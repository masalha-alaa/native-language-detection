I think New Kids Turbo covered this pretty well
If anyone wants to learn more about it here's a report on it that goes into it from the 90s:
Why do Germans do it though
Religious reasons
Austria
Imagine how great of a lake it would be
Latvia
No hard feelings, bro, but an even bigger coastline would be kinda nice
Rip cheap liquor tho
And if not the whole thing maybe just Kaliningrad
Baltics is harder to drive through (yes, I also include Estonia)
At least Poland has good roads for drive through and some toilets and gas stations next to roads
Compared to them we live like in desert
Just 100
With prices in Norway it feels like pocket money
Same in Estonia

This was exposted to /r/bestof which has a lot of subscribers and they flooded this thread
You can tell who came from that sub because don't have flairs
Yes, I do
I forget words like 'lunch' and 'airplane'.
I often find it easier to express myself in english than in my own native language
I got called out for it yesterday lol - was in an online race, translated an English sentence into Estonian very literally and it did not sound great at all
Not really
Estonians just have a kinda ugly sounding accent, it doesn't have any specific characteristics at all, just sounds like you just ate something really hot
I have thought about it and honestly I think the fact that Apple is domestic and other stuff foreign probably made a huge difference in the beginning in the US
Here it's the same buying and Android or an iPhone it's just another brand but in the US it's a bit more complex
Two reasons - smartphone era in US started almost immediately as first Iphone was released
In Europe it started a bit later, when Android was already available
Second - Europeans are more frugal than americans (this is broad generalization, I get it)
Even if you are from well off family, they are not going to buy a phone that costs 2-3x times more
Narva, also all of Ida-Virumaa
It's basically a cancerous tumor of Estonia
I live 15 minutes from Malmö, and I'm there semi regularly, and it's always absolutely fine
It's a nice costal city with loads of diversity
But media gotta media I guess
Edit
Just to add, I'm not saying nothing ever happens in Malmö, but it's absolutely not the battlefield media likes to portray it as
When people ask me about it I usually don't recommend they go there, mainly because I think it's boring compared to Gothenburg and Stockholm, but that's just me
The same rules apply as in any larger city, don't walk around sketchy neighborhoods with your wallet visible at night, and you'll be fine
Living here I definitely feel closer to the continent than to the rest of the country, if that makes sense
And as you said, passing by Malmö to buy things you couldn't find elsewhere
If you're driving into Sweden from Denmark, and many tourists seem to do, Malmö will be the first city you pass through, so it'll absolutely leave an impression
That sentence: "drove up to Helsingborg for dinner" is such an American thing to say
Because realistically, it's not that far away, but still, I've never known anyone who decides to just go a few towns over for dinner (unless you were going there anyway)
Even when my family and I visited California, and drove the Pacific Highway, we'd always look for something in the same town we could walk to
Europe is an office
What job does your country have there
Edit: Estonia would be the IT girl who has had many violent relationships with  Germany and Russia
Still obeys to all the rules set by Germany
And is obsessed with her brother Finland, with whom they go to sauna with every week
She also is a part time singer at a bar
Estonia - IT department programmer who drinks waaaaaay too much energy drinks and stays behind their computer all day
The IT guy, who nobody knows works here
Standing outside, thinking how cool would it be to work there
Or maybe at the help desk and gets praised for the excellent work they're doing while they just usually restart stuff to fix the problem
Whom nobody in the office knows and whose computer is 15 years old but somehow works okay
And how others should also get high speed internet in their homes
I had rather positive culture shocks whilst in NYC, but I guess it's rather different from the rest of the country
I had always thought the American politeness and interacting with strangers could be a little excessive, but it really wasn't, it was rather a pleasant surprise
Naturally I was surprised by how dirty the city could be, but I've had the same kind of feelings in Paris and Barcelona
> but also the Baltic states
Uh, no, from Estonia as well
You need a  license  to get one and only in a few specific cases you can carry it around
You can actually get arrested even for having a fake gun on you in a public place, let alone a real one
Also, the Baltic states is not a country, I hope you know that
We are just neighbours, just like Estonia and Sweden
Also [a map of firearms in Europe] actually it looks like it is **Sweden** that has the most firearms per capita (hunting, not carrying them on the streets)
You are somewhat right with the concealed carry, but you made it sound very wrong, so I actually had to check the law to see wtf are you going on about
Yes, on paper, it is somewhat easy to do it
Nevertheless, no-one does
Most people who have a permit to carry a gun at work, do not have the right to carry a gun off work, for example
And it does not count - as you made it sound - as having some sort of special right to carry a gun on the street for self defence - we don't have a law like that
What we have, is that you can get a weapon
One of the possible reasons in the list is self-defence
You can get a permit to carry a weapon
So technically, yes
But you made it sound like we actually have guns on the streets
§ 50
General procedure for carrying weapons and ammunition (1) Weapons and ammunition may be carried together with a corresponding permit
(2) Weapons and ammunition shall be carried covertly and in a manner which prevents their loss or entry into the possession of another person, as well as causing accidental damage
There must be no cartridge in the magazine of a portable firearm, except for a revolver
(3) It is prohibited to carry weapons and ammunition: 1) under the influence of alcohol, narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or psychotoxic substances; 2) at a meeting, demonstration, picketing, celebration and other public events, except for a person performing official or work duties at the specified public events
Chornobyl irradiated forests were burning on a large scale recently
Honestly I haven't seen any news about that in Postimees nor ERR recently, neither in Russian nor in Estonian
The only two times I heard about that were in Reddit, so I believe it is not a very big of a deal for local people
Idiots ididocracy is limitless
Do you think people like that have any common logic, they been brainwashed by their own racist ideologies
For males Juhan, Heldur, Hildegard, Hugo, Aadu
For females Maire, Salme, Hilda, Alma, Elvine
In Estonia we have Elvira or Helve for women and Helmut or Eldur for men
Konstantin or Pent (Estonia)
None except Heldur of them have old-timey sense for me
To get proper ancient the names must have meaning in estonian
Like Lembit, Koit, Kalju for men and Tuuli, Luule, Kaja for women
But the split between male and female names is not absolute
It was used commonly when we were occupied by Germans so yup
Not really imo, I haven't heard of anyone with that name
Hilde, yes, but that's generally a girl's name if used
It is female name
There are currently 57 women with that name and pretty much all of them are 85+
Those are old yes but ther are still used very frequently, meanwhile the ones i counted you wonrt see on younger peeps
Lol sa pole kuulnud sest kasutati, saksa ajal
Enam muidgi mitte
Well then the names would be Heino, Endel, Ülo, Aino, Linda, Laine
Noh, Sakslane ise küsis hämmingus, et kas Hildegard on mehe nimi Eestis
Enamasti kui see oli kasutusel oli see naise nimi
Kui palju 20 aastaseid Aadusid või Salmesid sa tead
Need sinna juurde veel
palju on neid nimesid mida ammu ei kasutata enam
There are lots of Aados, Aadus and others in all ages
Salme is for older peaople but was not wery common even back then
Compare with Aino that was really popular back then but really not in use anymore
I mean in Estonia we're still using shale oil to power our life bc it's cheaper than buying electricity/building any new powerplants that use different fuels (nuclear, coal, what have you)
Good, but we need more
It's not enough
We need whole world moving there
We need to use every possible mean to influence others to do that too
Idk how we the Estonians will get our electricity then
It's just that it costs less to keep doing what we do than build nuclear power plants I think
Or maybe our ppl will stop being pussies so we can finally build a nuclear reactor
>I'm sorry but I think the EU should sanction Estonia over this
You should be sorry because that's an incredibly stupid idea
Estonia's dependence on oil shale is a Soviet legacy
Estonia has no mountains like Scandinavia, nor wide rivers like Latvia, which is why we're in a much worse position when it comes to competitive hydroenergy, compared to our neighbours
These incredibly-polluting oil shale plants were built to power up entire Estonia and even parts of St
Petersburg
While it's not good for the environment, it has made Estonia extremely dependent on that source
Nevertheless, the plants have been upgraded with filters and Estonia's greenhouse gas emissions have already fallen by half compared to Soviet era
Nuclear power plants are not an easy option for Estonia, considering we're just too tiny
If we had a miscalculation in the style of Finland with their Olkiluoto 3, it could literally bankrupt the country
We have no history nor experience with nuclear power
There, however, are now talks about some modern small-scale reactors that would fit us as well, but it's only future technology
Estonia has potential with wind, though, due to its geographic location by the sea
Wind power generation has increased steadily, but has stalled recent years due to various legal disputes
It makes up roughly 7-8% of power production, but there's much more potential to that
However, wind energy production is dependent on changing weather, which means there *must* be some stable power production to complement it as well
Nevertheless, the largest of Estonia's Soviet-era oil shale plants are to be closed in the next years, due to EU CO^(2) quotas, and while this is positive for the gas emissions, it will eliminate a massive share of Estonia's electricity production, turning Estonia from an electricity exporter to importer, making hundreds of people unemployed etc
This will be have a massive negative socio-economic impact to the already poorest region of Estonia and will undermine the country's energy independence
Oh, and did you know that in the meanwhile, neighbouring Russia will keep polluting like there's no tomorrow, and we will probably just buy dirty electricity from there instead because we still need power, only the money will now go to a foreign country
And the nature has it no better at all
Absolutely brilliant, isn't it
I would mostly blame our stupid government on it, considering they should have seen it coming, but EU's "let's set an example for the rest of the world with how commited we are" while rest of the world is not following, is a real problem that can have real negative impacts on us
Everyone is scared of a tsunami in eu that's why we don't fully go on nuclear power
>don’t call me stupid
I called your "idea" stupid, not you
> stop blaming the Soviets
I didn't blame the Soviets, I blamed the natural conditions *and* historical circumstances
And the government
> You’ve had thirty years to figure this shit out and stop being the worst polluters in Europe
Firstly, the climate talk became more widespread only in 2000s, I don't think people were that aware of fossil fuels being phased out back then
Secondly, even if I'd agree that the government of Estonia should have started transition much earlier, would that justify just abruptly shutting down most of Estonia's electricity production, which will be replaced by just-as-dirty Russian imports
There's absolutely no win for Europe that way, the environment won't benefit but European economy will suffer (and our competitors will benefit)
I don't even understand why are you so hostile out of the blue
I'm ultimately pro-renewable, but having such emotional viewpoints a'la "shut down all polluters
" which would ultimately hurt Europe and might not even benefit the nature (as explained above) deserve criticism
Things that are common in Europe
> Helsinki is the second-most Northern capital in the world (after Reykjavik)
Helsinki has the world's northernmost metro
We can it freely do
Language beauty comes so beautifully out
We're so keen on boycotting that we lost 2-6
Going all-in with the boycott by finishing last in the group aswell
This is just diplomatic bickering and will cause more costs and time for ordinary travellers, who don't have anything to do with US politics
"It has never been like this and it is the same again" is my favourite phrase in Russian
I didn't know that it was he who said that
It's bizarre
Apart from slightly less people at the university, and on busses, would wouldn't know there was anything special going on
It really doesn't feel like it's really hit us as hard as it actually has
Well, the EU is supporting Rail Baltica to link Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with the European network (we don't even have any other 1435mm railways yet
) - so of course
As long as your citizens are smarter than ours and don't start stupid enviromental shit
never seen ads, but in general, the "there are kids starving in africa" is a very common thing to say if your child doesnt want to eat their food
for a while there was a print-out picture of a malnourished black child right above the food trash can at my school's canteen
the goal was to make us feel bad about throwing food away
im pretty sure there was some text too, but i cant remember what it was exactly
and that stayed up for a good few years for kids aged 6-18 and teachers and any visitors to see
kinda fucked up in my opinion
the fact that i dont want to eat their oversalted rice has nothing to do with malnourished kids somewhere in africa, and is highly unnecessary
i mean, what was their idea
i see the picture, turn around and go finish my food
even if it was super poor quality
and painting africa as the land where everyone is starving, is also pretty ignorant imo
When I was in Spain and on train from Madrid to Malaga, there was an ad on the tv about poor african kids who flee to Europe, get great education and become happy people, underlaying message of the ad was obviously - "look at those poor african kids, lets bring them over here and save them
". And that's just one example of many such instances I saw when travelling around Europe
So yeah, I can say that in western europe it's pretty common theme
"kindergarten", they just straight up stole a German word, didn't even try to anglicize it
I would like to add choir to the mix
In Russian we have послезавтра (poslezavtra) for overmorrow and позавчера (pozavchera) for the day before yesterday
And it is very widely used
No, at least half of it was taken from French
>our winters get milder and milder
Well
someone obviously didn't get snow in september
But to be serious, casting aside the couple of warm-ish(12degrees) and rainy days right now I'd actually say that this
autumn is a bit colder than others
E: also haven't noticed that trend, only that halloween is now a thing
15 is damn cold for me
So I pack as much clothes as I can
Though it's mainly because I am really skinny, so any cold wind - and I am frozen instantly
>, but they're shorter
Didn't notice that in Estonia
They last as usual from late November to late March-early April
Maybe there is a bit less snow in December, but overall winters haven't changed much
Summers did get warmer though, and I kinda enjoy it
For me optimal temperature is 25-30 degrees, so I was fine with that
We have a really weird anti-German sentiment
It's mainly only for political reasons; when one needs to be anti-EU, big projects will be condemned as "a return to 700 years of slavery under Germans".
But the same people who'll push this agenda will be the same people to fly Waffen-SS flags at rallies (the 20
Estonian SS-Panzergrenadier Division to be precise)
No anti-German sentiment here, we're to preoccupied with russians
There was
Up to 1940 Germans were public enemy nr
Until it was the soviets
1940 was clear hint I hope :D
Its from Italy
My whole childhood has been a lie
Americans are paying more for health insurance than any other European country
The problem is not that the healthcare isn't universal, the problem is that the healthcare is monopolized and de-regulated - because of that it is ridiculously expensive
Due to lobbying (or lets just say "bribing") by the Big Pharma, the government is not allowing competition in the health market, thus the prices have no reason to go down
Funny how USA calls itself a "capitalist" country when competition is not possible in some sectors
I am for Estonia
Some advantages -
* If you have lifetrheatening trauma or disease you will be treated fairly quickly and you won't spend thousands on just calling an ambulance
Same for childbirth (not sure about abortions though)
* Even non public clinics and healthcare is not as crazy expensive as in US (though that might be just linked to generally lower cost of life)
Disadvantages :
* The brunt of paying for healthcare lies on working class and their employers
13% tax that goes to healthcare is paid from every salary and you have no option to not pay it or move to some private healtchare
You might never use public healtchare, but you still pay for it
* If you have non-lifetrheatening disease, waiting periods for doctors can take up months
* Despite taxation, public healtchare fund is constantly running short of money
One of the reasons why waiting periods for doctors are so long
* Dental services are not covered by public healthcare (apart from 40 eur yearly deduction)
So if you need any operations on teeth - be prepared to pay all the hundreds and more euros out of your pocket
Over here, it is also very common to drink tap water, buying bottles is somewhat stupid
I have heard that in some areas of the capital people don't, but I am unsure if the quality is really different or those people are just weird snobs
The places I lived at the capital had no problem with tap water
It's safe to drink and there's nothing wrong with it, but some people buy water from the store because they say that it tastes better but there honestly isn't a difference
Yes, of course, it is very rare to not drink ta water
Only reason I would buy water is when I'm not home and don't have access to tap water
In some parts of Tallinn though, the water has slight smell of chlorine because the water is taken from a lake and needs to be purified, but it doesn't bother me
Everywhere else I've been, water is perfect in my opinion
I know in Tallinn the tap water tastes pretty chlorinated in some parts of town but honestly a filter jug takes out the taste and I don't understand how some people have the energy to buy and carry in water for no reason
In Estonia it depends where you are, in the south accesessing groundwater is pretty easy so tap water comes from the groundwater, but in the north there is limestone in between the surface and groundwater so you can't really get groundwater there, so they take water from the surface and clean it, so it isn't really good to drink
TLDR: depends where in the country you live
Brita is well not exactly common but most people know what it is and some people even use it frequently
Huge refrigerators that also do other stuff like dispense ice-cubes, water or similar are basically an american thing
Yes they are sold here as well and a few of the people who have built a new kitchen in the last \~10 years do have one, but most people find it unnecessary
The taste of water differes from district to district
In nõmme for example where it comes from deep ground water the taste is really good in my experience but in the city center where it comes from ülemiste it is a bit more chlorinated taste
I heard stuff like that when I visited in 2018 too but it was totally drinkable, not pleasant tasting but if it's 30 degrees outside you're gonna drink it
Sadly way too often
I work in an international environment, so I speak English on a daily basis
Also, most of the entertainment I consume is in English
As a result, I mix up languages all the time
It’s as if my brain is not switching between the languages fast enough
Correct and clean use of language is very important to me, so it’s always really embarrassing when I can’t remember specific words
Violating personal space
We might not say anything but you certainly won’t be making a friend
We’re massive introverts for a reason
Also don’t call us or any other baltic countries russian or imply anything similar, there’s a lot of bad history there and quite frankly it’s a bit offensive
Associating us with today's Russia or the old Soviet Russia
Bad memories
In Estonia, a big no no is being loud and annoying to random people in public
Estonia agrees with everything you said
I'd think over here we all know it's a country, but for some reason I always thought that the language has been gone for centuries by now
Then as I was browsing youtube language videos for some totally different reason, I found out it's alive and kicking, just never ever mentioned anywhere in the media
Actually, this is different
What I mean by this no talking, is no small talk
But greeting things are ok if you don't stop for a chat
We have a fixed saying "jõudu tööle
" that translates to something among the lines of "wish you strength/energy for the work you're doing
" and this is a totally normal thing to say as you are passing a person working that you know, even if you only know the face and have never spoken to
Or even if you don't know them at all, but it's like a public physical work at your workplace or home area, like cleaning or tinkering something
I grew up mainly at the countryside and therefore am used to using this a lot
People who have grown up in big cities might find this a bit odd or old fashioned to use it with people you don't know personally, but the workers have generally smiled and answered with the correct phrase "jõudu tarvis
" thats like "thanks, strength/energy is needed
Hmm, the medieval old town of Tallinn is really lovely and there are (or at least were before covid) some good restaurants in the capital as well, [this] crossed my mind but the locals will know better
That being said, Tallinn as a whole is one of my least favourite towns in Estonia
But that's a matter of taste, of course
It's just quite different from the rest of Estonia (and has way too many cars)
You can take a 2h [train] to Tartu
It is very small compared to Tallinn, even though it is our second biggest town
But there is not that much to do, especially with covid
It is lovely to walk around the old town, parks and riverside and also elsewhere if you're interested in architecture
You can [take a trip with an old boat on the river] there are also several cute little bars like [this] or [this]  I recommend going to a sauna, even the smaller places can have decent sauna complexes like [this] in Tartu and [this] in Tallinn
The tiny coastal towns are actually my favourites, but you can only reach them with a car or bus, so this might be too much hassle for a short stop
Where are you going in Russia
Do you plan to take a plane or cross the border on land/sea
Tallinn airport is lovely, as it is actually inside the city and connected to the old town by a city tram
The airport is also very small, so everything will be quick and easy
Unfortunately, can relate
It depends on the neighbours, but I cannot wrap my head around what are the factors
One thing is, that it is easier if you either don't know them at all or know them very well - anything in between is risky
Will they chat or not
What do they think
etc
Some pictures of it happening today
[First] & [second]
i'm biased and i dont even have a licence, but i think its a cool and clever idea
i hope people dont find ways to abuse it
Considering that the main highways I drive on here everyone goes at least 10 kph over the limit either I'll see a lot of cars on the side of the road or nothing will change :/
> fine amount was defined by how much a person was making a year
It's already like that here in Estonia
These changes to fine calculations were made pretty recently (if not even during this year)
The last car has almost an hour of pause time
damn, how much were they speeding
The police put this in place because according to their research speeders were less annoyed about the fine and more about the time it took to get the paperwork done (i.e 15 minutes in the cop car)
This won't help against regular customers (i.e cunts), but it's a great deterrant against people who "experimented" that day
If you go over 20km/h of the speedlimit, then you must wait 45min
If you go over 21-40km/h of the speedlimit, then you must wait 60min
Whenever estonian is spoken by a non-native in a film/series made by a non-estonian, they make us sound russian
We have a really beautiful language and they just think we're Russians
Can you link me some examples
I haven't heard any yet, and I really need a good laugh
How I met your mother ( barney is a street performer from Estonia) and in Brooklyn 99 there was some guy from a slavic nation and sang a song but it was in estonian xd, doesn't really count but its funny haha
Thanks mate
(Almost universal) Free healthcare
We go naked into sauna and usually there are both sexes together
unless going to sauna is already considered crazy abroad, then that
3 things:
First: i think we got something similar with the dubs but it isn't always a single dude (sometimes there's 2 of 'em)
Second: idk how common or uncommon it is in other countries but here especially in rural areas we like to make our own juice, kompot and other stuff
Third: we also go to the forest regurlarly to pick mushrooms (idk how common it is in other places)
leaving ur baby to sleep outside in the stroller
yes, even on the street in front of an apartment building
yes, even in cold weather and snow
God jul och gott nytt år! ️

Now get ready to answer questions about New Year's.
American series assume people in the Baltics are just Russian and give them a mega thick Russian accent or use some random words, turn them into a song and say  that the song is about how a dog loses its virginity (brooklyn99)
We are not slavs, very offensive
oh yes every time some tv show character is supposed to be from an obscure country and they pick estonia
also the song jake and mlep(clay)nos from brooklyn 99 sang, has estonian lyrics although mlepnos is from some random made up country lol
of course, his name sounds greek, the music style sounds idek like what but not estonian and the country's name sounds slavic
but the accent and grammar are so bad that i didnt catch it, a friend randomly pointed it out to me months after i saw that episode
i almost died laughing when i found out lol
Yes, but it wasn't due to how they were speaking
I knew this girl and the first time we spoke I could not understand what she was saying
Her voice sounded too light for me to make the connection between what sounds were coming out of her mouth and words I knew
After a few minutes I could already understand her, but right at the start I just couldn't.
The memory of not being able to understand her had stayed with me
> At least it wasn't "neuken in de keuken
" (Wanna fuck in the kitchen
Thank you
I shall remember this for the next time I meet a Dutch person
The miserably common one that we're not a part of Russia
Also have had to explain that we don't use horses as a way of transportation
Holy shit I had 2 college dormmates (one from France, other one from Barbados) who thought the exact same thing
They were convinced I was insane saying they're an actual animal and I had to show them a Wikipedia page for them to calm down
Igloos and now polar bears
I'm really curious where so many people get the misconception that Poland is somewhere in the Arctic
As long as 95% of people are vaccinated education is enough imo
Out of curiosity what is the policy regarding adults and booster shots
Thanks for the clarification
I don't remember the exact phrasing in Estonian, but I saw some movie subtitles where "I'll pop a cap in his ass" was translated as something like "I'll shove my hat up his ass".
During summer I usually have a small spray bottle on me at all times
Whenever it gets too hot I just spray water on my arms, legs and sometimes on my hair, if I feel like my head is getting too hot
Think of it as artificial sweating without the smell
It's also fun to spray your friends every once in a while
Got 3 h of sleep last night, it didn't drop below 20°C even at night and the cottage where I stayed in had a stable temp of 35°C and like 70% humidity
Also I couldn't open the window because then the mosquitoes would eat you alive
It was hell on earth
Narva, the old city and pretty much everything was destroyed by the soviets
So they rebuilt it
with commie blocks
I see no difference
To me it looks like a regular city
Võhma is worse tho
It’s literally city for a meat factory and soviet blocks, new houses are good tho
**§ 1
** Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic, where the people are the highest bearer of state power
Estonia's independence and sovereignty are timeless and inalienable
" **§ 1
Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein the supreme power of state is vested in the people
The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
However, the preambula can be taken as a sort of poetic first article and is considered a very important part, as it essentially states the reasons for the existence of Estonia
" With unwavering faith and a steadfast will to strengthen and develop the state which embodies the inextinguishable right of the people of Estonia to national self-determination and which was proclaimed on 24 February 1918, which is founded on liberty, justice and the rule of law, which is created to protect the peace and defend the people against aggression from the outside, and which forms a pledge to present and future generations for their social progress and welfare, which must guarantee the preservation of the Estonian people, the Estonian language and the Estonian culture through the ages, the people of Estonia, on the basis of § 1 of the Constitution which entered into force in 1938, and in the referendum held on 28 June 1992, have adopted the following Constitution
**Article 1:**
*Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein the supreme power of state is vested in the people
The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
But I really like the **preamble of the Estonian constitution**:
*With unwavering faith and a steadfast will to strengthen and develop the state which embodies the inextinguishable right of the people of Estonia to national self-determination and which was proclaimed on 24 February 1918, which is founded on liberty, justice and the rule of law, which is created to protect the peace and defend the people against aggression from the outside, and which forms a pledge to present and future generations for their social progress and welfare, which must guarantee the preservation of the Estonian people, the Estonian language and the Estonian culture through the ages, the people of Estonia, on the basis of § 1 of the Constitution which entered into force in 1938, and in the referendum held on 28 June 1992, have adopted the following Constitution
Official translation:
§ 1
Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein supreme political authority is vested in the people
The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
I mean, let's be honest, a very big part of it is showing middle finger to the USSR and not just symbolically
Because Russian language was not historically widely-spoken in the Baltics, and only became such due to mass immigration of Russians during Soviet occupation, it was just stripped of any status
The point being that Baltics refuse to become a Russian-speaking region just because a foreign occupying regime tried to turn them into one
Not very similar reasons, actually
Swedes in Finland have lived there for centuries and have played pivotal role in Finnish history
If anything, they're more similar to what Baltic Germans were for us
I don't think Baltics will ever make Russian a co-official language
It's something Estonians and Latvians broadly reject
At best, it might get some regional status, and even that would most likely exclude Tallinn and Riga
Identity is such a complex issue anyways, we can't even always find any reasonable justifications for it
But to put it simply, Swedish-speaking Finns were already there when Republic of Finland came to be
Vast majority of Russians in the Baltics, however, were not there when the countries came to be
Of course there are other issues at play as well, such as Finland's relationship with Sweden being almost intimate, so connections to Sweden are not a big controversy
Russia and the Baltics, meanwhile, I don't think needs much commenting
i was in finland, went on a tram and most of the people there were estonians

] Estonians, after a sauna, in a ice hole grilling (probably) *Jänku Jussi Viinerid*.
I could sense that Finland would win this one
Ida-Virumaa, the by-far poorest part of Estonia, where crime rates are astronomically high, where 75% of the population are Russian, where cities consist of nothing but semi-abandoned brutalist Soviet buildings and most of the (legal) economy is entirely dependent on oil shale
Probably the Russian occupied part
* Crime rate is not really that high, I think Tallinn is worse
The thing is that a significant part of the youth have left, so many who would have commited crimes are gone (most likely to Tallinn)
* Not all towns are the same – there are abandoned ghost towns, but some are also okay-ish, like Jõhvi, Sillamäe or Narva
But yeah, it's the most problematic part of the country
It's not even that much poorer than some other regions like rural South-East or lakeside Peipsi, but it's the integration problems that make all the problems worse
Really
The Azores are one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever visited
I’d actually love to spend my retirement there
Ida-Virumaa has by-far the highest crime rate by capita, and while it’s true that the total number of crimes in Harjumaa is higher, you have to account for the fact that Harjumaa’s population is more than 5 times greater
If we talk about more serious offenses like murders and killings: there were about 8 murders and killings per 100,000 residents in Ida-Virumaa compared to about 2
9 in Harjumaa
It becomes even more apparent if we take domestic violence; there were 57 offenses per 10,000 residents in Ida Virumaa compared to 26 in Harjumaa
[Source]
Furthermore, you can’t argue that a county where even the city hall of the biggest and most important town, located on the most central and touristy square, looks like [this] does not have a massive problem with urban decay
Ida-Virumaa has a problem with crime and a problem with urban decay, more so than rest of Estonia, of course
I'm mostly arguing that they're not *that* much worse than some other places in Estonia
E.g. I find Paldiski to be much uglier than towns like Narva or Sillamäe. Many towns by lake Peipsi look poorer than them
Even Tartu and Tallinn have some really poor-looking districts full of wooden shacks which are not far from city centre
Also, while Narva's failure to even restore the town hall in 20+ years is ridiculous, there are other similar stories elsewhere
E.g. Balti jaam is probably one of the ugliest and most impractical central stations in Europe
The whole mess would be better just bulldozed
Compare that to Tartu which has a classy and historical building (and it actually functions as a station
Even Narva has a proper station now
Of course there are problems elsewhere, but Ida-Virumaa is just a massive conglomerate of all those problems
"Laulupidu" aka a singing festival/party
Only the best choirs get ti sing there and almost everyone can sing along to the songs
Its also kind of a memorial for the Singing Revolution of Estonia
Trying to hit on women in the store or on the street like Americans have been recommending me
It is not de jure illegal but around here de facto it absolutely is
Here you can cycle on both sidewalks and roads, whatever fits you better
You just need to leave room for the cars (and they for you) and not endanger the pedestrians
Wait what people do that
Haha, I cut it like your brother-in-law as well
I guess I just don't much about such a seemingly petty thing
I used to go eat lunch at this now closed diner in central Tallinn and there was always one table of 2-4 guys, who were all in suits and drank 1-2 beers for lunch and stayed there for quite long
I never understood how their employers allowed it, but most people working nearby worked in banks
Yeah there's a time and a place for those things, they are called parties and pubs
Oh you better be nice or I'll use [this gadget] on your cheese
we have compound words that are correct even though they have more than 2 of the same vowel in a row
usually the rule is that a maximum of 2 of the same letter can be next to each other in a word
for clarity it's recommended to hyphenate words that dont follow this rule, but as far as i know, you dont have to and most people dont bc these words are fun
jäääär (edge of ice),
kuuuurija (moon researcher),
töööö (work night, but if you turn it around, öötöö would mean night work/job)
examples with many consonants in a row would be
kukkki (even the rooster),
sokkki (even the sock), etc
I have always found it interesting how in Finnish the word "no" is turned
* Ei
* En
* Et
I don't think any other language has that
Also - we have the letter "Õ" :) Very Estonian letter
i think estonian has a word for that too
'igatsus'
Uhh they are, closedt language to hungarian is mansi and mansi are finno ugric same as hungarians
true
the saaremaa people disagree though :P
you make a small change in intonation or a barely noticable break between the two parts that make up the word
for example "jäääär" consists of two words, "jää  and "äär" so you just say these two words very close to each other, sort of
or with "kukkki" , the word consists of "kukk" and the suffix "-ki". instead of saying each individual letter like "khkhkh", you just hold the silent part of the letter K for a bit longer
i think this kind of ties to the other fun and very specific part of the estonian language where we have 3 different lengths of pronunciation for letters ("välde" in estonian)
this is a more complicated topic i am not too good at explaining in either estonian or english, but basically in the words "vili", "viilid" and "viilima", the first i-sound is a different length in all of them
i hope i managed to explain it well enough for you to understand
i am not too sure about my explanation skills or technical knowledge of pronunciation, but i tried my best :)
Honestly, whatever, as long as we don't end up more than 1 hour ahead of Central Europe and in a different time zone from Finland and Latvia/Lithuania
Winter time benefits for like two months out of the year absolutely do not cover for all the drawbacks throughout those five months
Natural time doesn't make the sun rise at 3am
Just before the switch it was daylight out before 6am, that's just ridiculous at the end of winter
With winter time the sun sets before 4pm in the winter, that's way too early
I want to kill myself every year when all of a sudden it gets dark an hour earlier and I won't see the sun coming home from work for four months because of it
What, you think those people on their way to work and children walking home from school are invincible to dangers
Winter time is abnormal time
It's shit no matter what time of year it is
You're southerners first of all and summer time is so much better
I want to die when the sun is setting while I'm having lunch
> We need light when we are going to work, if not there will be more car accidents
Mate, you can use the exact same argument but in reverse for summer time
Your natural time is waking up 5
30am in March
And suicide rates go up in the autumn when suddenly it gets dark super early
But sun setting at 15:28 sounds great do you does it
Winter time is literally the natural time, I don't know what you are talking about
> Protests erupted, led by angry students, who blamed the accident on the fact that it is now darker in the mornings than it was before
That's super silly, with the switch to winter time more accidents happen in the evenings as there's more traffic and it's darker than it was before the switch too
However waking up at 6am at the end of February because the sun is in your eyes and panicking that you're way too late to work is just nuts
The switch is just as stupid here
In December it gets dark before 4pm
On the other hand in the beginning of March you get sun in your eyes at like 5
30am
Winter time is awful
Exactly and towards the end of february and in march the sun rises very early so that daylight is just wasted while it still gets dark early
Natural light is also very important on your way home from work, something that winter time completely takes away
In high school I had to go home from school in the darkness for months
Which was much like going in the dark except of course there was more traffic
There's nothing natural about winter time, especially for everybody who isn't a morning person
And I do mind it starting to get dark when I'm having lunch
It's dark in the morning anyway
I don't think you understand how the world works
They tyranny of morning people
Yeah I understand, doesn't make it any less bullshit
>Why are you born in a northern country then
Never mind, these kind of people will not get it
It has literally nothing to do with people
It has plenty to do with it
12:00 should technically be midday right, because that's when the sun is highest in the sky hence the system
However 12:00 isn't actually the middle of the day for the majority of people, it isn't even the middle of the work day
That's why you don't understand how the world works
We had a singing revolution to free ourselves from the Soviets, no blood, no bullets, just patriotic song and our fellow people
Also, we united with the rest of the baltics to form a human chain of several hundreds of kilometres
Glad you guys joined us there =D
Yea I learnt about that, brutal stuff but I hear he was an ass( and that's putting it lightly)
Yea its amazing, to stand there knowing that the red army could be sent to stop you, kill you if they must, absolutely terrifying to think about
Oh yea, we were super lucky, they already had guns poi Ted at us, tanks sent to retake Tallinn but Moscow changed their mind, there was too much political pressure in Moscow, so they left us alone
Its unbelievable how lucky we were
Press conference that messed up with one date, and that brought down the berlin war, not Reagan, not hasslehoff, a mistake is what did it
The collapse of Yugoslavia
The one where there were brutal killings
Yea we touched on him briefly, didn't know or remember he did all of that, just remember that he had to do something to piss off the people so much for 5 soldiers to empty clips into him
He saved many lives
Maybe the restaurants in the town hall square, they're just very expensive
Walk off it and you'll find plenty of good restaurants where a beer wont cost 6€+
I might be in the minority but getting mcdonald's on your trip isn't that bad imo, it's quite nice and conveniant
Espercially when you're in the central tourist area, fast food is fast, cheap and you know what you're getting so you can have a quick lunch and continue sightseeing
Don't have to stress around trying to find a Cafe where you wont get robbed
The comments under the trailer are pretty good
"This is worse than the famine
We would just like our historic lands back from Russia, thats all
It's definitely the nr
1 news in Estonia right now
I wish all good luck as it won't be a peaceful fight, I just hope there won't be any physical involvement from the east
Yea it has been said for a long time that change in the east only comes through revolutions
It's just how it sadly is
Lukashenka has his back against his wall, losing the election means imprisonment or exile in Russia
He isn't just fighting to keep power, he's fighting to keep his way of life, no way he'll back down
Living from election to election
I've heard American news reporters say something like "day 1182 of the X administration, 202 days until the elections" from the political left and the right, like it's some sorta punishment
SALES TAX
...and healthcare
Honestly with all the shit the US government (and various federal bureaus) has done, it's reasonable to at least not trust it much
> inches, feet, yards, acres and miles
Yeah, and there are 12 inches in feet, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile (and 1760 can't be divided neither by 12 or 3)
It's all confusing to say the least
Decameters are rarely used because it's just easier to say things like "15 meters" instead of "1 decameter and 5 meters". Centiliters are actually often used for volume of liquids
Megagrams are "used" but we just name then tonnes (since 1 megagram is literally 1 tonne, and 1 tonne is also a metric unit)
Another funny mistake Germans occasionaly do is calling a mobile phone a "handy" also in English
They just assume that's what it means in English
And some Spaniards believe that "footing" means jogging in English
Edit: Clarification that "handy" is a normal word for a mobile in German
Same place as I do now, because I couldn't afford to move
Denmark
Learning the language already
Estonia prolly
I heard it's a pretty cool place
Tbh, I think everyone should take a test every 10 years to renew their license
Driving a car is not a human right, it's a pretty big responisbility
And all drivers should prove from time to time that they haven't lost their skills, especially since driving conditions can change drastically
It doesn't make sense to do a driving test once and it's valid for your whole life
Sounds about like over here, though I'll take out my warm winter jacket maybe a few degrees earlier, just wear extra lighter clothing under it
That might be because it's windy and snowing-raining-snowing-raining-snowing here often and my winter jacket is super windproof and waterproof
>Worst weather there is is 0 to 4c, wind and whatever sludd is called in english
Amen
It depends on the area
As we have a lot of coast and islands, these areas have a milder climate and temperatures rarely go below -10
As you go away from the coast, it gets \~5 degrees colder
But temperatures below -20C are usually considered somewhat newsworthy
Looking at the climate charts, Stockholm is a bit warmer: our averages are 3-5 degrees lower in the winter and just 1-2 degrees lower in the summer
Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité
Honestly I personally just take vitamine D and dream of the summer to come and of the summer that I left behind
And drink I guess, but that varies
Honestly I think it's unhealthy how much I have riding on this summer, it's always better in my head than in reality but it's true that those few good summer days give me the hope to survive winter
I might be in the extreme but this year waiting for the summer has become almost a religious thing for me
As long as I can go to the beach I honestly don't care how the corona goes
30% men smoke, 20% of women smoke
People start smoking when they're like 15, as was the case for me and my uncle for example
My father also smokes
Snus and nicotine pouches are also popular, about 6% men either do snus everyday or a few times a week
Associating us with Russia and the Soviet "Union". Pro tip: don't.
pilsner is czech though
op is from slovenia
Estonia isn't Scandinavian but should be Nordic
Same happened here
Yea but you cant travel
I meant that a huge downside that is often overlooked with lower income countries is that they cant travel
Like rent and prices might be okay and in balance but no way you're going to afford a 80€ hotel room when you're making 400€ vs when you're making 1900€.
Estonia recently had a Minister of Foreign Trade, who didn't speak English
But this former [Minister of Finance] showed some class
Btw, the guy was actually Olympic silver and bronze medalist in sailing
I'm sorry but I think we didn't have any as if we weren't under anyone's control we were trying to survive in the hostile environment that is eastern Europe
Eh ya know good ol Estonia
We make pea soup  eat pig and use the bone to create a toy with string in it
Then we sled down the mountain and the one that sleds the furthest has the best harvest during the year
An Estonian who
hates sauna
After all, we're not that different from Finns and warm sauna is the best thing against winter depression
We just have
Päike=Sun
Kuu=Moon
They do not have any genders
Historically the period under the Swedish Empire is literally still called "the good Swedish time" here centuries later
The real golden age is now though, Estonia and Estonians have never been in a better situation by a huuuuge margin
Some people think Estonian "golden age" was during first 20 years of independence from 1920 to 1939
But imo it's mostly national pride for fighting for an winning independence during war in 1918-1920
Realistically golden age as in "best time to live in our country in all of our history" is right now
We're in nato, eu, eurozone and schengen, we finally stopped decline in population, we have historically highest wages ever and it's growing (and outgrowing inflation) each year
Not in my city but in Tallinn, some citizens wishing to protest the city government's handling of garbage collection left trashbags in front of the city hall
The city officials called the police to report a "suspicious object" and the bomb squad was sent in
After being thoroughly "disarmed", the bags were determined to, in fact, contain trash
Outside of Tallinn tbh
I see Finns go to Pärnu tho for cheap Spa's and stuff
Working in Eastern Europe: Russian
Working in Western Europe: French or German
Well definetly German, but Russian is most helpful in Eastern European countries
Well in eastern europe and the baltics it is russian
And i dont know more
wait the drying rack isnt a thing everywhere (not even in europe
glögi in estonian too
Absolutely impossible
Grammar-wise it may be possible but I’ve never encountered anyone who hasn’t lived their whole life in an Estonian-speaking environment making no grammar mistakes
Pronunciation-wise I’m certain that it is impossible, if you’re not at least a Finn — and even they have a slight accent when speaking Estonian
Nope
extremely hard
I havent heard a single non-native people who has mastered it
Even if they do manage to learn the grammar, u can still hear that something is off with their pronounciation
Couldn't care less
I work pretty much all week anyway
But I am just your typical workaholic, so I am not a good representative of an average worker
If majority of voters reject this kind of proposals, there is a reason for that
Instead of thinking "duh, those voters are stupid", maybe ask them why they vote like that
The solution for that is to work in 2 shifts, not close shops earlier
I definitely wouldn't say that where I live all service industries suddenly become empty after 8pm
Pretty much everything works as long as possible because customers keep coming
Nothing is stopping you from negotiating shorter work weeks with employer
I know people who asked for half and even quarter-time workweek (obviously with reduction in pay)
>doing nothing productive
Not every job has a lot of unproductive hours though
In my opinion most people are too attached to rigid 9-5 workweek and don't even think about other options
I think the whole proposal of 4-day work week is aimed at those people
But for me it means nothing
I work as comp
graphic artist and work both in office and freelance, and though in contract I have 40h workweek, in reality I work more flexible (some days few hrs more, some days less), it all depends on amount of work
Well, Finland
Rumor has it they've helped Estonia in ways many Estonians will never fully know about
From Kekkonen supposedly convincing Soviet Union to preserve the Tallinn Old Town, to collaborating under the disguise of folklore cultural organisations, to donating police gear in use in the initial years after the restoration of independence (the whole police
structure was rebuilt from scratch basically), etc
Even up to late 90s I remember people talking about stuff donated from Finland like clothes, machinery, and such
And thank you for having good prices on alcohol
50 years of sacrifices
Too bad nobody helped us to get rid of the commies
They destroyed Narva's old town during WW2
Then they demolished everything that survived the bombing and built commieblocks instead
Tallinn would've had the same fate
In Estonia we actually laugh that Finnish sounds like drunk Estonian, so who knows who's actually the drunk one :)
"kompastuskivet" = komistuskivid (in Estonian :))
It will in the future since most countries are becoming more liberal and globalized
I dont feel any common identity with other european countries especially western ones, we have nothing in common
>Drop a Scot in New Zealand and another in Moldova and ask them a week in which one encountered the most cultural similarities
To be fair, less than a century ago both were a part of the same empire
And to this day both have the same monarch
So I don't think it's a fair comparison
We had a more cultural high school grad trip to Greece but hearing the storys from classes that went to Bulgaria make me a bit jealous
Latvia when sober
Russia when drunk
I think the Baltic's in general are sort of in a 'rivalry'. Kinda but not really
You guys really want that island, don't you
What about Hungary
So wholesome
We'll keep it
We got it fair and square with vodka

* Tuba/Tupa (E: room/F: main/living room)
* Ruum/Ruuma (E: room, space/F: cargo hold)
same in Estonian
imagine having grammatical genders lmao
Estonia is great but I've thought of moving to Finland because it's close and culturaly similar
I've also thought of moving to Ireland
Excellent location for cultural exchange
Over the centuries we've had visits from Denmark, the Germans, Denmark again, Russia, Sweden, Poland-Lithuania, Russia again, Germany again, Russia again: vol 3
But atleast it's pretty
But we actually don't have that much variety, no mountains, no really grand landscapes only bogs and forests which are pretty but you can also find them in nordic countries
The more I think about it the more negative sides I can think of, but that's the true estonian way
So what you're saying is
Estonia Nordic confirmed
Well, "sital käima" in direct translation means "to walk on shit"
"Käima" here means more like "to go" as in to "to go to a shit" or "to go for a shit", but yeah "to walk on shit" sounds funnier
My friend bought a 01 when he was 13, we had some great times whipping it around the forest as kids
Definitely wont let my kids do something so stupid lol
It was the biggest pos but still worked
Had the best faults like the driver seat sliding off the rails when accelerating and not really needing to use the pedals as the clutch and brakes were toast anyway and you could use the hand throttle for accelerating
Very much so (another Estonian here lol)

I've been thinking about buying one just for novelty
>they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for them when we left at 7
Who goes clubbing just till 2am
Where I live most clubs don't even open till midnight, would be pointless to be there just for couple hours
Any parties before midgnight are considered for kids
Apart from Italian cities, I never had such problems in any big European city
TIL Light beer is something entirely else than what I thought it was
In Estonia we have *hele õlu*, literally "light beer" which just refers to the colour and taste, alcoholic and calorie content is entirely normal
From a quick search it seems *pale lager* is the closest term to it in English
> dinner at 22:00
At this time I usually prepare to go to bed, unless it's weekends
At what time you go to sleep and how are you not completely tired next day when you go to work at morning
Here in Estonia clubs are open till 4-5 in the morning
Isn't it the same in Finland
It's more like around 23
00-23
30 to go to bed, and I am definitely not having full dinner just an hour before going to bed
And I am talking about work days(gotta have that full 8h sleep before work), on weekends of course time schedule is different
I felt like that when I was younger
Estonia seemed so boring, like there’s nothing to do, people seemed depressing and not friendly
No bright blue ocean or tropical palm trees
Time went by, I was lucky to have the opportunity to travel quite a bit and see the world
The more I experienced the places I thought I would be a much better fit in, the more I realised how wrong I was
Now I appreciate Estonia as my home more than ever
I like that people are reserved and they don’t put up a fake smile or engage in random small talks, and that they respect your personal space
I like that we have four seasons, incredibly beautiful coastline, forests and lakes
I like how everything is closeby or how innovative we are implementing new technology
And even though we have plenty of idiots ourselves, I feel like the overall level of education of people is better than in many other places I have been to
I enjoy our traditions and food
And for the love of everything good and holy, I cannot live without our black bread
Tl;dr : I don't feel like I'm an estonian, yet I don't feel european enough to live anywhere else
I want to leave estonia but I fear that means severing my only connection to my heritage
I'm not a fan of the people I belong to but its the only people I have
Estonians tend to be a bit cold towards strangers and our history is 90% about suffering as slaves/peasants and the other 10% is us recovering from the soviet Union and e-nation
I always hated how it doesn't feel europe enough here, we are too young of a people to have a lot of history, like the greeks, italians or French
I want to feel European but I dont feel it here
We praise the European Union but not being european
I dont like how the only activities outside of home are drinking, partying and more drinking
People here are either Tallinn supremacists or hillbilly dumb asses who vote in a hate filled Conservative faction, yet I don't feel like I could fit anywhere else
I’m Estonian Estonian
It's pretty much the only way people are able to socialize
I can't imagine any party without an alcohol
Going to a night club without consuming copious amounts of alcohol is pretty much impossible
Pubs and bars are also quite popular
Unfortunately consuming alcohol is one of the few ways that make people open up here
Otherwise they are extremely cold and reserved
>Moderate social only drinking only exists in non-UK Europe
It does exist, but it's a thing on more formal gatherings
Partying on friday night
People go wasted all the time
Thankfully we don't. We're the most atheist country in the world
I haven’t seen any billboards like that in Estonia
Haven’t noticed them in other European countries I’ve traveled to either
Depends from country then
Estonia with it's 14% religious people is much less religious than the USA with its 66%.
Yeah, same vice-versa
Can understand Finnish sometimes in writing, but not without issues
Same, some Hungarian words seem similar but impossible to understand

Interesting where the divide between "only football" and "literally all the time" comes from
I'd have expected it to be a West-East division, but a Norwegian said it's normal to fly it, while a Pole said it's not that common
Not at all
For people who have their own house, owning a flag is probably more common than not (judging by the # of flags I see raised on flag days)
For people who live in apartments having a full-size flag is more rare, as they're not as likely to have anywhere to store or display it
In Estonia the use of our flag is pretty excessive, which probably due to the fact that the display of the Estonian flag was strictly prohibited during Soviet time
You’ll see Estonian flags on many porches all around the year, in front of *all* houses on official holidays and of course in clothing and as various kinds of decoration, such as Christmas trees, mugs, pennants and many more
In Estonia everybody has the national flag
(Might be because when we were being occupied by the russians we had to secretly keep our nationality alive somehow) But everybody buts a flag out on our independence day and whenever there’s some kind of war related memorial date
I think it’s more of a north-south divide than a east-west one
If I remember correctly - you actually HAVE to have a flag waving outside on some days
So if you have a private house it's your own flag and when you live in an apartment it's the obligation of the housing association
24th of Feb (Independence Day)
23rd and 24th of June (Victory day/St John's Eve and St John's Day)
20th of August (Re-independence Day)
There's also many other days that are the so-called "flag days", but these are the only mandatory ones I believe
In Estonia it's more that the neighbours will just look weirdly, but I've never heard of police actually fining people for this
And if you uncapitalise it and switch the w with a v, it becomes Estonian
[I think the photograph of our first independence parade in 1919]
Old and famous
[Eesti taat ja eit söögilaua ääres]
I thought the picture of the baltic way was the most famous one
I thought the most famous one for the brits was where Churchill does the peace sign
Well at least if you get a job it actually pays money not peanuts
I recommend degrees that will allow remote work
It's the only way to live: getting salary of the capital, while being able to live in a normal place (not so expensive, not full of cars etc)
>actively work with FAX machines
Frankly, I'm not sure if I have ever seen one used
I'm 30 btw
I suppose you haven't met me
Btw since I've noticed Slovakia often gives Estonia a lot of points at Eurovision, more than Finland does often enough so I consider Slovaks our brothers from very different mothers
In general there's a lot more similarities between us than there are between Estonians and Hungarians that's for damn sure
Any small town will do (like 10 000-20 000 people small)
Dunno, feels more like a matter of taste
Over here it is usually done via a digitally signed and if needed then encrypted file
You do need 2-5 klicks and and a pin to sign it and a further three klicks to send an e-mail with the file, but I'd say that about equals grabbing a pen, signing it manually and taking it to a fax machine
Indeed, ignorance is bliss

You "serve" society by working(thus providing services), paying taxes and not breaking laws
Why should the forced labor be added on top of that
> There's absolutely non of that in the whole system
Can you opt out of both types of services with zero legal repercussions
If no, then it's forced labor
>  so what's wrong with making it mandatory
Infringement on my personal liberties as an adult, perhaps
I don't understand how it's acceptable in liberal democracies
Governments should incentivize working in necessary fields just by creating jobs and paying wages, so people can chose to work there on their own
> none of these things are things that can be done professionally
If that was true then countries without mandatory civil/military service would be literally falling apart
So far it is not happening
I don't understand how in your mind rescuer or firefighter can't be a professional worker
They literally need special training to deal with necessary equipment (in my country there is a whole Academy dedicated to give such education and train people for professional service)
In February 1991, there was a prank on the TV about the 100 Finnish markka bills being taken out of use
As Estonia didn't have its own currency at the time and the Soviet rouble had crashed, many relied on the Finnish markka for their savings and many rushed to exchange their bills
This was amplified by the memory of Soviet 50 and 100 rouble bills having been suddenly phased out in 1961
There's even an [Estonian Wiki article] about it
It is a bit weird yeah, I used to work at a hotel which during WWII was used by Nazis as a command post of sorts or sth like that
Estonian language and culture
As a Russian who is still going to a Russian school here, I have to learn Estonian
In the primary school pretty much every kid hated Estonian language and Estonian songs and traditions that we had to learn, but now I appreciate that I know such a unique language
Danish does sound like shit tbh
I don't know that many European fast food restaurants, but you Finns really got something right with Hesburger
This is a lot better than McDonalds
I once tried Hesburger and almost puked, don't recommend lol
We have KFC here at Estonia
Maybe you were pregnant
I was poisoned there once so I don't go there at all
Some people have been poisoned in McDonalds though
And everything I tried in Hesburger was inferior to McDonalds in my opinion anyway
We have KFC here at Estonia
Not really, I've added a link to this message that has the KFC locations in Tallinn
(There's 2)
Here in Estonia it's still e-post (e-mail) or simply "meil" (basically same as English "mail")
Plenty of businesses have their own email adresses
And for communications inside companies employess also mostly use e-mails provided by the company
And I also still have my hotmail account as secondary private e-mail
I was 20 and applied to jobs with my "juxxx666@hotmail
com" account
That was my actual account
Very professional
Yep
For example in Estonian we say "meil" when referring to an e-mail
The word "e-kiri" (*e-letter*) exists but isn't really used (at least not in speech)
Latvia
Finland
Russia
Sweden
Lithuania
Latvia is first not because we specifically learn about Latvia, but much of our history also applies to Latvia
The same is true for Finland and Lithuania to a lesser degree, while with Russia and Sweden, we'd learn more about their countries themselves
Hmm first that come into my mind are:
Germany
Denmark
Sweden
Latvia
Russia/Soviet Union
Germany, Russia, Sweden, Denmark and maybe Lithuania
Germany played a large role
Did you forget that Latvia exists or what
I think it's more that Germans played a large role and not particularly Germany itself
I mean, WW2 knowledge about Germany is pretty universal for everyone in Europe, not just for our own national historiography
I think the connection with Denmark is very strongly concentrated into the 13th-16th century and we barely talk about Denmark outside the context of the Danish territories in Estonia
Yeah the Teutonic order or better known here as Livonian Order and the Hanseatic League time periods are very fascinatic to study
How our capital (called Reval back then) was quite an important city for our location for trade between the west and east (ofcourse this location was also a curse why we were conquered so many times)
And yeah most native Estonians were peasants, but still it was interesting time period and a lot of our old town was built turing that time period, if i don't remember anything wrong
I know
The Teutonic State however fought Lithuania a lot when it stretched all the way to the Black sea
I'm talking about the German Teutonic Order
That doesn't make any sense
By that logic we should exclude all countries we were once one state with
Yep, although I think this question entails modern countries
Also our knowledge of the Teutonic Order is rather limited to its Livonian branch
Look at the other comments, a lot of them mention countries that do not exist today
Ah, ok
In those 51 years humanity has created several satellite global positioning systems with precision down to couple meters
In terms of actually being practical for the whole humanity, it's much more grand than sending couple of guys to the moon and  bringing some rocks back
Uhhhhhhh well Finland is basiclly the helpful step bro (please no im stuck jokes please i beg you) Latvia and Lithuania are like normal brothers
I'd say we are an adopted child of the baltic family
And Finland is the step bro who isn't in the family
Finland, genetically linguistically and culturally
For us, it's always been Finland
I would fight for Finland if another country ever attacked it
aww stop it you
Ahh i see you truly are a man of culture aswell
Edit: Writing this only because you appeared to be following me around Reddit
You'd be better off finding some other topic to focus on
This has nothing to do with Latvia, so I don't understand why you're so invested in what estonians think on this topic
Latvia will always be the country that we consider as a friendly neighbour in the south
That's where most of us also draw the line
We are not "brothers" with Latvia
We are not family
We are friendly neighbours who also share some common interests (defense topics mostly) and have had similar challenges in the past
If you keep insulting estonians for how they feel (like many latvians seem to do in reddit), or trying to manipulate opinions like some of your posts, then it will result in the opposite reaction to what you're looking for
I wish you well
There are many healthier topics / areas to focus your energy on
Poll:
oh you you’re making me blush
Kinda true
Thats what other Baltics fail to understand
i think its perfect the way it is
i wouldnt change a thing
I wouldn't except maybe add a finno ugric symbol or something like that
I’d like to make better ties to our brothers up north and change it to a Nordic cross version
i like the current one better
its simple, memorable, striking and looks great in any size
At the childhood home never
But if your parents were to own another property or apartment, they could charge you a small fee, like 1/3 of the rent price
My parents bought an apartement as an investment in my university city where I live and they take the rent that my roommate pays
I have even brought out the topic that maybe I should also pay something but will immediatley get shut down
Maybe later when I start earning more than the minimum wage Ill try to pay, at my age it seems fair
Not really national but some regions have their contenders
For example Žorik, in Tallinn
A stray dog who recently got it's own statue
He has been taken into a home to live peacefully but he tries to escape which is has resulted in a rather big "dog-hunt" as everyone is concerned about him
It seems like it is easy for us aswell
Britan
They helped us during our independence war
UK cuz they helped us in our independence war
We have Iceland Square(our foreign ministry is there on purpose)We had an event called Day of Iceland back in 2011 in honour of 20th anniversary of Iceland recognizing our independence
I grew up with Moomin books and anime
House at night but not the day, apartment always closed
Žonn meid his vei tu ä tävern truu te dark forest, ounli tu faind aut tät hi forgott te mani
Please note that Estonian neiter has a j-sound as in ‘John’ nor a sh-sound as in ‘she’, therefore I used the foreign letter ‘ž’.
As in phonetic spelling
"Džon meid his vei tu ei tävern fruu ze dark forest, õunli tu faind aut zät hi forgot ze mani
Estonian:
Dšon meid his uei tu ei taven thru thö daak forst ounly tu faind äut thät hi fogot thö mani
Džon meid his vey tu a tavern fruu de dark forest, onli tu faind out tät hi forgot de mani
in estonian : "Džon meid his uei tu ei tävörn fru de dark forest, õunli tu faind aut tät hi forgot de mani
i think
Currently, there’s a lot of fuss about the legalisation of gay marriages
It’s a very polarising topic, but I hope to see some progress in the near future
We are also facing a never ending embarrasement caused by our Interior Minister
He is known for misogynistic and homophobic statements, which have been utterly harmful for Estonia’s reputation
He is a populist and a demagogue who represents a loud conservative minority
Our prime minister has to constantly apologise for him, but that’s as far as it goes when holding him accountable for his actions
They both should have resigned a long time ago
Finland, if you see this, then I am really sorry for his misogynistic comments about your prime minister
He does not represent the views of the majority of Estonians
I personally admire Sanna Marin and I think she is a fantastic leader
Mart Helme, interior minister, said that gays can go to sweden
Some people are very angry at this, also the greens got a petition through to the parlament, the petition is for legalization of same sex marriage
definitely Tartu, it is the only uni in the baltics that is in the 500 best unis
all are free, but University of Tartu  is generally regarded as the best, probably because it is also the oldest and thus most reputable
I am somewhat unintrigued by the landlocked Central-European countries: Czech Republic,  Slovak Republic, Austria
I know they have pretty castles, but I can watch pictures of them and don't have to travel there
Yes, there are mountains, but mountains without the sea is like having a soup without a dessert - it fills the purpose, but the enjoyment is not there
Mainly, none of the three interests me with their language of culture
Serbia might also somewhat fall into the list, though maybe I just know too little about it
Personally I am also just not clicking with Spain
Too extroverted for me, I guess
At the same time, I loved Portugal
And Moldova I simply forgot for a minute, but as I find Romania somewhat cool, then Moldova can pull that shine on itself, too
The description of Slovakia was somewhat what I was thinking in my mind - what would be a "slovak" thing
But I must say, that being not crowded with tourist is also a big upside
So you kind of have all the listed things minus the mess and higher prices of tourist hotspots
I am not a fan of the language either
But I'd think that they have more than Paris - Normandy and Brittany, the wineyards, Bordeaux, Marseille, maybe some Arabic influence in places etc
Took a train all the way to Vladivastok
Was a nice ride
There are buddhists in Ulan Ude
There is Lake Baikal
There are muslims in Kazan
There is Kamchatka that is basically Iceland on steroids
There are so many tiny finno-ugric nations
There is The Empty North
There is cheap food and great hospitality, also fabulos arts and plenty of history
I mean, on that lattitude, you cannot expect beach resorts
>Maltese language
Yes
I like denmark it's like a more laid back scandinavia, people arent so uptight
Hungary was way more interesting to me
I love the language, I really liked the small villages, felt kinda
dunno
Asian in an interesting way
The wines
The warmth
The thermal waters
Just has this really nice vibe for me
No, I am not a Slavo-phobe (as I said, neither do I think much about "Austrian German", I prefer German German)
There are just many Slavic languages and there are others that have caught my eye more: Russian as I always like learning new alphabets, Bulgarian cause it has a nice softer sound to it than other Slavics, Slovenian cause is has some really old features (uses "dual", has odd pronouns) and interesting influences and even Ukrainian as I happen to have a few friends who have relatives in Ukraine and listening to them has been really fun
The West-Slavic languages have not attracted me that much, I think they simply have too few vowels for my personal taste, as pointed out by this webcomic:
Yeah, it is definitely subjective
As it is with most "beauty" I think
The connections there are in ones mind, the memories, the habits - they all play a great role in this
Yeah, I do believe I can find something interesting in every country
Maybe some lakeside villages or even Bregenz, maybe Graz for the history and a quick google also added Seewinkel National Park for some birdwatching
Good videos
The carst based river system is really cool, luckily both Croatia and Slovenia are in my to-visit list anyway
You also have Milk Bars, this is cool
I had no feelings for Warsaw, but Krakow seemed lovely and I do want to make it to your seaside towns as well
I personally don't like Tallinn much, the old town is pretty, but otherwise it is rather generic and full of cars - but that might be more from the experience of living there for a year than from a tourist perspective
I personally like the [bogs] more interesting [coastal] locations and small seaside towns like [Kuressaare] [Haapsalu] and maybe [Pärnu] The small Uni town of [Tartu] might also be worth a visit
What are the relations between Slovakia and Hungary like nowadays
Or Slovakia and Ukraine
We don't hear too much about you guys here, so would love to have an opinion from you
Yeah, not like southwest-Asia, but maybe some imaginary-Mongolia type of Asia
I think it's partially due to some aspects of architecture that are not so common in the north (though ofc not limited to Hungary in southern parts of Europe) and partially due to the vastness of the landscapes (plains, wine yards, etc)
Can't really explain it, might just be in my head
Btw did you know that pretty much all Estonian kids read read "A Pál-utcai Fiúk" at school
I think you guys could have quite a laugh indeed, if asking an Estonian/Finn to pronounce Czech words
For Slovenian, have a peak in there: [
It is a part of compulsory literature at most schools - and usually also popular among kids
We usually have half of the literature from Estonian literature and the other half from foreign literature every year
From the classics, Orwell (british), Dostojevski (russian), Hugo (french), Lindgren (swedish) and Lee (USA) are usually included to name a few
The languages are related distantly enough, to not understand more than single words, but have a look at that for example:
Actually quite difficult to say
We're a small country so it's difficult to hide big cases and they tend to come out
However our corruption probably has a different form, it's more of a nepotism, however still there have been bribing scandals
No daily corruption though, can't buy off the police and so on
Very
Alteast so I've heard from the Estonian mafia
[Arvo Pärt - "Aliinale" (1976)]
A really gentle piano piece from an Estonian composer, that I often listen to at night, when alone and painting/reading/writing/yoga/etc
It is like barely there, really grows on you
Anyone who has ever been to one of our song festivals (especially as a singer) - [“Ta lendab mesipuu poole”]
Or [“Laul Põhjamaast”]  (starting from 1:10)
Rail Baltica and HS2 are steps toward that
We need better trains
Also did you know that latvia and estonia will soon start building European largest offshore wind farm
I had a related experience when on a trip with my friends
We had rented a lodging and were eating breakfast in the kitchen, all hung over
I was just eating a sandwich, my eyes looking into the distance
So my friend tried to be the active one and started a conversation about whether I usually put ham on cheese or cheese on ham on my sandwich
I looked at his sandwich and **he had put cheese on ham**... I just yelled at him across the table, asking "What are you doing
" and everyone else at the table agreed
He agreed that this conversation blew up in his face quite fast - we still sometimes tease him about it
Well there was this worldwide a discussion about what way should you place [the toilet paper roll] \- does the paper roll off from the upper/front (over) or lower/back side (under)
Specific ones to Estonia
Maybe food-realted stuff like team [*peenleib*] vs team [*vormileib*] for bread preferences, though I think the majority is team *vormileib* anyways
And are the default pancakes [small (one-spoonful) pancakes] or [big (over-the-pan) pancakes] I think the majority is used to big pancakes
A potato salad should be made with sour cream
And maybe add a bit of mayonnaise
The second is not a potato salad, it's an abomination, actually the former is too
Who the hell cuts potatoes like that, it should be in cubes
Anything with raisins is garbage
It's clearly a biscuit
Cakes are designed to be eaten with a cake fork or a spoon, you eat Jaffa cakes identically to any other good biscuit
of course smetana goes on borsch
Sour cream goes on everything
(Estonian)
There are two types of sandwiches:
a) black bread - ham - cheese - cucumber
b) white bread - ham- cheese - tomato
Tomato on a black bread
Cucumber on a white bread
Cheese under ham
All unheard of
In my childhood, it was actually ham OR cheese, only rich snobs would put BOTH on one bread
Edit: kinda joking, ofc
Might be just my family thing
The name is the impostor
> The two biggest are probably whether potato salad should or should not contain mayonnaise
You are one of these barbarians who makes potato salad with vinegar aren't you
Why is sour cream in the sweet pot
Nonono, sour cream is firmly in the salty category because you might add salt, lemon pepper or garlic in there
You're from Harjumaa aren't you
There is only one possible situation where cheese won't go on top and that's when there's tomato slices included
Meat is always under cheese
Do not say that, you don't know how people can interpret that
I've had sour cream on pizza in Russia
Me personally, I never eat soups with sour cream
> scone rhymes with gone
That just sounds like an alien language, and we're not even entirely sure what a scone is
I am convinced that all Russians do this because I have one Russian guy living next to me in the dorm and not once has he put it the right way round
Oh my god, he actually said it out loud
Makes sense, not sure what NI protestants think they are, to the everyone else they just seem ridiculous
Well, on all Estonian foods
It is a must on almost every soup indeed, exceptions are milk/cream cheese based soups
With pea soup smetana is optional
Pure oil has no goddamn place in a potato salad
You put sour cream on sauerkraut
Really, would sour cream and pizza be common in Lithuania
Because I've literally never seen it in Estonia
No, I mean that pronunciation is alien
Scones themselves looked like a mix of a muffin and some other pastry for which there really isn't a suitable name in English
Sometimes I do
Gives it sort of a creaminess thing
I always put sour cream on sauerkraut soup though
I think in Estonia we actually know almost everyone or at least someone who knows someone
But I think really special is the moment when you meet another Estonian in totally random place far away from home country
It always feels like a miracle to hear Estonian in less touristy place and we always have to greet each other and of course have to ask if they know someone we know
And also sometimes we wave or flash lights to another car when we're far from home and see Estonian licence plate
Estonian trucks tend to honk to Estonian cars as well
Kilpkonn(shield frog)=turtle
Nahkhiir(skin mouse)=bat
Jõehobu(river horse)=hippo
Laiskloom(lazy animal)=sloth
Meresiga(sea pig)=guinea pig
Okassiga(thorn/needle pig)=porcupine
Jääkaru(ice bear)=polar bear
Ninasarvik(nose horn)=rhino
There are maybe more but I do not remember all
Edit:Found more
Pesukaru(wash bear)=raccoon
Kuldnokk(gold beak)=starling
Edit:Found one more
Metskits(forest goat)=Roe deer
I guess in Estonia we don't have any significant examples (or maybe I don't know about them) because we don't have any projects started in the first place
Our government loves to fantasise and promise something and then everyone forgets about it
For example, trams in Tallinn
Every year the administration orders a new research where trams would work great, turns out we can have trams everywhere in Tallinn and beyond and then we wait for the next research
Tram line to Lasnamäe, planned since the soviet times and never executed, is promised every election
Linnahall in Tallinn is also a great example - it was closed in 2009 and since then new projects appear every now and then
Opera house, conference center, mall, new passenger port - you name it
But now there is Rail baltic and I fear it will suit this thread in a couple years
Even now there are many problems and construction hasn't even started yet in Estonia
Oh wow
Estonia has had ID cards (with a chip) since 2002
I don't even have a passport (you don't need one when travelling in Europe)
They are also partly responsible for the delayed Crossrail in London, due to open in December 2018 but now pushed back to late 2021
Mandatory here from the age of 15
Cost is 25€ but the government can reduce or waive it if you have financial difficulties, and lasts 5 years
Well, we can use the ID cards to travel anywhere in the EU (plus the UK until the end of the year I think)
Passports are only needed for going outside the EU
No, you can visit them with an EU ID card, until the UK stops allowing them
I've done it 3 times over 2 years
Thankfully no, only dustmasks are gone from building stores
Well, my best friends father bought supplies for 3 months, for a very good reason see, he has a chronic lung problems and if he caught corona, he would die
Lumemari
Snowberry - actually not a real berry or anything but it’s the name of a delicious ice cream flavour and I always thought it was the most beautiful Estonian word
Its cognate *eit* used to mean "wife" or "married woman", but now is a bit derogatory and means "old hag".
It’s a small difference of the name but this berry is called lumimari and the ice cream is lumemari
Or *Linnutee* ("Bird's Way") in Estonian
Krõõt. I really hate it’s sound
I also hate all these English names with Estonian spelling, such as Kätlin (Caitlyn), Keit (Kate), Braian (Brian) or Mäddox (whatever this is supposed to be)
Funnily enough, with how Estonian pronunciation works, Kevin actually sounds normal unlike most others (Brandon etc)
That sounds so stereotypically Finnish
Sonny is a dog’s name where I’m from
now its one of mine as well
A common deposit system for bottles/cans would be nice
Yes, this
How absurd that while you are free to and even encouraged to buy goods from another member state, but then you can't actually do the environmentally reasonable thing and return them to the system
Or well, you can, but nobody will return your money and this means very few people are willing to bother, even less carry over their empty bottles to another country
In a time where environment is being prioritised, this should be a no-brainer
>from 300 to 6
000   € within one financial Union
Just a nitpick - lowest average net wage in EU is 500eur in Bulgaria, highest is 3500 in Luxembourg
Higher and lower wages are in European countries outside the EU
It can be done here in Tallinn as well (if you have credit card with contactless payment enabled)
We have the same system, but it's incompatible with Finnish or Latvian ones, for example
So if I'm bringing over a pack of beer cans from Finland, I need to take the empty cans back to Finland to get my deposit money back (stores charge some money for the cans/bottles, which you'll get back once you return them)
Same for Finns doing it here or in Latvia
Some of the bottle machines might have some places to put non-refundable cans/bottles, but people are not really motivated to do it
The result is that "foreign" cans/bottles are usually not returned at all
Most likely they'll end up in trash, but worst case scenario is just being dumped somewhere
Considering there's always the talk of "single market" in the EU, it's quite ridiculous this wasn't thought through
Since we hated the communist more than the fascist, we have it more communist oriented
Unfortunately there is a sizable minority who sees Estonian members of WW2 pro-German collaborationist divisions and security units in a more positive light
Main idea is "they fought against bolshevism, duh". It's even worse in our neighbor Latvia, where parades of  SS unit veterans were held
I understand and fully support anyone who dislikes soviet regime and their illegal annexation of neighbouring countries, but I will never understand why you have to celebrate those who fought for another totalitarian regime because of that
Disco Elysium
I played it and it was great
Only popular video game made by Estonians
Yeah, game develepoment industry in Sweden is pretty big
I had a pleasure to visit Avalance studio office and it was pretty cool to see EA office literally across the street, as well as Paradox office couple floors above
I love baba is you
My favourite puzzle game
Dude, you have freaking Max Payne, Alan Wake and Control
Finns for helping us in the war on liberation
*you will fight till the last finn*
Limpa, Valge klaar and Kelluke are all very popular here
We have Jaffa in Estonia too
We also have Limpa limonade here, very good
Especially the blueberry flavour
Limpa is just the shortened version of the word "Limonaad" and the name of the company
But in slang people use "Limps" too
You can disable it by changing your YouTube language to English
It's totally fine to discuss for both our own (K. Päts) and foreign, i.e. Soviet and German dictators
It's not taboo to talk about it, but if you praise Stalin for example you will get stares and people will be mad at you
Don't think there even are many games translated to Estonia (maybe some indie game)
But i even hate if someones uses Windows in Estonia, some translations make no sense (Same with phones)
Since i dont know any videogames that have been made in Estonian and there are almost never translations, i play games in English
Well I can't play games in estonian and finnish sounds so weird in video games so I'll rather play in english
Only game I know that has an Estonian translation is minecraft but I still prefer English
Eh, maybe a bit
I speak Estonian, learned English and speak it very fluently, learning German in school
Used to learn Swedish on Duolingo
Yes, i know estonian and english and used to speak finnish, i want to learn finnish and mari, which is spoken in russia
Finland: Estonia does not want into Nordic, Estonia just wants to reconnect to its big brother
We should do more stuff together, like saving the languages of distant relatives who are still trapped somewhere in Russia
Also sorry for the dude who insulted your prime minister, I'm afraid he's not ok in the head
Sweden: thanks for the university and everything
For some reason, it is still called "good ol' Swedish era". Oh, and sorry for burning down Sigtuna, unfortunately we cannot remember what exactly happened there anymore
Denmark: we were so connected in history, how come we drifted apart
As far as foreign rulers go, the times hanging with you were some of the best times, thank you for trusting the locals
Germany: we share a lot of history and had Germans living her for generations right up until the WW2 (our middle ages are pretty much called German period)
So you can come and visit more, a lot of people over here do speak German and have no-one to practice with
Russia: We are sorry for all the idiots who think that everything from the east sucks
It does not, you have amazing literature, ballet, music, nature etc, not all is politics
We can accept nowadays that Russians, too, suffered under USSR
You guys should really open yourself to tourism more (that you already started with the visa-free lists), I think it will bring you tons of money with just a little marketing
Latvia: Northern Latvia often feels like home
And do you actually want to have an island
Maybe we could give you some that are currently not inhabited
Lithuania: thank you for trying to help Belarus
We should be of more help
Iceland: we all know that Iceland was the first to recognize Estonias re-independence and we salute you for this
Portugal: could we start some kind of a seaside-countries club in Europe
We could have like some celebrations that are hosted by a different member every year
I feel like there is a similar element of melancholy in our cultures and it would be interesting to meet more often
Lol, don't worry, the bad Finnish tourist stereotype doesn't reach much further than the harbour area and certain Tallinn Old Town pubs
Greetings from the north, cousin
Over here, all people know at least these to things about Hungary for sure: that our languages are related and that "A Pál utcai fiúk" is from Hungary (kids read it in school)
Funnily enough, we seem to also share a tiny dessert that you call Túró Rudi and most of Europe does not know of
Also, YES, do the trans-siberian
I did it and it was fab
We stopped in \~10 cities for a night and it was very cool, are planning to go back to some places
Do not miss Kazan, Ulan Ude or Krasnoyarsk
If you want to come somewhere where you can feel at home, then I think our climate is just as shitty as yours
But as for actually changing the system, I do think some changes will happen eventually, but it will take time
You need some new great thinkers that can inspire people to develop a better system - I'd hope that they will start cropping up
Heh, thanks
Did not really think that there will be Portugese people that know of Estonia (:  When I visited Portugal, I felt an odd sort of connection with the place, that has never been the case with any other southern countries - so it intrigued me a lot
Especially as it was a very spontaneous trip and I really didn't know too much about Portugal before that
Vielen Dank
Die deutsche Sprache ist sehr schön!
Yeah, it is inhabited and a very cool place with it's own unique culture
As for showing our faces, people from the southern half do visit every now and then (and not just those idiots who come for cheap beer), we like little roadtrips or weekend getaways at your place sometimes
And then there is Positivus festival, it was extremely popular when it first started
You're welcome to
I recommend to come in the middle of August for the best weather and relatively long days, though if you want very long days and maybe to participate in a midsummers celebration, come at the end of June
Avoid November and March at all costs (unless you are a freak like me and like November storms)
I'm so sorry if it came off as harsh
As I said, there are no hard feelings associated with this for ages, people have started to question many things that narrative about the middle ages and there are good reasons for it
A lot of it was written during early independence movements and later edited by Russians
You can see some clear political motives for both of these groups to use things that happened so long ago that nobody knows anymore to their advantage
I just think it's really interesting that this narrative is very well-known in Estonia and pretty much in history textbooks, while I have yet to meet a German who knows it
I do find it somewhat odd that it is so unknown in Germany, not because I don't know that we are a small country and far away from you, but because you guys had so much land and huge mansions here, a lot of relatives here etc, and these rich Germans still lived here right until 1939-1941 ( *Umsiedlung*)
So it is not so old: even if you're a schoolkid atm, your grandmother was alive when those rich Germans left for Germany from Estonia
And they lost all that estate, they did such a big move, I'd think it's something that comes up among family, youknow
There have also been several discussions during different time periods about who and on what conditions could get these lands back etc and some have managed to get something I believe
I mean they were basically victims of the pact between Hitler and Stalin
I really didn't mean anything bad, but I can see how that can come off as negative and I'm sorry for that
This is a nice thread and I had no intentions on making it nasty and political
I actually second-guessed if I should erase that part as I had finished (didn't realise it while writing) and I should have listened to that impulse
I also decided to move that part from my original post, to avoid hurting  people
I'd like to share it with some Germans who are interested in  history at some point, but this is not the place for it :)
Though looking at how people are not happy about Polish politicians at all, it might not help a lot
Who has never conquered anyone
Maybe I'd suggest Latvia
They have their ups and downs depending on who's at the power, but the system seems to be working
u/marussia123, Ruhnu doesn't really have a distinct culture (while Kihnu does)
I mean, it used to back when it was inhabited by Swedes, but not anymore
Ich mag Deutsch, viele Leute sagen, dass Deutsch hart und aggressiv klingt, aber wenn es keine Kriegsrede ist, klingt Deutsch sehr schön!
The Hansaetic towns or at least the towns that were towns during the Hansaetic league are the nicest towns over here
During middle ages, Estonia was controlled by the Teutonic order (what exactly is it's relationship to Germany is foggy to me, but I assume it came down to the fact that the dudes spoke what was considered German)
We call our country "Eesti" and the people "eestlane". The old term for people was "maarahvas", that means "people of the land".
A local version is to call that place "Kapa-Kohila" (*Kappakoil* in German)
It is actually an older name for a little railway village (borough) [Kohila] in Estonia
You can also call the location "Pärapõrgu". This could be translated as Behind-the-Hell or The-Hell-Behind
Estonians say "pärapõrgu" which means something like behind the hell and sometimes even "karuperse" which means a bear's' ass
>Behind the Lord's back
We have the same saying, but the meaning is completely different
"Nagu vanajumajala seljataga" /behind the ol'Gods back/ - in a safe place
I am starting to wonder if I have simply misunderstood that saying since childhood
No, I can confirm your interpretation
"Valmis või mitte siit ma tulen" i hate it
"Valmis või mitte, siit ma tulen"
Valmis või mitte, siit ma tulen
Valmis või ei, siit ma tulen
"Valmis või ei, siit ma tulen
It's a direct translation of the english phrase
There aren't much they can do about it
I remember Soviet Union
It's quite hard to be the bold one and do something about it
Life is so sweet and nice
Do you love estonian accent aswell : (
Same I ve been trying a lot to change my accent it sounds horrible
Yay : )
One, that I did not see here
Botas - trainers
And I don't think that I have ever even seen any of their products in real life
[For bonus]
Interestingly even Estonian, which isn't even an indo-european language, kinda has this same similarity
The estonian for dragon is either "draakon" or "lohe".
"Draakon" is somewhat more common nowadays, and is most strongly associated with rhe high fantasy type of dragons like Game of Thrones and LOTR
"Lohe" is a bit more archaic, although definitely still in use
It's just not as obviously a loanword, so the translation is not as specific to the types of dragons we're used to seeing .
Kite in estonian is "tuulelohe", which basically translates to "dragon of the wind", being composed of "tuule" meaning "of the wind", and "lohe" meaning dragon, as i said before
I mean if the American didn't speak Spanish and the Spaniard couldn't speak English it would be a logical backup option to communicate in French
If you're from outside the county(Harjumaa), where the capital is, you're basically from the wild West to those living in the capital
If you live in Harjumaa you are basically thought of as having you're life centered around Tallinn
And if you're from Narva, you ain't even in the same country
I would still consider Tartu and Pärnu and maybe a few other cities to not quite be the wild west, but other than that it basically is wilderness lol
Pärnu and Tartu still feel significantly different to Tallin, but maybe their not quite wilderness yet
Thank you I needed that
From estonia to lativa iv never had my passport checked you just drive over the boarder no guards no stops from estonia to finland on a boat never had to show a passport just buy a ticket online swipe it and go
my grandma lives near the border and sometimes does grocery shopping in latvia
Not that often, usually when travelling, Latvia is quite far away form my town (100km) and Riga (with activites) is even futher to make it worth to drive for no reason
Also prices are quite similar so it doesn't become a reason
Also wages are lower so that also isn't a reason
Helsinki is like 1
5h by ferry but then again you need to start buying tickets and everything is more expensive there anyway
Around 20-25% of the population are russians i live in estonia
I'm from estonia, they start teaching code here from the first grade
I think popular enough it should be legal (won't probably happen before some other big neighbours legalize it) . I know there are a lot of sunday smokers who do it rarely
But more young people have started to smoke (wich is not that good for their brain development)
But i think cannabis should be legal and controlled by the state, not that smokers will keep funding the underground gangsters/mafia and will end easy access to other drugs too arter they found their cannabis contact (wich is not hard to do if you walk arround with open eyes arround some parts of town)
A lot of countries has shown that war on drugs don't work, you need to reach helping hand for addicts not punish them as criminals
(this goes for other drugs too and i don't mean we should legalize everything)
Yeah THC got somehow legal as "food  supplement" or something like that (But the police are still harrasing those who grow and sell it once a while, even if everything is legal)
It's sad our politicans don't see the value how much money you can make by taxing it
But no, let the people finance criminals, that's fine
They don't understand by making it legal here, there would be much less street dealers selling it to underage kids (wouldn't say it would dissapear totally)
And all the new tourists we would get
But no, cannabis is "the root of evil" and road to all kinds of different drugs in their eyes
But i think younger people are starting to change their minds slowly, so i am hoping for the best
Also when i got arrested while owning under 1g and smoking a tiny pipe, they treated me like i was big criminal, and like almost 10 police officers were dealing with me totally, turing the whole deal in the police Station
And the same time people are getting beaten up in old town every weekend with no police in sight (not every weekend, but you get the point)
It's much easier to catch stoners, because most other drugs you inhale, eat or inject with seconds in some dark bathroom (not that i use any other drug)
But i doubt you are walking arround with brownies all the time and smoking smells and can't be done that discreet
We also have like Maikel and stuff, we also have names like Keitlin, Kätlin (Catylin) and Sessiilia (Cecilia)
I'm not leaving due to the economic situation of my country, but I do plan on working abroad for a few years just for the experience
Isn't it also dangerous to just wander around in deserted areas in ex-yugoslavian countries due to all the land-mines left from war times
>were you can be more that a few kilometers from structures
Checked google maps and up in the north of Norway there are areas of 100+ km with no man-made structures in them
I just checked this railway line on google maps and it definitely is not 3h of nothingess
It goes through several towns on the way and there are small villages every few miles on its way as well
>There is a lot of details lacking from google maps
I checked satellite images ) There is quite a lot of nothingess in Finnmark
Obviously compared to Siberia it's not much, but compared to central Europe where you can't go more than a few kms without noticing human footpring, it's quite a lot
>real forest
Wilderness is not just forests though
And you definitely have quite big areas where there is literally nothing but nature - judging by google maps there are ares of 100+ km between roads with nothing but swamps, planes and hills there
Very mildly if at all
Our previous president was born in Sweden
Unlike USA, Estonian citizenship is based on parents' citizenship status, not on being born in Estonia, so location of birth doesn't have nearly as much significance as it does in America
The president usually doesn't have much power but has a lot of representative responsibility,  so it is of some importance
In Estonia if a Russian got elected, it would ruffle some feathers
Just too much bad history with them ://.
Our previous president was born in Sweden and grew up in New Jersey
[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]
His birthplace was never a problem
I mean Toomas Hendrik Ilves was born in Stockholm, grew up in Sweden and the USA and only came to Estonia in the 90s. I think it's a bit different for ex soviet block countries, in some sense if you were born before the 90s you weren't born on the soil of the Republic of Estonia
Yea, we have it complicated
Honestly, as Estonia is a small country, it seems as all big media have pretty same moderate views and luckily all of them imo aren't afraid to criticise the government, even the government owned channels
But, when EKRE came to power last year, they complained that one journalist of ERR (the national broadcaster who owns a few radio stations and tv channels) criticised them too harshly and eventually he was fired
So here is that
Finland, because they're the only other Finnic nation that has its own country
I want to say Finland but reading the comments it might be one way love
We have been friends since the fall of Tsardom of Russia
Our president even Konstantin Päts wished to make a unified Finland ala Greater Finland on 1917
In 1939 Finland had volunteers from Estonia against Russia
Also Finnish and Estonian anthems melody's are literally the same
Finland
Tfw you don't consider us as a friend
I thought it was Lithuania because of Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth
Well we certainly are Finnic, just like Finland and some tribes in Western Russia
Now this is what i can agree with
Sibelius
Yes, I wear one right now
I have no idea what is written there
For me it was just 2€ t-shirt that covers me
Ok I'm reading it first time right now
"Dry Goods Tom Taylor MCMLXII registered trademark no 957 872"
Well among teenagers it's quite popular to wear shirts that say fuck or lit or w/e. Often in bold italic Futura
No, I bought it this year
Maybe it was produced 1962 :), I have no idea
Yes, you are correct
Jokes about Russians that aren't funny  Ahem* what did Ivan say to Dimitri
Nothing , they're both passed out drunk in a soviet age bus station
Kaiu raba or Kolgu raba
Both names are used
It's a bog in Estonia
People have gone missing, Multiple UFO sightings have been reported, compasses and GPS's can stop working
Time can stop too
It has even been tested, people have  took 2 watches and left one at the entrance of the bog and one inside the bog
The watch that was left at the entrance of the bog was way ahead of the watch in the bog
A grandma and a grandchild once saw a man with very brown skin, just red underwear who was walking very weirdly
A hunter set up a trap to catch an animal and set up a camera
So if an animal tripped over the wire, it would take a photo
When the hunter later went to check the camera, there was no animal on the picture
There was a man with a very curved back and with a walking stick
Every local was asked if they knew who it was and nobody recognized the man
That man has been spotted many times but nobody knows who it is
There have been more sightings of strange creatures but the old man is the most famous one
I just listened to a podcast episode about this place and other claimed paranormal sightings in Estonia
Definitely one of the spookiest locations
Sadly no, it’s a podcast in Estonian about crime and paranormal fenomena
13-15- Estonia
Right now there are 5 major parties in Estonia:
Keskerakond (Central Party)(Liberal)
Reformierakond (Reform Party)(Liberal)
EKRE (Right wing Conservative Party)
Isamaa (Conservative Party)
Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond (Social Democratic Party)
There are also some smaller irrelevant parties
Occasionally buying something from local, but expensive bakery or restaurant
I have a choice of buying something way cheaper from a grocery store next door, but I still want to support the small local businesses
AND occasionally being a blood donor
In estonian it's nojaa
We say nojaa or nojah or alternatively no nii
First name and surname (father's)
My Danish teacher had a problem with the naiming system in Estonia
He had a baby here
In Denmark it's relatively common to have two first names and two surnames (judging from my Danish acquaintances at least)
In Estonia by law you can't do that
You can either have two first names and a surname or one first name and two surnames
But not both
I don't really know whether names like "Karl-Erik" or "Toomas-Hendrik" or "Pille-Riin" are considered two names or one name by law
People generally refer to people with these hyphenated names by their full name (i.e the second part is not a middle name)
We have it like the germans I think, a first ( maybe a middle name, depends on your parents) and usually the surname of your father, if you are a woman you may also have your mother's surname
You can have either of them
My family used to be im charge of a German noble man's mansion so yeah i guess i would've inherited that
But when the slavea rose up they burned the mansions down
I'm form Estonia
I would have been slave
I'm green at heart so I do support anything that minimizes pollution that China creates
And we can't really just blame them either
We also have to carry responsibility because instead of solving our pollution problems we just exported those to China
So, yes
We need closer economic and political cooperation with Taiwan
Our e-government was defeated by rats
And here i was, high and mighty, about to say that Estonians don't have IT problems
Same
Nohu
In english you can have stuffy nose, runny nose and you can sneeze or have sniffles or cold in the head
But there is no word to describe them all - I have problem with nose
Well almost: there are rhinitis and coryza but AFAIK nobody uses them
The word does exist in other languages: in german it is Schnupfen and in russian насморк.
Definitely this colorful monstrosity
Worst part is that it was finished just a year ago, even though it looks like something from 1990s
They can
It is not compulsory, but if they do, there is a national curriculum (to ensure that it is a useful subject and not just someone teaching only their own beliefs, they have to cover many religions etc)
They can also teach philosophy, often if the school has one, it also has the other
I think it is really useful, as it is normal for humans to think about "life, universe and everything" and also to think about what can and what can't be known
Teenagers especially like to think about life , death and universe and what it all means, so it's usually really interesting to have all those discussions
You also practice logic and critical thinking, get to know about all the stories that are represented in art and literature etc
It is also useful for history and social studies lessons, as different religions have influenced culture and politics and vice versa
In my own universe, I would merge philosophy and religions into one subject and make in compulsory for \~2 years, aged 14-16
They should integrate it with literature, history, social studies and maths etc
You have to teach kids to think, not only learn stuff by heart (though this is no doubt also very necessary)
Yeahbut only as a non-required subject
You may take this subject but dont have to
Yeah
It was one of the coolest subjects imo
Like a mix between of world history and culture
Christianity was only a small part of it
yeah, we had it too
it was an elective class though, so most people in my class didnt take it
I don't think it's actually far from truth
Especially in public saunas
Mõisaküla, just for the fun of it
It's our smallest settlement that has a "town" status - it has ~800 people
Also it's pretty much in the middle of nowhere and on a border with Latvia
Moving all the government structures in there would be a fun experiment
A city that is almost entirely made of government officials and diplomats
Uhh, either pärnu or tartu, they are already big cities
Our level of importance is well showcased in [one comment in this thread] that uses us as an example of a non-important country when comparing the importance of countries:
> Ngl, objectively speaking, it's difficult to argue that Germany and Estonia are equally important
I'm not saying that one country is better than the other
Power mattrrs
They are "deeply worried" and "voice deep concern" over the relationship we have with Russia
that relationship being, you know, war
I thought every country in Europe has free healthcare
Frankly, there are no real downsides to this
A stronger society benefits everyone
You know,  no-one has to go robbing houses to get their wifes cancer removed or to pay off the debt from that and so forth
It also helps with gender equality, as giving birth can make you bankrupt in the states
There can sometimes be long waiting that others have mentioned, but this has less to do with free healthcare and more to do with lack of doctors
This in turn has more to do with socio-demographic changes (old doctors die at quicker rates than new ones get their education) than anything else
Frankly, it is sometimes not 100% free, as there can be some minimal fees, that are meant to act as small barriers
Like when you first go to some specialist, you have to pay 5€ "visit fee", but I'm not sure if it is really connected to a lack of GP referral or is there in all cases
>. This in turn has more to do with socio-demographic changes
Seeing that you're from Estonia, I am sure you have to know that the biggest reason we have lack of doctors/nurses is that they can easily move to nearby EU countries and immediately earn 3-5 times more money
I have relatives working in Estonian healthcare and know pretty well that their pay is not nearly good enough for the amount of work they do
And on top of that they have to fight for every little increase in salary
Just some rambling thoughts, it's late:
The moving abroad part is true for some doctors, but I'm not sold that's a bigger aspect than socio-demographical changes - and it is even amplified by that
Our average age of doctors was 51 in 2018
Ain't moving abroad mainly done by GPs and not so much by other doctors
There are fields, where working abroad is very complicated (psychiatry - due to high importance of language), but we still have a serious lack of young doctors
And not just actual working doctors, but also a lack of kids applying for residency programmes
There were many years, when they took in less than 100 new kids a year, yet we had \~150 doctors retiring each year and it quickly built up
And the bigger cohorts born in 1988-1992 that have graduated by now are basically collectively on maternal leave
They are \~30 when they graduate, so they are in a hurry to buy a house and start a family, I think females also still make up a majority of graduates
They also often have more kids than the general population
The way socio-demographics amplifies even the moving abroad part, is due to the fact that you cannot get full-time work in smaller towns, as the populations there have been decreasing
Therefore you don't get full-time salary either
And these aspects might push people to move, both for higher salary and more interesting work
As for nurses, I assume you are absolutely correct though
They have had way more salary problems and they are also notably younger when they graduate (more time for adventures)
I don't personally work with nurses, so that part is foggier for me
Finland, Sweden, UK, Germany and Norway are most popular destinations
I really don't get Russian grammar Like you have set rules to your language, but there's a load of words that don't follow the rules, Also why so many genders
Mai ingliš is veri guud tänk juu
Veoauto is a great one to try to pronounce
Correct me if I’m wrong but I think both languages can put any words together to make a new word
Meaning there’s no official word
Well I got good news for you
[Start here] and go nuts
Once you complete the series you know everything you ever need to know about the conflict
[This video] and [that one as well]
might give you a humourous idea about it
For better or for worse they do seem to get very different treatment to other people
Pretty typical unfortunately, the Ukrainans suffered a whole separate genocide even before the war and most people know very little if anything about it too
Wow, what you've described is eerily similar to what I had in shool in Estonia
Down to having longer breaks after 2nd and 4th lessons
As far as I know Estonia copied a lot of things from Germany when we regained independance in 1991
The only difference is that we didn't have a free 7th hour (which kinda sucked on longer days)
And honestly I always hated that we started so early, I had to wake up at 6:00 to get to school
I usually was literally sleeping through 1st-2nd lessons
Interesting how similar it is to my school in Estonia, even the Wednesday thing
The only difference is that we don't have breaks longer than 20 minutes and as in the 11th grade we have 7-8 lessons we usually end around 15-16
Not sure it would work in winter though - here it would leave only a couple hours at midday for school, haha
But yeah, I think schools shouldn't start earlier than 9
It was pure torture to wake up so early (both for me&siblings and our parents)
And first lessons were not productive anyway - everyone was really sleepy
I am really glad I can now show up as late as 10:00 at work
Shortest day is 21 december - sunrise is at 9:17 and sunset is at 15:20
Technically 6 hours of daytime
In reality though it gets bright at around 10-11 and dark by 2, because sun rises reaaly low relative to horizon and barely iluminates surroundings
Plus usually its very cloudy, so even less light
It's actually even worse in Alaska and north scandinavia - they have polar nights with no sun at all for the whole winter
It just doesn't rise above the horizon at all for them
You can check out this incredible timelapse that shows difference between summer and winter in Finland - it's pretty much same here in Estonia
[A meteorite landed] on our biggest island and basically burned a lot of it down
The event was so remarkable that the story was kept alive for millennia among several nations until it could be written down
The war of independence
Liberating Riga from the Germans and almost capturing Petrograd was pretty cool
I heard  once that during the Tartu peace treaty signing, Soviet officials watched a military march, what they didn't know was that the Estonians let soldiers march multiple times so the Estonian army looked many times larger than it actually was
Also in 1944 the  Estonian national committee (government in exile essentially) declared a new government and seized Toompea from the Germans and ordered them to leave from Tallinn
The Estonian republic existed in Tallinn until the Soviets "liberated" it
Also it's kinda surreal that countries like Finland have tried to win Eurovision for decades (53 times for Finns for example) and we just won on our 8 try and became the first country from the former eastern bloc to win
Sort of a "you don't say" moment
It has to be Midsummer or actually the day before Midsummer when Midsummer is actually celebrated, i.e. on Victory Day on 23 June
The most recognizable feature would be what we call 'potato blond' hair (like natural, darker blond)
Could also be another Balt or a Finn, though
Yep, though there are different phenotypes generally i think i can recognize estonians
Tallinn old town, Pärnu (where I too love) and Saaremaa Island in the summer
The **locations** might be known only for the more obvious ones: Alaska, Florida, Texas, California, New York
Also maybe Oregon, Louisiana, Michigan, Virginia, New Mexico, Maine, Montana, etc really depends on your interests, of which places do you hear often
For younger people, the **names** of all the states will be familiar
For older ones, not all, but the more popular ones (mentioned in news and tv-series) will be
In Russian we have almost the same one
Казнить, нельзя помиловать! - execute, no mercy
Казнить нельзя, помиловать! - must not execute, have mercy
I have heard that the way they teach irish in schools is also wrong, that they teach with the wrong pronunciation
When topics about my own country then sometimes there is not an English page
Or on some topics i read both Estonian and English version of the topic, really depends how informative and popular the topic is
But most times i prefer to use the English, because our language "is so small", it's pain in the ass to Google anything in Estonian, sometimes you get so wrong results
So as much possible, i use internet only using English
I speak Russian and Estonian, so will go with both
Russian wikipedia is pretty extensive and very good for topics like science, geography, biology
However anything about history and especially articles about Russia/USSR have to be taken with grain of salt
A ton of "sources" are actually official soviet/russian encyclopedias
Best to take a look at English articles (or German in case of ww1 and ww2) and compare them
Estonian wiki - very good for anything about Estonia (history, politics, language, laws), not so good for anything else
Very small amount of articles and most available articles are pretty short
the estonian one is decent, definitely not as detailed or reliable as the english one in most things, but similarly to other languages, thr local topics are covered better
sometimes i also use wikipedia as a dictionary - i know the word/term in one language and then check its linked counterpart in the other language to get the correct name
especially useful for names of animal species or more niche foods which you cant always just check in a dictionary
Of course, water here is very good
Some people living in Tallinn complain about very slight chlorine taste which is added to fight bacteria if the water goes to old house with bacteria living in pipes
Naples has a huge graffiti issue as well
First thing I noticed
Made the whole city center look like a dangerous place to be in
Which maybe it was, I wouldn't really know as a tourist
Happy cake day
Bydgoszcz, Poland for me, with 346,739 inhabitants
Łódź was the first I didn't know
The last I knew was Nantes
Zaragoza
i know a lot more cities, but just not that one lol
Lol, same for me
oh damn, you guys got one more than us
Estonian also has the Instructive case (viisiütlev) like in Finnish
It isn't officially included because it's only used in a few words (like in Finnish)
oh, seems pretty dumb to count it as an indepdent case imo but good to know
>military complex , slavery and wealth obscenity
I mean first two points were core parts of Europe up until very recent history and I'd say last one is still not fully gone away
when your mouth is hanging open: "Close your mouth, your heart will get cold"
when you complain about your food being too hot: "you have a windmill under your nose" (ok this one could have been just my dad's invention)
when you're a shitty parent who believes theyre the only one whose opinion matters: "the child speaks when the chicken pisses" (chickens dont piss)
i cant think of any others right now
oh, we have the sugar one too
Estonian is pretty easy in this category, we only have very few exeptions like
Süüa (to eat) should be pronounced as süia, same with müüa (to sell) - müia
Everything else is pronounced the way its written
Everything is written as it is pronounced but not other way around
Two major points that make text->speech problematic
Palatalization: "palk" (log) and "palk" (salary) are pronounced differently
Length of syllables: "pall" is written in genitive and illative "palli" but both forms are pronounced with different length of "ll".
And to finish off the Finno-Ugric gang
Yeah the "palk" thing, didnt think of that
Usually you understand which one was meant by the contect
What is ø pronounced like
Is it like our Estonian ö?
Most likely
Yes
Saaremaa pirates kidnapped the king of Sweeden and ransomed him back to the sweeds
In Estonia our scouts (young eagles) are literally a sub category of the Defence Force (military)
While obviously very militaristic (since it was originaly created to prepear young boys for mandatory service) we also spend most of our time outside
Everything we do with the younger boys is centered around it being fun and  more playfull than just training, but for older boys the idea of military training is fun in it of itself (this is usually why boys want to join, they are drawn by the guns and "cool army stuff")
TL;DR We raise child soldiers but it's fun :p
I'm not sure but our scouts are present at military parades, so I'm guessing its more like the U.S but not as militaristic
Not sure tho, it isn't that popular here, most just send their kids to grandpa and grandmas house for the summer, or summer camp
No, but roman and byzantine coins have been found here
That smiling cashiers are creepy and unsettling
We really are that gloomy
Here in Estonia if it's public sauna (like in spa) people don't go naked
If it's private and it's just family/friends - yeah, naked
We can relate
Packages are put into parcel machines, leaving packages on porches is unheard of
[Machines like that] or more advanced "pack robots" like [an Estonian company Cleveron offers] There are hundreds of those and they are basically everywhere
They all work with the same principle - you enter your package number and the door opens
You can also send your own parcel via the machine
The machines also have payment option, if you haven't paid online
I think no city will ever beat [Norilsk] Russia
Podgorica, rest of Montenegro is really nice though
I used to visit Bratislava quite often while living in Vienna and of course it’s not as interesting as Vienna but I always liked it’s atmosphere more than Vienna’s.
Well the letter Õ. Our anthem is *Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm*, which means "My Fatherland, My Joy and Happiness", but if you write it with O-s as *Mu isamaa, mu onn ja room*, then it means "My Fatherland, My Hut and Feces".
I'm quite sure every language have words that are written same but
have different meaning depending from pronunciation
palk = log
palk = salary
When written there is no difference, when said there is difference
In Estonian that sounds like Mina tapan haned = I will kill the geese
As an Estonian I read it as
"I kill a goose"
Unless I am outside for a long time, yes I do
I like rain, not thunder i was scared of that
Not many thunderstorms in Estonia but when there are I love them, sometimes even go chasing if severe ones occur (derechos, smaller tornadoes)
They are cool but then again dangerous if you're not prepared
In estonian
Ninasarvik- nosehorny (rihno)
Jõehobu- river horse (hippo)
Merisiga- sea pig (guineapig) <-- noidea if thats how its spelled
Kaelkirjak- (this one has 2) neck spoty or neck typie (giraffe)
Lasteaed- child fence (kindergarden)
Kilpkonn - shield frog (turtle)
Jõehobu - river horse (hippo)
Mine persse - go into ass (fuck off)
Ninasarvik - nosehorn (rhino)
Laiskloom - lazy animal (sloth)
Pesukaru - washing bear (raccoon)
Tulemasin - fire machine (lighter)
Külmkapp - cold closet (fridge)
Hundinui - wolfs club/stick (cattail)
Puuvill - tree wool (cotton)
Pesukarhu is a raccoon, not a badger
In Estonian most words are similar, but aren't actually a combination of words
Like for example plane in Estonian is lennuk, it's obviously derived from the verb lendama, which means to fly, but no other connections there
Doesnt really change xd, at least this sentence
Tere, minu nimi on John, see on meeldivus kohtuda sinuga
Kust oled sa pärit
Hello, my name is John, it is a pleasure meeting/to meet you
Where are you from
I would translate "me llamo" as "me I call" to account for the conjunction of the verb
Also "conocerte" because it's "nice to meet *you*" Otherwise I'd agree with that translation :)
Homo sapiens, by far
Especially, when not properly socialized and educated from an early age
It is said that the most dangerous animals in our nature that **will** attack you are female moose and female boars, given that they have a calf or piglets around them somewhere
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
But otherwise bears and wolves of course, but they are unlike to attack unless provoked
Ticks, Boars, Moose, Bears and Wolves but won't likely attack unless provoked
Good point about wasps
That's truth
Not humor
Wasn't it illegal in Denmark to fly flags of other countries and unions
From Google:
Official **flag** rules in **Denmark** state that, unless special authorisation is given, it is **not** permitted to **fly** any other national **flags** than the **Danish** Dannebrog, a white Scandinavian cross on a red background
Okay, thank you for the info

Tõde ja õigus
Sügisball(Autumn Ball)
November (2017) for Estonia
Tõde ja Õigus
Personally my favourite Estonian movie is "Truth and Justice"
That's also a good one
"Tangerines" is also highly recommended
Anyone with a spine would do
Merkel would be ideal due to her vast experience and being centre-right on a political scale
"Estonia has no sex and no future" is a running joke about Estonian language pertaining to the fact that there's no grammatical gender as well as no future tense in Estonian, i find it very fascinating how you can talk about future in present tense, we have something similar in my native Ukrainian, but it's more rare option, in Estonian though it's use all the time
I love the way estonian sounds in song, its beautiful
Its kinda sad though seeing that most people in your country speak the language that is not native
Same in estonian we have only TEMA
Pretty much
Sült, or meat jelly
Meat surrounded by jello
(estonia)
We probably got it from you or russians
Okei is very common but my estonian teacher always used to scold us a bit for using it
We lost our freedom in 1939 to Russians again and then we got it back in 1991
But there's still a Russian threat out there
Well everything is pretty awesome now, but boy, you're going to have a shit time
Well, we got occupied by the Russians again for some time but we're back
"We won the war
Buuut päts took over and gave away our country, but we got better"
What happened to all of east Prussia and everything east of the river Oder
I wonder if it would have been possible for a German from 1919 to think Germany stayed the same from then until now, and not know about the second world war
No kidding, it is a lot like Arabic, like I once learned 1-10 in Arabic because I was bored but I'd forgotten them over the years, then I looked up the number in Maltese right now and they were so similar I remembered arabic numbers immediately after reading them
Estonia has a village called "Aa" [
Ee sounds like the Dutch Twin of [Aa] :)
There's also a village called "Ao"
Is that the place where they invented a ja o?
Never been to Paris, never cared much for the Notre Dame (not meant in a bad way, just little to no dealings with it)
But anyone with a heart and mind will have, at the very least, a thought of empathy invoked for the French and the Parisians
I'm not even really religious and i thought it was quite bad
Although I'm bot religious i can still feel bad about those who are
First reaction was surreal and hard to believe it’s really happening, like one of the symbols of Europe burning
As if the Big Ben or Colosseum was up in flames
Kyiv has a mostly positive reputation i guess
Tallinn, us rest like to go there to visit itsa surreal expirence to vist the city
Idk we like it here and it's mostly seen as "the place you drive to for your job/bc of shops/bc you gotta get on your plane" if you live outside Tallinn or any other city
Well it is pretty dirty
There are actually 12 towns in  Luxembourg
Yeah i've been there
AS A BABY gottem
The Estonian government collapsed just now too
Big corruption scandal and our prime minister resigned because of it
* One fell because they fixed food prices during hyperinflation, which did lead to food stamps
* One fell because PM lied about selling rouble notes that we had left after adopting our own currency
* One fell because minister of interior recorder his private meetings with other politicians
* Next fell because PM has shade real estate deals
* One fell because minister of justice wanted to set minimums how many how many civil servants had to be prosecuted every year
* One fell because married PM danced & kissed with one other girl and resigned
* And last one fell because corruption investigation (they gave a loan to businessman far below market rates)
There is a possibility that next one will fall because of same incident because investigation just started and one involved party is included in next coalition
All this is for last 17 governments

It is not necessary to speak English to get by in Estonia, but most people in the younger generations have at least some degree of fluency due to having learned it in school and exposure to English-language media
Speaking additional languages is more of a nice-to-have thing, generally not expected
Most of those who are old enough to have grown up in the USSR can speak Russian to some extent, younger people generally don't (aside from the ones who are Russian themselves, of course)
Though I imagine it varies by location also, there are some places (mainly in Ida-Viru county) where most of the population is Russian, so Estonians living in those areas are probably more likely to pick up the language as well
That's mostly a thing in northern Estonia I believe
During Soviet times many people watched Finnish TV and might have picked up some language from there, but those broadcasts didn't reach the southern parts of the country
And afterwards learning Finnish still was/is worthwhile for people in Tallinn, especially those working in the service industry, due to the amount of Finnish tourists
But here in southern Estonia knowing Finnish isn't common at all in my experience
Sadly the Estonian Swedish dialects are all but extinct nowadays, as when the coasts were declared restricted zones after the USSR took over, most of the coastal Swedes were displaced and emigrated to Sweden
There is still a [small community] (around a few hundred people) of Estonian Swedes who remained or returned after we regained indpedence, but they mostly speak standard Swedish AFAIK
Learning Swedish as a foreign language is not particularly common among Estonians
Depends, if you're coming over for a little shindig and put your beer in the bridge then it's all good
Just randomly opening the host's fridge is rude however
Finland- cold on the streets, warm under the sheets and sauna
Russia- the food, the people, the culture
Russia has something for everyone
Latvia- Kārums and cultural sites plus the "brother from another mother" (as I like to call it) friendship
Sweden- the history we share together
Yes
My parents and grandparents would use Russian
It was impossible to understand until I started learning it and even after that they would have easily got away with it when just avoiding the most simple words
Now that I am an adult I sometimes use English with my partner accidentally and my parents are sure we're hiding something :D
I come from a Russian speaking community in Estonia, so my experience is a bit different
However, I have seen this behaviour in families where parents use Russian as the main language at home but who also come from a different culture
For example, my friend's parents are Ukrainian and would switch to Ukrainian when arguing, so that the kids wouldn't understand them
Similarly, my mum would speak in Bulgarian to her mum/friends when she didn't want me to understand the conversation
Georgian parents switching to Georgian from Russian
I guess this may raise questions about families not teaching the native language to their kids, which is quite normal
From memory, it was mostly the Tatar families who tended to speak Tatar at home, so the trick didn't apply to them
I guess the funny truth was that we as kids would switch to Estonian/English if we didn't want some adults to understand us
my parents spoke russian, even though my mom barely spoke it at the time
i grew up speaking estonian and my parents switching to more or less broken russian when they wanted to speak about secrets
but same, me and my brother switched to english when we didn't want adults to understand us
Its funny
I have never met or talked to any non native who could actually speak it except my russian teachers
> My native language is English and I FUCKING HATE that we expect everyone to speak English
It's not my native language and of course I expect everyone to speak it too, like how do you use the internet these days without it, I'm truly baffled
I've found plenty actually, seems mainly because of Uni
I know a Hungarian dude who speaks decent Estonian and I've met a German girl and an American guy who were so fluent I could barely tell they had an accent
Gotta say it is weird though
That is absolutely true and the only people I met there who were nice were ironically immigrants who couldn't speak English either but at least they did their best to communicate
either fresh and warm rye bread or a random drunk in public transport
Fresh air and pine forest
When I was a little child me and my family used to live in Austria and the only 3 places I had ever been to where Estonia, Austria and the Canary Islands
Since we only used to visit Estonia during summer time I was profoundly convinced, that the Estonian climate is the same as the one on the Canary islands
Boy, was I wrong
thanks to the olympic games i had heard of the city of torino, but i always thought it was in canada
i have since been to torino, italy, and can confirm that it's in fact in italy, even if i still forget sometimes
(this doesnt count as europe, but i also thought salt lake city was in canada, so you can imagine i was extremely confused as to why they'd hold the olympic games in canada, 3 times in a row)
oh, and i was shocked to find out that all of the eastern european countries werent in the ussr
that was quite an eye-opening history lesson for me
To put it bluntly, there's no balance of power, as even after 30 years of independence and continuous decrease of president powers we still basically have a situation where the president is de facto the head of the ruling parliament party, while the prime minister and their cabinet openly admit that they are part of president's team even though technically the law isn't supposed to allow for that
It"s just the reality of political scene in Ukraine
IMHO, so far this has allowed for several cases were presidents tried to consolidate even more power using their de jure and de facto influence to sway officials, attempt go rig the elections and install something similar to Belarus and Russia in Ukraine (those were Kuchma and Yanukovych), in both cases they were only stopped due to the power of public outrage that led to revolutions (Orange Revolution in 2004 and Revolution of Dignity/Maidan in 2013-14)
At this point, I'd argue that further decreasing presidential powers and making him/her a figurehead would prevent such situations from happening in the future
Usually alone, unless it's comfortable for the parents to drop them off
Yeah who live close walk or go by bike, but a lot of people take a bus
Yes, it's expected that kids will go to school on their own after a few weeks at age 7
I can read the "Povist vremyanyh lit" or "Chronicle of Bygone Years" / "Primary Chronicle", a history of the Kievan Rus' from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kyiv in circa 1113 pretty easily, if I concentrate
It's written in Old East Slavic(which would later evolve into Old Ruthenian/Ukrainian/Belarusian which itself would evolve into modern Ukrainian) so it's a millennia old and includes so many of archaic words or words that changed their meaning but the overall structure and the spelling mostly remain the same(except for the few Cyrillic letters that are no longer in use)
Old Estonian looks like Welsh, Polish and German mixed into one
for some reason
[If you read the pages 57 and 56 of this then you'll see
] I can understand only one or a few words from each sentence
instead of "give an example" we say "bring an example", since thats how it's said in estonian
estonians also tend to just forget articles (a, an, the) altogether, since we don't use them
oh, and i guess also using the correct tense, since we have much fewer tenses in general and no future tense at all
Yeah, we have that as well
Estonian does not make a difference between "he" and "she" either and it does show
I mean I had English classes for 11 years in school, used English constantly during my Uni studies and still use it every day for my phd work
And still
Sometimes when I am writing a longer text or if I am speaking with a bigger group of people I use "he" instead of "she" or vice versa
It is not like I cannot remember the difference, ofc I know it
It is just that when I get carried away, then my brain is simply not used to dividing humans like that and doesn't care about me sounding stupid
i'm going to try my best, but sorry if the explanation is confusing
we usually just use present tense and imply the future part of it with adverbs such as tomorrow, next week, soon, etc
sometimes also the help-verbs "saama" ("to become") and "hakkama" ("to start")
for example: "ma laulan" means "I am singing" or "I sing" (present continuous & present simple are the same tense here)
"ma laulan homme" means "I will/am going to sing tomorrow". the tomorrow makes it known that the singing is not currently happening, but will happen in the future
you could also say "ma hakkan laulma" ("I will start singing") if you wish to not specify when the action will happen
in this instance, the form of the verb changes ("laulan" -> "laulma"), but it is still not a future tense, because "laulma" is the basic form of the verb and "laulan" is just the conjugated version of it ("singing" vs "i sing")
"ma varsti laulan" would mean "I will soon sing"
so yeah i guess in conclusion it's kind of confusing, we just use the present tense in different ways and the adverbs+context usually help express that the action is going to happen in the future
Estonia issues ID-cards since 2002
Every Estonian from the age of 15 is required by law to have an ID-card (you don't have to own a passport)
They're commonly used to give "digital signatures". I (and many other Estonians) don't own a passport since you need a passport only if you want to travel outside Europe
Also - perhaps controversially - since 2005 you can vote though the internet using an ID-card
You can actually do a lot of stuff using the ID-card through the internet
Apply for universities or apply for permits or do your tax declaration (literally takes one minute if you don't have your own company) etc etc
The card looks like [this]
Background color look exactly the same as on my driving license card ))
the estonian one's image is like
2 or 3 designs too old lol
Definitely to emphasize how intergrated the id system is
Super useful, especially that you have 3 seperate systems to authenticate yourself so you don't even need to use the card physically
You can authenticate via text message or an app
>The idea that I could get in trouble for not having any ID when going to buy some eggs is crazy to me
It's not that crazy
You're not going to be stopped by police during your grocery shopping (in fact seeing police is very-very rare here)
But for identifying you in post office, bank, police station - basically anything governmental or financial - it's a must have to identify you
i mean yes but also no
[New design vs 2(?) editions older design]
Unless you're buying alcohol or tobacco products(to prove that you're 18 or over) - no, it's not a  requirement
No private company or shop will ask for your ID, unless you ask for services or goods that require you to be an adult
Tallinn since the 1600s for sure
Before that, Tartu could've given it some competition for top spot, whilst before the Northern Crusades the most important castles were mainly in the south of the country
Tallinn grew it's lead more and more following Tartu's near complete destruction in the Great Northern War, the construction of the Tallinn-Narva-St
Petersburg railway and a massive population boom (don't know why) for only Tallinn in the interwar period
In Soviet times this effect was even stronger with Slavic immigration
sounds like a rap
I started learning English from Cartoon Network at age 4
A massive amount of cartoon network ever since I was 4
And video games and TV shows and so on and so on
Depends what you study
My program only accomodates for Latvia and Turkey
Id pick Germany in a heartbeat
E: Also depends where you're from, maybe in Switzerland it's very similar but coming from south/east Europe it's still worthwhile experience
Tall female, skinnier type of athletic, blonde, [long bob cut] and hiking
Swede
(/NO/IS)
A male with brown hair, light eyes, strong jawline and [crooked teeth] British
> Spanish and Italians also dress in light fabrics, but are way more coloured
This reminds me
We had an older Spanish male giving Spanish lessons in high school
You could spot him from a mile away, especially in autumn/winter
All Estonians were dressed in their usual shades of dark brown, grey and black with an occasional beige or if you're very lucky then navy or maroon
And there he was, long grey hair waving after him, skipping around in his red pants and yellow shirt, looking like the flag of Spain, in bright primary colours
With males it is more complicated, but with females it's usually really easy
But it's more about clothes and mannerism than facial features
Russian females dress either way more feminine or, if feminine is not their thing, then way more edgy
Bolder in every sense
Estonian females prefer more casual and neutral clothes
Usually young Russian females have something that shows off their pretty figure way more, like extra skinny blue jeans that have some sparkle on them or really short dresses - both of them go with extra high heels
And long painted fingernails, several rings or other jewelry, often wear a cross (orthodox, this also applies for males and is rare for Estonians
Older Russian females have this unfortunate diamond shape (I have met only a handful of skinny old Russian ladies in my life I'm afraid), red or dark violet hair, often a lot of perfume - once again, way bolder than your usual Estonian granny
We have one that I particularly enjoy
"Sittast saia tegema" - "to make bread from shit" with is to say you turned a bad situation into a good one
And one of our previous  presidents said a quote that goes like " The situation is shit, but that's our fertiliser for the future"
Yes, the Institute of the Estonian Language, they publish dictionaries and their website which provides advice is probably visited very often, as the grammatical rules of estonian are quite hard to remember sometimes
As a small country there is a lot of pressure on preserving the language, now there is even a language inspection which seems a bit draconian if Im honest
I think Luidja beach in Hiiumaa is really nice
I liked Tõrvanina beach in Hiiumaa a lot too
What is some great music from your country that you'd like others to know about
I would say TRAD
ATTACK
, they're even underrated in Estonia
Basically mixing folk-rock-techno by using old folk songs for lyrics or sampling and ending up with pretty catchy and upbeat songs
[Pass-pass]
[Lell'o]
[Sõit]
Don't worry about the lyrics, I can't understand them either
I think they're a good representation of new age folk-pop music
How can you just snub this [gem]
We have a LOT of dialects
Almost all islands have their own dialects, southern part of our country also has like 5 dialects, so does northern
Not for anymore, because communism
We still have *some* dialects, like the Hiiu and Seto dialects, but mostly just one unified language
Not for anymore, because communism
We still have *some* dialects, like the Hiiu and Seto dialects, but mostly just one unified language
Northern Estonian (the standard version) is very unified and has almost no regional dialects except for some people on the islands switching the õ for ö, the Southern Estonian dialects (Võro and Seto in particular) are so different, that they’re pretty much unintelligible to Northern Estonians and are often considered an independent language within the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages
In saaremaa they have some type of a mix of ö and õ
I don't think anyone seriously blames Belgium or Belgians for EU problems
If anything, french and german politicians get most of the hate
And referring to Brussels is just a form of speech, same as Moscow to Russian government or Washington to US government
Tbh Lenin as a Chuvash is more of a meme
His father had oriental roots, but it's not clear what ethnicity exactly
His mother was half-jewish if I remember correctly
So he had more of a mixed ethnicity
But he never spoke chuvash and was raised amongst educated Russian class of citizens
Putin as a Finnish is even more of a meme or conspiracy, but in actuality his ancestors come from Tver region, which is close to Moscow and quite far away from Finland
He is most definitely Russian
Also Gorbachev isn't Ukrainian, though he has Ukrainian roots(but that can be said about any Russian born in south Russian region)
Quick google search shows that drinking age of 20 in Scandinavia is only for strong alcohol
Anything like beer is from 18
Well it's more like 50%true/50% meme ))
In my school, at the beginning of this year we all got to choose a new subject
Multimedia, Programming, British culture, Arabic culture and creative writing
I don't think other schools do this, may be unique to our school
OMG
I have talked about this so much in Estonia, I thought that kind of classes don't exist
We only have handcraft classes where boys do wooden stuff and girls cook and knit
But the home economics type of class is desperately needed for the new generation specially, imo
I would've been thankful if someone had taught me some of it too
The classroom looks the same but we didn't have cleaning or finances subjects
We have it in Estonia
By default it's at least in my former school only for girls except cooking which was for both but technically if boys wanted they could choose to go to that class instead
Narva and Valga
Narva was split by the soviets into two cities
Well there's the city of Valga
At first it was a Latvian city but more and more Estonians moved there thanks to the new railroad to the extent where about 80% of the people living there were Estonian
We almost went to war with Latvia for that town in 1920, thankfully it never happened
Then there's Narva
If I remember correctly, then the city had a vote whether it would stick to Petrograd governorate or join the Estonian governorate in the late 19th century
Then when the war for independence broke out both sides of the Narva river remained under Estonian control
In 1940 when Estonian Soviet socialist republic "became a member" of the USSR, they did some border adjustments where the town of Petseri in the southern Estonia was given to Pskov oblast and the eastern part of Narva, known as Jaanilinn or Ivangorod under the jurisdiction of Leningrad oblast
And generally speaking, residents tend to stick to the side of their home country
My grandparents live there, they only go to the Latvian side for cheap booze and diesel
> What always bothers me is how many people from the west think they know exactly how things worked back then
I'm ex-citizen of Soviet Union and I lived considerable part of my life in Soviet Union
I still get some western people explaining to me how life was in Soviet Union
You surrendering is mostly meme, just like that "Polish used cavalry to storm German panzerkorps"
Neither is true and usually educated people know it
This sounds as stupid as calling US attack on Iraq as Cavalry attack because 1st Cavalry Division participated
It's just stupid
Nazi Germany, Soviet Union and other participants used horse mounted troops in WW2
Also horses were used for artillery
That does not make it cavalry
They fought as infantry and used horses for transportation
Also cavalry never charged German tanks
It's stupid nazi propaganda that still gets parroted by uneducated
Where
Every source I read mentioned that this just nazi propaganda
Troops on horses were used, but they never charged tanks
Yeah definitely old leggings, tops and sweaters are awesome for home but I wouldn’t wear them outside
I mean it's not that they're not really nice it's just they are extremely comfortable
[This one] is quite popular among students, containing the lyrics "Get out, get out of the country, those who drink Estonian vodka and don't speak Estonian
Which could be seen as quite hostile to any immigrants who haven't learned the language
It's a very fun tune though
There's also a lot of partisan songs from WWII era, with explicitly anti-Russian lyrics
And a few that are outright pro-Nazi
Those aren't really sung often nowadays (especially not the Nazi ones), but some are still quite recognizable, [this] for example
With a line like "ei iial tibla ori küll eesti rahvast saa" - "the Estonian people will never be slaves of the *tibla*" ("tibla" being a derogatory term for Russians)
Estonia basically always, why
Im Estonian my country's history is full of suffering and shit
I try playing the country to either prevent that or accidentally make it worse
Ck2: usually estonia
HOI4: Germany
Vic: prussia
Eu4: hungary
Vienna, because of the culture
Always wanted to go there and try thei schnitzel
Besides Switzerland and Monaco that have been mentioned here going to Harrods in London was quite an experience, watches that cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands, bottles of wine that cost thousands as well and so much more
Cars parked outside were of course also exceedingly expensive
I felt at Monaco like how I imagine a someone from Kongo might feel like in a regular European country, the cars people were driving cost more than I have made in my whole life
I was just about to say that I saw Belgian number plate in Estonia
During the summer there are mostly Finnish, German, Russian and Dutch number plates here
"Ät" - means nothing
We don't have our own cool name, but the funkiest I've heard is Russian "sabachka" - a little/cute dog, a cute diminutive, something like "doggo".
Равлик/ Ravlyk meaning snail  is the most common name, though when used in emails, for some reason we just don't say it, it is said as "at"(like English) sometimes when in context of mentions
Another less popular way to say it is песик/pesyk meaning "little doggie", though i personally prefer the snail option
I have only heard it called "ät", but Wikipedia says it's also called "kassisaba" meaning cat's tail and "kapsas" meaning cabbage
> "Ät"
It's "ätt"!
yes
usually finland, bc im not too excited about russia and well latvia tends to suck at the sports i care about as well
I love them
I think only microstates should exist all over the world
In my opinion big countries are genocidial bullies who only want war and destruction
Of course, sadly it wont work :(. So it's ideal, but never achievable
Russia ofc
Russia
It's always the russians
Russia
We don't have a specific name for them, but there are definitely cafeterias where you can get cheap, home-style food
We say "spikker" which means a secret tool, usually a piece of paper containing info to look or write off of during a test
In addition to "spikker" already mentioned in some other comments, another (somewhat more archaic) word for cheat sheet is "puks", "(maha) puksima" = to cheat, to copy (down)
"Puksima" can also mean "to headbutt", but I'm not sure if it's the same etymology
"spikker" in Estonian, always wondered the etymology :D
From this word we also have the verb "spikerdama" - "to cheat (on a test)"
Oh we have similar word with same meaning - “spikker”
1 000 000 = miljon
1 000 000 000 = miljard (you could also call this biljon, but it's rare)
1 000 000 000 000 = triljon
1 000 000 000 000 000 = kvadriljon (nobody really uses it)
We have (or had idk) the largest precent of alchoholics per population in the world (estonia)
Pretty much everyone does it, but no one looks the bus driver in the eyes while doing it
On long distance and country side lines
I have never seen anybody saying “Aitäh” to the bus driver even he/she is the last passenger getting off the bus
Nobody talks with anyone on buses here (Tallinn)
Previously some people bought ticket from bus drivers, but since public transport became free for city citizens and everyone else uses plastic card to buy tickets, nobody talks with drivers anymore
Well, i do it atleast
Not really
I used to say less untill it became a meme, now i say it always
Not that "i knew it guy", but Im not really surprised
Never played any of their games but I don't find it that weird that a company that has huge stackes in the chinese market also follows a political stance
Blizzard bending to communists does not meak me happy
I actually like ours a lot, it looks like a frazzled flag in the wind
Tbh Switzerland, because it kina looks like an octopus in the middle of everyone else
No, it *used* to be thicc in all the right places
And even then you missed Luxembourg
Let's just hope it won't go down like the Armenians
I don't understand why Turkey is still in NATO
It has bad relations with every neighbor, including EU member Cyprus and Nato member Greece, it spits on western values, it attack US allies in Syria, seeks closer ties with Russia
They should be kicked out of Nato, any cooperation with EU, be heavily sanctioned and not allowed to start a process of rejoining until they kick Erdogan and his cronies out of the offices and get back on secular, democratic path
Their "own country" would take pieces out of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran
That's one of the reasons Turkey is invading right now
Terrorism is just an excuse
Why are you asking me these questions
Did you see me justifying Turkish actions
Higher Kurdish autonomy *is* the geopolitical reason for this
They also say "sorry" in a weird way
i dont think we bite into anything
the most commonly used expressions are "lusika nurka viskama" (to throw the spoon into the corner) or "sussid püsti" (loafers up)
When somebody is working (especially manual labor, say raking trees in the garden) and you walk past them, you say "strength
" and the other will reply "needed
Maybe it's common elsewhere too but I haven't heard about it
It's pretty much the one case where it's expected for two people to interact that don't know each-other
In addition only to maybe saying hallo in the hallway/corridor of an apartment building or when passing each-other on a forest trail
Ayy poetry club
We celebrate our national "Mother Tongue Day" on the birthday of the first Estonian poet who started writing in Estonian Kristjan Jaak Peterson
Greeting each-other in the apartment building has even survived in the Soviet blocks
But pretty strictly only in the hallways
Once you're in the parking lot or a store nearby it's more common to avoid eye contact
> How do you say the "Strength needed" part in Eesti keel
"*Jõudu
- "*Tarvis
Ida-Virumaa I suppose
It’s a county in the northeast with a large russian population
Maybe even Setomaa
It’s a small region in the South with a unique dialect and traditions
For example, every summer they elect an earthly representative of their mythical king Peko for the upcoming year
Hiiumaa the other island
For some reason being from the biggest island Saaremaa is considered cool but being from Hiiumaa makes you a hillbilly
Well, I moved out relatively young, but the general rule is that with adult kids (let's say 18 and up, could be younger) there is no problem, though one-night stands usually don't make it to your home, if there are other options
Over here, it is somewhat rare to stay with your parents after finishing high school
With teenagers, it depends on the family
Several families don't blink an eye either
In the ones that might not approve, you simply use the times when nobody is at home
[It became popular in both countries during the same time
As big as Samoa
Around 6 diffrent apples
We definitely have honey flavored cereals
Egg cups - yes
Can buy it from any supermarket
But pie birds - no, never seen them before
That's actually first truly unique thing I saw in this topic
I use it every week
Wait, some people don't have cheese slicers
I think we call them "oki doki". I'm not sure how to spell it though
Maybe it's spelled "woki doki" or maybe it's walkie talkie, when we say it it sounds childish
I think that the word "kiisu"(cat) is kinda childish and "kutsu" (doggy )
A weird thing in Estonian is we have this thing called "Little I" that makes words sound childish
When we say "kutsu" the little I goes between s and u. So it's pronounced [kutsju]
We say it in Estonian too
That's what I've been thinking about Brexit as well
The UK has historically had a very conservative stance in politics, which also explains their euroscepticism in part
But making such a monumental reform that brings massive political, economical and social changes based on a referendum won by a 4% margin just doesn't fit in here
Maybe we're all living in a simulation which started June 23rd 2016
As in several others here, we use it as a verb, so we "do sex" - seksima (-ma in the end says its an action)
Also, playful loving, although it is a bit old expression - armatsema (regular *to love* is *armastama*)
And then there are of course the coarser expressions like keppima (sticking), panema (putting) etc
&#x200B;
Edit: formatting
sex is a verb in estonian, so we just sex
or some of us do, i cant relate
We have “yellow media” for gossip news and tabloids about celebrities
And “black humour” for sarcastic dark jokes about death or other taboo topics
we call it pickle season
Wonder how many Estonians my age (17) know this
Only one person from my old class knew it, everyone else thought he was mad
Which is a bit sad actually, Lindgren's books are mint
I'd like to copy Not being poor from Norway
The cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands
Have a similar energy productsion as France aka >70% energy predused from nuclear
Salaries in countries like Switzerland and Norway would be nice
Not even joking
Also mediterranean weather would be nice too
Sometimes total obedience to rules is not good either
It leads to being too rigid and not open to change and innovation
And some rules and laws are stupid too
We actually had some oil reserves off the shore in the Black Sea but they were stolen by Russia
Happy cake day
Horilka, which is a Ukrainian word for vodka,more specifically percivka which is horilka with chilli pepper and spices, I never tasted it since I don't drink, but they say it's great
English was very easy to learn compared to any other foreign language I've studied, but I think that's mainly because of more opportunities to practice it rather than any inherent attribute of the language
No, it's actually super easy, barely an inconvenience
My native language is Russian, second language I learned was Estonian
Both are very different from English, so learning the basics of English was incredibly hard for me
Especially since it was during times when Internet and English mass media was not as easily available as today (late 90s early 2000s)
Some things in grammar that seem "easy" made it actually hard, for example - " sentence structure is straightforward "  , in Russian you can structure sentences in almost any order you want, so it was hard to learn rigid structures of English sentences (and I suck at it to this today)
You also conveniently left out articles (non existent in Russian or Estonian) and tenses (12 in English vs 3 in Russian and 2 in Estonian (present and future look the same grammatically)
English became much easier when I got access to unlimited Internet, but it mostly helped with vocabulary and idioms, not so much with grammar
this is pedantic as fuck
Be sure to max it out, though, whatever it is
>What the hell is a 401k?
Personal pension investment fund
They exist in Europe as well actually
Banks in my country offer them in additional to the main pension
They wouldn't even need that if they were just visiting
US citizens can visit EU without a visa for up to 90 days
Of completely different etymologies, I don't think there are any
But there are many [Estonian exonyms] that are noticeably different from their English names
Typically our names for cities are very similar to their original version with adjustments to better fit the language
Notable exceptions would be Cešis - Võnnu and Pskov -Pihkva
There are however many German names for our cities thanks to Baltic Germans
Here are a few
Tallinn - Reval
Tartu - Dorpat
Pärnu - Pernau
Kuressaare - Arensburg
Cannot think of really different cities and another user has already posted a good link, but some islands crossed my mind:
Swedish island **Gotland (eng) = Ojamaa (est)**
Finnish **Åland Islands (eng) = Ahvenamaa (est)** (just like Ahvenanmaa in Finnish)
Theres only one
Baltic port - Paldiski
No longer used though
Venice/Venezia is pretty different too
As is Nice/Nizza
We say Peking in Estonian too
There's Cologne which is actually Köln
What about you though
How much do you feel like an American
In Estonia:
- 1 euro: 1 liter of milk
- 10 euros: 1 mediocre meal in a regular pub and a beer
- 100 euros: monthly train pass for traveling near Tallinn ([zones I-V] about 1 hour distance trips from the city)
1€ -  A bag of chips
10€ -  A pack of pork ribs
100€ - A week's worth of food
Why would it need to include it
It's not like most people using that monthly train pass would also travel to Finland with it
Sorry, I edited the mistake
There is no nationwide ticket, only for up to about 1 hour trips from Tallinn
You can buy monthly tickets to other places as well, but these are for specific trips, for example between Tallinn and Tartu, which would cost you 213 euros
*Tallinn
And it would still be economically stupid as most people wanting to buy a monthly train ticket would *not* want to pay for the additional ferry ticket
Well, there aren't that many people who would travel to work this far daily
But there are plenty of people who would take a ride from Rapla to Tallinn for example, which is a 1 hour trip
>It's a joke, chill out man
What a lame excuse for a stupid comment
It's not exactly humour, is it
I didn't get that bad joke, sorry
At least back when I was in school, we started by doing all-caps print letters, then moved on to cursive
Cursive
Different cursive for English and also Russian cursive when we learnt that
First 2 years printed-like, then in cursive
Most write in cursive but i like tilted hybrid xd
In kindergarten we learned it like printed, beginning of school learned cursive and a few years later everyone just reverted to printed
My kiddo is in 5th grade and they still do it about the same
> I now write a kind of hybrid: block letters that I usually join within words
I write a hybrid style too
I use block letters when I want to capitalize something and then write in a style similar to what's printed
The only exceptions are a and l.
I haven't had a chance to try any, but I think I would probably like them as I enjoy most seafood
Maybe the Lasnamäe region of Tallinn
Majority of the population are Russians
It's a good place if you want to get stabbed or something
the first one i could think of is Kapa-Kohila
It's not a real place, but it sounds like one, and it's usually used to mean a place in bumfuck nowhere - aka the smallest most random town ever
"Ugh, their cottage is in Kapa-Kohila, I cba driving there every week
"You're acting like some hillbilly from Kapa-Kohila
Also I'd say Ida-Virumaa and maybe Saaremaa
It seems like Estonians like to make fun of people their not being able to pronounce õ
ÖÖÖÖÖ
I'm from Ukraine,it does look like Chernobyl
The cultural difference would be too much, it would be hard for me to integrate
The social security is much better in Europe and I would be much more comfortable with raising my kids here
My mom has spoken a bit about her births - but not to too many details
Enough to know she was hospitalized early each time, which one was born early and which one late etc
She was beside me when I gave birth so that might be one of the reasons
We are quite close with my sister, but she has never talked about her births
There isn't really anything overtly sexual about being pregnant, so it's common enough to talk about the details
Every time a new baby is on the way/has been born that's pretty much the only thing they talk about
I think nobody even asked how she is related to me
She was my rock during that emotional time, as my child's father and me had separated long before the birth
Definitely not too emotional :D
Germany - Saksamaa (derived from Saxony)
Finland - Soome (derived from Suomi)
Russia - Venemaa (from old-germanic: wened)
Sweden - Rootsi (from old-swedish: rods)
France - Prantsusmaa (from German)
There are also plenty of direct translations of the names of places, but they are not unique just directly translated:
Netherlands - Madalmaad (literally ‘low lands’)
Cape Verde - Roheneemesaared (green-cape-islands)
Ivory Coast - Elevandiluurannik (well
ivory coast)
Svalbard - Teravmäed (sharp mountains)
Russia = Venemaa
Sweden = Rootsi
England = Inglismaa
Finland = Soome
Just some fun examples
I've always wondered
why Igaunija
And now I'm wondering why cough cough hehe
Interesting fact: in Russian it is the same - Дания (Danija)
My hometown also had a cocktail bar/club/whateverthefuck called A.P.T.E.K for the same reason
There's also a bar called Kivi (Stone) so when somebody asks where you are you can say "Ma olen kivis" aka "I am stoned"
[Kalevipoeg] is our national epic
Faehlmann and Kreutzwald compiled this from legends in Estonian folklore and unified them into a whole story in a poem form
Don't know about the Latvian one, but Kalevipoeg is indeed the national epic of Estonia and probably the best answer for this question regarding Estonian poetry
Really cool to see someone know about it, really appreaciate it
That's really cool
Tbh, FIFA would be worse than Qatar if it was a country
I like Italian food over anything that is made in Northern Europe
Personally - except for some Italian food - I really dislike Southern European food, especially Spanish and Greek food
I lived in Spain for half a year and never have I had such bad food almost all the time
I guess I’ll just remain faithful to our meatballs and smoked flounder with glorious potatoes
(I do love Asian food though
I think that they can be pretty interesting
Nowadays there are a lot of nordic restaurants and I honestly quite enjoy them
Usually nordic food is very influenced by nature and earthy ingredients
From wild mushrooms to actual moss I think that generally nordic cuisine has a lot to offer
The tastes are maybe more subtle than in southern countries
Atleast that's my take
Rye and berries probs
Did Norway depart from Eurasia
Mostly it's called the *Saksa-Rooma riik* ("German-Roman State"), but *Püha Rooma riik* ("Holy Roman State") or *Püha Rooma Keisririik* ("Holy Roman Empire") aren't uncommon either
Flat-earth not so much but antivaxx and climate change deniers unfortunatelt are a thing
Ww2 is the reason we dont like russia
Ofc they have
If not for the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and WW2 in general today‘s Estonia would look very different
>It was how we dealt with the aftermath of the war
That's literally the example of ww2 affecting foreign relations
You can't separate aftermath of the war from the events of the war - even the fact that Russians aren't allies comes from events of the war(occupation of eastern europe by ussr in 1944-45)
I don't see how someone can say ww1 and ww2 didn't have big effect on how UK foreign relations are shaped
Both wars sped up dissolution of British Empire, rise of the US and UK becoming second partner in UK-US alliance
It also set up the conditions for creating NATO and EU
Yeah, russofication
>If everyone had just gone home and had a nice cup of tea
If that was the case, there would not be any consequences of any major historical events, nor there would be any wars
That's not how world works though, so events of the wars, aftermath of the war and long-lasting effects of them are all interlinked with each other
yes
and not only on reddit
i've got into many unnecessary arguments on discord because american people misunderstand the meaning of what i say
but the thing that bothers me the most, is when i'm reading a thread and suddenly everyone is talking about something that i have no idea wtf is and there's no explanation
and like other people here are saying, the whole "too focused on race" thing the americans do
tbh it sounds so obsessive
Im noticing the same thing there, I like to lurk but when I think about it there's basically nothing said there that I could see on my country
Although I do love shocking them with our fuel prices and the fact that many cars have under 100hp
Lately I've been becoming edgier when switching to English, which is weird
And Estonian names mean they're probably from around Helsinki im guessing
Small corner stores where as a kid I would buy all sorts of snacks and sweets
Bubble gums that had tattoos or stickers in their wrapping
[Candies] that were way too sour to enjoy them
Chip bags that had pokemon [tazos] in them
Small stores like that are quite rare to find nowadays
But when I have stumbled upon one, they always have these novelty candies that you can’t find in regular supermarkets
Always brings back fun childhood memories
Calm after the storm was one of the best songs in the whole competition
It was no Sandstorm but honestly that song is better than at least 50% of the crap at Eurovision these days, I'd put it in the top 20% probably actually for that year
Oh my, Tooji is like that fuckboy who has so much attention from girls that nobody has ever told him how terrible this is
We do wear a red poppy, but it's done to honour all of soldiers who died/fought for our country, it's generally connected to the Remembrance Day on 8th/9th of May and focusses a bit more on those who died in WW2 and current Russo-Ukrainian war instead of WW1
It's a fairly new tradition(which was partially introduced/copied from you in a move to distance ourselves from the previous Soviet/Tsarist symbols of remembrance/war that were (St
George's Ribbon in particular) that were coopted/marginalized in use by Russian far-right nationalists and different collaborationist terrorists since the start of the war, alongside it's usage to glorify war
Right now we use the red poppy alongside a motto/slogan stating "Never again". I personally think it's a neat new tradition as it focuses on remembering the dead instead of glorifying death and suffering
Estonian isn't a slavic language, so to have something ending in "ia" is very weird for us
We say "Tšehhi" because to us that's comfortable
We've only had this one flag lol
"kadedus" means jealousy and to be jealous, you say "kade olema"
Estonia is similar, jealousy is "kadedus"
Estonian is actually a combination of two groups of Finnic dialects:
- North Estonian dialects are actually genealogically closer to Finnish than they are to South Estonian dialects
Standard Estonian is derived from one of the North Estonian dialects and it has been adopted as the spoken language by most Estonians
The only other North Estonian dialect still spoken is the Islands dialect, which differs on specific islands
They are quite similar in their vocabulary, but they have very peculiar island-specific accents
- South Estonian dialects are rather conservative and still have vowel harmony, making them very different from Standard Estonian
Tarto and Mulgi have almost died out, but they were strongly influenced by North Estonian dialects, so they were similar enough to understand, but had a very pleasant southern and archaic sound
[Võro] is still spoken and it can be a little tough for Standard Estonian speakers to understand, while [Seto] is even more different and is very difficult for Standard Estonian speakers to understand
Yep
South Estonian is thought to be the first to branch off from Proto-Finnic
North Estonian and Finnish diverged later
That is most likely because [North Estonians speak Finnish better] due to the importance of Finnish television during the Soviet occupation
Finns often consider South Estonian more familiar because it has retained vowel harmony
The news write it as "Pfizer/BioNTech vaktsiin".  By people, it is called either "Pfizer-Biotech" (had even forgotten the N is there) or shortened to only Pfizer (that we frankly say more like *Fitser*)
I say Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, others usually say BioNTech
Estonian, German, English, Finnish, Swedish, Latvian, Spanish, and French
Yeah kiitos is Finnish, tänan is estonian ( literally: I thank )
"aitäh" is more commonly used
Also in short it is tänks which sound like thanks
Completely forgot that word exists sorry lmao
Estonia was very very good at wrestling too between the two wars, 5 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze medals between 1924 and 1936
Well considering how small Estonia is, everyone else is huge af
But to answer your question, Germany and France are really big for europe
Poland, or any non-European country of similar size
>Zurich
I have not been elsewhere in Switzerland, but I have visited Zurich \~3 times due to work
I really liked that it felt way less crowded than one would think, looking at the number of people that live there
The traffic is not awful at all, everything works like it should
I liked Bergen a lot
I must admit, I have never visited Oslo, I usually try to avoid the capitals
Binnish bemes :D :D :D :D
Well, Estonia [stores] all (and I mean *all*) data they have on their residents in Luxembourg
Toronto hosted for a long time (say 1960-2000) the biggest Estonian community abroad
The wealthiest Estonians during the Cold War lived in Venezuela
> Tartu
So it's Estonian
When reading your language, it really feels to me like our languages are related
Also one of the most memorable games in our Footballing history are against you
Isn't that what your politicians tend to call bribes
By letting the Polish submarine Orzeł crew escape from Tallinn in 1939, the Soviet Union found a good excuse to put a part of it's army on the Estonian soil
(They tought we were unable to protect ourselves, so they made us sign a pact)
Well yes, but if this incident hadn't happened, perhaps we could have defended ourselves better
English:
* 'Not at all' when replying to thank you
I have never heard anyone use it
* 'shall' for the future tense
* 'Supper' when referring to dinner, I have only seen people referring to 'fish supper' (fish and chips)
* 'Pupil' - apparently it's 'student' when kids are in school
I was taught I think circa 2007 that for future tense using 'shall' is archaic and we should almost always use 'will' instead
Quite soon after that I saw an old Top Gear episode when Clarkson said "Shall we take the Aston
" and I determined that it was bs and I shall use that word as much as I damn want
Oui oui, la souris est en dessous de la table
Definitely British English, if rumours are true she's now a head master in England
Stop acting like a complete cupboard hinge
Vienna in Estonian is called Viin, viin also means vodka in Estonian
Everywhere outside of Tallinn
Seriously though, the country as a whole is pretty sparsely populayed, but small enough that no place is really sufficiently distant to be considered "middle of nowhere".
Literally
pur whole country is in the middle of nowhere
but probably Setomaa, Vana-Vastseliina etc
Everywhere that isn't Tartu, Tallin, Pärnu or Võru really
I think closest to nowhere are the areas around the coast of Peipus as most of Ida-Virumaa and Võrumaa have stores, schools etc
while there you can expect to take a 20-40km trip to go to a store/school or use an ATM
Literally everyone moves from all around the country to the capital - Tallinn
There is some movement from Tallinn to its suburbs and nearby countryside, but it's mostly just wealthy people buying detached houses near the capital
All towns and villages outside the capital region are depopulating
The [speed signs] at [our ice roads] stretching to the islands in colder winters have a recommended middle speed limit as the middle speeds can cause resonance and break the ice - probably not for you specifically, but definitely for the cars coming after you
Also warning signs for falling icicles are quite common in Estonia
Better than discovering the back side of a sign warning of a mine field
Yet *Ice Road Truckers* always concentrates on Alaska
I guess that's one way of looking at it
But radioactive zones aren't always *that* dangerous and doubt there is that much of a quick change in the threat level once you're past the sign
With land mines, stepping on one would most likely be an instant death or a limb loss
Never heard of it in Estonia
But, apparently, we have 5 clubs playing it
Eggs
depends on the household
Milk
Well, Duh, it’d go bad in a day if it wasn’t refrigerated
Besides noone likes warm milk anyway
QWERTY with special letters of the Estonian language like õ, ä, ö, ü.
And more specifically we use the Swedish keyboard layout with some minor Estonian touches (such as the aforementioned letters)
The places where stuff like > or < or @ etc are are the same as on Swedish keyboards (i.e quite different from the English keyboard layout)
The Estonian layout:
Yeah, I have the swedish letter Å on my keyboard too but I changed it and when pressed it writes Ü. Also, how do you get the flag and country name next to your username on this subreddit
> Also, how do you get the flag and country name next to your username on this subreddit
On the right side of the subreddit (just under the join/leave button) there's a possibility to edit your "flair".
"Täitsa kena oled" you are cute
In Estonian “ I love you” translates as “Ma armastan sind”
[like this]
Yes
We are only "milk white skinned" because we don't receive enough sunlight for most of the year
As soon as we get to warmer places we get tanned just like anyone else
Same as being heavily tanned increasing chances lf skin cancer
We don't mind accents, unless its difficult to understand,  then its about not understanding what you say
I think when older people speak English with an Estonian/finnish accent, like on the news or Smth, some of us feel a bit embarrassed because rally english is a blight
It just sounds so harsh and like sandpaper to my ears xd
i dont go to restaurants often, but i dont see how eating alone could be weird
That's pretty much fancier shashlik
You lot didn't even bother giving it a proper name did you
We just call it sandwich cake
Yeah we do, Rassolnik is quite common
Estonia has 2
* Tallinn Old Town
*  Struve Geodetic Arc
Estland
I actually wrote an article about it, too
By the response I got there's plenty of people in Estonia who prefer the name Estland and would support changing it in English
Some people want the name of Estonia in English to be Estland (i.e the name it has in many Germanic languages)
Basically because it supposedly sounds less "Eastern".
I really don't like the Estonia (It's ok but strange), kinda sounds like a website for geology fans of something
Here are some variants that, in my opinion would be better:
Eesti
Estland
Igaunija (that's how latvians call this country)
Im fine with estonia, its latin
Horvaatia in Estonian
Finn
I love the name, but in Estonian it’s a bad word for Finnish people
Yeah, we usually call them Sasha
I personally don't really have any clothes with logos on them (though the [Vans sneakers] maybe do have
But clothers with logos are still commonly worn, especially Nike and Puma shirts and hoodies, also tiny logos on coats and jackets
But it is more of a sportswear thing and generally europeans dress "smarter" on the streets and don't wear sportswear unless well doing sports
So maybe that's why it seems less prevalent
An average casual look is something like [that] and [that]
>Probably not the advertisement they wanted but, you know, at least it shows their clothes are probably durable and versatile
Lol, that's a good one
Sweden
But, it was dispelled in the end of 90's when I first visited
During Soviet time I had quite romantic view of them
We're
not friends
Moi is also what Finns say and it's possible that it's a Low Saxon loan
We aren't nordic
Universal, not free
When 33% of your salary goes to social tax, that pays for healthcare, universities and pensions, it's not "free". It's just guaranteed to most of the society
We also kinda "pay" for it in much lower salaries than what you have in USA
20-30k yearly salaries are a norm even in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe it's often only 10k. 100k salaries are almost unachiavable for regular employee, not even for highly qualified IT specialists, you either have to move to leading position in a company, or start a business
Yeah, and cost of living in some poor african countries is even lower
Doesn't mean life is better there
The bigger the wage you have - more disposable income you have
Even with higher prices
And having debt doesn't always mean a bad thing
Especially if it's something like a loan to buy a house
>for what you get
Not everything we get from government is of good quality though
It's just enough to survive
Here in Estonia basic pension (if you didn't work) is like 190 euros, average if you worked for lets say 30 years is around 400ish euros
You better be saving separately or you will have quite poor retirement
Free healthcare
Well, you can wait for you doctors appointment half a year
or alternatively  you pay for it and get it immediately
>Let’s see, 33% of $40k per year
33% is only a social tax
Add to that 20% income tax and 20% vat tax on everything you buy (which makes many things cheaper to buy from american amazon or ebay, even with shipping costs)
And don't forget that 40k is a dream salary for majority of population in my country
Average is about 20k (in usd) and half of the workers get  less than 15k. So, still sounds great to you
>Perhaps, Africans have different values
I don't think civil wars, famines and overpopulation are "happy african values". Most of the population in african countries have shitty life, and it's not relative, let's not kid ourselves
>Eastern Europe
I make 10k, tax is 10%. My disposable income is 9k. Cost of living is 5k. I have 4k.
> I make 100k. Tax is 60%. My disposable income is 40k
You're the one who is simplifying
Firstly in Nordic countries tax is progressive, so 60% tax only applies to a portion of your salary above certain threshold
It's not like 60% of your whole salary is taken in form of income tax
Secondly almost nowhere the tax is 10%. In Eastern Europe income tax is between 15 and 20%. And good luck trying to live on 5k in any east european country
Maybe if you have a flat inherited from grandma and spend money on nothing other than food, it's doable
but usually most of your salary goes to rent, food, clothes,  and it's growing more if you have a family or kids
> Some people are perflecty content living in a hut for their whole lives
Oh sure
And thousands of africans who try to flee to Europe and often die in sea for it, probably just want to go on sightseeing tour, right
Also millions of east europeans who migrated to Western Europe probably just wanted to take a look at Westminster and Eiffel tower, right
> Since we are getting nitpicky, this is wrong
Only 7 countries have income tax rate of 10% and lower in Europe
14  ex-socialist/soviet countries have tax rates over 13%.
> Some don't mind having a family of 4 in a 20 sqm space because they're not you
I am pretty sure 90% of people in such conditions only do it because they have no other choice, not because they are "happy" about it
I know it, because I lived in a small flat with loads of family members, and I know people in such social circle
Almost nobody is fucking happy in such situation
>Everyone is the same
I never said that everyone are the same
I do know there are some hermits who are happy to live in a hut
But in  general people with less wealth and in more impoverished conditions are less satisfied with their lives
Migration patterns of millions of people from less wealthy to more wealthy countries (in many cases where people put their lives in danger) only confirm that
> Several are at 10 and under 15%.
But most are not
I do feel that Asia is closer to us than Africa - both in km and culturally
This might not apply to South-East Asia, but Kazakhstan and even Japan do seem familiar and surprisingly similar
But I am from Northern Europe and this is probably different in the South
When it comes to North Africa, then it is somewhat covered in history classes and social studies, but mainly in its relations to Europe
I also had the chance to study Arabic language at school and later took a course at uni, too
I do like Morocco tiles and ceramics and their cute Darija language
I know about Algeria being colonised by France (have read a lot of Camus)
Egypt plays a big role in history and is a popular tourist destination
I've forgotten most I've read about Tunisia by now and and I don't think I've ever really known anything specific about Libya
Actually, I was just discussing this fact with my friend a few days ago - that Libya is so big on the map, but that I can't really recall anything specific about it
Finland/Estonia also have a weird click with Japan, both language and culture-wise
There have been several articles about this topic, even in English like [this] and [this] from a quick google
Probably at the beginning of 20th century when we fought for our independence(estonia) from Russia
We also fought some Germans and latvians at the south of estonia
1918-1920
Fun Fact: Estonia had a lot of vikings
Most of the vikings lived in our two biggest islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa
They were very rich
Yes
Home Alone and Die Hard are shown on TV every year during Christmas
[Rullnokad ("rolled beaks")] by the way they roll their baseball cap "beak". Usually drives old BMW, drinks a lot and has lower than average IQ
Linked is a humor show making fun of them, but they are a real phenomenon
Oss
We also have a short movie about their culture:
Also ossid
I think *kalevipojad* has become more common nowadays
It is used for *gastarbeiters* that usually have some blue-collar job, most commonly in construction, in Finland (in rarer cases, Sweden, Norway etc) so they constantly ferry back-and-forth
Stereotypically, they have low education, are from a rural place, have shallow values (money, cars, women) and act annoyingly (drinking, loud etc)
Technically, Finland "has" them ;)
Finnish: Can understand sometimes, some words have a complitely different meaning tho
Hungarian: what
Two more false friends
"Raiskama" means "to spend" in Estonian (like spend money)
In Finnish it means "to rape".
"Pulm" means "wedding" in Estonian, but "pulma" in Finnish means "problems".
True
but someone still decided Hungarian and Estonian are somehow connected
Yay
Uzbek sons of bitches
Idk what that phrase means but i'd understand the Finnish version as: Elav kala on vee all (A living fish is umder the water)
Uuuh, i was close
No serious ones
Ask Russia, they apparently are very eager to "liberate" even more of our country
Similar in Estonian with "kurk", but it's only the same in nominative case, declension is different "kurk/kurgi/kurki" for cucumber, "kurk/kurgu/kurku" for throat
Definitely first with the nation, and thereafter country, then city and perhaps then county
I was born in Tallinn and i live Tallinn, but my family roots come from Hiiumaa island so I identify with Hiiumaa the most, because it's the closest to my heart, then Tallinn, then Estonia overrall
After that I identify as a finnic person and lastly european
Squirrel
>whatever the language
Estonian: *orav*
There are always exceptions
I'd say the difficulty with world is that most of the letters in that word are practically imaginary
*Orava* is the genitive form in Estonian, as well as a settlement
What country that is far away from your own, feels for some reason very similar
I know that Finland and Japan share quite some similarities and the people in respective countries are sometimes obsessed with each other
This does extend to Estonia to some degree, but it is not so big here
I personally also felt an odd connection when visiting Portugal
Now because people will come with the old "Portugal can into Eastern Europe" thing, I'll say that it's not really about anything like that
It is more about being very connected to the sea and having a certain melancholic tone in our cultures
And among all the southern places I've seen, they seemed by far the most calm, not yelling when they talk, not so focused on wild parties and drama
And small, a bit more down-to-earth, not so posh, as some bigger countries might seem
Czechia maybe
We are both very atheist and unreligious, both have high beer consumption, pretty much the same HDI, GDP per capita and democracy index
Both used to be unions (Livonia and Czechoslovakia)
That's all I can think of right now
Inside Europe from the places I've been to myself Slovakia felt quite similar to home overall
In terms of mentality of the people most of the Germanic-speaking lands are quite similar
Outside of Europe it's more tricky, from the impressions I've gotten perhaps New Zealand and parts of Canada would be the most similar but I've never been there myself

Amen, brother
Yeah, Coratia also commented the same thing

Yes
How did I forget to mention that
Thank you
The Japanese also love the Moomins, take off their shoes indoors, and the introvert-thing
And the mythology is similar
I've seen several articles, but these came right up on google atm [ and [
Basically they both have deep respect to nature and these animistic old beliefs really strong in their folk culture
They are also somewhat reserved and culturally a bit different from their neighbours
I've seen several articles, but these came right up on google atm [ and [
Yeah
Thy also both have their very own ballet style
The Russian high class used to speak a lot of French and at some point when there was political trouble, several Russian intellectuals escaped to France
I think New Zealand is a really good bet to most of the british isles
And yes, the sheep
Has to be [Taevaskoja]
We have a crossroad in Estonia where there's a sign - 2 km to Tapa city (Tapa means kill) and 21 km to Loobu village (Loobu means give up)
Also, we have a village called Litsmetsa which literally means "slut's forest".
I suppose Chornobyl pretty much sums it up
M/S Estonia
I kinda wanna believe in conspiracy theories that it was sunk on purpose by Russian spies since it had old soviet guns on the ship and they were on a route to US through Sweden
The primary reason why some of my relatives won't ever travel to Stockholm by ship
Safe to say it was a disaster for us all
Me  'im from Estonia'
Them 'Estonia
Where is that
/ Isnt that in Russia
/ Yea, i meant what country not what town
in what state is that even in
We had a little bit of snow in November
It also snowed one morning a few days ago, but was already melted by evening
Yes, but little and rarely
It can be called something like "snowish" as well
Tallinn is very cold, OK
The ground becomes slippery and icy, OK
That's all
It is too weird to experience this situation in Tallinn as well as the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe in January
Global warming and accordingly us, human being, have spoiled the balance of the Earth
And I've lost my hope to see a harder snow at the forthcoming weeks
Some coats came down but they melted the next day
Only three times
Same here
Absolutely not
No telephone shopping, no TV shopping
None
Only online oe go to the store
We are very distrusting of phone and TV shopping
Sometimes considered a language, sometimes just a dialect, Seto, aka old Estonian
Also japanese has a nice tune to it and same goes to Icelandic
My favorite language apart from the Finnic ones is English
I love how it’s a mix of both germanic and romance roots with a very distinct pronunciation
What I do not like, though, are all those very specific English accents, such as Scottish, New Zealand English, Southern U.S. English, etc
We hate russians, probably because we have to learn their language
Tip of the day: don't force people to learn gibberish languages like russian
Depends what you mean by "foreign-born" of course
Our previous President [Toomas-Hendrik Ilves] was born in Stockholm to Estonian emigres and grew up in the United States and is a US citizen
He visited Estonia for the first time in 1984, when he was 31
After that he worked for Radio Free Europe and because of that he couldn't visit Estonia throughout the rest of the Soviet occupation
He first moved to Estonia in 1996, when he was 43 years old
All pre-Soviet occupation citizens and their descendants have been provided automatic Estonian citizenship, so he was able to become the President in 2006
AFAIK, Latvia and Lithuania have also had Cold War emigres as their presidents
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president between 2006-2016 was born in Stockholm to WW2 refugees and grew up in New Jersey
As per Estonian citizenship laws he automatically received Estonian citizenship upon re-independence and became extremely prominent politically
His parents fled the Soviet "Union" during WW2
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, our 4th president, was born in Sweden, grew up in New Jersey, then later moved to Canada and then Germany
He came back when Estonia gained independence
He was Estonian, just foreign born
Before arriving, he was also Estonia's ambassador to the US and he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he finally settled in Estonia
My english teacher in 4th grade spelled sneakers as "snikers". I am wearing snickers apparently
Maybe, but school systems are different enough that it gets annoying finding the correct term in each case
Gymnasium seems to be common in (mainland) Europe and we know exactly what it refers to, so I'd go for it
Here we have the 3 king's day, all we do is take out the christmas tree
we call it "three king's day" and we don't really celebrate it, but it is a tradition to take out the christmas tree on this day or at least BY this day, and it is also the last day it is okay to wish happy new year
Only a monster would do such things
Ok german
I’d say all of Northern Europe, except for Denmark
Ai kurat, sa põder raisk (aw fuck, you goddamn moose)
When I visited Copenhagen and Arhus I felt that the Danes were talking very loudly
The shoes off part is true tho
Same in Estonia

There's a difference between nordic and Scandinavian as Scandinavian means that it's apart of the Scandinavian peninsula whilst nordic means it's in northern Europe
But uhhh
we'll see about that Latvia thing later
We have more french and british troops here and as for the question it makes us feel a bit safer
I think it's a big difference between having NATO troops over or them having an actual base here
I think that NATO is our ally not just US so I wouldn't like them to have seperate bases here
But I guess I understand the tactical reasons why they have them in Germany and so on
If we go for Slovakia then I would love to add poultry to list
Especially duck
Saddest part is I was eating it like 15 years ago passing by from Poland to Hungary and never after found this place and I'm not even sure where I was
It was more of the eastern part as I went to Eastern Hungary
> ”eww, bottled water” is a real reaction in Finland
I'd say it's the third most Finnish thing after the sauna culture and going completely nuts whenever you win at hockey
> bread I grew up with, and love
I think this is the key with bread
I love our bread and I get confused when other's claim they have good bread
For me, they rarely do
It's just what you are used to
Pierogi (pelmeen) and kefir(keefir), both are very common in Estonian households
We have some polish products
Not in Estonia
All the things that are usually sold in polish groceries in western european countries can be just  found in regular shops, so no point in having specific shops for them
The Bronz age giants in the Mediterranean( Greece, Egypt, Italy, phonetians, and China + Japan + Korea
Those nations at that time are fascinating to me
Hungary
They were the greatest power in Europe during the Middle-Ages, yet when we think of this time period, we think of Britain, France, the Vikings and Saxons, which were basically little petty kingdoms compared to Hungary
Soviet era Estonia from 1953-1980
Or pre Christian Estonia before the crusades in 12 century
Any time before year 1000
I am very curious about how Estonian language sounded back then, what the daily life looked like and what the beliefs and customs were
We don’t have much written history from that era, besides a few mentions here and there in foreign chronicles in addition to archaeological findings
So it would be fascinating
Or maybe when a giant meteorite landed in Saaremaa a few thousand years ago ([Kaali crater] I would love to see that
From a safe distance of course
Life has been pretty crap for most of the time in history so there are probably just two options for me
Mid90s because it was a crazy time here, wild music, wilder parties, people wearing tracksuits
Even if it was among the most dangerous peacetime periods of the whole last 100 years, murder rate, mafia, car crashes, all out of control
The other point would've been around 1928, the first republic era before The Great Depression came round
I'm pretty confident I could hum the Finnish anthem
Yeah, the Finnish one is quite familiar
I'll tell you when i see one
Since i live in Viimsi
Some do and some dont, cars seeming to be  the most popular way
The weirdest thing i have seen tho is a dude looking like he barely has money for clothes and shaving cream  and driving a brand new S class Mercedes
In Estonia I guess it has to be "Õnne 13". It has been running since 1993 and has aired 822 episodes in 28 seasons
A typical show of this type I guess, shows boring small town life even though it's filmed in the suburbs of Tallinn most of the time
No, but the South Estonian dialect is very strong and sounds like a small part of it is lithuanian+latvian and rest Estonian
Russification began in 19th century actually, but Soviets took it to the next level
People are "angry" at China for suppressing the language, culture and traditions of their minorities, such as Uyghurs and Mongols, but Russia has been doing it for centuries and nobody bats an eye
Time when colonialism was acceptable
Russia is systematically replacing and repressing the Crimean Tatars even in 2020
Also minority cultures are dying in Russia, as the education and government services are only provided in Russian
The only people who are preserving the Finno-Ugric cultures- and languages are old people (see Russian Eurovision entry on 2012), and when they are gone, there is nobody left to conserve these unique traditions
It's ironic when dogs like Lavrov and Putin are complaining about the "discrimination of Russians" in the Baltics, including the situation with Russian language in here
Like 5 years ago it was such a thick snow and like -30C but we'll gotta see this year
You’d earn more weird looks as a non-atheist than as an atheist
Most of the country is atheist
If someone says to me specifiacally that they're an atheist the only fear or thought that crosses my mind is that maybe they're going to start spewing some crap from a cringey youtube video which makes /r/badphilosophy look good
Religion is so unimportant in Estonians lives that it is seriously such an unimportant matter, and organized religion is sometimes looked as a big greedy business which some seriously hate
We (Estonia) are one of the most irreligious countries on Earth
So being an atheist is kind of a default option
People will be far more surprised if they find out that you do variuos religious things and go to church often
Easter and Christmas are still celebrated by most though, but it is more of a cultural thing nowadays than religious
Same here
one celebrity called her a mushroomer from an estonian island (for her casual outfit), but that got quite a bit of backlash, so idk if it counts as a joke
oh, she also kind of looks like Jungkook from BTS, but that one is obviously not a common one either
i suppose the one we do have jokes about is the prime minister, whose only purpose seems to be apologizing for the actions and words of the members of the other ministers
he is also notorious for not being able to give a straight answer, to the point where someone created a "round answer generator" that generates answers that dont actually answer the question, but sound like they do
Her god damn pointy ass nose and her hair (Kersti Kaljulaid)
Our prime minister Jüri "The apologizer" Ratas, we have a far-right populist party in our goverment along with a center/bit leftist party where Ratas belongs to
And the leaders of EKRE are constantly saying sketchy shit and Ratas has to apologize for them
The whole situation reminds me of a sitcom
"Went to the store and accidentally stepped on an old ladies toe, I was about to say sorry but thankfully Ratas was already there" and so on
He's a joke himself, being an ex-comedian
Generally with an S, but many Estonians make it a point to pronounce it with an Sh, but it sounds a bit pretentious as does the "over-pronunciation" of other foreign place names, especially well known city names
Learning Finnish as an Estonian is quite easy too
They have guns, yes
I remember one time when someone was shot, they were running st the policeman with a knife or something similar
Special units like K-Komando, comparable to S.W.AT
, use assault and battle rifles too
Is it true that the Swedish police uses horses
Every time estonian police uses firearm, it is most important news for a week
It is that rare event
That is why police used soviet era crappy makarov pistols until very recently (2017) - police did not complain because they used firearms only in shooting range
So - yes, the are carrying but there is sooo much paperwork when they happen to unholster it
we were taught the same
Tallinn is notoriousily pro-car
I think the little strips on the side of some roads are ment for bikes but other than being not marked, very narrow and not seperated by anything other than some pain on the pavement they also arent designed to be navigated in a logicaõ fashion
The end abruptly etc
I don't know how some are brave enough to try and cycle in 9 lanes of traffic so most just use the sidewalks if at all
My family gatherings are usually pretty boring but sometimes my grandpa drinks too much and starts talking about some random stuff and it's actually pretty funny listening to him
And he always talks about a time in the russian army when a loose propeller cut some dudes head off
"Sai sai
" "Sai" can be a very common thing to hear in Estonian considering that it means "did (someone) get the bread
" "Yes" note that the person getting the bread is unknown so it could be anyone but it's typically either you or we in this specific situation
It works the same way here in Estonia too
In Estonian it's the same though

Would add to this list

I thought of adding him to the list, but I didn't think that he was that historical since he was the president  just 20 years ago
I'd say it's a beautiful language, although it doesn't particularly strike out for that quality
It does seem to have sort of a very "round" pronunciation, which I think is an odd quality when it comes to languages
As for vocabulary, I like how much technical variability English has, while the grammar on the other hand doesn't allow for as much variance as Estonian
The stupidest quality it has of course is its nonuniform spelling, which often doesn't make any sense at all, aside from the etymological perspective
English is way better for scientific texts in my opinion
>  not the ugliest language around
Funny, for me personally it is French
[Here] is a good example of what English sounds to foreigners
Lots of other languages have more concrete pronunciation
Not necessarily rougher (like someone stereotypically pronouncing German as if everyone was an SS soldier kind of way), but still more concrete
French is also similar in that sense and a large reason why English sounds the way it does, especially if compared to other Germanic languages
French takes it to a new level though, it's not so much of a "round" pronunciation, but just hasty in the sense that it mashes everything together
We have this issue too, l communicate in English so much that most of my conversations with some Estonian friends are done in English too
The word knight comes to mind as a good example of a word that was pronounced very differently
I think the sound of our language is actually quite different, some dialects sound more like Finnish than standard Estonian
Nah, the virus isn't that big of a problem here, most people forget it exists even
It's hard to say
Even if we narrow it down to what you specified ...it's still pretty vague
Graduated from uni
Well, average graduate salary varies from 1200 eur to over 2000 eur depending on a university and field of study
Rents a flat
Well, you can rent for as low as 250 eur a studio or room in a flat, or you can splurge a 1500 for some fancy big flat in city center
But if you really want an average
Average net salary is around 1200 net
Average rent for flat ...I'd say 450
Add to that bills, groceries and assume no car - let's say another 250 eur
Plus some 100 eur on irregular purchases
So theoritaclly, if you live within your means, but not super-frugally, you can save up 400 eur a month with an average salary
In practice ... I have no idea how much anyone saves
Approx 500€ (wider guess 300-700) a month
I'd think that an average graduate would earn 1300-1400 (after tax) in the first year after graduating, though the full range is of course very wide, some jobs can earn you twice as much, some might get you stuck at 900
Average rent for a 2-room apartment would be from 350 to 450, with most options being 400-450
But if you have bought an apartment the loan payments could be quite a bit smaller
Everything depends on how much you spend on food, fun and heating etc, but it's an estimate
At what age can people start uni
In Estonia you are 19 if you start uni right after high school and as Masters takes minimum 5 years it is basically impossible to finish uni before 24
Most people take a year or two off (during or in between their studies to study abroad, travel or work) and several people change their speciality at some point, so usually people graduate Masters while aged 25 or 26
So this seems quite young
Damn, I'd be broke very fast if I spent so much on food everyday :D
Oh, this is interesting
In Estonia it is rather rare to do bachelor and not do a masters nowadays (they are considered more of a drop-out than a degree, influenced by the fact that before adopting the Bologna system our bachelor took 4 years to do, so a lot of people have 4-year degree and the 3-year one is considered a bit too basic)
On the other hand, having a part-time job while doing masters is also common
This mentality can really be stressful for Greek students
Then again, this really long uni study here means that people have less children than they want to, cause time runs out, so at least you guys won't die out at the same rate as we do :D
Then all the foreigners would be confused, everyone would be talking võro
You can drive through our whole country in 3-4 hours
So the life will return to normal course in less than a day
But for a few weird hours there will be a lot more people at the latvian-estonian border as all of 400k residents of Tallinn will appear there
Pretty sure there's no difference
1) I have no idea as I finished school in Soviet Union
2) I'm not that old yet and I still have functioning brain
So, no I have no nostalgia whatsoever
There may be some golden nomenclatura children who feel nostalgia
I have not met one as I don't know any
I move around regular people circles
3) Our ancestors were freed from slavery 1865
I havent go to it yet but i can say for certain that people have nostalgia for tgeir childhood not communism
The only people, that are nostalgic about the Soviet Union in Estonia are very old Russians
I can see how this might be different in other post-Soviet states like Ukraine, Belarus the Caucasus states and even some parts of Latvia due to the different economic situation
Afaik and have heard, Estonia had it a bit more mellow during the soviet times
I personally haven't heard anyone missing it but I also wouldn't say that my parents stories are filled with horror, everyone basically managed to live
All the horror stories are mostly from the WWI, times were much more difficult then, especially with the deportations
But I can imagine that maybe some old russians in Estonia are missing it a bit
As for estonians i haven't seen a single person that could forgive or look past the horrors
I've heard alot of stories from old people (even old Estonians) that they miss the soviet union and how everything was in order then, for example Edgar Savisaar one of the people who helped us get our freedom said a few years back when he visited Russia that there was more order and everything was "nice"  back then
About schools i guess we learn about it from top to bottom which makes most of Estonian youth dislike Russia and communism
Official soviet history has not died out - it is alive and well in Russia
Lavrov is bringing it up quite often
The main part is that Baltic states asked Soviet Union to join
(Which happened after SU had its armed forces in Baltic states and had organized general elections with only communist party candidates
But that part was omitted
The mass deportation of 1941 was explained as evacuation of civilians because of war
Most destruction of cities in 1944 was blamed on nazis
But mostly it was repeating over and over the glorious parts of soviet era - revolutions (1905, 1917 february and october)
Great Patriotic war (world war II on eastern front) and victory
"And then Russia invaded us (again)"
Al dente is the best
Being quite open about nudity
Like going to the sauna naked together or not having little changing booths inside the changing rooms
The graveyards are so pretty during Christmas/New Year's Eve
So many candles in the darkness
All the graveyards look pretty much like this:
(No snow on these pictures though
You usually won't break your skull on a Dutch granny's bike
Road biking and MTB'ing are quite different in their nature compared to commuting in the Netherlands (actually statistically in the Netherlands cyclist who wear helmets have more injuries - because they generally ride in a riskier matter)
It would be such a silly concept for Estonian
Most people know how to spell well enough and the difference between people would be rather arbitrary
English has a very nonstandard spelling, while Estonian spelling is more or less uniform and follows pronunciation very closely
There are only a few exceptions to it and most people would know them by heart
The youngest "real word" I could find was demarche even though I can't recall ever hearing it out loud
Prime minister (the one how has power) is chosen in the parliamentary election, where the party or parties who have the most seats become the government
For example, last election reform party got tha majority of votes but didnt form a government since they couldn't get a coalition
President is chosen by parliament
I don’t think there’s much pressure
It’s quite common and normal to be single and be focused on your career instead
In fact, I would say that way more pressure and emphasis is put on your career achievements, rather than creating a family
By the time one is in their late 30s, they are expected to be successful in their career
Besides, you wouldn’t want to have kids, unless you can provide them an economically stable and secure home
There is definitely a generational difference in this matter
In my circle of friends, it’s seen as a bit weird when someone marries and has children in their twenties
Whereas, it was the norm for the older generation to settle down and have children in their twenties
So it is quite common that parents and grandparents keep asking when will you be showing them your partner (if you don’t have a girlfriend/boyfriend yet) or when will they finally have their grandchildren (if you’re already in a relationship)
But they do it jokingly, rather than judging you for doing something wrong
I also haven’t noticed any difference between the attitude towards men or women
At least in my experience
If anything, women put pressure on themselves, since we feel like there’s a limited time window for us to do family planning
For example, I personally feel quite anxious sometimes when I think that I’d like to have a family one day
Due to biological limitations, I would have to plan it for my mid/end-thirties
But for that I would have to meet my soulmate within the next few years, which seems quite impossible since I’m so focused on my career
If I pass that window, I would probably have to consider adopting instead
yadi yada yada
No one else has put the pressure on me
Just me worrying about how to balance my career and personal life goals
Estonia is really small but
Tallinn our capital mostly low iq people
Tartu very educated people since its a university town
Eastern Estonia dibla dibla and dibla
Islanders think they vikings Vikings
South-eastern Estonia is like another country
It is **awesome**! We sometimes even do daytrips just like 100-200 km across the border (to see some new areas, buy some different products and just be in a different-language-speaking-area) and weekend getaways are very common both via car or plane (unfortunately, the railway system is not suitable for long-distance travel at my end of EU, but in the south they use it a lot)
Oh my, you really made me miss tiny travelling like that
Damn covid
Usually it makes no difference
It's not like I'm going to Sweden or Russia on a whim
Flights to cool places in Europe though are short and you can go to Latvia for cheap booze
Otherwise it's normal I guess
Especially for border regions, it can be just a strategical choice once in a while to visit the other country and buy products that are cheaper there
if your neighbouring country has cheaper grocery stores, you can save a decent amount by just shopping there
Where's this
Tornio
Yeah, my parents live 5-6 hours drive from me and have visited my place 3 or 4 times in the 10 years that I have lived here
For them, 40+ km is a long ride
At the same time, some of my friends casually drive 1500 km for a small trip and 200km on a daily basis
So it really depends
I've heard that in most countries people don't wear a [reflector] on their outdoor clothes for half a year like [that] No idea if it's true, though
Over here you get a fine, if you don't.
[This immediately comes to mind] Jokes aside I did notice a crazy amount of different types of beer glasses in Flanders when I was there
Oh one of those, we call them 'soome kelk' for fairly obvious reasons
Not very common either, mostly just left over from the the end of the last century, rural people probably still use them sometimes
I won one of those at a little contest six years ago, I think I've used it maybe once, otherwise it's useless
You buy sliced cheese, duh
Oh, we used to have similar ones like this:
Yup, most of November to March it is still dark when you go to work/school and already dark when you go back home
I've seen [similar] ones
Not very widespread though
Oh my god I read that totally wrong and I was proper confused
I read 'sink' as the Estonian word for 'ham' instead of well the kitchen sink
They are way too big for it to be suitable
If I was in a beer hall in well Bavaria it would make sense because I wouldn't want to get up to get a new beer too often
Yeah, over here there are several more stylish options for those who do not want to add a simple circle with some logo to their clothing, like a brooch [here] or [here] or a [tassel] or [animal characters] for younger folk (these were really popular to have on school bags)
Still better than having Soviet era high-density residential areas
The [Lasnamäe] district is notorious in the sense of low-quality Soviet era housing
Part of the problem is also that the Soviet occupation ended when this district wasn't fully completed yet
I mean, it would probably still look bad considering that it's all built on a low-vegetation limeston tabletop area, but it looks especially bad because it was never fully completed - it's not like anyone invested into new housing in the early 1990s and after that nobody had the incentive to improve this area
Western Estonian medieval towns are all beautiful
And Lihula is actually a town, it has the highest EKRE-voting share of all Estonia
And Russians
Don't get me wrong, Lasnamäe is definitely the worst of them, while [Annelinn] is comparably similar in Tartu
[Väike-Õismäe] is also quite bad, but some others are slightly better, like [Mustamäe] or [Pelguranna] even though they partly have older [still Soviet era] buildings
It has lagged behind Lasnamäe actually - at least Lasnamäe is being improved, but Väike-Õismäe is already too dense
Old cities are mostly new cities with old historical centres, i.e. old towns
These old towns are from different historical eras of course, so I can only speak of life in the medieval Tallinn Old Town, where many houses are from the 14th century
One of the main problems is plumbing as there is no room for proper plumbing inside the walls
You can see the problems in old town pubs for example where the toilets are often clogged
The houses can also have rather ridiculous floor plans due to their medieval nature
Have a look at the floor plan of [these apartments] for example
The courtyards can be pleasant though as they are often closed and private, although they aren't very practical due to being narrow and not getting much sunlight
Another problem is parking and access of course as much of the old town is a pedestrian area with limited vehicle accessibility
Nearest parking lots can be quite far and there are only enough legal parking spots on the street
In winters with more snow, the regular parking spots are often filled with excess snow piles and they aren't always removed in time
More about winters, the old town can get crazy slippery in the winter with its cobblestone streets and narrow and high sidewalks with often rather uncomfortable angles
Also, as the sidewalks are very close to the buildings and most houses have gable roofs, icicles are easy to form and they are a constant threat in the winter especially in the old town
Also, as the old town has many pubs and restaurants, it really isn't the calmest place to live - very few locals would actively look for a place to live in in the old town
>Old houses and flats have terrible insulation
I don't think it applies to all old buildings and it does apply to quite some new buildings as well
During the plastic-and-gypsum era of \~2000 the houses built here often had internal walls that are just a layer or two of gypsum and doors of papier-mâché, so you can basically hear people breathing in the other room
Old stone houses with wooden doors on the other hand
>5 floors no elevator building
Over here even modern ones don't have an elevator with only 4-5 floors
Besides, exercise is good for most folk, because most folk is fat, not paralysed
Interesting, over here it's the other way around: most old apartments have a height of  2
80 to 3
50, whereas most modern apartments are 2
40-2
>from 1900-1920
At least it's a glorious era
I really like buildings from that time
Ah, an alchemic
We had very common St Martin's Day and St Catherine's Day traditions that survived well into the 1990s. They were very similar with Halloween as kids would go door to door and ask for sweets
The difference was that they dressed up as bums or wanderers as the tradition comes from a former obligation of every parish to support their poor in times of need
> May Day is fuck all but a day off work these days for most in Britain
I didn't realize it was supposed to be something else
Well we have a place called "Põrgu küla" which means "hells village" and "Pulli küla" my best translation would be "tomfoolery village"
There's a duo of islands
One is Väike-Pakri (Small Pakri) and one is Suur-Pakri (Big Pakri)
"Small Pakri" is bigger
We also have a village called [Laeva] ("of the ship") which isn't anywhere near any major waterways
ok american
..I think a look at your country is a great example of why we should preserve lingual fragmentation
Most of the time and most of the people, yes
(I am a phd researcher at the moment and therefore don't count, as this means that it is pretty much my job to be stressed and work fullnighters)
Regarding a comparison with the 90s - stuff has changed somewhat, yeah
First, you were not able nor expected to work from home in weekends or beside office hours 25 years ago the way it is now
When you closed the office door, it was over
It ain't so any more, most of my friends check their work stuff on their phone like at least twice every evening after work
And then there is the cultural drift, as countries become more and [more individualistic] including that family is less of a priority over work than it used to be and people are in a way more alone than ever
I can see how these factors can affect mental health and this in turn can influence stuff like meals and sleep
But still, I don't think we can accurately recall the 90s as we ourselves were not in the same position 25 years ago
Halloween
Its still not a thing amongst older people  but most of the youth celebrates it
We only have towns, but I'd think that the most different is either [Kuressaare] that just looks a bit different being made of houses that have [white limestone walls & red roofs] way more than others (the island also has a bit different history than the mainland) or the capital [Tallinn] that has more [soviet vibes] and also more [modern vibes] than the rest of the country, let alone the [medieval old town]
I think that the most typical one could be any of Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Haapsalu, Võru, Paide
They all have these 3 most popular types of buildings: different [wooden houses] from 1880-1940, private houses from [1940-1960s] and a small [soviet district] (in small towns, they can be pretty green and liveable)
You wouldn't consider smt like Narva or Kohtla-Järve the most different considering they're majority Russian
I was thinking more about what towns look like, but population-wise, yes they are very different
And Kohtla-Järve also looks very soviet, but I simply forgot about the place or well that it's a town and not an *alev*. As a lot of the pretty old town of Narva was bombed town, this also looks a bit more soviet
So yeah, the contrast between Narva and say Viljandi is really very big
> Bielefeld
Wouldn't a good example need to actually *exist*?
It shouldnt, its oir secrect language
Plus you guys couldnt even learn it
Few examples from Estonian:
Kuuuurija (moon ivestigator)
Töööö (working night)
Jäääär (the edge of ice)
To be honest, all Finno-Ugric languages are very hard
Hungarian has 18, Finnish and Karelian 15, Estonian 14
fuck no, we'd have to teach so many people and the language is HARD
plus i want to keep my secret language for talking behind others backs :D
estonian too, but i would argue german isnt phonetic because they have some noun combinations that are pronounced differently
yeah, i mean those
and i guess you are right, there arent many
Saving the Latvians in 1919 and 1920
Maybe we should have let them declare war on us, then immediately surrendered
I mean, the French get a lot of white flag jokes but at least nobody claims their country has no legal continuity with pre-1944 France
Still probably wouldn't have made much of a difference other than having slightly fewer internet trolls to argue with, and on the negative side it might have led to even harsher repressions on the people for having resisted
So yeah we were kinda screwed either way
Cold - 20

This but everything is 5° hotter
Mostly agree, I'd say 5 to 15 is nice and okay
25+ and I can feel my brain slowly melting inside
I live at 59 and for me there is nothing really
I guess im used to it
Living at 59°56’N. It’s not that bad here
The sun rised at 09
10 in the morning today and set af 3
19 in the afternoon
You get used to it and I also like the cozy atmosphere in the december nights, where everything is dark, but you can see the lights shining from every house
I have a horrible sleeping schedule so i pretty much don't see the daylight at all
reflectors and the enjoyment of the dark really help
How Norse-influenced was ancient Estonia (pre-13th century)
Estonians, especially Saaremaa islanders, were known raiders and also pillaged Scandinavia at times
Also the gods in especially Saaremaa were named similar to "Thor", but there also existed local, Estonian pagan gods
So there was the pantheon of Estonian gods, but also an influx of Norse gods, so it's rather difficult to explain the actual religious situation in Estonia during that time
>Like, how did proto-Iranian loan words creep into Finnish independently from other Indo-European languages
It's really not [that complicated]
I heard that before coming the north we were at the coast of the black sea and then we split up Finns went to Finland and Estonians to Estonia
And our genes resemble the original Europeans more than Germanic and other people not Mongolian which was also a theory before hitler did the race research thing
Also, a clue into the origins of Estonians and Finns might be in linguistics
North Estonian is genealogically closer to Finnish than it is to South Estonian, so the Finnic people probably splintered in Estonia first and only then did Finns migrate onwards
Most likely especially insular and coastal Estonians were very strongly integrated with Norse people, either on good terms or bad terms or really both
The inland regions saw less Norse influence, but it was probably some kind of a mix everywhere
Either case, our Nordic/Northern identity has very old roots - it's definitely older than subjecting it to Internet memes would suggest
I'm not saying the ones that came later are any less European
Oh god, I can't do it for Tallinn
Each district should have its own song honestly
There is always a lack of doctors (GPs in particular) and teachers, also nurses and caretakers
Actually, being a teacher is a too-often-overlooked option
Think about it, almost 3 month summer vacations and no 9-17 work hours
I think positions of middle school teachers for physics, chemistry, biology and languages other than English are often vacant
IT and communication, finance/economics, energetics, law
These are top paying fields
>is about 900/m, well above national average
Uhm, isn't net average wage in Lithuania almost 900/m?
A type of farmhouse called "rehielamu", which combines rooms for drying and threshing crops with living quarters under the same roof
Incidentally the concept of "rehi" (a specialized building for the aforementioned crop drying and threshing) itself seems to be confined to North-Eastern Europe - I can't even find an English translation for it
That when people say bread they mean white bread
Turns out that black or rye bread isn't that popular everywhere
Also obligatory bagged milk (there are others, Canada
We don't translate those names in Estonian either
Åland Islands are awesome
It's quite easy to visit from Estonia, one just needs to hop off the Tallinn-Stockholm ferry during the night
They are a fantastic site for a bike trip - I did like a week long trip and visited over 60 islands
We have 2 or 3 pairs of bigger orange Fiskars scissors, honestly they seem to show up everywhere so I have no clue how many pairs we actually have
Not only English but pretty much the whole world
French - abricot
Spanish - albaricoque
Italian - albicocca
Russian - Абрикос (abrikos)
Swedish - aprikos
Estonian - aprikoos
Japanese - アプリコット (apurikotto)
Probably a wrap or some cheap [slimy burger]
Pretty much
*Lägaburger* or *lögaburger* ("slimy burger") is this cheap and simple style of hamburger usually made in the countryside and poorer suburb kiosks at night, when there's really nothing else open anymore
You know, in kiosks that have been there since mid 90s at least
It tastes fine if you're drunk, but it's really just cold cabbage salad with mayo in the middle of a burger with buns as soft as the belly you get after eating it
Do not forget to drink those four beers beforehand
I was searching for a photo and found this, so the comment seemed suiting
Nobody really advertises it under this name, it's just the colloquial name by Estonians for this burger
It goes by either *lägaburger* or *lögaburger* or sometimes *rotiburger* ("rat burger")
Abbreviations like *lägaburks*, *lögaburks* and *rotiburks* are also common
The slang word *roti-* ("rat") is used for whatever is cheap, gotten for free or flat out stolen, especially if it's of low quality
Must be the [Toompea Castle] in Tallinn, currently housing the Parliament of Estonia
I think the [Tallinn TV tower] Northern Europe's highest open viewing platform at 314 meters or 1,030
2 feet
I would say the most iconic building is the [Tallinn Town Hall] which is located at the heart of the old town
Toompea Castle is a good one, I'd also say Tallinn Town Hall (Raekoda), but only if we can include the Town Hall Square (Raekoja Plats) with it
i would agree, but tbf i only spent a day in prague anyways
Yep, although I'd say it's more like a symbol for Tallinn than for Estonia in general
Never liked raw meat and I am more of a cat person than dog person
Guess I am not a true European then, lol ))
Also, isn't raw meat dishes a big thing in Asian countries
I would like to note that illegally entering Chornobyl exclusion zone will get you a small fine of about 15 euros as well as deportation from Ukraine (usually followed by a ban to enter the country for 3 years)
* ?-1227 - though there wasn't really an unified Estonian state at the time, so not sure if that counts
* 1918-1940
* 1991-present
Hard to call this time free when the territory of Ukraine was divied between multiple factions waging war against each other
Estonia and Latvia, yeah
You guys had the Grand Duchy
Sorry but how do you even compare it with Riga
Even Helsinki is more similar to Riga than Tallinn
Tallinn is centered around a medieval walled old town which itself is rather picturesque but rest of the city was nothing more than a poor province for much of its history and it shows
Riga was historically the metropolis of the Baltics which is why it's still the biggest city and also looks way more cosmopolitan
Similarly to Helsinki, it has dense Art Nouveau quarters in the centre, something that Tallinn almost completely lacks
The Old Town is extremely overpriced, locals almost never eat/drink there
I suspect you spent your money there
not that special, but i once had a couple of asian tourists ask me where the stop for the tram number five was
there is no tram number five
i told them about other ways to get to their destination, but they didn't really want to believe that the trqm line doesn't exist
felt kinda bad for them tbh
i don't even know
i mean, i don't think i have ever been taught about fridges existing in other countries, i just kinda assumed they exist elsewhere too
astonishing how close-minded people can be
> Who is doing the police stuff in your countryside ?
Just regular police throughout the whole country
Military police is only reserved for small amount of tasks like escorting miltary convoys
The word "saks" in Estonian, meaning "noble or upper-class person", comes from the same root as "sakslane", the word for German, because Estonia was ruled by German nobles for several hundred years
The capital city "Tallinn" was named when Denmark used to rule Estonia
"Tallinn" sounds similar to "Taani linn", which means "Danish city"
Tartus old estonian nane was Tarbata and was related with taara who is one of the gods in the estonian pantheon
We really only have one good university: [University of Tartu] It’s a pretty nice university and part of the top 2% of universities worldwide
[Most of Estonia] *speaks* Standard Estonian already
The few dialectical areas that remain have rather distinct dialects usually too difficult to understand for Standard Estonian speakers, but they then switch to Standard Estonian as they all speak it as well, except for perhaps some very old people deep in the countryside
Some areas where Standard Estonian is spoken with different intention/accent, do not necessarily conform (islanders in particular), but they are easy enough to understand
Bottle deposit and recycling system
That you pay a small sum on every bottle bought and you need to return them to a recycling machine to get the money back
For a union that likes to pride itself on economic integration and environmental awareness, we've somehow just forgotten to make the best of such simple everyday problem
Why is every country building its own isolated system and how come not even all countries use it
If I buy a bottle from Finland, I should be able to return it in Estonia and get my deposit back
If the uneven rates are a problem, harmonize them
We forget that the bottles are at a higher risk of ending in nature if the deposit scheme malfunctions
That you have to own a reflector
Phone charger plugs
I would love to finally have single market
>use one EU-wide-system
I guess that's basically what [aghcsiz] wanted
We already have common border and currency systems that include majority of EU countries, that limits the powers of countries, so why not go with common car registration system
what do you mean savage land, organic waste brown and paper green is the only correct way
Varenyky, you make them with various fillings but regardless of what's inside it's iconic to eat them with either sourcream or some fried "salo"(pig fat aka reversed bacon) bits called "shkvarky"
I don’t think we have invented anything on our own, but we eat pelmenis and tortellinis and the like
Pelmeenid
Fun fact
Pelmeni were invented in udmurtia and it means ear bread in komi
Managing to buy your beer from the store before 10 PM when alcohol sale becomes prohibited
It's especially fun if you get to the store at 9:55 PM and there is a line
Can't drink more after you've run out
And if you run out, you're either shit at planning or have already had too much
So that drunk people couldn't buy more alcohol in the middle of drinking
Basically for closed container sale
Bars and restaurants have to open the container when they sell you alcohol after that time
Somewhere warm where there aren't so many creepy spiders or snakes

Very similar to the Finnish one, except the 3rd line is a bit different at the end
Another question on top of OP's, how do you start the game
In Estonia it's common to say in choir "kivi, paber, käärid, 1, 2, 3" (rock, paper, scissors, 1, 2, 3) before making your pick
We have the good old rock, paper, scissors (kivi, paber, käärid)
Although, me and my friends would sometimes invent new additions to make it more fun
For example, an eagle that would fly and grab the paper, but you could take it down with rocks or scissors
One Trump lackeys called us "suburb of st
Peterburg".
Famous French politician told  that "we missed perfect opportunity to shut the fuck up"
These people are very affected by external influences and probably would be less inclined to vote for the best interest of the country they live in
I'm young and i never lived in the regime
But heard about it from my grandpa
He lived next to a military airport in Tartu Estonia and he saw Russian pilots crashing their planes cuz they were drunk
Most of the building next to the airport had cracks in them because of all the vibration
But talking about the family, they didn't support the communist party thanks to that they didn't get a decent job and didn't get the permission to buy a car
Also if u had friends at the store they would put weiners under the counter for your family, that's because most of the shelfs were in empty
This stuff happened untill the collapse and some years after it
Nagu tina tuhka – like tin into ashes
Gone/lost forever
Well
most of Estonians know atleast some Russian so we're pretty okay in Russia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland
When going up, some kinda manage to get by in Finland but in Sweden we're screwed without English
To some extent I can get by in Finland
Besides Estonian I’m also fluent in English, German and Spanish so obviously I can also get by in these countries
Knowing German has also helped me a lot in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, I doubt though that I’d be able to get by simply by knowing German
I was just in Tallinn recently and was surprised how many signs/ads/etc there are in Finnish, especially near the port
I think, youd have a good chance on the islands as well
>Besides to countries that share your mother tongue (i.e. Germans in Austria)
Yea
Just drove from Estonia to Hannover Germany and back
It's really nice that u don't have to worry about hiding the drugs
Jokes aside it's pretty comfortable
Estonia joined Schengen in 2008, so there are still some remnants of border infrastructure
For example there's only 3 places where you can drive from Valga to Valka - where the checkpoints used to be
There's no actual infrastructure though, you just drive straight through
my granny lives near the border and casually goes grocery shopping in latvia
there's basically no checks, only the old border control buildings by the road, but they no longer work as border control and everyone just drives or walks by
or goes alcohol shopping in them
I have ended up in other countries without noticing
1752 Km(1082 miles) and on paper it says 17h 52min but I'm sure it took more
We slept in Riga and Poznan
Also there's a faster way to do this aswell with a car
You take a ferry to Sweden and from there to Germany
The cheapest fuel was i think in either Lithuania or Poland
The best roads were in Western Poland tbh
The most fun is when u get home and u can finally sleep
Well i actually had fun at the Agritechnica aswell (it's basically like a E3 for farming machines
The most horrible traffic was in Berlin downtown, their traffic system is so weird and doesn't seem coordinated at all
Thanks for this warm story
I hope u can still travel but maybe in the passenger seat
Oh we don't do any farming
We sell the equipment
My dad has a dealership here in Estonia
So he went to meet with the other salesmen and some important people to make some deals and talk about expanding the sales to other baltic countries
He's on his way to Phoenix Arizona to go to one company's 70th Birthday
Pc has some awesome artwork and my phone has a slightly nsfw picture of my gf
Never thought my little country would make anyones list haha
May I ask how we made the list ?
Well I'm glad to hear that =D
waffles
the flag, and then Brussels for the political importance
My Dutch friend telling me that they can't drive
Finland
I cant recall any jokes about finns
do u have any examples
i thought we mostly joke about russians and germans because of all the "estonian, german and russian
" jokes
and maybe latvians too because 6 toes and "s" at the end of every word
They usually are about how Finns are slow and dumb alcoholics
[Here are a ton of examples
Finnish is just drunken Estonian
Nice
ty, gonna have a nice night reading these
Never heard of that
Have fun
i think about 22 degrees is the norm here, but i have no idea what the tem is right now for me
maybe 23-24 since im sitting near the heater
How old are you now
Tartu, Estonia - often take long walks alone, including at night
Never had any threatening encounter
Fortunately violent crime against strangers is not a big concern here, the worst that might happen is some drunk students trying to start shit
depends on the area, but i personally have walked home from Tallinn city centre to a suburbian area (approximately a 1
5 hour walk
) at about 4 am to sober up from a party during summer, twice without any issues
i also frequently walk my dog alone late at night, but for that i keep to the suburban areas
i am a young adult woman
if i told my family they'd scold me though
idk i think its a lot about knowing the area and keeping to the bigger streets that have lighting
I live in 2 places, Peetri and Jüri
One is a more urban and the other is a more rural place
You can walk around at night casually in both places and nothing will happen
However, in places like Kohtla-Järve, you wouldn't even step outside in the evening
Same for me, feels very safe at night
Tallinn certainly has a reputation of danger in the smaller cities especially Lasnamäe, Kalamaja, Kopli and to a lesser degree Mustamäe.
oh def, i'd probably be much more cautious there
but city centre/old town, nõmme, kristiine, haabersti, maybe even pirita (idk dont have much experience there) are pretty safe in my opinion
and in mustamäe i feel relatively safe walking on main roads as well, because i am familiar with them
i think the sense of safety has a lot to do with how well you know the area, hence why i said it depends
I remember reading once in the news that on Midsummer's Eve in Poland over 20 people died in car crashes
Helsinki feels as safe your own neighbourhood in my experience
I'm sure fairly narrow rural roads with trees acting as barriers all around have something to do with it too
Biggest one is the peace treaty we signed here,
The finns also signed one here, tartu has also been destroyed multiple times over
See= this

Just be polite and respectful
And don't act offended if things in the country you're visiting work differently from your home country
That's really all what's needed
Eh In my personal opinion it's fine to be the "annoying tourist" here bc we only get like 2 tourists every week here in Estonia but eh depends on where you're going I guess
I'm starting to reconsider my decision to go to Germany
Example of flats for such price
Luxurious 120sq m flat in the center of Tallinn -[
Houses - literally 350sq m mansion with 6 bedrooms, sauna and garage
Basically for such price you can buy whatever the heck you want
And that's in Tallinn, most expensive city in Estonia
Even if we move slightly outside it the options are even better
For example 527sq m house -
A newish 200-300m^2 house in a suburb ([example] or a
100-year-old wooden apartment building ([example]
A 3-5 bedroom apartment in/close to city centre or a house a bit away from centre
You can get a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom, big garden and 5994 m2 house for 400k.
Kremlin was a standard defensive structure for all Russian medieval towns
So they can be found in pretty much every big city in central Russia
Coming here
(Estonia)
It's not as beautiful as travel guides and other shit say
Tourist traps are tourist traps for a reason
There is something that is worth looking at
That's why I never avoid tourist traps
I visit those and then I make sure that I sleep and eat and have some fun outside of those
I never skip
Why I go Prague and never visit Karl bridge or that famous clock of theirs
When I went to Vienna I visited Schönbrunn Palace and that huge wheel they have, etc
Doesn't germany have the most beautiful old architecture
A racetrack
Looks pretty, has a great acquarium, 92 years of motor racing history, interesting palace
I've been there twice and I'd like to go again, too much of a shy kid the previous times
bats are called *nahkhiir* (leather/skin mouse)
we call dandelions butter flowers lol
That's a bit universal to every website unfortunately lol
The one at a street level is 1st floor, next one is 2nd floor
Basement can be both 0 and -1
This is one of the differences between UK and US English
In the US the first floor is at street level (i.e same as in Estonian)
And Estonia
We've got Lääne maakond - West county
And our largest island is literally named Island land (Saaremaa)
Everyone really likes to downplay everything
Honestly that stuff doesn't work all the time, electing Trump "was just gonna be fine", brexit "was gonna be fine" and so on
E:it's not going to be the end of the world is not a great argument for a shitty decision
I kinda hope the same but then again I thought the same thing when Trump was elected and when the brexit vote went through
I've kinda lost that optimism
Webpages really cant afford to adapt to every situation differently
If for example bigger countries implement it the hard way the websites will follow them and wont start making exceptions for smaller countries
Webpages don't have borders
Well, in this vote Farage did vote against it as well
I think he's talking about Farage in general
Not sure how true the claim is though
But it won't be up to the EU now to fine
It'll be up to the member states
at least i havent heard anyone ask for that/order than
Pros: Good education, modt people keep to themselves, cool parties
Cons: Extremely racist, sexist etc boomers around every corner
Reindeer meat sauce with potatoes I had once in Sweden was great, much better than our regular minced meat sauce
I wouldn't count on it thanks to utter incompetence every step of the way with vaccinations and stuff

Winter
You can be well off in your country but if you don't live in western Europe then traveling can be pretty difficult and I imagine that Estonia is pretty well off in that regard anyway
high tax, low wage
and bad weather
I’d say Pärnu
Tallinn and Harjumaa in general are thought of as arrogant urban people who have traded their “Estonianness” for success, while Tartu is thought of the city of intellectual bohemians
Everyone loves to sit on the beautiful beaches of Pärnu and spend a few summer-days there though
Maybe also the islands, especially Saaremaa
Yes, Pärnu or Haapsalu
Tallinn and Tartu generate too much negativity
Life goes on as regular as people are used to it
Heavy snowfall affects our daily lives a lot more, as does the melting period, when the streets are slippery
With extreme cold, cars do indeed start to fail, especially those produced for warmer markets
car doors can freeze shut so thats kind of fun
u have to get the car running and crank the heat up for a little so the locks warm up and hopefully start working again
luckily at least one of the doors has always opened
It depends on a lot of factors, wind especially
If you can switch hands often, it's not impossible to have a long conversation outside with no gloves on as you can warm your other hand in the pocket for a while
Also especially younger people often have [such gloves] for easier phone use
Personal projects generally in Estonian, at work whatever the standard is for the current project (usually English)
Almost all in English
Comments sometimes in Estonian, but rarely
English, despite pretty much every programming class I've taken teaching otherwise
In Estonia they are planning to open a bunch of Lidls and I’m not exactely happy about it
From my experience of Lidls in Austria they offer very cheap very low-quality food
While I lived in Austria there was an incident where they put horse meat in their lasagna for example
Their range of goods consited mainly of cheap off-brand products close to their date of expiry, often with packaging or other flaws
The whole atmosphere felt very cheap compared to other Austrian supermarket chains like Merkur or Billa
No, the only cheap supermarket chain we have is Maxima and it’s reaaally bad
Ofc they can
In fact most of my friends are girls
If it's casual, like a friend or family, I say "Jah
". Jah means yes
If it's formal, I say " \[Full name\] kuuleb
". Kuuleb means is hearing
For a long time I used to say "Jaa
" meaning yes because that's how my mom did it
Now I usually just say "Halloo
Estonia first became an independent country in 1918
Previously we had been ruled by various foreign powers since the 13th century; it is not known how exactly Estonians were organised before that as written records are sparse, but it was probably more like a number of loosely connected tribes than any sort of unified state
EDIT: also our independence day is February 24th, so Estonia is exactly 102 years old today
Founded 102 years ago today, restored independence on the 20th of August 1991
Estonia was declared independent in 1918, but "happily" joined the USSR in 1940
Then in 1991 Estonia declared itself independent for the second time
The point is that some argue that Estonia today isn't the same Estonia as it was before ww2
102yo as founded in 1918  its our independence day todayy
Before  1918, for many years (and i mean many) we were occupied by Russians, Germans etc and when not occupied, this land wasnt called Estonia
Yes
But I'm not really sure how effective it was
Yes
In Estonia we do learn to cook
We have a class that I believe starts in the fifth grade
In class we learn to cook, knit, sew, crochet, do embroidery and practice calligraphy
It’s for girls but for a year we switch with the boys and do woodwork instead
we had a cooking class/subject as part of the handicraft/home economics subject
It wasnt year round though
And we were about 12-16 when we had that subject
It was fun, but we had to be in teams and it could get kinda annoying sometimes, especially if you know a bit more about cooking than your teammates
Once every year
In Estonia this is actually a very controversial subject
In Estonia there are currently 72
000 stateless people (6% of the population), most of which are Russians
After Estonia split from the Soviet Union there were about 400
000 Russians living inside the borders of the now independent Estonian republic
The new law of citizenship stated, that only people who lived on the territory of the first Estonian Republic and their descendants are citizens of Estonia, everyone else has the possibility of naturalization which requires living in the territory of Estonia for at least 8 years and passing both an Estonian language and Estonian history exam
The only other option for the Estonian Russians was to apply for Russian citizenship, which would make their lifes in Estonia considerably harder though
And additionally with the [Estonian alien’s passport] you can travel visa-free to both Russia and the Schengen area, which is not possible with both the Russian or Estonian passport
In 2011 of the 470
000 Russians about 140
000 left for Russia in the 90s and of the about 320
000 remaining about 55% had Estonian citizenship, while about 25% have Russian citizenship and 20% are stateless
The Estonian center party (Keskerakond), which is currently the second largest party in Estonia wants to grant citizenship to all these people without the Estonian language and history exam
If you speak English then I really don't mind
A lot of people speak pretty decent English so you will almost never be in trouble for not knowing Estonian (you should still atleast try to learn though)
Also if you are going from outside to enter your  apartment  and hear your neighbors coming from behind on staircase - better hurry up and get to apartment first to avoid that awkward "hi".
~40min walk
20 minutes by bus
Very often at 18 and almost always between 18 and 25
I haven't seen Estonian really anywhere but i once saw a car with Estonian license plate in a small village in France
Also when my Dad went to the USA he was chatting with South African people and they said they have Estonian names there
Now I want to hear what those names are
That car with an Estonian plate was probably just someone on a road trip
I've seen Dutch, British, Czech, Austrian, etc plates here
Yeah true but when my family travels they like to rent a car
One name was Johannes(i know some other languages have Johannes aswell but apparently they write the name way that we do in Estonian)
I can't remember the other one
Yeah Johannes is quite a common male name here
It's a German name I believe, same root as John
You tell me
Yes but it's outside of Europe
That's what surprised me
Hey, stop
That's our line
Please don't throw things at me, fellow Swedes, but I would say the feeling is mutual
Hating the Danish is more of a running joke than anything genuine
Hell, sometimes Copenhagen feels like my second capital because of how close it is to where I live
Sorry, but you certainly can't find anything like [this] in your average European city
This level of neglect and decay is very shocking and unheard of even in the poorest parts of the EU
As a matter of fact I do
That's pretty cool, I've only ever heard "The Öresund Region" being mentioned in that context
Damn i thought i was the only one
Strauss is my favourite composer that's why i  watch it
I absolutely love buckwheat(tatar in Estonian) and its most commonly served with minced meat sauce here
Had those rarely in school lunches, always skipped them cause I hated it lol
> Balts
It's still present in Estonia
Called tatar here
Estonian name actually comes from the Tatars (people), because  buckwheat  came here from asian part of Russia
i had no idea it was from here
its not particularly popular, so i assumed we just havent really adopted it here
yeah, same here
my dad even gets annoyed if people step too far from the door with their shoes on
and by too far i mean like more than 1
5 meters lmao
I’m here cracking my brain - do we even have any original desserts
i have to say the name sounds exactly how it looks
i now craving honey cake at 2 am
mmm no, not with cheese
bread with just jam is a great cheap snack though
what kind of bread do you use
my mom introduced me to toast with cream cheese and strawberey jam, which is pretty damn delicious
apparently she found out about it when she was in germany in the 90s
There were sometimes high kings of ireland
You forgot Holodomor and mass deportations on cattle trains
We do have *jõuluõlu* in Estonian, which is very similar to danish julybryg
Another typical Estonian christmas drink is *glögi*.
Jõuluõlu here
It always suprises me how you guys are so similar in so many ways
Pretty sure, it’s the same
I live on the countryside alot of my friends houses have wood heating but people that have money usually go with ground heating since it's the most cost efficient way to heat your house
Well according to the [university metric] you clearly were doing something right :P
Though more seriously, in terms of advancing education in Estonia, I really gotta rep my man [B. G. Forselius] here
Don't get me wrong, the university was nice, but pretty much out of reach for peasants at the time
But that guy not only modernised teaching methods, initiated a spelling reform that brought written Estonian much more in line with the actual pronounciation, and started a seminary to educate Estonians to become schoolteachers, he also took two of his students to demonstrate their literacy before the Swedish king to prove that educating Estonians was worthwhile
In Estonian culture, this is considered a bro move
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kamakura
I guess thats it
Former leader of the Interfront, lol
I'm sorry but Russians in Latvia are quite dumb to pick such a diehard Soviet as their representative
This means she's forever seen as an unloyal stagnant of the old guard whose voice will never matter in Latvia
She basically represents the last twitches of the dead empire
I don't know about any other people in my country but I do eat them
Yes, though we don't usually do it on a pan, many people have special sandwich maker  (mind you it's not a regular toaster), which allows to heat up sandwiches with filling
Jaan Anvelt i guess, he was a communist who was supported by the red army
In the capital (i.e Tallinn or Northern Estonia in general I guess) there's no word for "that" or "those". They just say "this there" and "these there".
Visiting Narva and Eastern-Estonia in general, it’s like a completely foreign country
Setomaa Estonia
It's a place in Southeastern Estonia
They speak seto dialect there , a normal Estonian can't understand that language at all
They even call it Seto country
They elect their own president
There's also Narva on the Northeastern Russian border where u can't get stuff done in Estonian because everyone speaks Russian
We call it Ministry of Defence aswell (Kaitseministeerium)
Even what we call our army (kaitsevägi) directly translates to “defence force”. We’re a peaceful bunch
I think fika is overrated
Just an excuse to be unhealthy with people you don't really like
Didn't think of that, but yes, it's a struggle
We actually have a saying for a similar situation: "hädas nagu mustlane mädas" - "in trouble like a gypsy in mud".
In estonian black person ia "neeger" but the pc term is "mustanahaline"
It‘s the norm here too
>not so much in other countries
Pretty much like that all over Eastern Europe
>I know that line cutting is going to happen
It's not about cutting the line
Chiming mid-line that is already formed is considered rude in Europe as well
However when new line is formed  it doesn't matter what order was in other line - it's a new line after all
Question for a Spanish person
Is it similar/the same in Spanish
I'm currently learning Spanish and this made me curious, since both a Frenchman and a Romanian agreed on it
> with sauna all over Europe staff will kick you out if not naked
Really
Never had such  experience (though I've never been in germanic countries where I heard they are pretty strict on that) but in other countries I never had problem with not being completely nude in sauna
Towel is fine imo
Btw, I am talking about public saunas, not at home
Obviously with family it's completely ok to go naked to sauna
But in public I am just not that ok being completely nude
*[The Singing Revolution] is an exceptionally good documentary about Estonia's recent history
In Estonia we pass around a human-like doll in december, called Tahma-Toomas
If the doll stays behind your door after the 21st of december, it shows that the family living in that house is lazy and sloppy
As most of the old traditions it's becoming a rarer sight by the year
From neighbour to neighbour
we watch that too, every new years eve
Konstatin Päts
Who
Allowed the Soviets to establish bases in the country to avoid bloodshed and confrontation, trusted the Soviets to not interfere in Estonian internal affairs
7 months later, a Soviet coup and occupation followed, tens of thousands being deported or perished during the 50-year occupation
A touchy subject, but by far the largest mistake in Estonian history
Then again, the question must be raised, whether there was any other possibility
The Finns opposed this plan and retained their independence, but whether the Baltics could've done the same
must be debated
Totally agree on this one, although obvious bias
Some of the plates getting alot of attention here are really complicated looking and not just because of the embellishments, but also just weirdly grouped and, at times, way too long combinations of numbers and letters, that don't seem intuitive at all
Seem like they would be a pain in the ass to remember, but i guess it depends
Let's see
There's no anime (besides Ghibli )/ manga avalible here
At least I don't know any stores that sell anything like that
Most of Netflix
Rollercoasters
A government that actually works
90 :)
Well there is something fishy when one party that has done some questionable things has been the most popular party longer then I have lived
We can't choose our president either, the government does that
Not super rare but most people don't have them
They're more common in the younger generations
In the past hyphenated names were more of a thing (eg
Anna-Liisa), but nowadays the hyphen is more often omitted
Quite uncommon, I'd say about 25% or so of my acquaintances have one
Even fewer use them
[The planned high-speed railway terminal in Tallinn
Hey, I'm from Estonia and here are top picks from me:
No, u/Prygikutt didn't say, but they've already scaled it down, although it looks essentially just as good
Yeah, I couldn't find the picture of the scaled down version but I've seen it
I would have posted it, but I couldn't find it either
Not very in-depth, but it was covered
In Estonia we skimmed it, not too much but we talked about it
I remember we covered something about it in class but I didn't listen so I can't remember what it was we talked about there
Well, here in Estonia it's obviously not a forgotten thing
Wouldn't say it was a massive topic in school history lessons, but it did have it's own part in textbooks
It's just well known overall due to being close to both Finland and Russia
There was something about it in 5th grade and something in 9th
Municipal police or mupo, we call them half police, because they check tickets on buses and trams and they act like they have the power but they can only give tickets
They think that they are police but no, hence the nickname of "half police" .
I remembered the time when they made fun about mexicans on Top Gear after reading that
Yeah, I never said mexicans are actually lazy people
Mexicans are some of the most hardworking folk out there
They contribute way more to the US economy than a lot of Americans will ever realise and that is sad
Hasn't it been shown that after a certain amount of worktime, the productivity significantly decreases and so, working yourself to death with overtime will not net you good value
Estonia has a rather logical approach
Dual citizenship is not allowed, but if you have birthright Estonian citizenship, then the state cannot take away your Estonian citizenship simply because you have another citizenship as well
In effect, dual citizenship is not allowed only for people, who have obtained Estonian citizenship through naturalization
I don't like the idea of somebody getting a citizenship while keeping the old one, simple
Most countries differentiate between birthright citizens and naturalized citizens in some way, especially in specific citizenship-related rules
Another country's citizen coming here and voting on stuff on the other hand absolutely would affect me
I just like to listen to angry Russians, other than that i don't like other languages
English and Dutch
Least favorite: Italian and French
I am usually called a shortened version of my name but from my dad I've gotten "Mees metsast" (man from the forest)
Despite my mom being Estonian she likes to call me Кабан(pronounced Kaban) a Russian word for a boar because I eat a lot and very fast
For a sec I though we were using Cyrillic here
Similar in Estonian - "in Bordeaux" would be *Bordeaux's*.
I think it's because of the language
Atleast that's what I've heard
We use a lot of double vowels which for some makes our language sound stretched out, like baby talk
I think it depends more on the rain, wind and sunshine than actual temp
And also if you're underslept and if you've eaten enough
But if I'd have to guess, then generally from about 17 degrees with "nicer" weather and low physical activity
But this is coming from an almost underweight tiny female
I actually have more problem with long-term slightly-too-cold than short-term very-cold-exposure
As in I can easily go and walk my dog for 10 minutes in my home clothes (like T-shirt+skirt) in winter with -10 Celsius, but if I am sitting still at the office and it's 17 degrees, I can get very very cold by the end of the day without my hoodie
My partner, on the other hand, wears shots basically all year, so there you go
I'd guess he's T-shirt ready a few degrees before me, once again depending on the other factors
Gotta love Scotland
We have the mythics like Kalevipoeg and Töll
Then Lembitu, who unified the estonian tribes to fought against the germans then we have Kuperjanov who was a partisan leader during the indepenedence war and laidoner who was a general then baisically every forest brother
[Blackcurrant] Was kind of shocked myself when I heard about this lol
>Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable
It's not like that over the whole Europe though
Here in Estonia it's illegal to drink in the streets (unless it's like an open terrace near bar)
You can be charged even for having an open bottle in your hands
We are not a Nordic country :(
Yandex has an alternative for pretty much every online service you could think of
And yandex taxi is actually available not only in Russia
It is pretty popular even here in Estonia
> can they force you to pay without beating you up
Social pressure
Many people will give in to not make up a scene, especially if the amout of money is small
As for "why not beat you up" - that is a very clear case of robbery with force, which can be reported to police
While in that scheme there is not much to report about
We are forced to learn russian
That's the main complaint
Sure, teatch us russian, but also do a better fucking job at teaching the russians inside Estonia how to speak estonian
The ENSV flag, cuz hammer and sickle
* USSR flag
* [Flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic
* Nazi Germany flag with swastika
* Nazi SS flag
* That nazi flag with iron cross
* [Flag of the Russian Saint George Ribbon]
* [Black and white celtic cross flag]
Probably missed some
There's plenty that make most people roll eyes or scoff if somebody waved these without irony or historical reasons
Same for Estonia
Ugliest flag ever
The hallway of axes
You would have about kids swinging and 1 or 2 kid(s) would have to run through
I stopped playing it when I for some reason froze while I was running and was hit
my dad taught me the palm slap game but i never really saw anyone my age play it
Blind chicken- basically it was hide&seek + catch mixed
hiders would have to avoid the seeker and the seeker was blindfolded
Oh and not on the ground because ground was basically off limits to hiders
So a bunch of kids, 1 with blindfold, would climb around an old iron structure
Idk how we didnt fall off
I did that a lot with my friends who I'll call A and B. I stopped playing it when a 35 year old grown ass man started chasing us
And luckily he only got A. B and me got away
But I'll always remember the moment when I was on the grass, unable to drive my scooter just to turn around and see the man 10 metres away from me
Läskit skotit homoilee
Russia because they've historically been a pain in the ass neighbor for all sorts of reasons, invading, genociding, deporting, looting, blocking trade etc
I guess we could get better along with them if they chose to switch to democracy and stop being a nuisance to everyone around them
China because we don't really want their money, influence and technology here due to CCP being a terrible institution
Same fix as mentioned above
Belarus too lately, because Baltic countries kind of formed an united bloc to contest the recent election results there
Yet again, same solution as mentioned above
Russia
They killed our people and colonized and stole the land of the estonians and our brother people
Russia
I’m sure this applies to every former soviet country
Frankly, swedes were colonialists, and colonized finland
Any other city than tallinn lol, maybe tartu aswell, since there are alot of foreigners there
I totally expected from the post title for it to be some kind of guessing game

I disagree with about everything our current government under prime minister Ratas does
no gas deals with germany/europe in general
Every time your Minister of Foreign Affairs opens his mouth, support for NATO inches a bit higher here
The thing is, it's already over 90%, so we're hitting limits on how much we dislike your country's foreign policy
It isn't a good one, it creates conflicts, allows no trust and no cooperation, and pushes your neighbours only further and further away
Just as it does in Estonian
The word was borrowed from Baltic languages into Estonian
I know Russia *tries* to use that tactic, but fortunately for us, the EU also has some kind of unified foreign policy and Germany is far from being the only decider on that front
And if you have four EU members throwing sticks to the spokes of cooperation with Russia all the time, the truth is, it will be difficult for the Kremlin to achieve anything meaningful
We have the power, for example, to forever veto visa freedom for Russians
And this is only from a perspective of other countries actually having the will to cooperate with Russia
In reality, Russia's approval ratings in Europe are abysmally low, with only a few exceptions (Greece, Bulgaria)
>I think conflict in Ukraine is more of a road block in Russia-German rapprochement
Sure, but I would put it under the wider problem of Russia's "fuck my neighbours" attitude
>But it’s rather naive to think that political elites in Poland and the Baltics would be able to indefinitely resist political pressure from major EU members, if one day they decided to change their Russian policy
Especially if UK really leaves the EU
They couldn't hold out as the last of the Mohicans, for sure, but they still have influence on the issue
Baltics in particular rarely voice opposition in the union, so when they do, it's not to be taken lightly
Besides, it's difficult to imagine a situation where Poland and Baltics are vehemently against while rest of the EU is in favour
>I’m pretty sure that Russia beneficial as an ally to Germany would also be beneficial to the Eastern Europeans as a neighbor
Russia as an ally of the EU would benefit us all, but these are just empty words
The question is not whether we would like to cooperate, any sane person would
The real question is what concessions are we willing to make for that goal
And the Russian strategy of ignoring the "irrelevant" players and playing directly with the big boys is also against the EU interests
There are plenty of small countries in the EU that would be against such attempts
Germany would face opposition from the European Commission if it tries to go solo (something that somewhat already happened with Nord Stream 2)
In Estonia private tuition is not really a thing
We have a rather good education system and even though some secondary schools are considered better than others (to get you into a good Uni) , the main reason behind it is just that some schools can collect a higher proportion of highly motivated pupils, rather than these schools having tremendously better teachers
The national minimum curriculum defined by the law is rather detailed and the books are usually quite the same between schools - there are simply not that much different coursebooks available as there are like only one million people who speak Estonian in the whole world
Crazy, right
Therefore, private tuition is usually only a thing if you are actually having trouble with a single subject (usually Maths / Physics / some language) - and in this case, the tutor is usually a just young Uni student who passed his secondary school with flying colours
In recent years, I have seen some prep-for-entrance exams courses, one was for an art school and one was for Medicine
Don't know about the Art prep, but the Medicine one was cheap, online, and mainly meant for those who had graduated a long time ago and wanted to refresh their memory and get some more up-to-date knowledge
Other than art schools, there are basically no entrance exams, but national high school graduation exam grades are used (you can choose some of the subjects and some are compulsory, but within the same subject, the exam papers are the same for everyone and take place at exactly the same time in every school)
Medicine asks for a national exam in Estonian and  in addition to this you need either national Maths exam or take an entrance exam in Biology or Chemistry
I think the reason behing re-introducing entrance exam in Medicine was the fact, that on some years, the national exams happen to be easier than on others and entrance exam gives more equal opportunity for all students, as some take a gap year etc
Medicine has really high competition and I bet they got some kids just applying every year, hoping to get in on a year that had harder exam than their own year was
I personally didn’t know anyone who doesn’t keep eggs in the fridge
Also all of the stores keep eggs on refrigerated shelves
I have an opinion: If something is sold in a fridge/cooler/refrigerator, it should be kept in the refrigerator at home to try to follow the same circumstances
So, yes, I store my eggs in the fridge
Huh, where else are you supposed to put them
Even if you can keep them at room temperature, fridge is just the most convenient place to store food (unless you have some special room or cellar for that)
We call it viht
Why the fuck would you eat nutella with butter
Ever since my trip to Russia and \~8500 km in a train all together (riding time \~6 full days, longest in one go was 39h), European distances seem
lame
We never felt the distances were too long, quite the opposite, in the end we wished there were more trains to take
As we often took night trains like from 7 pm to 8 am, we really didn't have too much time enjoy the scenery etc
Anything under **20h** ride is very close
Anything under **100h** is worth considering for sure
Up from that is for train freaks only (I might be becoming one of them)
Sadly, getting anywhere from Estonia by train is a hassle - you can't even buy a train ticket from Estonia to anywhere outside
But I've done it a bit as we have a border town with Latvia and they actually have made the schedules match, so you can take a train to Valga, then hop off and in the same tiny station hop on the Latvian trains and get to Riga
But to get to all these European connected railways, you have to repeat this trick 2-3 times I think
From Tallinn:
- Within mainland Estonia: train or bus
- Latvia: bus
- Estonian islands, Finland and Stockholm: ferry
- Everything else: flying
>goes to Russia, St Petersburg and I don't want to go to Russia
I recommend keeping an open mind
Train trips in Russia are awesome
Yes, Russia is not rich and yes, the living standards are different, but there is a lot to see (it is BIG) and it's not unsafe
Have a look at [Kamchatka] that is like Iceland on steroids or take a peek at the [buddhist temples] in Buryatia and beyond
People just think that all of Russia is like the sad towns they see in Hollywood movies where it represents "where the bad guys live". Tourism-wise, I find Russia cool
I just avoid talking about politics
Ever
Anywhere
Yeah, sometimes, but I guess that's included in the previously mentioned categories
Although in that case we would usually fly to Helsinki
If we use Riga for a connecting flight, then we usually fly, especially if you come from Northern Estonia
Otherwise Latvia is a bus territory, while Lithuania is already a bit too far for that to be comfortable
I've done the train journey to Latvia as well, but it's a hassle and definitely not worth it from Tallinn
From Tartu it's also like half a day's journey as the train schedule is not aligned on the border and you have to wait in Valga for a couple of hours
The quality of old Latvian trains isn't helping along either
Yeah, same here, over here the mentality of "Russia bad" was really strong (understandably) for like the first two decades after independence, so there is a generation who knows really little about Russia, other than it's poor and drunk
It has started to change a little, as kids actually actually get friends who have a Russian parent or watch some youtube travel stuff
"What a snappy retort," said Fred
Why so
Tallinn airport isn't that big due to Estonia's size and the proximity to two bigger and easily accessible airports - Helsinki and Riga, the latter especially for Southern Estonia
We might have our main lines covered from Tallinn, but for further destinations, we need to take connecting flights anyways, and sometimes it's not faster to change flights mid way, but to just go through Helsinki or Riga
>It has started to change a little
Lol, no it hasn't.
They are extremely short, you don't even get offered coffee, only a biscuit or a candy
But they save you a lot of time as going through both harbours and driving to Vantaa Airport would take up a lot of time - instead coming to the small Tallinn Airport extremely close to the city centre and flying to Helsinki is rather quick
Dunno, in university it seemed better in my time, but I have no kids going to school, so maybe this is just as bad in schools still
Nope, not a single bit of Russian, back to the 1600s my family in all lines has lived on the island
So if anything, then Swedish might be somewhere, but even that is unlikely
Yeah, in this case we mostly fly to Helsinki
of course
i think i learned at 4 or so years old with side wheels and for my 6th or 7th birthday i got a "big kids bike" without side wheels and with gears, that i started learning to ride right away
i like bicycling, and i bicycled a lot as a kid, but honestly im still not very good at switching gears unfortunately
idk man
city traffic is terrifying too, havent tried riding there yet, i usually ride on the sidewalks and go for longer trips into the forest or to these special rollerblading/bicycling roads
There are school trips to other countries in almost every European country, Are you sure you don‘t have any in Finland
In Estonia we usually visit Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia or sometimes the UK
I even know a class who went to Kazakhstan
Mostly the soviet era
Compound words are pretty fucked
Also groups of words like järgi/järele/järel are kinda the same but using them correctly is pretty tricky
I can't even tell the correct way right now
There are actually plenty troublesome rules, maybe my estonian is just very shit but I often find that it's too hard as a language
Damn, ours is 3
48/hr before taxes right now
Was as low as 2
62/hr in 2016
Sure is, specialists with master's degrees don't get paid that much often here
Well London and Dublin are among the most notoriously expensive cities in Europe for housing
UK in general is very expensive on that front
Other places in the world with similar reputation include Sydney, Vancouver, Bay Area, Toronto, NYC
We do however pay 300+ euros for a two room apartment plus utilities(which can be over 150 during winter months) in Tartu
I was getting that minimum wage back then in 2016 and I would've been homeless without my parent's support
Living costs are comparable
No, because I can't afford it
Average wage is meaningless, a minority get paid that much
Tallinn in particular is really becoming Western-like in terms of costs for sure
Btw I reckon a big part of the reason why people drink less in Belgium is that you cannot afford to with these small beers that cost a lot, I think I ordered only one beer in total from a pub there because of it
Statistics do not agree
That said, I only found fairly crappy beer in stores for 2€ when I was in Flanders a few years ago
>the nation such a person resides in (in my example, Italy) to make the same sort of government pensions or financial assistance to the unemployed to non-citizen residents, even if they are EU citizens
That's totally wrong
I am not sure if EU does require that, but from my knowledge all (or almost all) EU countries will provide you government benefits (such as pension and unemployment payment) as long as you work there officially and pay taxes
It's even against the law to not provide you those if you pay taxes
I know a guy who lived and worked in several EU countries and he is eligible to collect the pension (based on how much he worked) from each of those countries when he retires
Generally I loved it as NYC is definitely a very unique setting
I'd love to live there for a short while, but of course not for any longer period as it would get a little depressing
There are many older style highrises in NYC that I liked, but some of the ones from especially the 1970s and 1980s felt like they are just a huge boring facade the first 10 floors or so
i think Frozen's translation to estonian is one of the clumsiest sounding ones i have ever heard
"Lumekuninganna ja igavene talv", which translates to "The Snow Queen and the Eternal Winter"
someone broke into my familys small house in the middle of nowhere and stole a really good husqvarna lawnmower and some winter tires
they literally smashed the window glass in enough that they could properly open the window, then got in, opened the door from the inside and carried all the good stuff out
we dont live there, visit rarely (once or twice a year at best) and mostly use it for storing stuff
so there's no heating or water or anything
Presumably via German influence, Estonian also talks of a mother tongue and fatherland
Unless it's a old building where windows haven't been changed these are the standard
Also as windows are the main things that get changed here due to better insulation it can actually be a bit tricky to find other "regular" windows
It's the most normal window there is
All other types are considerably less common
I'm in Estonia, and these are pretty much standard windows here
As an American expat, I was totally surprised and enthralled with them
Doors to balconies work the same way as well
Just as an aside, no windows here include screens (none that I have seen, anyway)
There just doesn't seem the need for them here in Estonia
most places have this type of windows, except for older houses with older windows
Aksually, guy keeps getting bigger and when I first watched him I thought he's American because of his accent lol
Not common with people you already know
I have really noticed it being very popular among russians
I go to a school that has a lot of russians and sometimes it's almost comedic seeing someone come to class and then proceed to shake hands with everyone
Well there's the South Estonian variants (Võru, Seto, Tartu, and Mulgi), though to what extent they count as different languages than just dialects is debatable
There was also [Estonian Swedish] though sadly that's pretty much extinct nowadays
Estonian and Russian are two commonly spoken languages as a matter of course
The third one should be either Finnish or English because of the increasing number of expats here
Well, besides russian there's a tiny minority of german speakers and sweadish speakers but the largest minority (excluding russian) is Võro dialect which it self divides into other dialects
Võro currently has 90k speakers here, võro sounds a bit like finnish actually
In Estonia we have only Estonian as a language but it has many accents
like a LOT
Its not classified as a language of its own but Seto, which is old Estonian spoken in south-eastern Estonia
Livonian too
tho the last native speaker died in the 90s.
They still teach it tho
They have youtube videos of it
Its closely related to Estonian
Belgrade because of the song "Balkan, Balkan, Balkan, ovo je Balkan, come on"
Well in Tallinn and tartu (the 2 biggest cities) if you're a resident of that city you have free public transport and to travel with the free public transport you have this green card that you put up to the card reader
If you aren't a resident then you will have to put money on the card and the ticket price will be taken off the card when you put it to the card reader
Does that make sense
Public transport is in most cases free in Estonia
You just hold your “Ühiskaart” against a chip reader to validate your free trip
Alternatively you can also load money on your Ühiskaart or just hold a debit or credit catd against the chip reade
I don't (transport is free in Tallinn)
1) prepaid stored value card which works on all buses in the country and can be topped up online or in many stores
2) season tickets that can be loaded to the same card, also available online or the same stores as the previous method
3) cash while boarding (most expensive)
4) contactless cards (only in Tartu and Tallinn)
Costs the same as a single ticket using the prepaid card
5) QR tickets, available online
Cost 1€ per ride, available in Tallinn and Tartu only
6) Android app that ties to your prepaid card and used NFC on your phone along with special SIM card
This is what I've been using
It really baffled me how they still use paper tickets in Vienna
If u are under 20 u can also get free transport in major cities
Even if u are not the resident of that region
Residents do not get free public transport in Tartu
I thought DfT was pushing mobile ticketing
In my opinion it's inferior, because QR codes take longer to scan and if your phone dies you're out of luck
Smart cards that work nationwide would be a much better solution
I might have remembered that wrong then I guess
You can’t. You can only swipe your Ühiskaart (public transport card) which everyone uses since only this way you get a free ride
I busses you can just pay the driver, you will recieve no ticket though
In trams you either have to use the Ühiskaart, your smartphone or swipe your debit card or credit card
They also have weekly/monthly/yearly/etc tickets, they’re still just a slip of paper though
From what I've seen QR codes still take 2-3 seconds at best, while NFC smart cards are nearly instantaneous
If you don’t qualify for a free ride and have to use the money loaded on your Ühiskaart, the machine will also print you a bill, for me this bill doesn’t really qualify as a ticket, since you don’t have to show it anywhere and if you happen to see a ticket inspector you can just show him the card which you used to pay for the ticket
This only applies to busses though
In trams you lack even this option
Oh, well that’s new
When I studied in Vienna I had a ‘Top Jugendticket’ which was valid for a year and it was just a slip of paper
maybe things have changed
In Estonia we used to say 'hernesupp' which means 'pea soup' but now we've taken a more international approach and say 'cheese' more
"Do you speak Russian
Or better yet, "Do you speak Russian or "Estonian"?"
When on TV, I don't remember who but some celebrity was asked where she is from
She answered Estonia
The interviewer not jokingly, but very seriously then asked her: **"Oh, Estonian is a dialect of Russian, right
"**
I'm fairly certain it's the second
I just go with the classic "La souris est en dessous de la table". Doesn't get much of a better reaction tbh
Haha, sometimes it's the other way round
I am Estonian Russian and once a Swiss person, after learning that I am from Estonia, started telling me how much he loved Tallinn and how it's different from Eastern Europe/Russia and how unpleasant Russian areas of Tallinn are (probably Lasnamägi)
It was a bit awkward explaining to him that is where essentially where I am from
I have gotten questions from people to check if I spoke Russian or Estonian (I speak both)
I didn't really find it offensive, I guess I don't really look Estonian (more southern Slav) so people were more likely to assume I am not an ethnic Estonian
The most frequent comment used to be ''kaksteist kuut' from Erasmus students
(Edit - from Russian Estonian to Estonian Russian
When I was around twelve me and my mom were walking around in Tenerife and there was a guy who started loudly singing" KIIIMI Räikkönen, Kimi RÄIKKÖNEN" TO ME
I first heard it watching clips of rally crashes
You could always tell in what general area the rally was from the sounds of the crowd, they either said kurwa, vittu, blyat, merde, merda, scheisse or oh fucken' 'ell
>Russian Estonian
There is no such thing
Why call yourself a nonexistent ethnicity if you're just a Russian, a well known ethnicity
>It was a bit awkward explaining to him that is where essentially where I am from
I know the story, I'm from Lasnamäe myself
I feel the same way about it as those tourists though, probably even worse
You're a Finn
In what universe are you living if you don't know that Estonian is a distinct language
It's as if they are wondering whether such a language exists and they are deriving the hypothetical language name from the country name
I think they ment Estonian Russian, i would consider it different enough from Russian Russian, as they speak Estonian and would be at least partially integrated into Estonian culture and day-to-day business, no idea why would you reject it
Also, no offense, but Lasnamäe is indeed sketchy as hell, but oh,well, at least it's not Kopli
Or everybody being gay there
Source:Finland
You call it council estate, we call it home
Estonian Russian makes more sense, but "Russian from Estonia" or "Russian of Estonia" is the term actually used in Estonia
No way should it be used as sort of a mixed or integrated group name
Actual mixed ethnicity of someone is usually said with a hyphen anyways
>Also, no offense, but Lasnamäe is indeed sketchy as hell, but oh,well, at least it's not Kopli
At least Kopli is getting better and fast
There are some major projects going on there and near and the entire peninsula, actually North Tallinn in general is gentrifying and Estonianizing rather quickly, with many Russians moving to Lasnamäe or other areas
But that's given to a Finn automatically, by hearing their accent
"Russians from Estonia" or "Russians of Estonia" are the perfectly acceptable, perfectly understandable and the actually used descriptions
if no potato no lifeo
Make vodka from grain then
Handball really
That's surprising, it's such a minor thing here it is barely mentioned in TV sportsnews let alone anywhere else
But they are in English
You can't drink at a football match
What a shame
That said I've never seen a proper match from a stadium so I wouldn't know how it is
I've been an F1 fan since 2002-2003 and I can't disagree unfortunately
There's a chance for a genuine title fight this year but frankly I'm not optimistic, Mercedes' rate of development is so large I expect them to start steamrolling completely again in a few months if not already starting this week at Catalunya where I expect them to dominate
Any people putting stuff like cider in their soft drink bottles, mixing vodka or rum with coca cola or any other shenanigans like that
Eat potato, no more no less
Heck yeah videogames and booze
And Estonia would probably sit next to Finland
What if i like pasta
Hey hey hey we'd be more on the quiet side
Unless we and Finland get wasted together
Potato
I guess we'll go with  Latvia and Lithuania
Most of it
I went to school in Soviet Union and what we were taught during history classes was quite bad
Better for older time periods, but even then it was more of the propaganda then real history
As revolution of the working class
Estonian Republic was vilified a lot
Of course we actually had old history books still circulating
A British comedy TV series "Yes, Minister" / "Yes, Prime Minister" assuming the quality of the humour remains it would be hilarious
That we have WiFi in forests
Mostly shared by other Estonians whenever the topic is IT
“Skype is an Estonian invention/idea/thing”
Well yeah, there were 3 Estonian guys working on the source code, but the company was established by Swedish/Danish guys
Mobile data isn't the same as WiFi
You need a licence to buy a gun and another licence to use it
For those you need to pass a medical exam, get first aid training and pay the fees
I don't know the statistics, but I'm pretty sure the guidelines are quite strict
After all, I haven't really heard of a machine gun shooting in the news
Or of any shooting for that matter
Quite popular
I myself have been sent to science camp 3 times
I mean we were thaught a bit but it changes so much and honestly the actual part of "doing" taxes doesn't even exist here like it does in the states
The death penalty was completely abolished in Estonia in 1998, in order to comply with the European Union laws
The last execution took place in 1991 when a murderer was executed by a firing squad
I think 1x a day is the most usual one here as well, but most people wash their hair less often, like every 2nd or 3rd day
Now with covid restrictions, I bet everyone washes less
I used to shower every other day (I basically don't sweat), but as my bathroom is in renovation it's more like every 4-5 days now, as it's a big hassle
Some old people just go to sauna once a a week, but I think they usually have a mid-week tiny-wash as well
I've never heard of anyone do that
Sounds like a good idea though
I use a pizza cutter
Well, we usually like to joke about the islanders and their petty in-fighting between the different islands
>and the fact that if you looknat the map and picture Finland being a maiden, Turku is in the spot of the asshole region
Most pictures of the Finnish Maiden show Turku at her skirt though
Tallinn is the capital city, Tartu is the cultural capital and Pärnu is the summer capital
Kaunas is a city in a naturally beautiful valley that looks like is still in the 90s. Or rather it at least looked exactly like 9 years ago when I was there last
Well Narva is bigger than Pärnu, but because it's mostly populated by Russians, then obviously Pärnu feels bigger in our national consciousness
> I still shudder at the price of a pint down there
I remember getting some fish and chips and a pint in a pub fairly close to Trafalgar square and realizing that I worked three hours earlier in the year to pay for that
Ludicrous
So from that point on if I got any beer it was either from a supermarket or the cheapest beer I could find at the hostel pub (with a discount) which was Fosters
It tasted like sweat
Based of what I've seen Aberdeen is the grey-est city in the entire world
Haha the tour guy used that line too, quite like Antwerpen though, central area at least
Well, true
Pärnu is the third biggest Estonian city
At this point in history Narva is just a town which happens to be in the same country
Tartu though is a big small town in the way it feels to live in for sure
Tartu definitely punches above its weight
It has an important university, one ministry, the Supreme Court and several scientific institutions
Like Pärnu which by area is larger than New York City now for the same reason
> It's a very small risk that everyone has to be *willing* to take in order to leave in a safer society
"Willing" implies that there's a choice
That's the opposite of "mandatory". I would argue that the system in Sweden is one where almost everyone is willing to take the risk to have a safer society and it seems to be working well
For the most part, no, except for Russian monarchs whose names are usually written as the Estonian equivalent when one exists, instead of a direct transliteration (eg
Katariina instead of Jekaterina)
But the Elizabeths, Louis's, Felipes, etc generally stay in their original form
Hehe knugen :')
Metsatöll - Küü
Metsatöll - Oma Laulu Ei Leia Ma Üles
Metsatöll - Vaid Vaprust
All of these are great but i like especially this one
This is pretty amazing too, but honestly most of Metsatöll's songs are great
Stalin
I'm addicted to building unbelievably expensive custom castles (yeeeeeeaaahhhh)
Aitäh sulle (singular)
Aitäh teile/Teile (plural/formal)
"Thanks" is "aitäh" or "tänud". The latter exists as verb "tänama" and it is conjugated pretty same way as in finnish (tänan, tänad, tänab, täname, tänate, tänavad)
And then you can also use "ole/olge tänatud" (be thanked) to thank one or multiple persons
The n word
Pretty common, though not among 50+ year old businessmen or similar
Most popular among teens and young adults and metalheads of all ages, also among hippies and in art/culture scene
For Estonia, probably anything by Nublu or Tommy Cash
Our reputation in the music industry is probably that we're pretty big into every kind of drug out there
We were in a weird situation, because at first came the Soviet occupation who deported over 10 000 people in 1941
Those people were the ones who were active in military, who were public activists, politicians, businessmen and so on
Then came the Nazi occupation, they oppressed the people who previously collaborated with the Soviets
Then in 1944 Soviets occupied us again and they oppressed the people who, due to previous Soviet oppression, collaborated with the Nazis
The Soviets just made those people disappear without really categorising people who took part in the Holocaust, who fought for them or who were just forced to collaborate
The Soviet society didn't even recognise Holocaust as a separate event - It was all a "crime against the Soviet people".
We had our own ss division
And although nazis were bad I'd say they were better for us than the Soviet Union
They weren't really punished as most retreated to the forests or deserted
estonian for example
Yes
Sober people also sing at day time when dance and song celebration takes place
The singing revolution
On the 23rd of August in 1989, a 670-kilometre human chain composing of 2 million people was formed from Tallinn, to Riga, to Vilnius
People sang forbidden and patriotic songs and held hands to protest against the Soviet government
War of independence right after WW1
Won a war against Russia, defended our lands from Germans, and established first independent Estonian governance since the 13th century
Built up a democratic state
Unfortunately all lost thanks to two mustached angry cunts
Well, the Baltic Chain was part of the revolution era, but not really part of the "Singing" revolution and I'd say it wasn't the most pivotal moment during that era
But besides the Singing Revolution, it could be that it was the 1st song festival in 1869, if we are talking about forming the national identity altogether, as it was during the Estonian National Awakening
Slavery was also historical event that had enormous impact
Even today Estonians consider "working to death" as proper way to live
Especially older generations
Yes, but you can hardly count centuries of serfdom as "an event".
Yes, it is hard to call it event
And still it defines so much of our national identity
herring on rye bread with green onions
DIS-GUS-TANG
not sure if it’s truly a national dish, but everything about it is awful to me
The most impressive ones in Estonia:
- Estonian National Museum (Tartu)
- Estonian Maritime Museum at the Seaplane Harbour (Tallinn)
- Estonian Open Air Museum (Tallinn)
- Kumu Art Museum (Tallinn)
Don't forget Museum of Occupations
There was recently [a film] about the same concept
I loved the Imperial War Museum, the National History Museum though I got completely lost in
I had to leave a bit early because I had other plans and it took me at least 15 minutes to find an exit
The use of signs was so poor I felt like I was in Italy
Yep, it's organized by the Estonian emigre community there
The managers are all members of the same student organizations that are active in Estonia as well, most of them having chapters in Toronto
I actually know a few of them personally
And Toronto used to host the biggest Estonian community abroad from about 1960 to about 2000 when Helsinki took over
Not to flex or anything but we got 1 in Tallinn our capital and no more
KFC "just" came to Estonia and there was a lot of hype around them, huge opening lines etc
Now it's just another fast food joint and it's down to preference
It's mostly down to location
A kfc opened up in my city, and the wait time there was and entire hour for a day, not as long anymore
Bro u wrong I went to tartu a few weeks ago and there was one by the Lõunakeskus, packed to the brim too
Ülemiste and Kristiine keskus makes it two I know about
Feels bad man
Atleast you have a reason to come here now except to buy cheap alcohol so that's an improvement
Wait what another one
4 now
Yeah bro check google maps
Yo there's 4 now 2 Tallinn 1 Tartu 1 Narva
If you don't cook, you don't eat, if you don't eat you die
Regardless of your desires and skill you will be made to learn how to cook by necessity or die in the first months of university as you left your parents
I really struggled with it until I realised that I don't wear dress shirts so I have literally no reason to iron, only did it because my mother irons everything, completely useless if you ask me
I still think we often consider each other neighbours
Whenever we have comparisons about how 'the neighbours' are doing, Lithuania is always there
I the capital, you have traffic jams and commute that takes more than 20m. Higher salaries, higher living costs and all these typical things
But as we are a small country, I think the main difference is that you don't know so many people personally, and therefore it is more difficult to organize many things
In a small town, stuff is often easier or cheaper because your friends mother owns the place you want to rent and your other friends uncle works at that catering you want to order foods from and the theatre director is your friends older brother etc, everybody knows someone who knows someone
We don't really have major drug dealers
[Our police mostly just attacks kids for having a spliff
Even I've heard of him, saw stuff about him on some Netflix show
Most likely the territories that were heavily Russified during the Soviet occupation
Bring foreigners in and give them expectations that they are now glorious colonizers, then they will seek back to their glorious motherland after the colonization ends
Saaremaa 100%, people there have always had a problem with authority and by that I mean they had a tendency to rebel and kill all occupiers
They were basically Vikings in the early to mid middle ages
We have purple
Blue is pretty common too
Sometimes you'll see black aswell
Here, up to around 4 or 5 or so, parents stay at the party
It would be unreasonable to think the parents of the birthday kid can manage to take care of all the other kids as well as their own
same here, except when it's a toddler party or something, when you kind of need a parent for each kid because otherwise it would be very chaotic
usually the parent just takes their kid to the party and later picks them up again
I think we had precisely 1 lesson in a book in 7th-8th grade dedicated to dialect words from different parts of the country and the fact that shouldn't use them unless it's an informal conversation
Ukrainian dialects have been largely homogenised over the last century with only a few odd words surviving in the areas outside of the west ukraine
West Ukraine on the other hand, as it has the Carpathians, is still a home to a few "highlander dialects like Lemko/Boyko/Hutsul etc
which differ greatly from the modern literally ukrainian, they sound quite similar to what everyone talked like in early 20th century before the language was standardised again under Russian bias in 1930s.
I love every kind of fish sandwich
Favorite is kiluleib
Looking at the most common route, taking a train for \~200km is \~10€ if you buy full price and \~7
50 for a student
It is relatively inexpensive
Buses can be both cheaper and more expensive for the same distance, depending on the carrier, the time of the day and also on how comfy and how quick it is
Yes, bicycles are basically allowed on all trains, the warning just shows where it's not recommended due to a bigger amount of passengers etc, but afaik you can take a bike on any train, they all have the holders etc
But I didn't know they'd be regarded as fast tbh
They are fast enough for me, but not especially high-speed, that 200km with a few stops takes 2h.
In few years when Tallinn-Tartu rail is electrified and Elron buys more electric trains it will be cut to around 1h 30min
The point is that it's not like cities/towns of our size have faster trains operating between them anywhere in Europe
We can see high speed trains, but they operate between far bigger cities
Yeah, for any foreigners to know, the "cities" we connect over here are like 440 000 people and 95 000 people - and that's for the biggest two, the rest have less than 55 000 people
The Ministry of Education is in Tartu, just about everything else is in Tallinn
Tõde ja õigus (Truth and Justice)
It's about a guy who bought some farm land to raise his family on, but the soil turns out to be total crap, his wife dies, and he keeps getting into fights with his neighbour
They recently made a film adaption of it, which is actually quite good
Always imagined Germans as those orderly people who follow the rules, EXCEPT reality differs
When I was in Germany,in every city i've been to, German pedestrians don't follow the traffic code at all,they don't wait for the green light,they cross the street wherever they like it and I'm honestly surprised i didn't see any car accidents during my stay in the country
I am really happy with our disposable income atm
Granted, we are a couple with no kids, getting 30 any day now and both have a Masters degree, so atm we are well off
Bought an apartment a few years ago, slowly planning on getting a house in a few years, my s.o. is interested in economy and money, so pretty active with investment stuff by now and also gives me advice on that matter
I do feel that we have achieved a lot considering that we both come from really poor families, like parents earning about minimum wage and nobody else in our immediate families had a Uni degree etc - so we have not had an easy start, no mommies getting us a job or networking for us, but the good education system and social system **really** help out a lot if you're smart and/or hardworking
In estonia its low and getting lower, personally
I dont have any pocket money since my parents rarely give me any (im 16) . I dont even have a credit card
>Europeans have a lot less incentive to save and invest than Americans
That is not entirely true
We don't have same pressure as in America, but saving and investing is still very important, especially if you plan to buy property
Also, pretty ironic to hear that from swede, when 75% of adult swedes invest in funds
>Afaik it includes work related pension plans
No, that figure specifically included only investments outside mandatory pension plans
>Few people actually save up to buy
I didn't mean saving to buy as in save 100% of house value(obviously very few people do that, though even I personally know some who did so), however even for mortgage you need to save up 10-20% downpayment
I don't think he was talking about median wages, but rather about above average wages
100k+ wages for top specialists pretty much don't exist in Europe
Average return on market over last 20 years is 10%. It's higher than average inflation (which is around 2-4%)
Over time with compound interest investing is smartest choice
At the very least you're not losing your money to inflation, realistically you're growing it
Even without any additional contributions money invested now after 10 years will grow in real value two times
>So your investment 10 years ago at best would not have decreased
I mean, it's much better than losing half of that saved money value to inflation if this money would be just staying on bank account
As an Estonian
perkele
Pfft hard to tell really, probably the national station ETV as it has lost the least viewers in the past decade, young folk don't really watch TV anymore, certainly not live
ETV (Eesti Televisioon; Estonian Television)
Main TV channel of the Eesti Rahvusringhääling (Estonian National Public Broadcasting)
Number 1 is ETV(Estonian Television) and 2 is ETV2
Both are state funded Channels that are free for everyone and don't have ads
People don't watch tv much anymore and commercial channels have lost huge amout of viewers while ETV has lost the least
Does not matter - all channels are losing but ETV is still so much more popular that it is not even funny
Weekly 10 most popular shows are usually all from ETV
We can create words that just go on forever
Jäääär (jää+äär) -  the edge of ice, kuuuurija (kuu+uurija) - observer of the moon or my favorite -  "kuuliteetunneliluuk" (kuuli+tee+tunneli+luuk) or in (somehow) translation - the hatch for the path for the bullet
Fun fact, that word is the same no matter what way you read it
Ah, a fellow Finno-Ugric language, we know the feeling
You wanted to mess with outsiders learning your language so much, you screwed yourself
You wrote it slightly wrong, forgot 'lennu'. So it would actually be "Kuulilennuteetunneliluuk" (Kuuli+lennu+tee+tunneli+luuk)
The translation is slightly wrong but I might just be nitpicky now
I'd translate it as, "The hatch for the tunnel that the bullet is flying in
The direct translation word for word would be, "Bullet flight path tunnel hatch
This isn't really a word, moreso that it's a quirk of stitching words together
But it's fun either way
Damn, I forgot the lennu, thanks for the correction
But yea, its just absurd and funny haha
We also spell it "idee" =D  plural is "ideed"
Most people seem to think estonia has wifi everywhere and even the woods
not true at all
Eh, in most places it's just free (taxes), in Estonia primary school was free and in high school it was like an euro a day
>you would have to pay for it
Here in Estonia until 10th grade food in school is free (well, "payed by taxes", but free on the spot for kids)
I havent seen them, or you were talking about me
No, at least as far as I know
I dont think it is
A lot of people eat while walking
" In every port around the world, you will find at least to estonians " ( it went on about gathering news or something but anyway
) this is kinda bitter-sweet for me
On the one hand estonians are around the world and wherever I go I can find them but also that indicates a brain drain, people leave and don't do good work in Estonia
uhhh Kerli from the pop scene maybe
she has her own songs, but she also wrote "Skyscraper" for demi lovato
and Arvo Pärt from the classical music genre
No one really
The only one who has *some* fame in some circles is [Arvo Pärt] I.e classical music
He's (supposedly) the most performed living composer in the world
Example:  (this specific song has been used in quite a few movies)
No Contact
That's sad
Estonians really keep to themselves, you can say hi and bye to the bus driver but just passing someone, no
You thank the bus driver in Estonia only on intercity buses, but that's mainly because you often leave from the front door or the driver will have to give you your luggage
no way omg that sounds horrifying
i do that when i walk past someone i know (if they also notice me), but not to strangers
I see what you did there
I like to hear Spanish, they seem to speak with a lot of emotion and really quick from time to time
Also Finnish, because it sounds beautiful
Any German, Russian, Swedish, Danish, Polish political ruler in the past 800 years
Hmm, long list
Not much bad, actually, just the same as most others did
You held southern Estonia for about 60-70 years
But I imagine there was quite the animosity towards any foreign rule - you owned the area at a time where the Estonians were split between three countries, known (creatively) as the Three Kings' Era
You may have not but it absolutely happens, particularly online, there are friends with whom up to 80% of communication is in English
I have to agree with you, when I was a wee lad so around 15 years ago our language was far less affected by English than it is now
>  If you learnt everything in a junior cert Irish textbook you would be very close to fluent and be quickly able to become very fluent
But you see almost nobody learns to speak a language in school, this applies to every language
There are these bastards here too who just refuse to use Estonian even though they can actually speak it rather well
Forest brothers
They were guerillas who lived in the forest
2009
Now is the best time for Estonia, but 2009 because I would get in on Bitcoin on the ground floor and bet on major events I remember
Lets see
10 years ago we had financial crisis, in 90s we transitioned from socialism to capitalism and were overall quite poor, 30 years ago we were under soviet rule, before that ww2 and nazi occupation, in 30s under local authoritarian "strong man", in 1900s-1920s - revolutions, ww1, part of russian civil war, recovering from war
Earlier - under Russian, Swedish, German, Danish, Polish rule
I think I will stick to current day
One party hovering close to 50% in polls alone is a very dangerous sign in a democracy, especially in a country where there's no dual-party system
>There's no way extremist or heavily populist politicians can have a large hand in determining policy even if they receive more votes than usual in an election
We're currently experimenting with that in Estonia, and unfortunately, the loud ranters continue to dominate over the other coalition partners
It has stopped the populist party's surge in polls because they actually have to govern the country, but my god, what a shit job they are doing and their ratings are not falling
So it's a so-so result
Half of a store, its a tiny version and a place to pick up stuff from there Web-store
We all agree that we are in the baltic, the rest is opinion, so heres mine
We arent nordic, we share nothing with them except the finns, we more or less belong to the eastern european region
Latvia and Lithuania are brothers (and Estonia and Finland are brothers) but Latvia and Estonia have been roommates for quite a while
Sharing a lot of history and even territory (Livonia)
Rocks
don't tell the italians
The only puzzling thing is the red area to the right (with the red backing and plastic/aluminum chairs - all the other chairs are quite fancy wooden ones)
[Mu isamaa on minu arm] was seen as the unofficial anthem when singing our real anthem was forbidden during the Soviet occupation
[Ta lendab mesipuu poole] and [Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään] are also very iconic
Tbh it's hard to pick just a few, we have a lot of well known patriotic songs
Mu isamaa on minu arm (my homeland is my love)
It was often sang as a protest to soviet rule and it was considered to be made the official anthem in the 90s.
"Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään"
The one from the life of Brian
Next thing you are going to tell me that the Ministry of Silly Walks actually exists
How did you manage to forget Koit by Tõnis Mägi
would also add "Isamaa ilu hoieldes", though it's a bit more modern
latvia and lithuania are basically the same
'Almost similar' is a very subjective thing
I’d say Estonia and Finland, Russia and Belarus, Germany and Austria, Latvia and Lithuania, Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania, Greece and (Southern) Cyprus, Portugal and Spain, UK and Ireland
Quite many are different in Estonian:
- 1 (H) - Vesinik
- 6 (C) - Süsinik
- 7 (N) - Lämmastik
- 8 (O) - Hapnik
- 14 (Si) - Räni
- 16 (S) - Väävel
- 26 (Fe) - Raud
- 29 (Cu) - Vask
- 47 (Ag) - Hõbe
- 50 (Sn) - Tina
- 51 (Sb) - Antimon
- 79 (Au) - Kuld
- 80 (Hg) - Elavhõbe
- 82 (Pb) - Plii
- 83 (Bi) - Vismut
Then there are many others that includes letters that are not represented in the Estonian name, but are still somewhat logical, for example they might have K, H or Ts instead of C, F instead of P, Ts instead of Z, I instead of J, Ks instead of X, Ü instead of Y, V instead of W, or for example Rhodium (Rh) is Roodium and Thorium (Th) is Toorium
They are horrible in English, I am doing my current degree in English and the only thing that annoys me is the constant translating of element names in my head, it's not automatic yet
It makes so much more sense for Na to be Naatrium (in Estonian) than sodium (???) etc
We have same thing in Ukrainian:
Hydrogen - Voden' (Water-thing)
Carbon - Vuhlets' (Coal-thing)
Oxygen - Kysen' (Sour-thing)
Parts of Northeastern Estonia went through massive Russification during the Soviet occupation, so nowadays the situation looks like [this] Their youth definitely still speaks Russian
And although many younger Russians in Northern Estonia are more integrated nowadays, the ones in Northeastern Estonia are often poorly integrated and don't speak Estonian well
Well, there are many dialects but they all pretty much fall into 2 categories: South and North Estonian
North Estonian is the standard
South Estonian is so weird and I think I understand Finnish better than South Estonian
"Tee tööd ja näe vaeva siis tuleb armastus" (Do work then love will come) from A.H.Tammsaare
It's often said, altough it's quite interesting as the direct quote seems to have a meaning that hard work will pay off and not to give up
However everyone who has actually read the book and isn't too ignorant (not everyone) knows that in the book the love didn't come and the whole working to death basically was the tragedy of the novel
E: also from ex-president Lennart Meri "the situation is shit, but it's the fertilizer of our future"
"Work hard and love will follow" A.H. Tammsaare from  "Truth and Justice"
We will not qualify like always
Couldn’t care less though
Because it was the biggest city and generally already considered the main city of estonia
Some country side bus lines are free for everyone
Go to Tartu instead of Tallinn though
Its better

I feel like Spain should allow a free and well-organized referendum (maybe with a 60% or 2/3 threshold for independence)
I’m pretty sure such a referendum would fail and the whole legitimacy problem would be solved

I mean, they are quite populous, no need for higher concentration
ee, leader of finnish government is sdp
I do not like your rhetoric
They can be young or old, men or woman
I do not supporst any gender quotas and I don’t think that all women who get any position should be celebrated as heros as it is done
sorry, I see right wing government as a good thing:)
and by “right” right wing I mean socially conservative and economically liberal
And I know Macron is trying to do neccessary reforms, but it’s France :( (unions and shit)
I would love Sipilä’s government to come back
I know it is not possible after last elections
Tried to do the neccessary reforms
Impossible now I think
First thing I read about Rinne’s goverment was - they are gonna raise social spending
oh, ok, how the f did that turnaround just happen
I agree my initial phrase was based on emotion
But europe needs less left wing and more right wing touch at the moment in my opinion
well, my problem is - too many social liberals and too less economy ones
Portugal and Italy definately need their own Macron to cut spending and state sector
Liberals in american sense are socialists (SDP) in Europe I guess
And many green parties also fall into that category
It is argued that europe’s problem is too much socialism, the economy is not sustainable like this

Estonian here
Always looking closely for that little bit darker color than Latvia and Lithuania
There is no cultural divide, but there certainly is a socio-economic divide
True, just a few weeks ago there was a game of Jeopardy in Estonia, with so-called "wise-man round", all previous champions etc
Usually they got like 90-95% questions right
Then there was the Albania round
0 out of 5
Complete and utter lack of any knowledge about Albania
Damn, Russias getting all of it
We here in Estonia don't get any of it sadly
Snowing in communism
you're a pretty great lad yourself
Having not to pay 25% tax on something is a subsidy, you don't get money back, but
you have to pay less, so, a subsidy, that costs money to the state
What do they want the governments to do exactly
“Change the world” is a really vague slogan
Kids don’t understand that these changes have consequences that they don’t have to deal with yet
Going renewable means your expenses go higher
Raising petrol prices or instituting a car tax will raise your expenses
We saw how people react to these changes in France
Everyone wants a magic fairy to save the world but no one has any real solutions
That’s why no one takes these kids seriously
Estonians can be identified by their handsomeness
The Estonian in the sketch also is very similar to the common look in Estonia at the time
Like [here] a famous singer after the war
Yea for me the estonian looks the most familiar and also the latvian is pretty good
Many estonian criminals must've not gotten caught because of this tiny inaccuracy
>*extermally* mixed
Bloody hell, that sounds ominous
Few
For example forest brothers killed hundreds of Soviet soldiers
I mean Soviets didn't like it so I think it counts as a crime
I'm not sure tho
It's way too gradual to make such bold conclusions, but Estonians have intermixed a lot with Germans and Balts, while Finns have a stronger genetic drift
Estonians are still the most closely genetically related to them, but more distantly than say Latvians are to Estonians
Yeah we may be similar to Finns in language/culture, but our looks are quite distinctly different
We can usually tell if someone is a Finn or not
That one is a bloody good anecdote though
Erm, you are mixing up terms
These are ethno-linguistic groups, so these ethnicities are defined by language
Estonians and Finns are the related ethnicities and Latvians and Lithuanians are the other related ethnicities with the two groups not being related
Their genetic relations are far more complex of course
No, you still don't get it
These ethno-linguistic groups still are ethnically related while Finns and Estonians are not ethnically related to Latvians and Lithuanians, while their genetic relation might be more complex
You are making it look like Estonians and Latvians are ethnically related, which they are not, regardless of any genetic similarities
Of course they are entirely different things
Depends what kind of research
If they do genetic research, then they go into genetics, but if they do any kind of linguistic or cultural research, then they go into linguistics and culture
Most ethnic groups in Europe identify themselves by language - essentially nobody identifies by common genetics
I think you might be missing something in your understanding of basic concepts
Estonians, Dutch people, Latvians, Greeks, Finns - they are all ethnic groups, specifically ethno-linguistic groups, who all have their own cultures
Americans on the other hand are not an ethnicity, they are a nationality - in Europe these are mostly interchangeable as most European states are based on a single ethnicity where other ethnic groups are in a minority
That's why you can be an Estonian in the Netherlands without being a Dutch, but while you can be an Italian in the US and an American by nationality, you won't be an American by ethnicity
Of course with the US and with the New World in general it can be even more nuanced as most Italian Americans are Anglicized peoples and speak American English as their native language and they have retained varying levels of Italian culture
I am not saying any of that, you just seem to have a very weirdly unknowledgeable understanding of what an ethnicity is
It's a sense of common group belonging, either due to common language (ethno-linguistic group), common religion (ethno-religious group), common regional identity (ethno-regional group) etc
Common background is a key aspect of them indeed, but it's not about some ethnic purity, but about common background, i.e. common linguistic or religious or whatever roots
>then parts of the countries are per definition ethnically related
Other than people of mixed families - no, they are not ethnically related peoples
Estonians are a subgroup of Uralic people and Latvians a subgroup of Indo-Europeans
Uralic people and Indo-Europeans are not ethnically related
Germanic people and Balts are ethnically related because both of them are subgroups of Indo-Europeans - this is why Dutch people and Latvians are ethnically related, but neither of them are ethnically related to Estonians
Yet genetically Latvians are much more closer to Estonians than to Dutch people due to millennia of living next to each other
But these are two very different concepts
Trump supporter here
Have to admit, the french are far better in political maneuvers, centuries of games
And I did support Le Pen, but now that Macron pulled that off, I kinda respect him
Didn't expect that all

love how estonia and latvia look the same

I mean Poland is making abortions illegal even when woman is raped, so I'm pretty sure that unfortunately same sex marriage won't be legal there any time soon
Of course you know, but what do you think about it, will people riot or something
This seems like such a big issue, like how is it even possible in EU
Wow, great, another chance for the "comedians" of reddit to say how bad 2020 is
Not like it's been played out since April
In Estonia whole winter this year is basically a 90 day November and currently it is storming outside
Minus 5 in Vardø. Quite unusual in February
I will never forget that three hours of winter this winter
Cold and rainy

Stop being deliberately misleading
Macron sucker punched LePen in the throat and threw her down a staircase head first and her neck snapped at the bottom
What a wonderful result for France and Europe
Pretty picture is not an argument
Comprehensive studies with actual numbers and scenarios behind it would be
If only train travel was any good here
2026 can't come faster
First we need proper train infrastructure
Travelling on train takes much longer time than plane (difference can be up to 10x if traveling from one side of Europe to other), some parts of EU are outright cut from others in terms of railway system (only option for Baltic countries and Finland to travel anywhere far enough are by plane)
FYI there are several railway developments ongoing but they're mostly interrupted by the locals, so go figure
This is exactly why I support Rail Baltica, which has become quite controversial in my country
Same for HS2 in the UK
So pretty pictures and unfounded feelings should drive policy logic and data be damned
By the number of upvotes you have gotten it seems they do
Where is your evidence

When Europe went to shit
It's easy to think that things are bad now but 2014/2015 and even 2016 were really bad
We have actually come a long way in Europe and the debates have become more relaxed and although a lot of things changed I feel like we're a bit more reasonable
Even in this sub, I remember that I stopped visiting r/europe for 2 years, it was unbearable
They are certainly not anti-Russian
And I think it´s incredibly dangerous for EU, if the EU approaches this situation as an anti-Russian movement
It just isn´t and trying to portrait it as such simply puts the democratic movement in Belarus into troubles
"Other news on the CNN, Italy has declared war on France and already occupied southern France".

Whats this female perspective exactly for a managerial role in the transport department
Well ... government changes or 'mild-revolutions' take time (and when the time comes it happens super-fast)
Even if this time there is no 100% regime change it drives a point
That point being it encourages the people
Before this Belarus rarely if ever had protests
To now 100,000 or so people getting on the streets
It can be seen a wakeup call for both Luka and the people who so far thought "whats the point
" as you are doing
Some might still stay at home but some might radicalize
But in the end yes, revolutions don't always end up doing anything or even if they do the end isn't always the best result at least in the near-future
It's more of the usual class warfare of more-or-less 1 guy vs the now growing opposition it has
As long as he has the military/police backing him he has real practical tool to surpress the anti-Luka people
It's more so a first time show of force by any real opposition but sadly unless things really escalate Luka could hold on to power
Still again Luka has pinky promised some mild changes as it think it was a public vote and some other possible law changes while with the other hand he is trying to surpress freedom of movement/speech so it's yet to be seen what the end result is or if the opposition gets a bigger voice inside Belarus
I mean my own country saw an opportunity when the power of Moscow was weak and took to the streets
It was a lucky time to protest and show the areas unity
On the backs of those common folk on the streets, they managed to quickly form a local-government of sorts and while Russia then tried to quell the resistance it was too far gone and they simply appeased
While other former block countries did the same but then Russian still had some power and some of those protests became bloody with people getting killed, run over by APC's etc
revolutions can work sometimes but there is no actual "How to regime change" law book so every time it works differently
Sadly, they won't be much cool and peaceful when they die from Covid-19
Ussr was already crumbling by late 80s and Gorbachev didn't want to use force to hold the power forever
Totally different circumstances from todays Belarus

>But it doesn't set the extermination of races as the main goal of its existence
Yeah, only extermination of bourgeoisie, wealthy peasants and "enemies of the state". Guess it's okay if you're deported or killed based on your class instead of your race
> if the Russians did not stop them
Sure
Russians
Let's completely ignore these nations that were conquered by the Red bastards and forcibly drafted into Red Army
I can't believe these guys are actually defending Soviets for "freeing" us
At this point everything was better than Soviets, even Germans
USSR made demands to Finland and still invaded it multiple times, yet this pinko defends them wholeheartedly
I guess they really can't comprehend our reality, since they lived their merry and trouble-free life up in the North
It's easy to judge if you don't care, want or can't see history from our POV
That would be somewhat true (although still as horrific) if soviets gave the chance to "change class" as you said
But they never did
Once you were on their list of "enemies of the state" (and the list was numerous - cossacks, clergy, member of literally any party except communist, middle- and wealthy peasants
) there was not turning back
Even worse - with time definitions of who is on the list became arbitrary and random
Literally anyone could end up on the list, you could be the most loyal to the state, but NKVD could still execute you to fill the quota of "traitors". Great purge of 37-38 annihilated tens of thousands high ranking communists and red army officers
And also Soviets didn't shy away from terror based on ethnicity, since many ethnicities were seen as fifth column of hostile forces (sounds familiar, doesn't it
I wonder what those poor Estonian veterans, who were unfortunate enough to be forcefully drafted into German army, would have though of this statement
Remember *Czech Hell*? Sounds equally bad, doesn't it
Now, what would it make your ancestors
You're retarded, aren't you
These are bold words and assumptions coming from a Swede, who's own people and government supported Germans during the war by supplying them with iron
And later, during the Cold War sent Soviet refugees back to USSR just for them to be sent straight to Gulag to be torture and killed
Did I really have to remind you of this again
So, "that guy" is *probably* you instead
Sharing is caring
The same articles get posted all the time
The false narrative of that has been debunked countless of times, but the commies don't care
It doesn't say Hitlerism
There are no people in this thread yelling that True Nazism has never been tried and it was just excesses of one man
Alliance with Nazis was an expansion plan for the Soviet Union too
The difference comes from people actually putting it in practice or attempting to and people just cosplaying
Actual attempts always call for terror of the proletariat and all sorts of other nasty things like scapegoating
They have such a firm belief that it will all be worth it in the future
This is in direct contrast with systems, where freedom and pluralism are central
China is not the one protesting these things in Europe
It is eurocommies and Russia
>of course what they did differs from "a textbook definition"
The "textbook" prescribed totalitarian violence, terror and even genocide of unworthy nations

There were tons of movies made about WW2 in Ussr, some of them very high quality
And they worked very well in terms of propaganda - many people in post-soviet countries believe to this day that Ussr defeated Germany alone and allied contribution was almost non-existent
Problem is - barely any of those movies were shown on the western side of the Iron curtain
Western people were just not affected by this propaganda
For an entire year, UK was the only nation at war with Germany
If it wasn't for their resolve, the war would've certainly ended differently
Well, it's kinda hard to do when both sides tried to not let the other sides propaganda thtough
The American war films werent shown in Ussr either
- 9/11: 2,605 US citizens per 285,082,000 people (2001 figures) = 1 victim per 109 436 people;
- MH17: 193 Dutch citizens (incl
dual citizens) per 16,865,000 people (2014 figures) = 1 victim per 87 383 people
Indeed, the Netherlands had a proportionally bigger victim count

Thank god
I go to the city centre by using public transport, but I will not get rid of my car, because I want to travel freely, like, going to the countryside, visiting grandparents or our summerhouse
And when buying groceries I will also go by car, because
I have it already
I take public transport when I need to go to the city centre, or when I plan on getting drunk somewhere :D
Going to the office was easy, I lived next to the office building, by accident
But will change jobs soon, so again, going by car, but I already dread the traffic in the evening leaving the office, a bus goes also there directly, but then I'd have to walk \~15 minutes to the bus stop, then travel by bus etc
Going by car will be faster, but more stressful
At least I can look forward to the summer when I can go with my bicycle or motorcycle
The only hope for the no-car idealists is when public transport is so easy and fast and comfortable, that young people don't want to buy cars anymore
You can't force someone who already has a car to abandon it
Maybe it won't get used as much
Also, my brother is having a baby and will buy a car soon because of that
Even though they live near the city centre and their parking situation is very bad
Great own a car but do you need to take it to the city on short trips
You're then just limiting the ability for cyclists and pedestrians
Yea sure it's cool to own a car but cars are wasteful, no fighting that
Im happy that you live in a place where cars everywhere arent a problem but Im honestly done with trying to solve puzzles in my head just to walk in the city and not get run over
It's not normal that in the city center the walkpath just stops and you have to continue your walk through a parking lot
I honestly wish that my city's goverment would pull it's head out of it's ass and start doing the same thing
Now they have just greated more and more space for cars for years and wow guess what, the traffic is still shit
This is some dystopian shit, i would never be okay with it
Terrorism seems to be really working
The values that we need to fight for are the values of liberty, it's easy to pacify a country but to actually have such a region like Europe is a miracle in history
Im appalled that this needs to be said in r/europe
Funny how you say that, I know some Danes that moved to Estonia and say they like it a lot more
It’s not crowded, we actually have nature, good standards of living, and nobody beheads anyone
Not strange at all, if you think about it
Small number of them, dispersed over the country instead of concentrated in specific areas, means they will assimilate with the wider society instead of forming an insular community where extremist views can get reinforced
And also because of the low numbers, it is not really worth it for radical organizations to spend resources on targeted recruitment here
The extreme peace and cooperation
Of course we want safety but why are you want to give away your freedom to get it
This is just quite an Orwellian comment if you think about it
Id argue that the whole humanity people have seeked liberty despite it being more dangerous
Definitely something has to be done but through sustainable policies not surveliance and yes the first one is hell of a lot more complicated
And yes maybe through surveilance etc we get rid of extremism(which i doubt) but do you think you'll get your liberties back
The data doesn't back your argument up
It's a combination of your confirmation bias and the fact that you have better access to news today than you did 15 years ago
With the internet and social media, every example of death by police has a much higher likelihood of reaching you so it serves to paint a false narrative compared to the past
Think to yourself: would the recent MAGA hat teenager story have blown up the same way 20 years ago or is it completely a result of our clickbait media era where people do minimal to none fact checking as it's all about getting the story out as fast as possible
Without the internet, newspapers would have till the next morning to make adjustments so doing proper research into their stories served as an incentive as people value quality
Nowadays getting a story out takes 2 minutes and if you fall behind competitors you're losing readers
That’s a whole lot of words just to say you’re wrong anyway
It’s a downward trend, or at worst, an even trend
Damn, everybody is suddenly a cheese expert
You do understand that it's Russia pushing Europe and Europe pushing Russia *back*, right
You sound like Europe should stop pushing Russia back
I am afraid problem is not just oil&gas, there are also major business interests in Russia

Now if fixed radars detect you doing +3kmh and moving radars (on police cars) detect you doing +7 they don't register it as violation
I agree if I first saw this in my news it sounded like the dumbest thing ever
They are basically treating the dribers as school kids giving them a time out if they behave bad

I doubt such a referendum would work here today, especially after the populist conservative party has been fighting against said rights
There's a lot for us to learn from Ireland, as well
So the first is “Perseauk”, I’m not too sure about the second one but should be “Türa lits ära piilu minuga ei maksa norida” which means “Fucking bitch, don’t look/peek, it’s not a good idea to pick a fight with me” and the third is “Kusen su ema hauale”
None of them is too widely used tho
"Perseauk", "Türa lihtsalt minuga ei maksa norida (smth like that)" "Kusen su ema hauale"
Very good, you are well equipped
I think static automatic radars “red line” is “x7”(by gps)
Late 90's was a different time
Come visit again if you haven't. /r/Eesti if you have questions
/self-designated PR department
Well, “Türa” means basically fuck and “Lits” means bitch, so from “Türa lits” we get “Fucking bitch”
“Ära piilu” means “Don’t peek” or “Don’t look”,
“Minuga ei maksa norida” is the harder part
“Minuga” is “With me”, and “Ei maksa” is literally translated to “Doesn’t cost,” but in this context it would mean “Isn’t worth” and “Norida” basically means “Pick a fight,” so from this we get “It’s not worth it to pick a fight with me
So we get “Fucking bitch, don’t peek, it’s not worth it to pick a fight with me”
Well, he was really pissed off about it and all the media attention so in that case the fine had a good effect
Türa (or tra) is a pretty common word, but is mainly used by itself, it's more of a fuck than fucking
'Türa küll' is pretty much 'for fucks sake', 'tra sa teed' is 'what the fuck are you doing' etc
Vitt (vitt-vitu-vittu) is another popular word and is used rather similarly
Vitupea was popularised by a short film and means fuckhead
Mida vittu - what the fuck

Black represent dirt iirc
Actually the colors really dont have any meaning, its just interpitation also a petition for lithuania to use their old grand duchy flag
"New flags" is quite a fancy term for old flags that were simply banned during the Soviet occupation

love your artstyle
That's an interpretation invented during the Internet era, it's not historical, nor something official
No, that's just a coincidence
Blue represents the sky above our land, black the soil and our bleak history, and white purity and hard work
>Black represent dirt iirc
Officially the colours don't represent anything and the supposed symbolism was invented later
Same in Estonian Valgevene
I think Croatia might be Trans-*[Istria]
The idea of Latvian flag is almost as old as the idea of the Austrian flag - from the 13th and 11th century respectively
Rich and bountiful soil
More like "soil", which is value no
1 for recently emancipated former serfs
Wdym "too communist" it literally has been used for most of your history and its literally your coat of arms
Our flag was definitely not, nor was our state
You never used it as a national flag since the beginning of the 20th century, but only as a state flag (which is a secondary category)
>But Austria still had the idea first
Pretty safe to say that the Latvian idea was by no means affected by the Austrian idea
>and having 2 flags that similar will just confuse everybody
Lol, you haven't been paying attention to flags outside Europe
Its rad
>or the Moldovan
Well, that's what happens if you violently cut a country in two
Thats just dumb, that flag was around before communism was a thing, it represents lithuania when it was strongest
We, latvia and lithuania had our blues with communism and russians and so we detest communist symbols, but to associate the color red with communism is too far fetched, and again frankly dumb
Maybe lithuania had their reasons to choose the current flag over the old one but i dont know

Where's the Russian flag
The biggest enemy for the Russian people has always been their government
Literally every third former Soviet country is now an "enemy" for them
Tells you a lot about their "friendly" and "mutual respect" based foreign policy
Meanwhile, totalitarian dictatorships like Turkmenistan or North Korea
Nah, they're all buddies, considering they share more values with Russia
How are we behind Latvia and Lithuania
I call foul play
At least we finally managed to pass Georgia
Ah yes the 1940 Estonian brutal occupation of Russia
And who could forget that the estonians deported the russians into võru
My oh my How brutal the Estonians were to the russians
Of course we hate russia when they're sending their goddamn spies in our countries and kidnap our people to get their agent back
I'd say Russia and Russians have been a lot unfriendlier to me my whole life
Only actually met 3 or 4 nice Russians in my 30 years of life
Terrified Russia is going to try and annex Estonia as some point (again)
Ohh no, anyways
"You damn Czech people, complaining when we blow stuff up in your country
Ugh
so unfriendly
Sadly this is literally literally the reasoning Russian politics sometimes have
We did something bad but you also reacted bad so ergo you are bad
But we were actually "taken" by NATO according to Russia
Not like local people actually wanted to join an organization that would protect from a empire next door who, in various names, has shown aggression towards us right
Like every year they lambast us for "NATO drills", well technically true
They fail to mention that, as we are in NATO like 95% of those "NATO troops" are Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians
Our own troops
in our country
doing drills
Like it's so ridiculous that I can't even fathom someone in Russia going like "Yup, NATO brought in tens of thousands of soldiers again into the Baltics to piss us off and oppress the locals
Just out of curiosity what'd be the ideal Russia in your opinion
* Belarus (the illegitimate dictatorship, not the people)
* China
* Kazakhstan
That's kinda it, really
Same here in Estonia
Tbh We Estonians would still be quite suspicious of russia
I think our prime minister must answer to that question on next meeting in parliament
She probably is already preparing overview about who and in what point did mistakes what leaded to this disgrace, and what are our government plans to fix those shortcomings
Also congratulations to our southern sisters for winning us this time
The horror
The horror
My grandmother has told me the tales about Võru
apparently she was forced to wear a bracelet around her wrist
Guess they didn't like when we joined N.A.T.O. and E.U. after the Soviet "Union"
I don't think we want to be in any kind of union with you guys
Your money is always welcome here though
According to 2019, 44% of non-Estonians(ethnicity) supported NATO
Data suggests that the better assimilated into Estonian society the people are, the more they support NATO
Among age groups the lowest is noncitizens 40-59 and highest among people under 30
Mood
Same
You don't get it
You are just a worthless pawn in the game of the big boys
You don't decide anything, your vote in the Estonian so-called elections mean nothing
You are effectively controlled by America
Big boys like Russia can make their own decisions
The fact that you live slightly better than some other post-Soviet countries (but definitely worse than Russians) is only because your parasitic economy is being fed by the West, but not for long
Soon (TM) you will come crawling back and beg Russia to annex you, because you need to survive somehow
Also, don't bring any quality of life, economic development, wage level, human development, education, life expectancy or any other similar statistics, because these are all fake CIA fabricated numbers to make Russia look bad
The truth is everybody is envious of Russia
Ooh oooh oooh
putin happened
Speak for yourself, please
Im gonna be honest The ideal russia in my eyes as a foreign estonian is a Russia divided into multiple constitutional monarchies
Kazakhstan is kind of a classical dictatorship case as in their foreign policy avoids confrontations at all costs and extra attention is paid to internal policy
Therefore, Kazakhstan tries to avoid choosing sides, but will do the minimum necessary to show Russia it's on board
Russia is an extremely important economic partner for Kazakhstan, so they can't really afford a stand-off either
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan has become more vary of Russian influence and is trying to strengthen the national identity and language
This to an extent just enough to not irritate Russia too much, e.g. Russia remains an official language, so Russia isn't really in a position to take a political stance on Kazakh language
I mean Transylvania is a part of EU now so you never know
Might be hope for you guys yet
I don't hate Russians
I do hate your Governments
I have no idea how the hell you always get the worst ones
You have to do something to fix it
I have no idea what
I'd agree if i Were a citizen myself
Too bad that I am shit in drawing
You can literally google it
TIL she has a sister
Mate, we had all the snow melt in a few days, it's depressing as all hell
It can't be worse than +40 in central France like it was a few years ago can't it
Dictatorship is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done (Yeah)
It's all good when you're little, you have kill fun
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run
Looking back Lyudmila always ah mention
Said me not giving her much attention (Yeah)
She was there through my KGB-ation
I wanna show the nation my appreciation
Remove counter strike and put "attempting to" after remember and change planting to plant
"Verito"
My father's school actually had a shooting range in the basement
Yeah, Putin's main opposition is awfully careless around chemicals, right
He kindof has been for years
And what does it mean "as a russian"? That you get your news from government owned channels
Which, might be a suprise, is a European language
European here
Never seen something like that
These are usually used during temporary events and festivals, like porta potties
Stationary public toilets are usually indoors
If you listen closely, you can hear Italy crying in the distance
A tragedy
Many people lost their jobs, the social safety net in East Germany became worse, pension ages rose and now East Germany is a benefactor of NATO imperialism in the Middle East and Afghanistan
Yes the grey aliens For Estonia, Latvia and Belarus
B I G   U K R A I N E
Yes, that's correct, sad when people leave us out of the fun
And estonian workers on south finland
We go to Latvia to buy cheap alcohol, it's a circle of life
Going to get glögi from christmas market in your honour
It's the densest international ferry line in the world with quite huge ships, which themselves have large stores and pubs on them
Getting wasted on these ferries has become part of the culture of both countries
They are going to work abroad so they too can go to another country to buy alcohol
Yes we do, albeit a smaller one focused towards locals this year
And considering Tallinn is like 3rd or 4th in Europe (not too many above them elsewhere in the world, if any at all), it all adds up
Glögi is called mulled wine in English
For us getting to Åland means jumping off/on the Tallinn-Stockholm-Tallinn ferry in the middle of the night and finding yourself in almost empty Mariehamn
I've loved it every time I visit
Lol Sweden would have been a better choice
If this were Estonia, neighbours would be at each others throats all the time about petty issues
ah, finally
no russia and latvia
imagine having red on a flag, couldn't be me
ayyyyy
i dont know that they'd go out and literally start fuel bombing the police though, no
heres a video that covers the general situation [
Turkey is in the EEA
Eurostat disagrees with you:
28 degrees in Rovaniemi, something is very wrong with this weather
I can't understand heat like this living 800 km south of Rovaniemi
It is very odd
I'm from Estonia - we used to have rainy and not very warm summers but this year
even those people who love hot weather are suffering
Some people say that 30 degrees are unbearable here because air here is very humid but I dunno, I just want to die
I love this weather and I hope it keeps getting warmer (as long as every living being doesn't die because of it)
If nothing changes, I guess Svalbard is my only chance to survive
Or maybe South Pole, they say there's a nice chilly weather out there
Yeah, you can
People are used to different temperatures in different places, but I'm sure that almost everywhere climate changes noticeably
I remember in Rome woman who owned the apartment my family stayed in was complaining about "cold" spring
It was 26 degrees in the evening
In Estonia these temperatures are very rare even in the summer, and in the evening it's always less than 20
Well
Fuck
Do you have to pay for penguins in Iceland
Oh, in Estonia we don't have neither of those except our former president
He was a real penguin in a suit, I promise
He was pretty expensive to take care of but he was free to look at
We were the first nation controlled by penguins
And that's only a beginning
*happy estonian noises*
America - "English mofo, do you speak it
Plus it's using damn hieroglyphs so you can't even read it if you haven't learned it
This made me plan to go to EU elections this May for the first time
Hopefully no one from Estonia voted for this bullshit, but if someone did - they are not going to get my vote in May
I am truly sorry on behalf of most of Estonia for this utter shitstorm that our dear MEP Andrus Ansip has brought upon us
&#x200B;
Fucking wankers
&#x200B;
Well this fucking sucks, will at least VPNs work
Wait, so  does article 13 mean that Memes will get copyrighted or whats the problem
>Blame the politicians and goverments who pushed this shit through, not the the EU
It's not like those are completely separate things
Those politicians and governments are literally part of EU system after all
It doesn't mean you can't criticize a system that allows such things to happen in the first place
I don't understand how did you come up with the idea that we're against democracy here
So any criticism of a system that involves democratic elections is somehow an attack on democracy now
If I am against some laws or directives that come from democratic system, that doesn't mean I'm against democracy
It's as stupid as thinking that if I'm against poor road conditions, I'm suddenly against having roads altogether
How complicated is that for you
>You can criticize politicians for their decisions
But the politicians don't exist in a vacuum
Their actions are also affected by their parties, ideologies, connections, lobbying
There is more about the EU than just democracy
It’s-20 in Estonia
Honestly it's fine
We're used to it, but more importantly, we're equipped for it - clothing for being outside and heating+insulation for being inside
It was around zero yesterday and -20 today, but absolutely no difference for me inside
Cars start making sad noises below 20, but they almost always work too
Not me, my dorm room has no ventilation, last summer during the heatwave I spent days absolutely naked in the room dying because there was no air moving at all
Yup, it kinda feels like little needles poking your face and you're left thinking why do I live in a place where even the literal air hurts
I'll take dry +40 over that, -40 is just too much to be outside, no matter how many layers you have
Not directly because of the Allies winning but because of how the war ended up and what followed after that the countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland exist today
There are more of them in Central Europe and the Balkans but things were complicated there and I don't have the expertise to deduce which countries started more because of WWI or WWII or due to mostly unrelated conflicts
Go ahead and read The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, you might change your mind
Don't forget the rapes
That description particularly of a single soldier on the Eastern Front is so visceral
Made it seem much worse than Al Quiet on the Eastern Front did at least
The defining question of our generation
Wait, but Iceland is in Europe
Why the LLL on the roof though
Doubt it's standard equipment
This is a vehicle used for fairs/display only
It's probably the most common police vehicle, the most recognisable anyway
No reason not to use it
We don't have muscle cars as part of the police fleet
Besides a few exceptions it's all pretty civilian, like these transporters, Volvo wagons, Skoda RS Wagons, etc
I know they exist but I've never seen one
Yeah, I found that a bit funny when I found out as well
Cringe o'clock in /r/europe again
Tallinn experience is better: the bike lane is a...bike width suicide lane along a major magistrale road, but cars still park there
Happy independence day to our southern brothers
*Estonia wants to know your location*
Water levels are always hard
well, but the whole idea of a sauna is to be hot, I don't think it would feel comfortable to drink an ice cold beer in the sauna
A warm beer will nicely warm your insides up aswell, making the inevitable jump into the cold pond even more enjoyable
Americanization that's why
English is a global language now, seen, found and understood everywhere
Reminds me of the video for a Death Metal song ["Haavad Uulitsal" \(Wounds on a street\)
I don't know what's so cool about swear words
Literally the same in Estonia with Estonians and Russians
It has a "Pre-Covid" flair tho
That's an Estonian band tho
Erm, obviously the same as in Finland
Oh, nvm then
M8, look at My flair
False, Finns would never stand that close to each other
What are rules
Have you got rid of the trees that start right on the tarmac's edge yet
I was thinking of the roads I saw in Masuria actually indeed when I said it
I'd like to point out that if Trump was Putin's spy, or whatever, he wouldn't have killed 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria, 2017
Also, he wouldn't have sold Patriot missile defense system to Poland or started selling LNG to Europe
And I'm speaking this as an Estonian
We live in fear of Russia, yet right now, we feel safer than with Obama
Happy national day cousins
No worries, that's a Pepsi max, so no sugar
One small feedback: this could be done on a single map
It didn't come about without major backlash from backwards fuckwads here either
In fact backlash was enough that for a long long time I wasn't sure if it passed or not
Because then everybody will be gay and it'll spread like a disease /s
This looks like architectural rape, to be honest
It's absolutely disgusting for my sensibilities
That's totally different perspective
If the surrounding buildings are still like that there, this looks so out of place
Damn Russians have to ruin everything
What if the mink version is milder and will limit the spread of the "original" covid
This is a possibility
Viruses tend to evolve to milder and less lethal forms, its basic evolution (no point killing the host) and you can't be infected with both at the same time
>can be a bomb during vaccine development
This is a scary thought
This kind of jump to minks or whatever other animal will happen again and again
You can't stop it
Right now the actions taken are only in the interest of vaccine industry
The depressing thing is the polls don't show much of a shift, in fact PiS lost a bit, while Konfederacija gained, I assume Kofnederacija is even more right wing since it incldues reacitonist parties
For example Wales currently receives around £680 million per year in EU funding
The UK receives £2
2billion per year in structural funding

Only easy and flexible "green" is hydroelectricity and the Netherlands is flat without suitable rivers so there's that
It is not often a question of choices
No matter how much the Netherlands wishes it you can't become like mountainous Austria (63% hydro) with great rivers getting your electricity from hydro
EDIT: just vote to have mountainous terrain, bro
You meant it sarcastically, but there is truth to that
Denmark's electricity system is connected to Scandinavia and the mountains you are looking for are in Norway and Sweden
Again hydro, because hydro is the only on-demand renewable energy
It is not irrelevant
There is one very important thing in electric grid and it is balancing
Wind turbines generate electricity when the wind is blowing and do not generate when it is not
Yet you need a stable supply and that is where the on-demand sources come to play
For hydro you can turn it up or down by regulating how much water hits the wheel and you regulate it to compensate for windy and non windy periods
Norway and Sweden, with being the best land for hydro, has an oversupply of the on-demand capacity
That is why Denmark connected to them can run their oversupply of wind turbines
Cut the connection to the Scandinavian networks and the turbines wouldn't work
So you see
You already described one example of using Norwegian mountains - night excess storage
Other is Norway turning their hydro up and down to match Danish needs
Of course Russians wish the world community and democratic blocks like the EU let the dictators have free reign everywhere, but it is not really up to you
Brits like to drink tea
Finns like sauna
Now go ahead and DESTROY those claims with FACTS and LOGIC too as there are certainly some Brits and some Finns, who do not like these things
Meh
It's a Russian expressing a mainstream view in Russia about what the EU should be in his opinion
An outsiders view saying that the EU should be impotent in hindering Russia and countries like them
Pretty much everyone I compare Estonia with has less AIDS than we do
Thanks Russians
I actually think, if done tastefully its pretty great
&#x200B;
We had a cheap foodstore chain expand to our old town buildings and they had some pretty cool decorations
Like one of their stores is on the cellar level so you have random \~13-15th century stone walls next to the isles, random well spots I guess, simply covered off with see through reinforced glass you can walk on etc
&#x200B;
So its nice to have a functional thing inside old buildings if they keep the decor and somewhat adapt their own style to the place
28c ish in Tallinn today
Spent the whole day in bed sweating and sleeping
Send help (and beer)
I went swimming in the sea yesterday, it was okay
And it is not even July
I'd say anything above 20 is way too hot
I also went swimming and it was quite cold
On average -5°C. According to Wikipedia, the record low is -36,8°C, but that is definitely not the usual winter temperature
And I feel horrible even below -10°C.
They built the museum around him
>PZL Świdnik won't be touched by the courts because it's the rulings party beloved company
Apparently they were touched by someone if some regulation inspector banned their old chairs
Cant some EU courts help with the issue
If I am not mistaken, that's the chain the Night King borrowed to reclaim the dragon
Now it all makes sense
Something is seriously wrong with Germany if they think Russia is more trustworthy than the USA
> Russia is more trustworthy than the USA
This combined with Nordstream 2 and the investments taking place is very worrying
lol
Trump only talks, Putin orders assassinations in the EU
In many ways we even encouraged it
Think about all those times anybody has raised issues about regulations in Europe and how it's stifling
This is often just met with "lol if you can't follow the rules, then your business shouldn't exist". There's no desire to even understand *why* some of these rules are difficult to deal with
The idea doesn't get developed, the company doesn't advance and suddenly we're surprised that all of our computing is run by foreign companies
It's not a viewpoint, companies have no obligation to follow any sort of moral code because it's VERY subjective what is moral behaviour in any given situation
Also I'm pretty sure you don't have to be a cynical person to realize that most moral codes large companies follow are designed for PR purposes
Following laws however is a different matter altogether
Woah dude
Happy independence day, Ukraine
Also nice to see that it's close to my country's reindependence day
Should have called the Netherlands Holland
Alright
its pretty well done lmao
I dont get the Sweden one tho
their insult is that Denmark  has Skåne
Or that Gotland has disappeared
Ughhhh
Low blow but you succeeded for me
99% Invisible has a terrific episode on H-Day
Ah what a beautiful picture without immigrants
Humanitarian reasons based on the flawed theory that increase in their living standards brings forth (classical) liberalism, respect for human rights and all these other nice things
Macron is terrifying here
Most beautiful city in the world, fight me bih
Thats so vultureous
> at least 3 more years
Lol, what are you smoking
While it's of course spectacular that this is the case for an entire city, it really isn't that uncommon
Many modern cities across the world located at coastlines or riversides have their city grounds supported like that
Just a little addition - only 10% of venetian lagoon is open water, rest is wetland covered only by shallow layer of water
So it wasn't like they just made a city in the middle of sea
Still it was an amazing achievment to built a city in such a harsh terrain
>And nobody gives a fuck
Belarus lived 70 years under soviet totalitarian regime and now 25 years under Lukashenko regime
Unfortunately so many years in totalitarian state make people very afraid to go against security forces of the state
But we have seen what you are describing from France and US in the last few years
That doesn't sound as outrageous as what's in this clip
In  not as corrupt countries this is how they greet you if they think you sell weed
Unfortunately it isn't if you've been keeping track the rising power and brutalism of many governments in these regions
kremlin bots hard at work
Best decision ever
What could EU do about any of those issues except sanctions
Unfortunately  none of those countries are in EU or NATO so we can't intervene directly
I do wish though that we would cut energy dependence on Russia
Things like NordStream 2 should be stopped
Being Finnish you should remember the last time orders came from Moscow area
They attacked Finland and blamed it on you guys for starting it
They also had no trouble annexing Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and heaps more during that same period
So what way is it
Without NATO - get attacked, with NATO - get attacked
Historically it wouldn't matter, NATO or no NATO
With current Russian and EU politics there is a "whos cock is bigger" game anyway
Nuking a country in modern ages is not something countries do lightly
We have seen nuclear powers (US, Russia) wage wars, they won't resort to nuking
You would immediately become the worlds hated country if you did that as you would be a threat to everyone
As nukes go it doesn't matter if you are Finland, USA, Russia or some small island republic - nukes don't care how powerful you are and are a threat to the entire world and countries, including Russia
>EU is not a military union
There is a mutual defence clause though for EU
u/JakubMarian also uses regular Kremlin-influenced rhetoric
He has added those random mixed Russian-Estonian ares in Western and North-Central Estonia in order to make the geographically very small Russian-speaking areas "more proportional". The real situation looks like [this]
His maps may look all pretty and that, but they are often horribly shallowly researched
True, but in Estonia, he is doing it entirely arbitrarily
Western Estonia and North-Central Estonia (areas between Tallinn and Northeastern Estonia) have very few Russian speakers
If they are literally using age-old Kremlin rhetoric, then what else is there to say
[Gorgeous]
[Stunning]
[Utterly beautiful]
[Right]
I lived in that house for a short while
It was not
There are no examples of stalinist architecture here, really
A couple of residential houses but you can hardly tell
There was a huge housing crisis up to and including the 70s - my mother grew up in a communal apartment, 11 people per 3 rooms (3 families)
Jesus, that's 68,000 victims more than in Estonia
From the article I'd assume the mutilation happened in Germany
That doesn't sounds like a safe place to live to me
Oh the irony
It looks like a lot of paperwork, but anyone who ever worked with documents will be able to tell that it's not a lot
Especially considering that it must be a pretty big order
I mean my work contract+NDA take about third if not half of papers shown on this pic
I like the wall
We're going to miss you, UK
This is the cherry on top of the suck cake after losing Nicholas Parsons
Sorry that your government is shite
Maybe there's a way to delay the technical leaving
Doubt they would bother anymore
I hope Poles keep giving the middle finger to Soros globalist swine
Wonder if Spanish speaking SA countries will form something similar to the EU
Norway is so cool for doing this
Could you not, many thanks Europe
Thanks for the link - I checked the 50s video in it and it was very inspiring, thoroughly enjoyed it:)
Im reading about this event for the first time and for some reason the Dutch commentators don't seem very positive about it - what is the reason
It seems like a very cool and unique occasion
> Article 7 requires unanimity
Four fifts:
Wth, *111th*??
Cool now I can brag how much better we are than Latvia and all the other countries ranked lower than ESTONIA
What else could it be
There aren't that many countries in Europe
We're gonna start our own nordic club, with blackjack and hookers
Estonia can into nordic
Or Turkey actually behind both Russia and Belarus
> I'm pretty sure my symptoms are just my regular allergy/cold
Try to explain it to people near you when you cough in public transport
It should be a crime to give public spotlight on those "psychics". In Estonia you can see those crooks on TV every day
But they are not confronted
They are local celebrities
It would be awesome if someone were to actually test them and show the public what they really are
Because it's a lie
Eventually people will want to pay these psychics to tell them what they want to hear
And they will pay a lot
Nazi Germany bad, soviet union bad, liberation of auswitch good
There, can we stop the shitshow
Yeah
It's not like the people are usually stepping between every single tile so much to prevent growth
Just mentioning that this thing is not comics
It is caricature
This reminds us that "My parents want to kick me out at 18" and "I have to pay rent to my parents for living at home" are some of the "I'm too european to understand this problem" that we can read about here on reddit, on the subreddits where americans post
Capitalism at its fines
Nothing more to say
Yes, me neither, I just
made a silly joke
Please stop upvoting
Post links to prove it
That's some Russian internet and I am sure getting the color of fake blood right would not be that difficult
Now you are assuming out of the gate that all this was fake and there was no Russian assassination plan
That's the Russian in you thinking it and if you are already thinking that then why wouldn't the evil Ukrainians kill him for real
After all your lot pretends that this is a huge evidence toward Russia didn't do nuffing so just killing that poor SOB would have prevented all that
Ah, finally we have a warm sea
Worth it
So much more sun
What
You are afraid that Latvia will attack Portugal or something
fuck, we're away from russia
I have some bad news for you
At least she changed her style since 1812

> also socialism in Hungary ultimately led to improving workers and farmers lives, at least in a materialist sense
No it didn't. It lead to misery and lost opportunities as did socialism everywhere
It has never worked
Anarchy
Just another day in London
I swear our general area is some of the worst climate in existence
October and November are gray, depressing wastelands and then once it starts snowing and gets cold it won’t leave until like May
Awful, awful weather all the damn time
Only summers are nice sometimes
The shitty climate is one of the many reasons why I can’t wait to get out of this country
The heat is great, I’d love to have 25-30 degrees all year round
Sick and tired of the cold misery here
I liked it
I would rather have it instead of dreaded 5-6 month long grayish winter
But hey, I'm just one of those few freaks who enjoy even +40°C  ))
>We were all cold as balls here in Portugal this weekend
I have always found out that southerners don't really comprehend what "cold" actually is
Around 10 years ago I was in Turkey on vacation in autumn, and when we arrived there, pilot of the plane reported that the weather is sadly "a bit chill". It was +20 outside
More than the average summer temperature here in Estonia
So yeah, it's damn cold here
Right now we have +4 with snow, with 0 at night
We only had above +10 for  a few days, maybe a week this year
What's worse - it's now even always nice winter with bright snow and nice frost
It fluctuates between -10 and +5 for most of the winter, some weeks it's all wet and gray and depressing
For the entirety of the 2 days
That must have been tough
also in the news in Estonia:
Yes
We need another Ice Age so Europe would be bigger
Would solve overpopulation, more resources
> apparently it was fresh enough to be drinkable back then
It's supposedly still kind-of drinkable around the inner areas, [according to these comments
What book would you recommend that I can read to get a better perspective on that war ?
*cries in Monaco*
tbh it's probably Italy
Why russia tho
Many comments right now are by people coming over from these far left subs it was crossposted to
Nazis: Let's invade Western Poland
Commies: Let's invade Eastern Poland
Centrist: Guys ... let's not invade Poland at all
There is a lot of flairless users, few of them posters of /r/europe, but a lot of them not and posting mainly in far left subreddits
I have installed a Reddit Pro Tools chrome extension, the latest version of which makes it very easy to see where the person posts
So see ... it was Nazis and Commies doing the invading and the democracies are guilty of not stoping them
And that means both Nazis and Commies are scum and neocons are the good guys, who should be listened
For some of the most recent ones, this is essentially right after regaining or restoring independence
It made no conscious decision to legalize homosexuality in 1922
It just made a decision to throw out the whole Russian Empire's criminal code and paragraphs against homosexuality went with that

Today is like opposite day as we have Estonians and Latvians like u/toreon and u/LatvianLion making excuses for communism
I really, *really* cannot agree with you
All the supposedly non-authoritarian ideologies that you mentioned are absolutely fringe ideologies that have no relevance in our society
Communism *is* inherently totalitarian and inhumane
>but never about Nazi ones
False
>the participation of local quislings and SS people in various exterminations
Because the Estonian SS units did not participate in any exterminations, this is [a historical fact]
>Why are they holding pride parades if they were forcibly recruited, you ask
Because they fought against the re-invading Soviets
Wow, I really love people talking about stuff they don't know anything about (except through random tertiary sources)

By the way, I, too, can't understand why the Baltics would place more weight on looking at the regimes and crimes that are more relevant for them
It's not like the scale of Soviet crimes in the region was vastly larger in terms of both numbers and length
Oh wait
>Parades of SS veterans
They are just misunderstood people forced to  join the SS
Baltic Waffen-SS (which have very little to do with actual SS except for the name) units were literally declared to be innocent of any war crimes during the Nuremberg
As for the actual collaborators, plenty has been written about them by local historians
Nobody is building monuments to honour the *trawniki* douchebags
>Why are they holding pride parades if they were forcibly recruited, you ask
Siri, what is 'camaraderie'? Why do WW2 vets meet in the West and in Russia
Moreover, nobody - except maybe the Russian state media - calls, for example, the commemoration event for the Battle of Tannenberg Line, a "pride event".
>no the USSR is not even close to a good example of what Communism is
The USSR was undeniably the epitome of a communist state
>I'm also always suprised to see more animosity towards communist regimes than towards racist and fascist regimes
That isn't entirely true, it's just that no country and no tons of people actually defend racist and fascist regimes
Daily "flooding of communist and Kremlin sympathizers into that thread".
Capitalism is the best model we can ever hope to achieve
There isn't even anything wrong with capitalism as it's essentially just a freedom to do business and right to own property
Whatabout-whatabout
Examples
Haha
What the fuck
No we don't. What an idiotic thing to claim
Spouting Sputnik misinformation, classic
No we do not have such monument in the middle of capital square
Thank you for some sanity in this thread
Estonia has been through a lot, and the USSR committed heinous crimes to us
However, this has lingered as an erroneous understanding of ‘communism/socialism/leftism = bad
’ and I think we should be more intelligent than that
Hey, most of Northern Europe is actually very socially left in concepts like healthcare, but it is almost taboo to recognise this for some people
The trials we’ve suffered weren’t solely due to the nature of communism as an ideology, and by claiming that we severely undermine the dangers of totalitarianism, and the power of, for lack of a better word, cruelty
Let’s not pretend the soviet rule was cruel because they were communist and they couldn’t have done better - it was cruel because they were cruel
And now this fear is being funnelled into conservatism and radical fear-mongering from the bumbling individuals of a certain party
What a great time, eh
Issue is that such a monument doesn't exist
Blatant lies
Be ready because we will implement a harsh
ly effective e-services network
Międzymorze when
But why are you bringing social democracy into this
Who even claimed that social democracy is totalitarian like communism
Why do you feel the need to defend communism if you are a social democrat
They weren't the SS in the regular sense
I'm sure they were proud of being in the same unit with each other and for fighting against the Soviets
The Estonian Museum of Occupations, the Museum of Estonian History, the Estonian Jewish Museum etc
Non-communists usually don't care about such communist nuances
>sweatshops
Bad and inhumane regulation by these territorial states
>fucking up the planet
Insufficient regulation
>ridiculous endless growth expectations
Why is that even bad
>stock market crashes
That sounds like too optimistic criticism
>private health care leaving millions without the means to afford proper care
First of all, speak for your own country, and secondly, it's really all about lack of regulation
>Huge income inequalities
Really depends on the country, but you can regulate that *if the nation has the will*.
>bank bailouts
That may not be an entirely bad things, you know
They are too late, if our current dumb government tries to step out of the project they have to pay steep fees
Luckily they were too late and given the track record it was probably a desperate cry for attention by conservatives as COVID-19 has been taking most of the headlines
Of course they are not the same as communism is not the only totalitarian ideology
And I don't understand why you need to bring in those fringe side-ideologies here if we are talking about communism in general
>After 1945 you couldn’t find a single SS who was their member “in the regular sense”.
They weren't members of the "SS in the regular sense" even during the war as their units were ideologically very different from the regular SS
>Most country did not accept that excuse as sufficient to allow them to hold parades
Most countries did not have SS-units that were so different in their ideologies and whose lack of crimes was acknowledged by Western Allies
In fact, only Estonia and Latvia did
And you are really exaggerating with the word "parade" here
You can google them yourself
And as I said in another comment, you are right, there is no "Museum of the Crimes of Estonian Collaborators"...
[Yes
But such people will never care about that because that turns their simplistic world view upside down and right now it is too easy for them to blame entire occupied nations of literally organizing the Holocaust with their rhetoric
Yep, now you are getting it
Actually, I don't think so
I don't know of any to be honest, besides a few KGB museums at their former premises, but these are more about their methods than about their crimes
I'd rather die in a ditch somewhere than in a hospital like this

> who left the country becouse of transition to capitalism
Many people in East Germany were also so angry about the Berlin Wall being brought down by bloody capitalists that they left in disgust
Tbf, that saying is a famous paraphrasing of Hemingway's lines *No well-run yacht basin in Southern waters is complete without at least two sunburned, salt bleached-headed Esthonians [sic
] who are waiting for a check from their last article
And that had nothing to do with emigration, but with Estonians and their strong maritime culture
Yep, it's a very common saying among Estonians
Sometimes it's even shorter when we see another Estonian: "In every port
" or "In every port of the world
I like the French straight roads
the illustration is wrong though, it should be these three in a human centipede formation
Estonia’s maximum will be raised to 120km/h soon
hehe 110 in estonia
if it even exists, then that 110 might be like a km piece of road in the middle of nowhere because the highways i go on are always 70-90 kmh
Will be 120 here in a bit
Estonia and Latvia merged
Well, it's 120 in Estonia actually
In Estonia on new 4 lane roads there is 120 when the weather is good
> the farmer gets to set the price
So can the farmer be like "this sheep cost me one million billion dollars"?
But 110 is only on short sections, mostly it's still 90
See juba on

For what year is this map made
Railways ever built/used or current ones
Estonia is wrong: there is no functional railway link between Tallinn and Haapsalu (was closed and dismantled after 2004) nor between Rapla-Virtsu (was closed in late 1960's)
A segment of Tallinn-Pärnu railway between Lelle-Pärnu has been closed in 2018 for indefinite time
REIS TALLINN-TARTU-VALGA LAHKUB KÜMNE MINUTI PÄRAST

who the hell paid for that
Indeed it does
I ment the Riisipere-Haapsalu segment specifically
Now they're planning to rebuild the Haapsalu connection again
It's crazy to think for me that some countries don't have much pre-renaissance architecture
Despite multiple wars waged on my country territory with lots of damage, we still have a loot of medieval Gothic architecture
What else is new
communist apartments still serve good
What are you celebrating on Halloween exactly
Do the separatists have a plan for what they want to do now
I would wager they don't.
This likely won't end very well for Catalonia
>Only 70 pro-independence votes out of 135-seat chamber
Pretty embarrasing
They don't have any allies, except for Scots
They're gonna get annexed by the Spanish king
Well as far as the situation goes, Im sitting in Barcelona, near the Passage de garcia station and everything is exactly the same
Because 10 extra votes really shows a big majority, especially considering the importance of the thing they're voting on
As for why it's embarrasing - you'd think that
Well yeah, I never claimed it wasn't. Just remarked on how it's a pretty small one
>I doubt you would’ve said it’s "embarrassing" if anti-independence won by a slim majority
Embarrasing for the diehard pro-independence movement
Ofcourse
>do you think it would be embarrassing for the anti-independence movement if they won by just a slim majority
Considering they're way less popular & populistic
>Because apparently it’s embarrassing for a certain side of an issue to succeed in what they’ve fought for for so long
Well yeah, pretty embarrasing when you claim "oh everyone here supports the independence
" and then end up winning by a small margin
Or just go full Nero and make the next years one twice as big
Build a port and they will come
And they gave us hitler
Fattiehead
It is just falsely called "an alliance" when it was nothing of the sort
It was a foreign occupation
Bingo
Soviet "Union" too, maybe for some of the priginal members it was a Union, although even those were never elected in a democratic way, so even that is doubtful, especially considering the bolshevics lost the last election they fought in the Russian Republic
Turkey's weird
What made me surprised is that there were statues for him up to this day
I though everyone knew he was probably the worst ever colonizer, and his actions shocked even people living in his age
Even other colonizers like British were astonished and how poorly and brutally he run Congo and launched campaigns against him
We need to take historical context into account
King Leopold was horrible even by the standards of his own time
Read about him - even other colonial powers like UK were shocked at how awful things were in Congo
Well, even Belgians itself were not fond of it, when they found out about it
Belgian parliament had to vote to transfer Congo under control of Belgian government to stop it being Leopolds private land and institute some reforms to stop most brutal practices
You mean full out war
Maybe Putin needed to get some heat off because of Belarus and Turks are also fine with some limited slaguhter
*Slightly angry Estonian noises*
Or they might just run out of money for weapons
The workers still need wages, weapons programs are expensive

> These nutcases tend to whine for some weird reason
A piece of shit acts like it, who would've thunk it
I mean have you looked around
BLM has taken over the world but globally the effective genocides going on in China, Yemen and against the Kurds don't get anywhere near as much attention
They're not doing it anymore now are they
They got them from taxes paid to them mostly
The king of Belgium denounced the bruralities committed in the Kongo last year:
Also, nobody cares about your nazi ancestors
Hell, I think most of the Germans alive today probably had nazis somewhere in their family tree, but nobody goes around actively praising them and neither do they go around denouncing them because it seriously doesn't matter
And how exactly would you say they got their wealth unfairly
I'm not a monarchist btw, but I certainly wouldn't say that they got it unfairly
Being a monarch is a 24/7 job with very little privacy as you're constantly in the public eye
Add to that the fact that they have no real power anymore so it comes with few benefits that outweigh the negatives
Of course, monarchism itself is an outdated system and I'm sure it'll just fizzle out sooner rather than later, but there's no need to be angry at them today
You're just wasting your own energy on a subject that doesn't really matter anymore
Also, your flair says you're swiss
In what part of your life has the monarchy actually negatively impacted you
Actually, the correct translation is "rush B no stop". Very common mistake for beginner russian learners
Unpopular opinion, this metro doesn’t look good

Apparently I am Central European
Ahahaha, that's pretty wild
"Excuse me the fuck" - Estonians                             we are most definitely not central Europe
Eastern is at least tolerable, northern too, half nort half east imo
I’ve always felt we’re more central or northern than eastern european
Can Estonia into Nordic
Heh I don't care if this may be crazy but hell yeah we're central european now
Switch the colors around a bit and you have a low-effort r/PoliticalCompassMemes meme
And I took that personally
If estonia isn't northern Europe I don't agree
The Baltics Central Europe
What a joke
The [UN] and [EU] classify Baltic States as Northern Europe
>Culturally
Estonia aligns heavily with Finland in this regard, having linguistic and cultural ties
Much of our history has been tied to Sweden and Denmark
I’m not sure on which basis you’re saying Estonia is culturally Eastern Europe
Russian occupation didn’t affect our cultural identity
>Geographically
Estonia is further north than Denmark, so I’m confused
Sharing a border with Russia can’t be the reason we’re Eastern Europe as you could drag Finland along with that reasoning
>Socially
Not sure what this means, but Estonia shares social values with Scandinavia, not with countries further south or to the east
Since independence, the course has been towards a welfare society and we have a very high HDI today
That depends a lot upon what are your criteria
If it is Soviet occupation, then of course, we are Eastern Europe
If it is cultural traditions we are Northern Europe (Lutheran religion, traditions, historic ties etc
If it is geography, it gets complicated, even if you look at the map you see that Baltics are out of place, as they seem to belong to either Northern or Eastern Europe
But above all, there are nearly no criteria according to which the Baltics are Central Europe
What are you talking about
What is "culturally Eastern European" about Estonia
But Estonians don't want to be Scandinavians
You must be the first non-finnic person I've seen who says that it's easy to pronounce
I've given a taste of words like õlu to my German friends and yeah they cannot get it right

Since when has Finland owned the Estonian islands
Other than Soviet Finland having Saaremaa and Hiiumaa island, I'm totally ok with Estonia under Finnish flag
And what is with Poland what is Poland ?

At least we're not Sweden
Estonia can finally into Nordic
It sounds a lot stronger when spoken in a Romance language

:D Tallinn here to refute your map, try not to get hit by the wind chill
It's colder than this picture
Enjoy this murderous weather while it lasts
It was -22, so I had to put on an extra layer
Looks like this year we are going Iceland for getting that nice warm sun
I was going to go to sauna tonight
I have changed my mind now
7° in Canada today
Please give us our cold weather back
Even colder today, someone capture the image in half an hour to match that of yesterday, sun is still lower than last time
20 minutes after yesterday, Portugal is warmer, but UK
Denmark are freezing, Scandinavia and Central Europe got properly cold, compared to yesterday;
I think cold winters with solid snow cover usually mean more mosquitoes in the spring/early summer
In a sense this could be thought of as true
More global warming allows more access to fossil fuels in the north, and at the same time more global warming means weaker gulf stream and colder europe, at least in the medium term
Maybe it goes to jungle in Europe and Greenland after, in the long term, or just dead
So better to sell all the gas as soon as possible
I'm kidding, I hope your empire switches to solar and wind and nuclear and geothermal, sooner rather than later
Could you explain the British response to weather
Is it really that you lack some ability or services to handle this weather
Chlorides on the roads, snow ploughs, winter tyres
Or is it more mismanagement and health and safety bs
How about those temps at 7 m/s wind
Currently at -14 C; 8,6 m/s; amounting to -28 C equivalent with calculated wind chill
Maybe my weather map is pessimistic, the canadians think wind isn't that big a factor, three degrees warmer
Atleast you guys have close to none mosqutios in Souther Finland in summers, atleast near Helsinki while I have been there, however in Estonia they are freaking everywhere
60 isn't 100, and I don't mean just self-consumed energy, but the exports
There is potential to export a lot of electricity and other products not based on gas
Gas is easy, but the customers aren't going to be there forever, not for the current volume; trace amounts at best
By altitude, you mean latitude
Works fine for Berlin, will work fine for Moscow
I know cloud cover is a bitch at St
Petersburg, and at that latitude the seasonal variance is pretty big
But I'm pretty sure you could float a solar power plant in lake Ladoga to supply almost all of December-January energy needs with room to spare
Combine that with wind and storage, should work out fine
Check out the cost drop trend of high efficiency panels
High efficiency panels is a must this far north
Geothermal is tricky since it is non-renewable in that using it pushes the thermal gradient away, so you have to keep drilling new wells
But what I mean is hot dry rock, super deep geothermal, not volcanic miracles that are Iceland and Kamchatka, where nobody lives
Also as an efficiency booster for heating systems
Might not be economical now, but when nobody is buying gas, there are unemployed qualified drillers, for a while
Geothermal as part of heating systems could help take the edge off the 12-fold difference between December and June difference in insolation near Petersburg, shouldn't bed that bad further south
I think maybe that's only because you have too many trains
Have you tried having less trains
Maybe that'll work better
I'm kidding, trains are great, but playing with more than 10 is not fun
I'm not talking about Russia dominating the world nuclear industry, which in it's current form has little growth potential, due to it's excessive cost
Needs smaller, safer, lower maintenance and cheaper to install reactors
It's a diminishing market in the face of aggressively cheapening alternatives
I'm talking about domestic energy production, I'm talking about growing this number, which you already seem to have already set goals to reach 25%
> [In 2012 total electricity generated in nuclear power plants in Russia was 177
3 TWh, 17
78% of all power generation]
Exporting nuclear technology is not going to replace the major export industries, demand for mined resources is likely to grow, while demand for fossil fuels is likely to drop
I mean, maybe it's good if fossil fuel exports dwindle
You do make 70% of your electricity from those fuels, maybe it gets cheaper for your own people
Let's not kid ourselves, solar, batteries and wind is going to cost less and less per joule generated and stored as the manufacturing base grows and matures and new technologies keep getting invented and adopted, much faster than traditional thermal power plants and burning stuff
[Apparently, Sweden and UK have similar passenger modal share, almost twice that of Finland, but UK has a lot more total passenger-kilometers (a factor of ten more) than sweden, as well as more rail network distance per area]
Which makes sense comparing the countries population densities

ngl, finnish is drunk estonian
Go and live in Finland, that's the only way
Don't worry - you'll always have Estonians who think that your language is ugly
I mean I also think that Finnish isn't exactly a nice sounding language, but it's not like Swedish is any better at all, it sounds like a bunch of alcoholics at 7am hugging their toilet bowls
Don't know any Swedish to understand the thread, but don't worry, we're on your side no matter what
*And so the Estonians were left crying in the corner
More vowels = the language sounding more drunk and a shitload of finnish words for things are basically estonian words with a vowel stuck to the end like lampu, üksi, kaksi, kolme, neljä, viisi, kuusi, hotelli, passi, bussi to name a few
That's not even mentioning how many words just have a a lot more umlaut vowels
Well Finnish speaking ones mostly as basically every alcoholic in my family has or is working in Finland and speaks the language

Uhh yeah about that
Hmm
MI-6 has had some budget cuts and needs to update the database
We were independent from 1918-1940 as well and people use 1918 to count the age of our country
A link for those who also were curious:
See nimi
Sorry, sõber
I think we need to subtract the Soviet occupation from the 100 years, if we’re going to say “100 years *of* independence”. If we are referring to “100 years since the declaration of independence”, then 100 years is technically correct
Well, yeah the independence part is misleading
We are referring to age not independence, vennas
Yes,  the age of the day our independence was declared, not the overall age of the Republic
Exactly what happened
While the Nordic Council was formed, Estonia was occupied by the USSR

Can't be true, Estonians speak quite good English
Go to a gas station in Poland though and try to speak English and see what happens even though they're supposedly higher than us
My empirical evidence suggests this map is total horse manure
I've travelled fairly extensively in Poland and Hungary and locals were so terrible at English that in Poland I was better off using Russian (which I can't speak for shit btw) and in Hungary my mom had to speak in German (which she has only barely picked up watching German soaps)
Same applied to Latvia and Lithuania but that was over 10 years ago, maybe it has improved significantly over this time
Some stone or something went through Timo's seat, up in the ass of Timo
I don't call bullshit, been there three times no issues, locals were very helpful as well
I call bullshit on most of the red eastern block here though
I've had issues in Latvia for sure, trying to get from the airport to Riga coach station I got on the wrong bus and had to ask directions from locals, my terrible Russian was more helpful than English
Rallienglanti, kyllä. Always reminds me of this
Tbf Hollywood alone has been vital in spreading the exposure of English far across the world
You're speaking Swedish mate, English is the most normal language ever compared to Swedish or Finnish or Estonian
I very much disagree mate, if you want to learn any other language besides English you better move to a country that speaks it, using duolingo or whatever on its own is useless, you almost immediately forget everything once you pause
If I didn't consume 95% of my media in English I'd never have learned to speak it and I'd forget it it within a few years
I studied Russian for four years, German for three and Spanish for two
Most of that time was wasted as you cannot learn to speak anything like that
Putin does, and unfortunately it's all that is needed for Lukashenko to hold his power
yeah with that name, I have a feeling OP isn't actually posting this just because he's outraged by sexism

Well I think its the regulations put in place
&#x200B;
Norway, Switzerland are arguably quite small countries population wise so they have a fairly good reaction time and results when it comes to making political, economical changes that the countries people accept
&#x200B;
Theoretically everything EU has can be done as an EU partner also but the negatives of EU are also its positives
You simply are apart of the common zones, free economy and peoples movement etc
You don't have to regulate with every other country while having to abide to some rules EU as a whole votes for
&#x200B;
So UK being this, former world ruler, still has a lot of red tape to cut trying to negotiate with everyone and the EU trying to solidify the position
I'm sure in like 50 to 100 years they might be come on top as they could regulate better deals then EU itself (more so an EU that is battling the rise of far right, so also a little bogged down in terms of regulations)
&#x200B;
Practically though it became a shit show
As usual "divide and conquer" got in the way, people weren't happy May's flavor of Brexit and everyone starting fighting how to Brexit so they might never make it even to that stage
Never mind building up the ties and relations with countries after Brexit
So time is money and as far as I understand the UK haven't been as effective so with every passing month they are losing money that they supposedly would of gained by being apart of EU
&#x200B;
Also a little bit of "It's the EU's fault
Oh shi
now we are on our own, well it's Theresa who is to blame now
" , we have just reached the stage where every more vocal politician is at the head of Brexit negotiation so
I don't know who to blame now

Estonia was made Christian by German and Danish crusaders that brought the religion here "with fire and sword". Also it later became a protestant nation
Estonians never really embraced Christianity fully, except perhaps in the 19th century
It was always mixed with paganism, which the foreign nobility and clergy overlooked for their own convenience
It has never formed a strong part of our identity, especially as it was brought here by crusade and was often a sign of foreign rule
Add to it heavy Soviet anti-religion policies from the 1940s onwards and you have yourself a society where religiousness is seen as an oddity - a respected oddity, but an oddity nonetheless
Going to post my reply from the deleted thread
Lithuania has been at the forefront of this issue in Europe right now
Mad respect to them and they can count on Estonia’s full support
There is a transitional council formed by the opposition which had a meeting today
One way to get rid of Lukashenko is for his commanders and government to lose all trust in him
This could be done by making sure the lower ranks start siding with the protestors (like law enforcement and factory workers) and ending in the higher ranks distrusting him
CGP grey made a great video called The Rules for Rulers
When you lose all your keys, you go crumbling down with your system
However I 40% believe Lukashenko will be assassinated by some means
The total area burned in Australia this season is about 4
6 million hectares
Estonia's total area is 4
5226 million hectares
Oh boy, we have so much more
Kurat
For us too is only to use in polite sitations or in front of children

Fun fact, in the Netherlands people use diseases as insults
I find that disappointing, I love using "cazzo"

You can get a half liter bottle of water for like 30 cents in Estonia
At the airport iirc it’s 1
60 for a liter
Water shouldn’t be expensive
It's been around 10-15 degrees and raining non-stop for the last 2 weeks here in Estonia, not sure who came up with 18 degrees on this map
but we definitely don't have any heatwave
Sauce
It hit 22 degrees today when the prediction was way below 20 and I’m wearing an autumn coat
And the best part is I’m in Estonia where your high is marked as 17-19 degrees for my country
yeah
fuck him
problem is that Estonia doesn't have coal
1 prime minister per log
Hahaha, someone has edited the english page to refer to Ratas as 'Sitaratas'.
In direct translation it means shit wheel
The main reason IMO is that Ratas - as an actual centrist - is attempting to play by the rules of the liberal establishment, which makes him a weak spot in the coalition
In any kind of scandal or "scandal" regarding EKRE, for example if one of their politicions called abortion murder, the media would not go and speak to EKRE politicians themselves
Because they would double down on what they believe in and not give a shit about the media
Instead, the media goes to Ratas and ask him about how horrible it is that, for example, Soandso called doctors murderers
To which Ratas would meekly agree that "this is unacceptable blah blah", both validating the criticism and making himself look weak and hypocritical
Statelessness allows them to go visa-free both to Russia *and* the EU
While also being fully fledged EU citizens
Estonian citizens need a visa to go to Russia
Many of them identify themselves as Russian, they have family in Russia
Btw, after a change in the law in 1995, all children born in Estonia after 1992 may obtain Estonian citizenship unconditionally
There's very good reasons the situation is the way it is
It's the result of 30 years of people having 3 choices
If you force it in any way you'll end up angering some people and giving Russia a way to stir up problems
Sure Estonia could've done some things better but it's a very delicate situation
I will never not miss Andalucia
*cough cough* estonian city *cough cough*
I think you're confusing Pskov with Pechory
Pihkva, yes
It actually was an Estonian territory in the first Republic and if I'm not mistaken even in the russian empire
The whole region used to be ours
"Petseri County had previously been part of the Guberniya of Pskov, and belonged to Estonia in 1920–1944
The territory of Estonia covered an area of 47 549 km2 in 1920–1944, nowadays it covers an area of 45 339 km2
And read the end of the first paragraph here :
That speaker rig
no, that's the president
That's the most Russian government thing to say
Also this isn't a protest, just a very crowded street
Welcome to the party ladies and gentlemen, pleasure to have you all here
This comment section is such a wholesome gold, everyone now wants to get on the list
Aha
Estonia moving up in the world
I am also surprised what did the Aussies do to offend the great glorious leader Putin
Out of curiosity, what do you think the Bronze soldier incident was
what the fuck are you smoking
sputnik
i hope you forgot /s
As far as I understood, they were accepted to participate because they are very big fans of the contest and are willing to wake up at 5AM to see it live
You recall wrong both otherwise thats the gist of it tho its a lot more complicated than your summary
Why do you spout such bull about Estonia being next and furthermore because of Bronze Soldier
Im telling you this as an Estonian living in Estonia, who has had to research into politics and be updated on recent developents
We arent going to be next
Im just fascinated on what you base such claims on
But then your claim is just a guess
You dont take into account  major differences between Ukraine and Estonia
They wouldnt be able to gain the support of the majority of ethnic Russians here
The Pskov oblast is a lot poorer than Estonia so the greener pasture thing wont hold
After 2007 we have become pretty good defending against misinformation and cyber attacks
This brings us to NATO´s  [CCE COE] and the  [Enhanced Forward Presence] which act as a deterrent
[If you have time to use Google translate on this page, you should check it out( it also is relevant to the first paragraph)
Now for the EU part: its not a military organization but all its members, especially Eurozone is very ingrained and in many ways act more like a country than a union of countries
So the Western EU couldnt afford to just sanction and softly protest
Also i would like to mention that we have been able to market ourselves really well on a global stage, which matters
So it would be too risky and useless to do an Ukraine here
A soft annexation of Belarus would be more likely or even expanding more into Ukraine but by no means im saying that it will happen
To your edits: Estonia doesnt border Kaliningrad and our borders are either water or bogs for the most part
There is no outright hostility between people
I think its not so much about the spirit of Nato and more about the open conflicts and the rest of the stuff going on like the plague and NS2 just to name a few
They didnt let us join with open hands as well and we had to jump through quite many [hoops
]  Referring to the article the best example is: ".... no quarrels with its neighbours and for border issues to be resolved

Also only Latvia and Lithuania are actually Baltic
Why does Putin always sit like a 7 month old who has just shat himself
If this shit happens, No law can stop the internet,
We fight
We share
We still make memes, content
In 1994 the Estonian country of Ida-Virumaa had a homicide rate of 64/100k
Idk about Moldova but Latvia is one of the baltics, post ussr countries and I heard from a Lithuanian that their rates were pretty high as well, it might have to do with that idk
Gun go boom, there is a reason why Eastern Europeans talk about the crazy '90s.
Its population is majority Soviet occupation era Russian immigrants
> pretty small city
> 620,000
Does not compute
And the capitals of Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Portugal and Ireland are smaller than that with Latvia, Finland and Denmark having capitals that are only slightly bigger in terms of population
Small city my ass
EeLäLe
Both the population and area sizes follow that too
Estonia being the smallest

Ehm, there are places and beers where 8€ is a fair price, but most likely you payed that for a 20c to produce beer
Actually during Covid (summer) it was the first time in
a lot of years since I went to town hall square to have a beer there
Below 4€, while it would've been 8€ just a year before
ahahahhahahahaha
No, we just want people to spell the name of our capital city correctly
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if Warsaw was misspelled frequently
It's like the other person said, we just want it to be spelled correctly
If I can spell Worcestershire, the UK dude can spell Tallinn
Well it is with one *n* in Russian, so that can be a thing, sometimes
But "Talin" is just
I dunno what that is
Then it is difficult to say
An off the mill beer costs 1-1,30 in a shop, while a price of 3€ in a bar would be considered fair
While a local craft beer can be anything from 2€+ in a shop
More likely 3€+
10°C xd
Currently 20°C at 1632 in South-Eastern Estonia, i'd say its mostly 12-20° with quite common heavy rain and sometimes thunder noises

Yeah, we have similar systems for fishing etc
For example if you go fishing on a lake you have to buy a ticket for that location online, in an app or send a paid sms
Wait, what
Not a single higher spot in Estonia, but a few bumps in Latvia and Lithuania
Do your research, we have huge "mountains" compared to them =)
Oh yeah, and forests
We have one of the most forested countries and
not even a bush
Anyways, nice map
Debated many Russians with this view who even admit Manilas false flag
The end result is usually "We kind of knew Finland would be pro-German so we attacked them first" which I find even more frustrating
Similar argument with Poland "Well we needed to grab the land as Germany would of grabbed it anyway". So you become an aggressor and kill another countries soldiers, generals and you somehow are mad that they object to it
Same reason with Baltics, you start your usual USSR oppression and are mad when a bigger percentage join the Germans in the fight as Germany occupies the land from the USSR (some joined the Soviets, some joined resistance, some escaped to the West and some became also more or less paramilitaries for a third party as Finland might be considered)
I "thank" Winter War because Finland stood up and that kind of leaves a big black spot in USSR/Russian history as they can't really claim moral superiority during WW2 era, forever more or less
I do also agree and know that the Russian spirit brought down the Nazi war machine as most Germans died on the Eastern front, I contribute this to the ordinary farmer Russians and not the USSR leads who were technically as bad as Nazi German leaders
IMHO the war was a lot more grey than black and white, Hitler obviously took the cake with his ideas of trying to eliminate an entire race on stupid eugenic principles, tracing bloodlines and whatnot while leaving close friends with Jewish blood who he liked alive so
a very sad and strange period of human and European history
We got rocketry and medicine off the ground, no need for WW3 guys
Maybe space battles
(Poland can join as a middle man)
I like how they *technically* don't say that Finland shelled Mainila but instead say that some guy wrote in his memoirs that he got a message that they had done so
They've had a lot of practice with disinformation after all
Wait up, we coming too
YOLO
Hey, Soviet Russia was Orwell's main inspiration for that concept
I don't think many people are surprised that Russian state controlled TV is full of lunatics
Technicalities, Baltic SS legions were acquitted of crimes as they were SS by name but not by formalities is the short version
A comparison would be "Nike/Adidas" and "Nice/Adibas", Germans by 1944 didn't really follow any assembly instructions when getting men to fight for them as new units were made
It is in utter bad taste though as the letters SS kind of represent the worst in Nazism fanatics and the Baltic units were named after that
In reality all sides can commemorate, in Estonia German side gathers near Sinimäed, Soviet side used to gather in downtown, now they gather in the military cemetery due to a infamous Bronze Soldier
Both sides hold speeches and proclaim what a great fight it was, a little vodka is passed around and both sides commemorate in their own way
So to Russians I say stop looking it from your hill, Estonia as many others were dragged into the war, we were very adamant on our position, neutral but Soviets had to force their mutual defensive pact and march soldiers in our territory
So just because a person gets conscripted into an SS unit he is by default non equal to a person who got conscripted into a Soviet unit
Nah, our northerners are even weirder

What's the difference between farming for meat and leather vs farming for fur
Seems like the real solution would be to improve standards/update regulations
Outright ban to me seems unnecessarily drastic
Looking at the historical perspective meat has for most of human history been a luxury product only for the holiday table of the common man and I can't really see how fur or leather is any different
There are cultures that do not eat any meat and are totally fine
I have a feeling that some of the ban advocates are Greenpeace types that don't really seek compromise and are totally willing to make false claims or exaggerate
you dont even know

Oh, these are good too, just in my town the ground pumps seem to be the most popular variation
What, how is Skype Swedish
One of the founders was from sweden, but the technology is from Estonia, and their main office is here in Tallinn, next to my office

My favourite bit from Asterix was when (it was one of the many issues where they dealt with the Romans) Caesar was with his companions and said something along the lines of "and now we'll go eat
You too, Brutus" and Brutus was having this inner monologue "he's getting on my nerves with this "You, too Brutus", one day I'll show him". They had many real-life moments integrated in to the stories
Asterix comics were so much fun

That's logical, because growing tomatoes here in the north is more difficult, and not everyone could have grown them like

Or maybe they weren't selling the data in the first place and there's no way to justify the additional cost of the liability and compliance that the regulation places on them
We had an online game shut out European users
It's not like they were selling that data
No it isn't. Every web server by default logs things like IP addresses, which is personal data
It's not
Except those are not the only conditions of GDPR
Just having to read through the regulation and being fully aware of its implications costs tons of money even if you don't have to do ANY changes

Honestly, if you were the creator of some technology-oriented thing like a website or application then I do not see why you would keep it in Europe
The situation here is not favorable: just look at what you have to deal with to sell something inside the EU
You have to report to *every* tax authority of every nation that's part of the EU just for VAT
The EU does not have a good environment for starting business that are web-oriented
Yea in Estonia education is a major thing
Its so weird to feel yourself in Spain but than realising that 3 days ago it was shit apocalypse
I think I have seen everything now
Couple of years ago it was snowing in the middle of June
Today it was 27*C and I had my toes in nice cold snow pile
Strangest feeling ever
Most bizarre thing was last week - it still felt like very early spring / late winter
Now suddenly it is middle of summer
The temperature feels amazing but it's hard to use your brain
Just doesn't really function anymore
Hell yeah we finally get some warmth too
I was looking at the tempature on a day to day basis
A few days ago it was 3 degrees, the next day it was 23 degrees, the next after was 28
We essentially skipped spring and went straight to summer
I thought I was going crazy
Same here send help

I had the weirdest day today in Estonia
Also in a place where they had like 25x25m snow pile and 25-28 degrees
So obviously we had a snowfight in the heat
Weirdest experience I had in a long time
Definitely is pathetic, goddamn slowflakes, I walked around outside and it was fine, hot compared to +5 degrees it was just a week ago but fine

Hi Julia
I love that you're fighting for us and for a free internet
Now that this issue has gone so far and it has become obvious that we the people need to raise our voices, could you give us some suggestions on what to tell out MEPs
I myself am Estonian and thinking of contacting my MEPs but unsure of what to write for them and what to do to make them take us seriously
This issue needs a better spokesperson than a young woman with Bieber's haircut
Aight boutta move a country over, might check up on an old discord friend too
Regarding Estonias internet and prices, i think my dad got a pretty good and cheap deal that telia is trying to trick him out of
Same here, I usually won't bother watchin videos
It's faster to read something that to watch someone talk about their stuff
Speaking speed < reading speed
It's that simple
Especially bad if the video sucks and doesn't talk about what's promised, then I have wasted minutes of my time, that could be spent somewhere else (reading some other stuff on reddit usually)
That's some good humour
You should be a stand-up comedian

Sadly yes
I didn't say dislike
It's one of the top countries in terms of average height and it has a low crime rate
And Estonia likes Finland

Work night = töööö
Ööklubi* - nightclub for non-weirdos
You have to put a -d (ööd) at the back if you want to say good night in Estonian (head ööd)
Yup, hyphenation is optional, but öötöö is a legit word though, doesn't even need a hyphen, literally the word for night-work/nightshift
Jää-äär is another one of these

Really explains why every prominent Russian during that era came from the Baltics or Germany
Same-ish situation in Estonia
Estonian area was an autonomous zone where Baltic Germans rules the land and German was the language of administration and the cultural elite
Only during the Russification period did Russian Empire try to change it
What's up with Estonia is a better question
Why was the Karjala area so highly populated relative to the rest of the country, better farming land and Lake Ladoga
Swedish Empire had universal education and this was not dismantled by the Russian Empire
Sure is, I love reading but it's such a time investment that with all of the other entertainment being available it's very difficult to get started with a book
I think I can count the books I've read since starting university in 2014 on one hand, certainly on two
I definitely know about that, my great grandfather was an Ingrian who grew up in a village south of Leningrad
Sometime during WWI he was forced into the Red Army where he mainly built bridges and when he finally got back to his home village in what must've been 1947 or so most of it had all been destroyed so he went to live in Northwest Estonia
There's more to this story but unfortunately I, the biggest history nut in the family, was born a bit too late and the stories he personally told me were both confusing ( as he was a bit senile) and I didn't have context for them as I was about 13 when he died
Still I do remember some bits about being bombed by German planes though
[UK has an opt in service here] signed up a couple years ago and the calls stopped within a week, haven't thought about it until now
I didnt get many robo-calls but I did get UK based call centres ringing and asking for the homeowner
Opt out services are better though since most dont know, or cant be bothered, especially the elderly, who I would guess, are more likely to pick up and give these people the time of day
Nah, I'm good right here
So is this heatwave directly caused by climate change or is it just contributing
No thanks, we are already melting with 25C
Can someone give me a quick summary of what's going on
Those fees are exist because accepting card payments costs to the merchant
These fees should be presented to the end customer by charging more for using the credit card option instead of making the product more expensive for all payment methods
This law sounds like it was lobbied by credit card issuers or processors to push out other cheaper payment methods

The "average" wage is pretty deceiving, as it doesn't show divide between regions and different income classes
For example in my country the difference between the richest (capital) and poorest region in the average wage is more than 500 euros
Median wage is also significantly different from average - almost 300 euros lower
For majority in eastern Europe travelling is luxury
Even those who do travel, usually go to neighboring countries with similar prices
Traveling itself is not that expensive, while accommodation and eating in restaurants definitely is
People just work around both of these by staying at cheaper places and eating store-bought food or food that they brought with them from home, depending on how much they can afford
We honestly wouldn't be there without the very open and always helpful Finnish and Swedish markets nearby
Of course it has a downside as well as our prices are more inflated than in most other post-socialist countries
Portugal is actually behind 8 post-socialist countries in terms of wage (PPP)
Prices are lower
Estonia's average gross wage in spring 1992 was 16
4 euros
Right now average net wage is 42% of that in Finland
If you take the difference in prices into account, then Estonia's wages are about 70% of that in Finland
It's pretty logical that the offset from the mean is larger above-mean than below-mean, hence why the average is way above the mean
Or Romania above Greece
Or Greece being barely higher than Macedonia or Albania for that matter
Growth will of course slow down the closer we get, but yeah, catching up to a reasonable degree within a few decades isn't something Utopian anymore
Also they have six toes on each foot
There really should be a graphic for it
All the best to Latvia
Congrats my southern neighbours,we had a shared struggle for independence and will be brothers forever
Especially now that almost everything is much cheaper to buy in Latvia(for the geographically uneducated,i live in Estonia)
Happy indepedence day from Estonia, thanks for selling our booze for half the price
The roadtrips down south makes us almost Nordic :)
Congratulations my little 6 toed friends
Congrats from Estonia
Your capital is the nicest in Baltics
They have Daugava
Dont worry it will change soon enough
Of course you have to tolerate hundreds of thousand of drunk Estonians, at least we keep to border area
How do you think we got what we have
20 years of drunk Finns spending hundreds of millions
We dont buy just booze
Also building materials is very popular
I think New Kids Turbo covered this pretty well
If anyone wants to learn more about it here's a report on it that goes into it from the 90s:
Why do Germans do it though
Religious reasons
Austria
Imagine how great of a lake it would be
Latvia
No hard feelings, bro, but an even bigger coastline would be kinda nice
Rip cheap liquor tho
And if not the whole thing maybe just Kaliningrad
Baltics is harder to drive through (yes, I also include Estonia)
At least Poland has good roads for drive through and some toilets and gas stations next to roads
Compared to them we live like in desert
Just 100
With prices in Norway it feels like pocket money

I got called out for it yesterday lol - was in an online race, translated an English sentence into Estonian very literally and it did not sound great at all
Not really
Estonians just have a kinda ugly sounding accent, it doesn't have any specific characteristics at all, just sounds like you just ate something really hot
I have thought about it and honestly I think the fact that Apple is domestic and other stuff foreign probably made a huge difference in the beginning in the US
Here it's the same buying and Android or an iPhone it's just another brand but in the US it's a bit more complex
Two reasons - smartphone era in US started almost immediately as first Iphone was released
In Europe it started a bit later, when Android was already available
Second - Europeans are more frugal than americans (this is broad generalization, I get it)
Even if you are from well off family, they are not going to buy a phone that costs 2-3x times more
Narva, also all of Ida-Virumaa
It's basically a cancerous tumor of Estonia
I live 15 minutes from Malmö, and I'm there semi regularly, and it's always absolutely fine
It's a nice costal city with loads of diversity
But media gotta media I guess
Edit
Just to add, I'm not saying nothing ever happens in Malmö, but it's absolutely not the battlefield media likes to portray it as
When people ask me about it I usually don't recommend they go there, mainly because I think it's boring compared to Gothenburg and Stockholm, but that's just me
The same rules apply as in any larger city, don't walk around sketchy neighborhoods with your wallet visible at night, and you'll be fine
Living here I definitely feel closer to the continent than to the rest of the country, if that makes sense
And as you said, passing by Malmö to buy things you couldn't find elsewhere
If you're driving into Sweden from Denmark, and many tourists seem to do, Malmö will be the first city you pass through, so it'll absolutely leave an impression
That sentence: "drove up to Helsingborg for dinner" is such an American thing to say
Because realistically, it's not that far away, but still, I've never known anyone who decides to just go a few towns over for dinner (unless you were going there anyway)
Even when my family and I visited California, and drove the Pacific Highway, we'd always look for something in the same town we could walk to
Europe is an office
What job does your country have there
Edit: Estonia would be the IT girl who has had many violent relationships with  Germany and Russia
Still obeys to all the rules set by Germany
And is obsessed with her brother Finland, with whom they go to sauna with every week
She also is a part time singer at a bar
Estonia - IT department programmer who drinks waaaaaay too much energy drinks and stays behind their computer all day
The IT guy, who nobody knows works here
Standing outside, thinking how cool would it be to work there
Or maybe at the help desk and gets praised for the excellent work they're doing while they just usually restart stuff to fix the problem
Whom nobody in the office knows and whose computer is 15 years old but somehow works okay
And how others should also get high speed internet in their homes
I had rather positive culture shocks whilst in NYC, but I guess it's rather different from the rest of the country
I had always thought the American politeness and interacting with strangers could be a little excessive, but it really wasn't, it was rather a pleasant surprise
Naturally I was surprised by how dirty the city could be, but I've had the same kind of feelings in Paris and Barcelona
> but also the Baltic states
Uh, no, from Estonia as well
You need a  license  to get one and only in a few specific cases you can carry it around
You can actually get arrested even for having a fake gun on you in a public place, let alone a real one
Also, the Baltic states is not a country, I hope you know that
We are just neighbours, just like Estonia and Sweden
Also [a map of firearms in Europe] actually it looks like it is **Sweden** that has the most firearms per capita (hunting, not carrying them on the streets)
You are somewhat right with the concealed carry, but you made it sound very wrong, so I actually had to check the law to see wtf are you going on about
Yes, on paper, it is somewhat easy to do it
Nevertheless, no-one does
Most people who have a permit to carry a gun at work, do not have the right to carry a gun off work, for example
And it does not count - as you made it sound - as having some sort of special right to carry a gun on the street for self defence - we don't have a law like that
What we have, is that you can get a weapon
One of the possible reasons in the list is self-defence
You can get a permit to carry a weapon
So technically, yes
But you made it sound like we actually have guns on the streets
§ 50
General procedure for carrying weapons and ammunition (1) Weapons and ammunition may be carried together with a corresponding permit
(2) Weapons and ammunition shall be carried covertly and in a manner which prevents their loss or entry into the possession of another person, as well as causing accidental damage
There must be no cartridge in the magazine of a portable firearm, except for a revolver
(3) It is prohibited to carry weapons and ammunition: 1) under the influence of alcohol, narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or psychotoxic substances; 2) at a meeting, demonstration, picketing, celebration and other public events, except for a person performing official or work duties at the specified public events
Chornobyl irradiated forests were burning on a large scale recently
Honestly I haven't seen any news about that in Postimees nor ERR recently, neither in Russian nor in Estonian
The only two times I heard about that were in Reddit, so I believe it is not a very big of a deal for local people
Idiots ididocracy is limitless
Do you think people like that have any common logic, they been brainwashed by their own racist ideologies
For males Juhan, Heldur, Hildegard, Hugo, Aadu
For females Maire, Salme, Hilda, Alma, Elvine
In Estonia we have Elvira or Helve for women and Helmut or Eldur for men
Konstantin or Pent (Estonia)
None except Heldur of them have old-timey sense for me
To get proper ancient the names must have meaning in estonian
Like Lembit, Koit, Kalju for men and Tuuli, Luule, Kaja for women
But the split between male and female names is not absolute
It was used commonly when we were occupied by Germans so yup
Not really imo, I haven't heard of anyone with that name
Hilde, yes, but that's generally a girl's name if used
It is female name
There are currently 57 women with that name and pretty much all of them are 85+
Those are old yes but ther are still used very frequently, meanwhile the ones i counted you wonrt see on younger peeps
Lol sa pole kuulnud sest kasutati, saksa ajal
Enam muidgi mitte
Well then the names would be Heino, Endel, Ülo, Aino, Linda, Laine
Noh, Sakslane ise küsis hämmingus, et kas Hildegard on mehe nimi Eestis
Enamasti kui see oli kasutusel oli see naise nimi
Kui palju 20 aastaseid Aadusid või Salmesid sa tead
Need sinna juurde veel
palju on neid nimesid mida ammu ei kasutata enam
There are lots of Aados, Aadus and others in all ages
Salme is for older peaople but was not wery common even back then
Compare with Aino that was really popular back then but really not in use anymore
I mean in Estonia we're still using shale oil to power our life bc it's cheaper than buying electricity/building any new powerplants that use different fuels (nuclear, coal, what have you)
Good, but we need more
It's not enough
We need whole world moving there
We need to use every possible mean to influence others to do that too
Idk how we the Estonians will get our electricity then
It's just that it costs less to keep doing what we do than build nuclear power plants I think
Or maybe our ppl will stop being pussies so we can finally build a nuclear reactor
>I'm sorry but I think the EU should sanction Estonia over this
You should be sorry because that's an incredibly stupid idea
Estonia's dependence on oil shale is a Soviet legacy
Estonia has no mountains like Scandinavia, nor wide rivers like Latvia, which is why we're in a much worse position when it comes to competitive hydroenergy, compared to our neighbours
These incredibly-polluting oil shale plants were built to power up entire Estonia and even parts of St
Petersburg
While it's not good for the environment, it has made Estonia extremely dependent on that source
Nevertheless, the plants have been upgraded with filters and Estonia's greenhouse gas emissions have already fallen by half compared to Soviet era
Nuclear power plants are not an easy option for Estonia, considering we're just too tiny
If we had a miscalculation in the style of Finland with their Olkiluoto 3, it could literally bankrupt the country
We have no history nor experience with nuclear power
There, however, are now talks about some modern small-scale reactors that would fit us as well, but it's only future technology
Estonia has potential with wind, though, due to its geographic location by the sea
Wind power generation has increased steadily, but has stalled recent years due to various legal disputes
It makes up roughly 7-8% of power production, but there's much more potential to that
However, wind energy production is dependent on changing weather, which means there *must* be some stable power production to complement it as well
Nevertheless, the largest of Estonia's Soviet-era oil shale plants are to be closed in the next years, due to EU CO^(2) quotas, and while this is positive for the gas emissions, it will eliminate a massive share of Estonia's electricity production, turning Estonia from an electricity exporter to importer, making hundreds of people unemployed etc
This will be have a massive negative socio-economic impact to the already poorest region of Estonia and will undermine the country's energy independence
Oh, and did you know that in the meanwhile, neighbouring Russia will keep polluting like there's no tomorrow, and we will probably just buy dirty electricity from there instead because we still need power, only the money will now go to a foreign country
And the nature has it no better at all
Absolutely brilliant, isn't it
I would mostly blame our stupid government on it, considering they should have seen it coming, but EU's "let's set an example for the rest of the world with how commited we are" while rest of the world is not following, is a real problem that can have real negative impacts on us
Everyone is scared of a tsunami in eu that's why we don't fully go on nuclear power
>don’t call me stupid
I called your "idea" stupid, not you
> stop blaming the Soviets
I didn't blame the Soviets, I blamed the natural conditions *and* historical circumstances
And the government
> You’ve had thirty years to figure this shit out and stop being the worst polluters in Europe
Firstly, the climate talk became more widespread only in 2000s, I don't think people were that aware of fossil fuels being phased out back then
Secondly, even if I'd agree that the government of Estonia should have started transition much earlier, would that justify just abruptly shutting down most of Estonia's electricity production, which will be replaced by just-as-dirty Russian imports
There's absolutely no win for Europe that way, the environment won't benefit but European economy will suffer (and our competitors will benefit)
I don't even understand why are you so hostile out of the blue
I'm ultimately pro-renewable, but having such emotional viewpoints a'la "shut down all polluters
" which would ultimately hurt Europe and might not even benefit the nature (as explained above) deserve criticism
Things that are common in Europe
> Helsinki is the second-most Northern capital in the world (after Reykjavik)
Helsinki has the world's northernmost metro
We can it freely do
Language beauty comes so beautifully out
We're so keen on boycotting that we lost 2-6
Going all-in with the boycott by finishing last in the group aswell
This is just diplomatic bickering and will cause more costs and time for ordinary travellers, who don't have anything to do with US politics
"It has never been like this and it is the same again" is my favourite phrase in Russian
I didn't know that it was he who said that
It's bizarre
Apart from slightly less people at the university, and on busses, would wouldn't know there was anything special going on
It really doesn't feel like it's really hit us as hard as it actually has
Well, the EU is supporting Rail Baltica to link Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania with the European network (we don't even have any other 1435mm railways yet
) - so of course
As long as your citizens are smarter than ours and don't start stupid enviromental shit
never seen ads, but in general, the "there are kids starving in africa" is a very common thing to say if your child doesnt want to eat their food
for a while there was a print-out picture of a malnourished black child right above the food trash can at my school's canteen
the goal was to make us feel bad about throwing food away
im pretty sure there was some text too, but i cant remember what it was exactly
and that stayed up for a good few years for kids aged 6-18 and teachers and any visitors to see
kinda fucked up in my opinion
the fact that i dont want to eat their oversalted rice has nothing to do with malnourished kids somewhere in africa, and is highly unnecessary
i mean, what was their idea
i see the picture, turn around and go finish my food
even if it was super poor quality
and painting africa as the land where everyone is starving, is also pretty ignorant imo
When I was in Spain and on train from Madrid to Malaga, there was an ad on the tv about poor african kids who flee to Europe, get great education and become happy people, underlaying message of the ad was obviously - "look at those poor african kids, lets bring them over here and save them
". And that's just one example of many such instances I saw when travelling around Europe
So yeah, I can say that in western europe it's pretty common theme
"kindergarten", they just straight up stole a German word, didn't even try to anglicize it
I would like to add choir to the mix
In Russian we have послезавтра (poslezavtra) for overmorrow and позавчера (pozavchera) for the day before yesterday
And it is very widely used
No, at least half of it was taken from French
>our winters get milder and milder
Well
someone obviously didn't get snow in september
But to be serious, casting aside the couple of warm-ish(12degrees) and rainy days right now I'd actually say that this
autumn is a bit colder than others
E: also haven't noticed that trend, only that halloween is now a thing
15 is damn cold for me
So I pack as much clothes as I can
Though it's mainly because I am really skinny, so any cold wind - and I am frozen instantly
>, but they're shorter
Didn't notice that in Estonia
They last as usual from late November to late March-early April
Maybe there is a bit less snow in December, but overall winters haven't changed much
Summers did get warmer though, and I kinda enjoy it
For me optimal temperature is 25-30 degrees, so I was fine with that
We have a really weird anti-German sentiment
It's mainly only for political reasons; when one needs to be anti-EU, big projects will be condemned as "a return to 700 years of slavery under Germans".
But the same people who'll push this agenda will be the same people to fly Waffen-SS flags at rallies (the 20
Estonian SS-Panzergrenadier Division to be precise)
No anti-German sentiment here, we're to preoccupied with russians
There was
Up to 1940 Germans were public enemy nr
Until it was the soviets
1940 was clear hint I hope :D
Its from Italy
My whole childhood has been a lie
Americans are paying more for health insurance than any other European country
The problem is not that the healthcare isn't universal, the problem is that the healthcare is monopolized and de-regulated - because of that it is ridiculously expensive
Due to lobbying (or lets just say "bribing") by the Big Pharma, the government is not allowing competition in the health market, thus the prices have no reason to go down
Funny how USA calls itself a "capitalist" country when competition is not possible in some sectors
I am for Estonia
Some advantages -
* If you have lifetrheatening trauma or disease you will be treated fairly quickly and you won't spend thousands on just calling an ambulance
Same for childbirth (not sure about abortions though)
* Even non public clinics and healthcare is not as crazy expensive as in US (though that might be just linked to generally lower cost of life)
Disadvantages :
* The brunt of paying for healthcare lies on working class and their employers
13% tax that goes to healthcare is paid from every salary and you have no option to not pay it or move to some private healtchare
You might never use public healtchare, but you still pay for it
* If you have non-lifetrheatening disease, waiting periods for doctors can take up months
* Despite taxation, public healtchare fund is constantly running short of money
One of the reasons why waiting periods for doctors are so long
* Dental services are not covered by public healthcare (apart from 40 eur yearly deduction)
So if you need any operations on teeth - be prepared to pay all the hundreds and more euros out of your pocket
Over here, it is also very common to drink tap water, buying bottles is somewhat stupid
I have heard that in some areas of the capital people don't, but I am unsure if the quality is really different or those people are just weird snobs
The places I lived at the capital had no problem with tap water
It's safe to drink and there's nothing wrong with it, but some people buy water from the store because they say that it tastes better but there honestly isn't a difference
Yes, of course, it is very rare to not drink ta water
Only reason I would buy water is when I'm not home and don't have access to tap water
In some parts of Tallinn though, the water has slight smell of chlorine because the water is taken from a lake and needs to be purified, but it doesn't bother me
Everywhere else I've been, water is perfect in my opinion
I know in Tallinn the tap water tastes pretty chlorinated in some parts of town but honestly a filter jug takes out the taste and I don't understand how some people have the energy to buy and carry in water for no reason
In Estonia it depends where you are, in the south accesessing groundwater is pretty easy so tap water comes from the groundwater, but in the north there is limestone in between the surface and groundwater so you can't really get groundwater there, so they take water from the surface and clean it, so it isn't really good to drink
TLDR: depends where in the country you live
Brita is well not exactly common but most people know what it is and some people even use it frequently
Huge refrigerators that also do other stuff like dispense ice-cubes, water or similar are basically an american thing
Yes they are sold here as well and a few of the people who have built a new kitchen in the last \~10 years do have one, but most people find it unnecessary
The taste of water differes from district to district
In nõmme for example where it comes from deep ground water the taste is really good in my experience but in the city center where it comes from ülemiste it is a bit more chlorinated taste
I heard stuff like that when I visited in 2018 too but it was totally drinkable, not pleasant tasting but if it's 30 degrees outside you're gonna drink it
Sadly way too often
I work in an international environment, so I speak English on a daily basis
Also, most of the entertainment I consume is in English
As a result, I mix up languages all the time
It’s as if my brain is not switching between the languages fast enough
Correct and clean use of language is very important to me, so it’s always really embarrassing when I can’t remember specific words
Violating personal space
We might not say anything but you certainly won’t be making a friend
We’re massive introverts for a reason
Also don’t call us or any other baltic countries russian or imply anything similar, there’s a lot of bad history there and quite frankly it’s a bit offensive
Associating us with today's Russia or the old Soviet Russia
Bad memories
In Estonia, a big no no is being loud and annoying to random people in public
Estonia agrees with everything you said
I'd think over here we all know it's a country, but for some reason I always thought that the language has been gone for centuries by now
Then as I was browsing youtube language videos for some totally different reason, I found out it's alive and kicking, just never ever mentioned anywhere in the media
Actually, this is different
What I mean by this no talking, is no small talk
But greeting things are ok if you don't stop for a chat
We have a fixed saying "jõudu tööle
" that translates to something among the lines of "wish you strength/energy for the work you're doing
" and this is a totally normal thing to say as you are passing a person working that you know, even if you only know the face and have never spoken to
Or even if you don't know them at all, but it's like a public physical work at your workplace or home area, like cleaning or tinkering something
I grew up mainly at the countryside and therefore am used to using this a lot
People who have grown up in big cities might find this a bit odd or old fashioned to use it with people you don't know personally, but the workers have generally smiled and answered with the correct phrase "jõudu tarvis
" thats like "thanks, strength/energy is needed
Hmm, the medieval old town of Tallinn is really lovely and there are (or at least were before covid) some good restaurants in the capital as well, [this] crossed my mind but the locals will know better
That being said, Tallinn as a whole is one of my least favourite towns in Estonia
But that's a matter of taste, of course
It's just quite different from the rest of Estonia (and has way too many cars)
You can take a 2h [train] to Tartu
It is very small compared to Tallinn, even though it is our second biggest town
But there is not that much to do, especially with covid
It is lovely to walk around the old town, parks and riverside and also elsewhere if you're interested in architecture
You can [take a trip with an old boat on the river] there are also several cute little bars like [this] or [this]  I recommend going to a sauna, even the smaller places can have decent sauna complexes like [this] in Tartu and [this] in Tallinn
The tiny coastal towns are actually my favourites, but you can only reach them with a car or bus, so this might be too much hassle for a short stop
Where are you going in Russia
Do you plan to take a plane or cross the border on land/sea
Tallinn airport is lovely, as it is actually inside the city and connected to the old town by a city tram
The airport is also very small, so everything will be quick and easy
Unfortunately, can relate
It depends on the neighbours, but I cannot wrap my head around what are the factors
One thing is, that it is easier if you either don't know them at all or know them very well - anything in between is risky
Will they chat or not
What do they think
etc
Some pictures of it happening today
[First] & [second]
i'm biased and i dont even have a licence, but i think its a cool and clever idea
i hope people dont find ways to abuse it
Considering that the main highways I drive on here everyone goes at least 10 kph over the limit either I'll see a lot of cars on the side of the road or nothing will change :/
> fine amount was defined by how much a person was making a year
It's already like that here in Estonia
These changes to fine calculations were made pretty recently (if not even during this year)
The last car has almost an hour of pause time
damn, how much were they speeding
The police put this in place because according to their research speeders were less annoyed about the fine and more about the time it took to get the paperwork done (i.e 15 minutes in the cop car)
This won't help against regular customers (i.e cunts), but it's a great deterrant against people who "experimented" that day
If you go over 20km/h of the speedlimit, then you must wait 45min
If you go over 21-40km/h of the speedlimit, then you must wait 60min
Whenever estonian is spoken by a non-native in a film/series made by a non-estonian, they make us sound russian
We have a really beautiful language and they just think we're Russians
Can you link me some examples
I haven't heard any yet, and I really need a good laugh
How I met your mother ( barney is a street performer from Estonia) and in Brooklyn 99 there was some guy from a slavic nation and sang a song but it was in estonian xd, doesn't really count but its funny haha
Thanks mate
(Almost universal) Free healthcare
We go naked into sauna and usually there are both sexes together
unless going to sauna is already considered crazy abroad, then that
3 things:
First: i think we got something similar with the dubs but it isn't always a single dude (sometimes there's 2 of 'em)
Second: idk how common or uncommon it is in other countries but here especially in rural areas we like to make our own juice, kompot and other stuff
Third: we also go to the forest regurlarly to pick mushrooms (idk how common it is in other places)
leaving ur baby to sleep outside in the stroller
yes, even on the street in front of an apartment building
yes, even in cold weather and snow
God jul och gott nytt år! ️

Now get ready to answer questions about New Year's.
American series assume people in the Baltics are just Russian and give them a mega thick Russian accent or use some random words, turn them into a song and say  that the song is about how a dog loses its virginity (brooklyn99)
We are not slavs, very offensive
oh yes every time some tv show character is supposed to be from an obscure country and they pick estonia
also the song jake and mlep(clay)nos from brooklyn 99 sang, has estonian lyrics although mlepnos is from some random made up country lol
of course, his name sounds greek, the music style sounds idek like what but not estonian and the country's name sounds slavic
but the accent and grammar are so bad that i didnt catch it, a friend randomly pointed it out to me months after i saw that episode
i almost died laughing when i found out lol
Yes, but it wasn't due to how they were speaking
I knew this girl and the first time we spoke I could not understand what she was saying
Her voice sounded too light for me to make the connection between what sounds were coming out of her mouth and words I knew
After a few minutes I could already understand her, but right at the start I just couldn't.
The memory of not being able to understand her had stayed with me
> At least it wasn't "neuken in de keuken
" (Wanna fuck in the kitchen
Thank you
I shall remember this for the next time I meet a Dutch person
The miserably common one that we're not a part of Russia
Also have had to explain that we don't use horses as a way of transportation
Holy shit I had 2 college dormmates (one from France, other one from Barbados) who thought the exact same thing
They were convinced I was insane saying they're an actual animal and I had to show them a Wikipedia page for them to calm down
Igloos and now polar bears
I'm really curious where so many people get the misconception that Poland is somewhere in the Arctic
As long as 95% of people are vaccinated education is enough imo
Out of curiosity what is the policy regarding adults and booster shots
Thanks for the clarification
I don't remember the exact phrasing in Estonian, but I saw some movie subtitles where "I'll pop a cap in his ass" was translated as something like "I'll shove my hat up his ass".
During summer I usually have a small spray bottle on me at all times
Whenever it gets too hot I just spray water on my arms, legs and sometimes on my hair, if I feel like my head is getting too hot
Think of it as artificial sweating without the smell
It's also fun to spray your friends every once in a while
Got 3 h of sleep last night, it didn't drop below 20°C even at night and the cottage where I stayed in had a stable temp of 35°C and like 70% humidity
Also I couldn't open the window because then the mosquitoes would eat you alive
It was hell on earth
Narva, the old city and pretty much everything was destroyed by the soviets
So they rebuilt it
with commie blocks
I see no difference
To me it looks like a regular city
Võhma is worse tho
It’s literally city for a meat factory and soviet blocks, new houses are good tho
**§ 1
** Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic, where the people are the highest bearer of state power
Estonia's independence and sovereignty are timeless and inalienable
" **§ 1
Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein the supreme power of state is vested in the people
The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
However, the preambula can be taken as a sort of poetic first article and is considered a very important part, as it essentially states the reasons for the existence of Estonia
" With unwavering faith and a steadfast will to strengthen and develop the state which embodies the inextinguishable right of the people of Estonia to national self-determination and which was proclaimed on 24 February 1918, which is founded on liberty, justice and the rule of law, which is created to protect the peace and defend the people against aggression from the outside, and which forms a pledge to present and future generations for their social progress and welfare, which must guarantee the preservation of the Estonian people, the Estonian language and the Estonian culture through the ages, the people of Estonia, on the basis of § 1 of the Constitution which entered into force in 1938, and in the referendum held on 28 June 1992, have adopted the following Constitution
**Article 1:**
*Estonia is an independent and sovereign democratic republic wherein the supreme power of state is vested in the people
The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
But I really like the **preamble of the Estonian constitution**:

Official translation:

The independence and sovereignty of Estonia are timeless and inalienable
I mean, let's be honest, a very big part of it is showing middle finger to the USSR and not just symbolically
Because Russian language was not historically widely-spoken in the Baltics, and only became such due to mass immigration of Russians during Soviet occupation, it was just stripped of any status
The point being that Baltics refuse to become a Russian-speaking region just because a foreign occupying regime tried to turn them into one
Not very similar reasons, actually
Swedes in Finland have lived there for centuries and have played pivotal role in Finnish history
If anything, they're more similar to what Baltic Germans were for us
I don't think Baltics will ever make Russian a co-official language
It's something Estonians and Latvians broadly reject
At best, it might get some regional status, and even that would most likely exclude Tallinn and Riga
Identity is such a complex issue anyways, we can't even always find any reasonable justifications for it
But to put it simply, Swedish-speaking Finns were already there when Republic of Finland came to be
Vast majority of Russians in the Baltics, however, were not there when the countries came to be
Of course there are other issues at play as well, such as Finland's relationship with Sweden being almost intimate, so connections to Sweden are not a big controversy
Russia and the Baltics, meanwhile, I don't think needs much commenting
i was in finland, went on a tram and most of the people there were estonians
[This
] Estonians, after a sauna, in a ice hole grilling (probably) *Jänku Jussi Viinerid*.
I could sense that Finland would win this one
Ida-Virumaa, the by-far poorest part of Estonia, where crime rates are astronomically high, where 75% of the population are Russian, where cities consist of nothing but semi-abandoned brutalist Soviet buildings and most of the (legal) economy is entirely dependent on oil shale
Probably the Russian occupied part
* Crime rate is not really that high, I think Tallinn is worse
The thing is that a significant part of the youth have left, so many who would have commited crimes are gone (most likely to Tallinn)
* Not all towns are the same – there are abandoned ghost towns, but some are also okay-ish, like Jõhvi, Sillamäe or Narva
But yeah, it's the most problematic part of the country
It's not even that much poorer than some other regions like rural South-East or lakeside Peipsi, but it's the integration problems that make all the problems worse
Really
The Azores are one of the most beautiful places I’ve ever visited
I’d actually love to spend my retirement there
Ida-Virumaa has by-far the highest crime rate by capita, and while it’s true that the total number of crimes in Harjumaa is higher, you have to account for the fact that Harjumaa’s population is more than 5 times greater
If we talk about more serious offenses like murders and killings: there were about 8 murders and killings per 100,000 residents in Ida-Virumaa compared to about 2
9 in Harjumaa
It becomes even more apparent if we take domestic violence; there were 57 offenses per 10,000 residents in Ida Virumaa compared to 26 in Harjumaa

Furthermore, you can’t argue that a county where even the city hall of the biggest and most important town, located on the most central and touristy square, looks like [this] does not have a massive problem with urban decay
Ida-Virumaa has a problem with crime and a problem with urban decay, more so than rest of Estonia, of course
I'm mostly arguing that they're not *that* much worse than some other places in Estonia
E.g. I find Paldiski to be much uglier than towns like Narva or Sillamäe. Many towns by lake Peipsi look poorer than them
Even Tartu and Tallinn have some really poor-looking districts full of wooden shacks which are not far from city centre
Also, while Narva's failure to even restore the town hall in 20+ years is ridiculous, there are other similar stories elsewhere
E.g. Balti jaam is probably one of the ugliest and most impractical central stations in Europe
The whole mess would be better just bulldozed
Compare that to Tartu which has a classy and historical building (and it actually functions as a station
Even Narva has a proper station now
Of course there are problems elsewhere, but Ida-Virumaa is just a massive conglomerate of all those problems
"Laulupidu" aka a singing festival/party
Only the best choirs get ti sing there and almost everyone can sing along to the songs
Its also kind of a memorial for the Singing Revolution of Estonia
Trying to hit on women in the store or on the street like Americans have been recommending me
It is not de jure illegal but around here de facto it absolutely is
Here you can cycle on both sidewalks and roads, whatever fits you better
You just need to leave room for the cars (and they for you) and not endanger the pedestrians
Wait what people do that
Haha, I cut it like your brother-in-law as well
I guess I just don't much about such a seemingly petty thing
I used to go eat lunch at this now closed diner in central Tallinn and there was always one table of 2-4 guys, who were all in suits and drank 1-2 beers for lunch and stayed there for quite long
I never understood how their employers allowed it, but most people working nearby worked in banks
Yeah there's a time and a place for those things, they are called parties and pubs
Oh you better be nice or I'll use [this gadget] on your cheese
we have compound words that are correct even though they have more than 2 of the same vowel in a row
usually the rule is that a maximum of 2 of the same letter can be next to each other in a word
for clarity it's recommended to hyphenate words that dont follow this rule, but as far as i know, you dont have to and most people dont bc these words are fun
jäääär (edge of ice),
kuuuurija (moon researcher),
töööö (work night, but if you turn it around, öötöö would mean night work/job)
examples with many consonants in a row would be
kukkki (even the rooster),
sokkki (even the sock), etc
I have always found it interesting how in Finnish the word "no" is turned
* Ei
* En
* Et
I don't think any other language has that
Also - we have the letter "Õ" :) Very Estonian letter
i think estonian has a word for that too
'igatsus'
Uhh they are, closedt language to hungarian is mansi and mansi are finno ugric same as hungarians
true
the saaremaa people disagree though :P
you make a small change in intonation or a barely noticable break between the two parts that make up the word
for example "jäääär" consists of two words, "jää  and "äär" so you just say these two words very close to each other, sort of
or with "kukkki" , the word consists of "kukk" and the suffix "-ki". instead of saying each individual letter like "khkhkh", you just hold the silent part of the letter K for a bit longer
i think this kind of ties to the other fun and very specific part of the estonian language where we have 3 different lengths of pronunciation for letters ("välde" in estonian)
this is a more complicated topic i am not too good at explaining in either estonian or english, but basically in the words "vili", "viilid" and "viilima", the first i-sound is a different length in all of them
i hope i managed to explain it well enough for you to understand
i am not too sure about my explanation skills or technical knowledge of pronunciation, but i tried my best :)
Honestly, whatever, as long as we don't end up more than 1 hour ahead of Central Europe and in a different time zone from Finland and Latvia/Lithuania
Winter time benefits for like two months out of the year absolutely do not cover for all the drawbacks throughout those five months
Natural time doesn't make the sun rise at 3am
Just before the switch it was daylight out before 6am, that's just ridiculous at the end of winter
With winter time the sun sets before 4pm in the winter, that's way too early
I want to kill myself every year when all of a sudden it gets dark an hour earlier and I won't see the sun coming home from work for four months because of it
What, you think those people on their way to work and children walking home from school are invincible to dangers
Winter time is abnormal time
It's shit no matter what time of year it is
You're southerners first of all and summer time is so much better
I want to die when the sun is setting while I'm having lunch
> We need light when we are going to work, if not there will be more car accidents
Mate, you can use the exact same argument but in reverse for summer time
Your natural time is waking up 5
30am in March
And suicide rates go up in the autumn when suddenly it gets dark super early
But sun setting at 15:28 sounds great do you does it
Winter time is literally the natural time, I don't know what you are talking about
> Protests erupted, led by angry students, who blamed the accident on the fact that it is now darker in the mornings than it was before
That's super silly, with the switch to winter time more accidents happen in the evenings as there's more traffic and it's darker than it was before the switch too
However waking up at 6am at the end of February because the sun is in your eyes and panicking that you're way too late to work is just nuts
The switch is just as stupid here
In December it gets dark before 4pm
On the other hand in the beginning of March you get sun in your eyes at like 5
30am
Winter time is awful
Exactly and towards the end of february and in march the sun rises very early so that daylight is just wasted while it still gets dark early
Natural light is also very important on your way home from work, something that winter time completely takes away
In high school I had to go home from school in the darkness for months
Which was much like going in the dark except of course there was more traffic
There's nothing natural about winter time, especially for everybody who isn't a morning person
And I do mind it starting to get dark when I'm having lunch
It's dark in the morning anyway
I don't think you understand how the world works
They tyranny of morning people
Yeah I understand, doesn't make it any less bullshit
>Why are you born in a northern country then
Never mind, these kind of people will not get it
It has literally nothing to do with people
It has plenty to do with it
12:00 should technically be midday right, because that's when the sun is highest in the sky hence the system
However 12:00 isn't actually the middle of the day for the majority of people, it isn't even the middle of the work day
That's why you don't understand how the world works
We had a singing revolution to free ourselves from the Soviets, no blood, no bullets, just patriotic song and our fellow people
Also, we united with the rest of the baltics to form a human chain of several hundreds of kilometres
Glad you guys joined us there =D
Yea I learnt about that, brutal stuff but I hear he was an ass( and that's putting it lightly)
Yea its amazing, to stand there knowing that the red army could be sent to stop you, kill you if they must, absolutely terrifying to think about
Oh yea, we were super lucky, they already had guns poi Ted at us, tanks sent to retake Tallinn but Moscow changed their mind, there was too much political pressure in Moscow, so they left us alone
Its unbelievable how lucky we were
Press conference that messed up with one date, and that brought down the berlin war, not Reagan, not hasslehoff, a mistake is what did it
The collapse of Yugoslavia
The one where there were brutal killings
Yea we touched on him briefly, didn't know or remember he did all of that, just remember that he had to do something to piss off the people so much for 5 soldiers to empty clips into him
He saved many lives
Maybe the restaurants in the town hall square, they're just very expensive
Walk off it and you'll find plenty of good restaurants where a beer wont cost 6€+
I might be in the minority but getting mcdonald's on your trip isn't that bad imo, it's quite nice and conveniant
Espercially when you're in the central tourist area, fast food is fast, cheap and you know what you're getting so you can have a quick lunch and continue sightseeing
Don't have to stress around trying to find a Cafe where you wont get robbed
The comments under the trailer are pretty good
"This is worse than the famine
We would just like our historic lands back from Russia, thats all
It's definitely the nr
1 news in Estonia right now
I wish all good luck as it won't be a peaceful fight, I just hope there won't be any physical involvement from the east
Yea it has been said for a long time that change in the east only comes through revolutions
It's just how it sadly is
Lukashenka has his back against his wall, losing the election means imprisonment or exile in Russia
He isn't just fighting to keep power, he's fighting to keep his way of life, no way he'll back down
Living from election to election
I've heard American news reporters say something like "day 1182 of the X administration, 202 days until the elections" from the political left and the right, like it's some sorta punishment
SALES TAX
...and healthcare
Honestly with all the shit the US government (and various federal bureaus) has done, it's reasonable to at least not trust it much
> inches, feet, yards, acres and miles
Yeah, and there are 12 inches in feet, 3 feet in a yard, and 1760 yards in a mile (and 1760 can't be divided neither by 12 or 3)
It's all confusing to say the least
Decameters are rarely used because it's just easier to say things like "15 meters" instead of "1 decameter and 5 meters". Centiliters are actually often used for volume of liquids
Megagrams are "used" but we just name then tonnes (since 1 megagram is literally 1 tonne, and 1 tonne is also a metric unit)
Another funny mistake Germans occasionaly do is calling a mobile phone a "handy" also in English
They just assume that's what it means in English
And some Spaniards believe that "footing" means jogging in English
Edit: Clarification that "handy" is a normal word for a mobile in German
Same place as I do now, because I couldn't afford to move
Denmark
Learning the language already
Estonia prolly
I heard it's a pretty cool place
Tbh, I think everyone should take a test every 10 years to renew their license
Driving a car is not a human right, it's a pretty big responisbility
And all drivers should prove from time to time that they haven't lost their skills, especially since driving conditions can change drastically
It doesn't make sense to do a driving test once and it's valid for your whole life
Sounds about like over here, though I'll take out my warm winter jacket maybe a few degrees earlier, just wear extra lighter clothing under it
That might be because it's windy and snowing-raining-snowing-raining-snowing here often and my winter jacket is super windproof and waterproof
>Worst weather there is is 0 to 4c, wind and whatever sludd is called in english
Amen
It depends on the area
As we have a lot of coast and islands, these areas have a milder climate and temperatures rarely go below -10
As you go away from the coast, it gets \~5 degrees colder
But temperatures below -20C are usually considered somewhat newsworthy
Looking at the climate charts, Stockholm is a bit warmer: our averages are 3-5 degrees lower in the winter and just 1-2 degrees lower in the summer
Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité
Honestly I personally just take vitamine D and dream of the summer to come and of the summer that I left behind
And drink I guess, but that varies
Honestly I think it's unhealthy how much I have riding on this summer, it's always better in my head than in reality but it's true that those few good summer days give me the hope to survive winter
I might be in the extreme but this year waiting for the summer has become almost a religious thing for me
As long as I can go to the beach I honestly don't care how the corona goes
30% men smoke, 20% of women smoke
People start smoking when they're like 15, as was the case for me and my uncle for example
My father also smokes
Snus and nicotine pouches are also popular, about 6% men either do snus everyday or a few times a week
Associating us with Russia and the Soviet "Union". Pro tip: don't.
pilsner is czech though
op is from slovenia
Estonia isn't Scandinavian but should be Nordic
Same happened here
Yea but you cant travel
I meant that a huge downside that is often overlooked with lower income countries is that they cant travel
Like rent and prices might be okay and in balance but no way you're going to afford a 80€ hotel room when you're making 400€ vs when you're making 1900€.
Estonia recently had a Minister of Foreign Trade, who didn't speak English
But this former [Minister of Finance] showed some class
Btw, the guy was actually Olympic silver and bronze medalist in sailing
I'm sorry but I think we didn't have any as if we weren't under anyone's control we were trying to survive in the hostile environment that is eastern Europe
Eh ya know good ol Estonia
We make pea soup  eat pig and use the bone to create a toy with string in it
Then we sled down the mountain and the one that sleds the furthest has the best harvest during the year
An Estonian who
hates sauna
After all, we're not that different from Finns and warm sauna is the best thing against winter depression
We just have
Päike=Sun
Kuu=Moon
They do not have any genders
Historically the period under the Swedish Empire is literally still called "the good Swedish time" here centuries later
The real golden age is now though, Estonia and Estonians have never been in a better situation by a huuuuge margin
Some people think Estonian "golden age" was during first 20 years of independence from 1920 to 1939
But imo it's mostly national pride for fighting for an winning independence during war in 1918-1920
Realistically golden age as in "best time to live in our country in all of our history" is right now
We're in nato, eu, eurozone and schengen, we finally stopped decline in population, we have historically highest wages ever and it's growing (and outgrowing inflation) each year
Not in my city but in Tallinn, some citizens wishing to protest the city government's handling of garbage collection left trashbags in front of the city hall
The city officials called the police to report a "suspicious object" and the bomb squad was sent in
After being thoroughly "disarmed", the bags were determined to, in fact, contain trash
Outside of Tallinn tbh
I see Finns go to Pärnu tho for cheap Spa's and stuff
Working in Eastern Europe: Russian
Working in Western Europe: French or German
Well definetly German, but Russian is most helpful in Eastern European countries
Well in eastern europe and the baltics it is russian
And i dont know more
wait the drying rack isnt a thing everywhere (not even in europe
glögi in estonian too
Absolutely impossible
Grammar-wise it may be possible but I’ve never encountered anyone who hasn’t lived their whole life in an Estonian-speaking environment making no grammar mistakes
Pronunciation-wise I’m certain that it is impossible, if you’re not at least a Finn — and even they have a slight accent when speaking Estonian
Nope
extremely hard
I havent heard a single non-native people who has mastered it
Even if they do manage to learn the grammar, u can still hear that something is off with their pronounciation
Couldn't care less
I work pretty much all week anyway
But I am just your typical workaholic, so I am not a good representative of an average worker
If majority of voters reject this kind of proposals, there is a reason for that
Instead of thinking "duh, those voters are stupid", maybe ask them why they vote like that
The solution for that is to work in 2 shifts, not close shops earlier
I definitely wouldn't say that where I live all service industries suddenly become empty after 8pm
Pretty much everything works as long as possible because customers keep coming
Nothing is stopping you from negotiating shorter work weeks with employer
I know people who asked for half and even quarter-time workweek (obviously with reduction in pay)
>doing nothing productive
Not every job has a lot of unproductive hours though
In my opinion most people are too attached to rigid 9-5 workweek and don't even think about other options
I think the whole proposal of 4-day work week is aimed at those people
But for me it means nothing
I work as comp
graphic artist and work both in office and freelance, and though in contract I have 40h workweek, in reality I work more flexible (some days few hrs more, some days less), it all depends on amount of work
Well, Finland
Rumor has it they've helped Estonia in ways many Estonians will never fully know about
From Kekkonen supposedly convincing Soviet Union to preserve the Tallinn Old Town, to collaborating under the disguise of folklore cultural organisations, to donating police gear in use in the initial years after the restoration of independence (the whole police
structure was rebuilt from scratch basically), etc
Even up to late 90s I remember people talking about stuff donated from Finland like clothes, machinery, and such
And thank you for having good prices on alcohol
50 years of sacrifices
Too bad nobody helped us to get rid of the commies
They destroyed Narva's old town during WW2
Then they demolished everything that survived the bombing and built commieblocks instead
Tallinn would've had the same fate
In Estonia we actually laugh that Finnish sounds like drunk Estonian, so who knows who's actually the drunk one :)
"kompastuskivet" = komistuskivid (in Estonian :))
It will in the future since most countries are becoming more liberal and globalized
I dont feel any common identity with other european countries especially western ones, we have nothing in common
>Drop a Scot in New Zealand and another in Moldova and ask them a week in which one encountered the most cultural similarities
To be fair, less than a century ago both were a part of the same empire
And to this day both have the same monarch
So I don't think it's a fair comparison
We had a more cultural high school grad trip to Greece but hearing the storys from classes that went to Bulgaria make me a bit jealous
Latvia when sober
Russia when drunk
I think the Baltic's in general are sort of in a 'rivalry'. Kinda but not really
You guys really want that island, don't you
What about Hungary
So wholesome
We'll keep it
We got it fair and square with vodka

* Maja (E: house/F: hut)
* Tuba/Tupa (E: room/F: main/living room)
* Ruum/Ruuma (E: room, space/F: cargo hold)
same in Estonian
imagine having grammatical genders lmao
Estonia is great but I've thought of moving to Finland because it's close and culturaly similar
I've also thought of moving to Ireland
Excellent location for cultural exchange
Over the centuries we've had visits from Denmark, the Germans, Denmark again, Russia, Sweden, Poland-Lithuania, Russia again, Germany again, Russia again: vol 3
But atleast it's pretty
But we actually don't have that much variety, no mountains, no really grand landscapes only bogs and forests which are pretty but you can also find them in nordic countries
The more I think about it the more negative sides I can think of, but that's the true estonian way
So what you're saying is
Estonia Nordic confirmed
Well, "sital käima" in direct translation means "to walk on shit"
"Käima" here means more like "to go" as in to "to go to a shit" or "to go for a shit", but yeah "to walk on shit" sounds funnier
My friend bought a 01 when he was 13, we had some great times whipping it around the forest as kids
Definitely wont let my kids do something so stupid lol
It was the biggest pos but still worked
Had the best faults like the driver seat sliding off the rails when accelerating and not really needing to use the pedals as the clutch and brakes were toast anyway and you could use the hand throttle for accelerating
Very much so (another Estonian here lol)
My grandfather actually was a racecar driver in the USSR, in the top 3 in the Baltic states I think
Anyway, my point is he drove a really sweet decked out lada:
Oh yeah

Now it's rare
I've been thinking about buying one just for novelty
>they thought we were going home attl 2am, I felt sorry for them when we left at 7
Who goes clubbing just till 2am
Where I live most clubs don't even open till midnight, would be pointless to be there just for couple hours
Any parties before midgnight are considered for kids
Apart from Italian cities, I never had such problems in any big European city
TIL Light beer is something entirely else than what I thought it was
In Estonia we have *hele õlu*, literally "light beer" which just refers to the colour and taste, alcoholic and calorie content is entirely normal
From a quick search it seems *pale lager* is the closest term to it in English
> dinner at 22:00
At this time I usually prepare to go to bed, unless it's weekends
At what time you go to sleep and how are you not completely tired next day when you go to work at morning
Here in Estonia clubs are open till 4-5 in the morning
Isn't it the same in Finland
It's more like around 23
00-23
30 to go to bed, and I am definitely not having full dinner just an hour before going to bed
And I am talking about work days(gotta have that full 8h sleep before work), on weekends of course time schedule is different
I felt like that when I was younger
Estonia seemed so boring, like there’s nothing to do, people seemed depressing and not friendly
No bright blue ocean or tropical palm trees
Time went by, I was lucky to have the opportunity to travel quite a bit and see the world
The more I experienced the places I thought I would be a much better fit in, the more I realised how wrong I was
Now I appreciate Estonia as my home more than ever
I like that people are reserved and they don’t put up a fake smile or engage in random small talks, and that they respect your personal space
I like that we have four seasons, incredibly beautiful coastline, forests and lakes
I like how everything is closeby or how innovative we are implementing new technology
And even though we have plenty of idiots ourselves, I feel like the overall level of education of people is better than in many other places I have been to
I enjoy our traditions and food
And for the love of everything good and holy, I cannot live without our black bread
Tl;dr : I don't feel like I'm an estonian, yet I don't feel european enough to live anywhere else
I want to leave estonia but I fear that means severing my only connection to my heritage
I'm not a fan of the people I belong to but its the only people I have
Estonians tend to be a bit cold towards strangers and our history is 90% about suffering as slaves/peasants and the other 10% is us recovering from the soviet Union and e-nation
I always hated how it doesn't feel europe enough here, we are too young of a people to have a lot of history, like the greeks, italians or French
I want to feel European but I dont feel it here
We praise the European Union but not being european
I dont like how the only activities outside of home are drinking, partying and more drinking
People here are either Tallinn supremacists or hillbilly dumb asses who vote in a hate filled Conservative faction, yet I don't feel like I could fit anywhere else
I’m Estonian Estonian
It's pretty much the only way people are able to socialize
I can't imagine any party without an alcohol
Going to a night club without consuming copious amounts of alcohol is pretty much impossible
Pubs and bars are also quite popular
Unfortunately consuming alcohol is one of the few ways that make people open up here
Otherwise they are extremely cold and reserved
>Moderate social only drinking only exists in non-UK Europe
It does exist, but it's a thing on more formal gatherings
Partying on friday night
People go wasted all the time
Thankfully we don't. We're the most atheist country in the world
I haven’t seen any billboards like that in Estonia
Haven’t noticed them in other European countries I’ve traveled to either
Depends from country then
Estonia with it's 14% religious people is much less religious than the USA with its 66%.
Yeah, same vice-versa
Can understand Finnish sometimes in writing, but not without issues
Same, some Hungarian words seem similar but impossible to understand
Kohuke- Sweetened curd cheese (sometimes with additional items like jam or chocolate inside) covered in a thin layer of chocolate

Interesting where the divide between "only football" and "literally all the time" comes from
I'd have expected it to be a West-East division, but a Norwegian said it's normal to fly it, while a Pole said it's not that common
Not at all
For people who have their own house, owning a flag is probably more common than not (judging by the # of flags I see raised on flag days)
For people who live in apartments having a full-size flag is more rare, as they're not as likely to have anywhere to store or display it
In Estonia the use of our flag is pretty excessive, which probably due to the fact that the display of the Estonian flag was strictly prohibited during Soviet time
You’ll see Estonian flags on many porches all around the year, in front of *all* houses on official holidays and of course in clothing and as various kinds of decoration, such as Christmas trees, mugs, pennants and many more
In Estonia everybody has the national flag
(Might be because when we were being occupied by the russians we had to secretly keep our nationality alive somehow) But everybody buts a flag out on our independence day and whenever there’s some kind of war related memorial date
I think it’s more of a north-south divide than a east-west one
If I remember correctly - you actually HAVE to have a flag waving outside on some days
So if you have a private house it's your own flag and when you live in an apartment it's the obligation of the housing association
24th of Feb (Independence Day)
23rd and 24th of June (Victory day/St John's Eve and St John's Day)
20th of August (Re-independence Day)
There's also many other days that are the so-called "flag days", but these are the only mandatory ones I believe
In Estonia it's more that the neighbours will just look weirdly, but I've never heard of police actually fining people for this
And if you uncapitalise it and switch the w with a v, it becomes Estonian
[I think the photograph of our first independence parade in 1919]
Old and famous
[Eesti taat ja eit söögilaua ääres]
I thought the picture of the baltic way was the most famous one
I thought the most famous one for the brits was where Churchill does the peace sign
Well at least if you get a job it actually pays money not peanuts
I recommend degrees that will allow remote work
It's the only way to live: getting salary of the capital, while being able to live in a normal place (not so expensive, not full of cars etc)
>actively work with FAX machines
Frankly, I'm not sure if I have ever seen one used
I'm 30 btw
I suppose you haven't met me
Btw since I've noticed Slovakia often gives Estonia a lot of points at Eurovision, more than Finland does often enough so I consider Slovaks our brothers from very different mothers
In general there's a lot more similarities between us than there are between Estonians and Hungarians that's for damn sure
Any small town will do (like 10 000-20 000 people small)
Dunno, feels more like a matter of taste
Over here it is usually done via a digitally signed and if needed then encrypted file
You do need 2-5 klicks and and a pin to sign it and a further three klicks to send an e-mail with the file, but I'd say that about equals grabbing a pen, signing it manually and taking it to a fax machine
Indeed, ignorance is bliss
> I needed to collect signatures and stamps in a little booklet to give the Prüfungsamt when I graduated, and I better not lose it or I may have to courses all over again
Oh my god
I thought you were talking about lack of online lectures, but this, this is next level
Nope I do not, I remember it from 2009-2012 era
It had legit good songs then
You "serve" society by working(thus providing services), paying taxes and not breaking laws
Why should the forced labor be added on top of that
> There's absolutely non of that in the whole system
Can you opt out of both types of services with zero legal repercussions
If no, then it's forced labor
>  so what's wrong with making it mandatory
Infringement on my personal liberties as an adult, perhaps
I don't understand how it's acceptable in liberal democracies
Governments should incentivize working in necessary fields just by creating jobs and paying wages, so people can chose to work there on their own
> none of these things are things that can be done professionally
If that was true then countries without mandatory civil/military service would be literally falling apart
So far it is not happening
I don't understand how in your mind rescuer or firefighter can't be a professional worker
They literally need special training to deal with necessary equipment (in my country there is a whole Academy dedicated to give such education and train people for professional service)
In February 1991, there was a prank on the TV about the 100 Finnish markka bills being taken out of use
As Estonia didn't have its own currency at the time and the Soviet rouble had crashed, many relied on the Finnish markka for their savings and many rushed to exchange their bills
This was amplified by the memory of Soviet 50 and 100 rouble bills having been suddenly phased out in 1961
There's even an [Estonian Wiki article] about it
It is a bit weird yeah, I used to work at a hotel which during WWII was used by Nazis as a command post of sorts or sth like that
Estonian language and culture
As a Russian who is still going to a Russian school here, I have to learn Estonian
In the primary school pretty much every kid hated Estonian language and Estonian songs and traditions that we had to learn, but now I appreciate that I know such a unique language
Danish does sound like shit tbh
I don't know that many European fast food restaurants, but you Finns really got something right with Hesburger
This is a lot better than McDonalds
I once tried Hesburger and almost puked, don't recommend lol
We have KFC here at Estonia
Maybe you were pregnant
I was poisoned there once so I don't go there at all
Some people have been poisoned in McDonalds though
And everything I tried in Hesburger was inferior to McDonalds in my opinion anyway
We have KFC here at Estonia
Not really, I've added a link to this message that has the KFC locations in Tallinn
(There's 2)
Here in Estonia it's still e-post (e-mail) or simply "meil" (basically same as English "mail")
Plenty of businesses have their own email adresses
And for communications inside companies employess also mostly use e-mails provided by the company
And I also still have my hotmail account as secondary private e-mail
I was 20 and applied to jobs with my "juxxx666@hotmail
com" account
That was my actual account
Very professional
Yep
For example in Estonian we say "meil" when referring to an e-mail
The word "e-kiri" (*e-letter*) exists but isn't really used (at least not in speech)
Latvia
Finland
Russia
Sweden
Lithuania
Latvia is first not because we specifically learn about Latvia, but much of our history also applies to Latvia
The same is true for Finland and Lithuania to a lesser degree, while with Russia and Sweden, we'd learn more about their countries themselves
Hmm first that come into my mind are:
Germany
Denmark
Sweden
Latvia
Russia/Soviet Union
Germany, Russia, Sweden, Denmark and maybe Lithuania
Germany played a large role
Did you forget that Latvia exists or what
I think it's more that Germans played a large role and not particularly Germany itself
I mean, WW2 knowledge about Germany is pretty universal for everyone in Europe, not just for our own national historiography
I think the connection with Denmark is very strongly concentrated into the 13th-16th century and we barely talk about Denmark outside the context of the Danish territories in Estonia
Yeah the Teutonic order or better known here as Livonian Order and the Hanseatic League time periods are very fascinatic to study
How our capital (called Reval back then) was quite an important city for our location for trade between the west and east (ofcourse this location was also a curse why we were conquered so many times)
And yeah most native Estonians were peasants, but still it was interesting time period and a lot of our old town was built turing that time period, if i don't remember anything wrong
I know
The Teutonic State however fought Lithuania a lot when it stretched all the way to the Black sea
I'm talking about the German Teutonic Order
That doesn't make any sense
By that logic we should exclude all countries we were once one state with
Yep, although I think this question entails modern countries
Also our knowledge of the Teutonic Order is rather limited to its Livonian branch
Look at the other comments, a lot of them mention countries that do not exist today
Ah, ok
In those 51 years humanity has created several satellite global positioning systems with precision down to couple meters
In terms of actually being practical for the whole humanity, it's much more grand than sending couple of guys to the moon and  bringing some rocks back
Uhhhhhhh well Finland is basiclly the helpful step bro (please no im stuck jokes please i beg you) Latvia and Lithuania are like normal brothers
I'd say we are an adopted child of the baltic family
And Finland is the step bro who isn't in the family
Finland, genetically linguistically and culturally
For us, it's always been Finland
I would fight for Finland if another country ever attacked it
aww stop it you
Ahh i see you truly are a man of culture aswell
Edit: Writing this only because you appeared to be following me around Reddit
You'd be better off finding some other topic to focus on
This has nothing to do with Latvia, so I don't understand why you're so invested in what estonians think on this topic
Latvia will always be the country that we consider as a friendly neighbour in the south
That's where most of us also draw the line
We are not "brothers" with Latvia
We are not family
We are friendly neighbours who also share some common interests (defense topics mostly) and have had similar challenges in the past
If you keep insulting estonians for how they feel (like many latvians seem to do in reddit), or trying to manipulate opinions like some of your posts, then it will result in the opposite reaction to what you're looking for
I wish you well
There are many healthier topics / areas to focus your energy on
Poll:
oh you you’re making me blush
Kinda true
Thats what other Baltics fail to understand
i think its perfect the way it is
i wouldnt change a thing
I wouldn't except maybe add a finno ugric symbol or something like that
I’d like to make better ties to our brothers up north and change it to a Nordic cross version
i like the current one better
its simple, memorable, striking and looks great in any size
At the childhood home never
But if your parents were to own another property or apartment, they could charge you a small fee, like 1/3 of the rent price
My parents bought an apartement as an investment in my university city where I live and they take the rent that my roommate pays
I have even brought out the topic that maybe I should also pay something but will immediatley get shut down
Maybe later when I start earning more than the minimum wage Ill try to pay, at my age it seems fair
Not really national but some regions have their contenders
For example Žorik, in Tallinn
A stray dog who recently got it's own statue
He has been taken into a home to live peacefully but he tries to escape which is has resulted in a rather big "dog-hunt" as everyone is concerned about him
It seems like it is easy for us aswell
Britan
They helped us during our independence war
UK cuz they helped us in our independence war
We have Iceland Square(our foreign ministry is there on purpose)We had an event called Day of Iceland back in 2011 in honour of 20th anniversary of Iceland recognizing our independence
I grew up with Moomin books and anime
House at night but not the day, apartment always closed
Žonn meid his vei tu ä tävern truu te dark forest, ounli tu faind aut tät hi forgott te mani
Please note that Estonian neiter has a j-sound as in ‘John’ nor a sh-sound as in ‘she’, therefore I used the foreign letter ‘ž’.
As in phonetic spelling
"Džon meid his vei tu ei tävern fruu ze dark forest, õunli tu faind aut zät hi forgot ze mani
Estonian:
Dšon meid his uei tu ei taven thru thö daak forst ounly tu faind äut thät hi fogot thö mani
Džon meid his vey tu a tavern fruu de dark forest, onli tu faind out tät hi forgot de mani
in estonian : "Džon meid his uei tu ei tävörn fru de dark forest, õunli tu faind aut tät hi forgot de mani
i think
Currently, there’s a lot of fuss about the legalisation of gay marriages
It’s a very polarising topic, but I hope to see some progress in the near future
We are also facing a never ending embarrasement caused by our Interior Minister
He is known for misogynistic and homophobic statements, which have been utterly harmful for Estonia’s reputation
He is a populist and a demagogue who represents a loud conservative minority
Our prime minister has to constantly apologise for him, but that’s as far as it goes when holding him accountable for his actions
They both should have resigned a long time ago
Finland, if you see this, then I am really sorry for his misogynistic comments about your prime minister
He does not represent the views of the majority of Estonians
I personally admire Sanna Marin and I think she is a fantastic leader
Mart Helme, interior minister, said that gays can go to sweden
Some people are very angry at this, also the greens got a petition through to the parlament, the petition is for legalization of same sex marriage
definitely Tartu, it is the only uni in the baltics that is in the 500 best unis
all are free, but University of Tartu  is generally regarded as the best, probably because it is also the oldest and thus most reputable
I am somewhat unintrigued by the landlocked Central-European countries: Czech Republic,  Slovak Republic, Austria
I know they have pretty castles, but I can watch pictures of them and don't have to travel there
Yes, there are mountains, but mountains without the sea is like having a soup without a dessert - it fills the purpose, but the enjoyment is not there
Mainly, none of the three interests me with their language of culture
Serbia might also somewhat fall into the list, though maybe I just know too little about it
Personally I am also just not clicking with Spain
Too extroverted for me, I guess
At the same time, I loved Portugal
And Moldova I simply forgot for a minute, but as I find Romania somewhat cool, then Moldova can pull that shine on itself, too
The description of Slovakia was somewhat what I was thinking in my mind - what would be a "slovak" thing
But I must say, that being not crowded with tourist is also a big upside
So you kind of have all the listed things minus the mess and higher prices of tourist hotspots
I am not a fan of the language either
But I'd think that they have more than Paris - Normandy and Brittany, the wineyards, Bordeaux, Marseille, maybe some Arabic influence in places etc
Took a train all the way to Vladivastok
Was a nice ride
There are buddhists in Ulan Ude
There is Lake Baikal
There are muslims in Kazan
There is Kamchatka that is basically Iceland on steroids
There are so many tiny finno-ugric nations
There is The Empty North
There is cheap food and great hospitality, also fabulos arts and plenty of history
I mean, on that lattitude, you cannot expect beach resorts
>Maltese language
Yes
I like denmark it's like a more laid back scandinavia, people arent so uptight
Hungary was way more interesting to me
I love the language, I really liked the small villages, felt kinda
dunno
Asian in an interesting way
The wines
The warmth
The thermal waters
Just has this really nice vibe for me
No, I am not a Slavo-phobe (as I said, neither do I think much about "Austrian German", I prefer German German)
There are just many Slavic languages and there are others that have caught my eye more: Russian as I always like learning new alphabets, Bulgarian cause it has a nice softer sound to it than other Slavics, Slovenian cause is has some really old features (uses "dual", has odd pronouns) and interesting influences and even Ukrainian as I happen to have a few friends who have relatives in Ukraine and listening to them has been really fun
The West-Slavic languages have not attracted me that much, I think they simply have too few vowels for my personal taste, as pointed out by this webcomic:
Yeah, it is definitely subjective
As it is with most "beauty" I think
The connections there are in ones mind, the memories, the habits - they all play a great role in this
Yeah, I do believe I can find something interesting in every country
Maybe some lakeside villages or even Bregenz, maybe Graz for the history and a quick google also added Seewinkel National Park for some birdwatching
Good videos
The carst based river system is really cool, luckily both Croatia and Slovenia are in my to-visit list anyway
You also have Milk Bars, this is cool
I had no feelings for Warsaw, but Krakow seemed lovely and I do want to make it to your seaside towns as well
I personally don't like Tallinn much, the old town is pretty, but otherwise it is rather generic and full of cars - but that might be more from the experience of living there for a year than from a tourist perspective
I personally like the [bogs] more interesting [coastal] locations and small seaside towns like [Kuressaare] [Haapsalu] and maybe [Pärnu] The small Uni town of [Tartu] might also be worth a visit
What are the relations between Slovakia and Hungary like nowadays
Or Slovakia and Ukraine
We don't hear too much about you guys here, so would love to have an opinion from you
Yeah, not like southwest-Asia, but maybe some imaginary-Mongolia type of Asia
I think it's partially due to some aspects of architecture that are not so common in the north (though ofc not limited to Hungary in southern parts of Europe) and partially due to the vastness of the landscapes (plains, wine yards, etc)
Can't really explain it, might just be in my head
Btw did you know that pretty much all Estonian kids read read "A Pál-utcai Fiúk" at school
I think you guys could have quite a laugh indeed, if asking an Estonian/Finn to pronounce Czech words
For Slovenian, have a peak in there: [
It is a part of compulsory literature at most schools - and usually also popular among kids
We usually have half of the literature from Estonian literature and the other half from foreign literature every year
From the classics, Orwell (british), Dostojevski (russian), Hugo (french), Lindgren (swedish) and Lee (USA) are usually included to name a few
The languages are related distantly enough, to not understand more than single words, but have a look at that for example:
Actually quite difficult to say
We're a small country so it's difficult to hide big cases and they tend to come out
However our corruption probably has a different form, it's more of a nepotism, however still there have been bribing scandals
No daily corruption though, can't buy off the police and so on
Very
Alteast so I've heard from the Estonian mafia
[Arvo Pärt - "Aliinale" (1976)]
A really gentle piano piece from an Estonian composer, that I often listen to at night, when alone and painting/reading/writing/yoga/etc
It is like barely there, really grows on you
Anyone who has ever been to one of our song festivals (especially as a singer) - [“Ta lendab mesipuu poole”]
Or [“Laul Põhjamaast”]  (starting from 1:10)
Rail Baltica and HS2 are steps toward that
We need better trains
Also did you know that latvia and estonia will soon start building European largest offshore wind farm
I had a related experience when on a trip with my friends
We had rented a lodging and were eating breakfast in the kitchen, all hung over
I was just eating a sandwich, my eyes looking into the distance
So my friend tried to be the active one and started a conversation about whether I usually put ham on cheese or cheese on ham on my sandwich
I looked at his sandwich and **he had put cheese on ham**... I just yelled at him across the table, asking "What are you doing
" and everyone else at the table agreed
He agreed that this conversation blew up in his face quite fast - we still sometimes tease him about it
Well there was this worldwide a discussion about what way should you place [the toilet paper roll] \- does the paper roll off from the upper/front (over) or lower/back side (under)
Specific ones to Estonia
Maybe food-realted stuff like team [*peenleib*] vs team [*vormileib*] for bread preferences, though I think the majority is team *vormileib* anyways
And are the default pancakes [small (one-spoonful) pancakes] or [big (over-the-pan) pancakes] I think the majority is used to big pancakes
A potato salad should be made with sour cream
And maybe add a bit of mayonnaise
The second is not a potato salad, it's an abomination, actually the former is too
Who the hell cuts potatoes like that, it should be in cubes
Anything with raisins is garbage
It's clearly a biscuit
Cakes are designed to be eaten with a cake fork or a spoon, you eat Jaffa cakes identically to any other good biscuit
of course smetana goes on borsch
Sour cream goes on everything
(Estonian)
There are two types of sandwiches:
a) black bread - ham - cheese - cucumber
b) white bread - ham- cheese - tomato
Tomato on a black bread
Cucumber on a white bread
Cheese under ham
All unheard of
In my childhood, it was actually ham OR cheese, only rich snobs would put BOTH on one bread
Edit: kinda joking, ofc
Might be just my family thing
The name is the impostor
> The two biggest are probably whether potato salad should or should not contain mayonnaise
You are one of these barbarians who makes potato salad with vinegar aren't you
Why is sour cream in the sweet pot
Nonono, sour cream is firmly in the salty category because you might add salt, lemon pepper or garlic in there
You're from Harjumaa aren't you
There is only one possible situation where cheese won't go on top and that's when there's tomato slices included
Meat is always under cheese
Do not say that, you don't know how people can interpret that
I've had sour cream on pizza in Russia
Me personally, I never eat soups with sour cream
> scone rhymes with gone
That just sounds like an alien language, and we're not even entirely sure what a scone is
I am convinced that all Russians do this because I have one Russian guy living next to me in the dorm and not once has he put it the right way round
Oh my god, he actually said it out loud
Makes sense, not sure what NI protestants think they are, to the everyone else they just seem ridiculous
Well, on all Estonian foods
It is a must on almost every soup indeed, exceptions are milk/cream cheese based soups
With pea soup smetana is optional
Pure oil has no goddamn place in a potato salad
You put sour cream on sauerkraut
Really, would sour cream and pizza be common in Lithuania
Because I've literally never seen it in Estonia
No, I mean that pronunciation is alien
Scones themselves looked like a mix of a muffin and some other pastry for which there really isn't a suitable name in English
Sometimes I do
Gives it sort of a creaminess thing
I always put sour cream on sauerkraut soup though
I think in Estonia we actually know almost everyone or at least someone who knows someone
But I think really special is the moment when you meet another Estonian in totally random place far away from home country
It always feels like a miracle to hear Estonian in less touristy place and we always have to greet each other and of course have to ask if they know someone we know
And also sometimes we wave or flash lights to another car when we're far from home and see Estonian licence plate
Estonian trucks tend to honk to Estonian cars as well
Kilpkonn(shield frog)=turtle
Nahkhiir(skin mouse)=bat
Jõehobu(river horse)=hippo
Laiskloom(lazy animal)=sloth
Meresiga(sea pig)=guinea pig
Okassiga(thorn/needle pig)=porcupine
Jääkaru(ice bear)=polar bear
Ninasarvik(nose horn)=rhino
There are maybe more but I do not remember all
Edit:Found more
Pesukaru(wash bear)=raccoon
Kuldnokk(gold beak)=starling
Edit:Found one more
Metskits(forest goat)=Roe deer
I guess in Estonia we don't have any significant examples (or maybe I don't know about them) because we don't have any projects started in the first place
Our government loves to fantasise and promise something and then everyone forgets about it
For example, trams in Tallinn
Every year the administration orders a new research where trams would work great, turns out we can have trams everywhere in Tallinn and beyond and then we wait for the next research
Tram line to Lasnamäe, planned since the soviet times and never executed, is promised every election
Linnahall in Tallinn is also a great example - it was closed in 2009 and since then new projects appear every now and then
Opera house, conference center, mall, new passenger port - you name it
But now there is Rail baltic and I fear it will suit this thread in a couple years
Even now there are many problems and construction hasn't even started yet in Estonia
Oh wow
Estonia has had ID cards (with a chip) since 2002
I don't even have a passport (you don't need one when travelling in Europe)
They are also partly responsible for the delayed Crossrail in London, due to open in December 2018 but now pushed back to late 2021
Mandatory here from the age of 15
Cost is 25€ but the government can reduce or waive it if you have financial difficulties, and lasts 5 years
Well, we can use the ID cards to travel anywhere in the EU (plus the UK until the end of the year I think)
Passports are only needed for going outside the EU
No, you can visit them with an EU ID card, until the UK stops allowing them
I've done it 3 times over 2 years
Thankfully no, only dustmasks are gone from building stores
Well, my best friends father bought supplies for 3 months, for a very good reason see, he has a chronic lung problems and if he caught corona, he would die
Lumemari
Snowberry - actually not a real berry or anything but it’s the name of a delicious ice cream flavour and I always thought it was the most beautiful Estonian word
Its cognate *eit* used to mean "wife" or "married woman", but now is a bit derogatory and means "old hag".
It’s a small difference of the name but this berry is called lumimari and the ice cream is lumemari
Or *Linnutee* ("Bird's Way") in Estonian
Krõõt. I really hate it’s sound
I also hate all these English names with Estonian spelling, such as Kätlin (Caitlyn), Keit (Kate), Braian (Brian) or Mäddox (whatever this is supposed to be)
Funnily enough, with how Estonian pronunciation works, Kevin actually sounds normal unlike most others (Brandon etc)
That sounds so stereotypically Finnish
Sonny is a dog’s name where I’m from
now its one of mine as well
A common deposit system for bottles/cans would be nice
Yes, this
How absurd that while you are free to and even encouraged to buy goods from another member state, but then you can't actually do the environmentally reasonable thing and return them to the system
Or well, you can, but nobody will return your money and this means very few people are willing to bother, even less carry over their empty bottles to another country
In a time where environment is being prioritised, this should be a no-brainer
>from 300 to 6
000   € within one financial Union
Just a nitpick - lowest average net wage in EU is 500eur in Bulgaria, highest is 3500 in Luxembourg
Higher and lower wages are in European countries outside the EU
It can be done here in Tallinn as well (if you have credit card with contactless payment enabled)
We have the same system, but it's incompatible with Finnish or Latvian ones, for example
So if I'm bringing over a pack of beer cans from Finland, I need to take the empty cans back to Finland to get my deposit money back (stores charge some money for the cans/bottles, which you'll get back once you return them)
Same for Finns doing it here or in Latvia
Some of the bottle machines might have some places to put non-refundable cans/bottles, but people are not really motivated to do it
The result is that "foreign" cans/bottles are usually not returned at all
Most likely they'll end up in trash, but worst case scenario is just being dumped somewhere
Considering there's always the talk of "single market" in the EU, it's quite ridiculous this wasn't thought through
Since we hated the communist more than the fascist, we have it more communist oriented
Unfortunately there is a sizable minority who sees Estonian members of WW2 pro-German collaborationist divisions and security units in a more positive light
Main idea is "they fought against bolshevism, duh". It's even worse in our neighbor Latvia, where parades of  SS unit veterans were held
I understand and fully support anyone who dislikes soviet regime and their illegal annexation of neighbouring countries, but I will never understand why you have to celebrate those who fought for another totalitarian regime because of that
Disco Elysium
I played it and it was great
Only popular video game made by Estonians
Yeah, game develepoment industry in Sweden is pretty big
I had a pleasure to visit Avalance studio office and it was pretty cool to see EA office literally across the street, as well as Paradox office couple floors above
I love baba is you
My favourite puzzle game
Dude, you have freaking Max Payne, Alan Wake and Control
Finns for helping us in the war on liberation
*you will fight till the last finn*
Limpa, Valge klaar and Kelluke are all very popular here
We have Jaffa in Estonia too
We also have Limpa limonade here, very good
Especially the blueberry flavour
Limpa is just the shortened version of the word "Limonaad" and the name of the company
But in slang people use "Limps" too
You can disable it by changing your YouTube language to English
It's totally fine to discuss for both our own (K. Päts) and foreign, i.e. Soviet and German dictators
It's not taboo to talk about it, but if you praise Stalin for example you will get stares and people will be mad at you
Don't think there even are many games translated to Estonia (maybe some indie game)
But i even hate if someones uses Windows in Estonia, some translations make no sense (Same with phones)
Since i dont know any videogames that have been made in Estonian and there are almost never translations, i play games in English
Well I can't play games in estonian and finnish sounds so weird in video games so I'll rather play in english
Only game I know that has an Estonian translation is minecraft but I still prefer English
Eh, maybe a bit
I speak Estonian, learned English and speak it very fluently, learning German in school
Used to learn Swedish on Duolingo
Yes, i know estonian and english and used to speak finnish, i want to learn finnish and mari, which is spoken in russia
Finland: Estonia does not want into Nordic, Estonia just wants to reconnect to its big brother
We should do more stuff together, like saving the languages of distant relatives who are still trapped somewhere in Russia
Also sorry for the dude who insulted your prime minister, I'm afraid he's not ok in the head
Sweden: thanks for the university and everything
For some reason, it is still called "good ol' Swedish era". Oh, and sorry for burning down Sigtuna, unfortunately we cannot remember what exactly happened there anymore
Denmark: we were so connected in history, how come we drifted apart
As far as foreign rulers go, the times hanging with you were some of the best times, thank you for trusting the locals
Germany: we share a lot of history and had Germans living her for generations right up until the WW2 (our middle ages are pretty much called German period)
So you can come and visit more, a lot of people over here do speak German and have no-one to practice with
Russia: We are sorry for all the idiots who think that everything from the east sucks
It does not, you have amazing literature, ballet, music, nature etc, not all is politics
We can accept nowadays that Russians, too, suffered under USSR
You guys should really open yourself to tourism more (that you already started with the visa-free lists), I think it will bring you tons of money with just a little marketing
Latvia: Northern Latvia often feels like home
And do you actually want to have an island
Maybe we could give you some that are currently not inhabited
Lithuania: thank you for trying to help Belarus
We should be of more help
Iceland: we all know that Iceland was the first to recognize Estonias re-independence and we salute you for this
Portugal: could we start some kind of a seaside-countries club in Europe
We could have like some celebrations that are hosted by a different member every year
I feel like there is a similar element of melancholy in our cultures and it would be interesting to meet more often
Lol, don't worry, the bad Finnish tourist stereotype doesn't reach much further than the harbour area and certain Tallinn Old Town pubs
Greetings from the north, cousin
Over here, all people know at least these to things about Hungary for sure: that our languages are related and that "A Pál utcai fiúk" is from Hungary (kids read it in school)
Funnily enough, we seem to also share a tiny dessert that you call Túró Rudi and most of Europe does not know of
Also, YES, do the trans-siberian
I did it and it was fab
We stopped in \~10 cities for a night and it was very cool, are planning to go back to some places
Do not miss Kazan, Ulan Ude or Krasnoyarsk
If you want to come somewhere where you can feel at home, then I think our climate is just as shitty as yours
But as for actually changing the system, I do think some changes will happen eventually, but it will take time
You need some new great thinkers that can inspire people to develop a better system - I'd hope that they will start cropping up
Heh, thanks
Did not really think that there will be Portugese people that know of Estonia (:  When I visited Portugal, I felt an odd sort of connection with the place, that has never been the case with any other southern countries - so it intrigued me a lot
Especially as it was a very spontaneous trip and I really didn't know too much about Portugal before that
Vielen Dank
Die deutsche Sprache ist sehr schön!
Yeah, it is inhabited and a very cool place with it's own unique culture
As for showing our faces, people from the southern half do visit every now and then (and not just those idiots who come for cheap beer), we like little roadtrips or weekend getaways at your place sometimes
And then there is Positivus festival, it was extremely popular when it first started
You're welcome to
I recommend to come in the middle of August for the best weather and relatively long days, though if you want very long days and maybe to participate in a midsummers celebration, come at the end of June
Avoid November and March at all costs (unless you are a freak like me and like November storms)
I'm so sorry if it came off as harsh
As I said, there are no hard feelings associated with this for ages, people have started to question many things that narrative about the middle ages and there are good reasons for it
A lot of it was written during early independence movements and later edited by Russians
You can see some clear political motives for both of these groups to use things that happened so long ago that nobody knows anymore to their advantage
I just think it's really interesting that this narrative is very well-known in Estonia and pretty much in history textbooks, while I have yet to meet a German who knows it
I do find it somewhat odd that it is so unknown in Germany, not because I don't know that we are a small country and far away from you, but because you guys had so much land and huge mansions here, a lot of relatives here etc, and these rich Germans still lived here right until 1939-1941 ( *Umsiedlung*)
So it is not so old: even if you're a schoolkid atm, your grandmother was alive when those rich Germans left for Germany from Estonia
And they lost all that estate, they did such a big move, I'd think it's something that comes up among family, youknow
There have also been several discussions during different time periods about who and on what conditions could get these lands back etc and some have managed to get something I believe
I mean they were basically victims of the pact between Hitler and Stalin
I really didn't mean anything bad, but I can see how that can come off as negative and I'm sorry for that
This is a nice thread and I had no intentions on making it nasty and political
I actually second-guessed if I should erase that part as I had finished (didn't realise it while writing) and I should have listened to that impulse
I also decided to move that part from my original post, to avoid hurting  people
I'd like to share it with some Germans who are interested in  history at some point, but this is not the place for it :)
Though looking at how people are not happy about Polish politicians at all, it might not help a lot
Who has never conquered anyone
Maybe I'd suggest Latvia
They have their ups and downs depending on who's at the power, but the system seems to be working
u/marussia123, Ruhnu doesn't really have a distinct culture (while Kihnu does)
I mean, it used to back when it was inhabited by Swedes, but not anymore
Ich mag Deutsch, viele Leute sagen, dass Deutsch hart und aggressiv klingt, aber wenn es keine Kriegsrede ist, klingt Deutsch sehr schön!
The Hansaetic towns or at least the towns that were towns during the Hansaetic league are the nicest towns over here
During middle ages, Estonia was controlled by the Teutonic order (what exactly is it's relationship to Germany is foggy to me, but I assume it came down to the fact that the dudes spoke what was considered German)
We call our country "Eesti" and the people "eestlane". The old term for people was "maarahvas", that means "people of the land".
A local version is to call that place "Kapa-Kohila" (*Kappakoil* in German)
It is actually an older name for a little railway village (borough) [Kohila] in Estonia
You can also call the location "Pärapõrgu". This could be translated as Behind-the-Hell or The-Hell-Behind
Estonians say "pärapõrgu" which means something like behind the hell and sometimes even "karuperse" which means a bear's' ass
>Behind the Lord's back
We have the same saying, but the meaning is completely different
"Nagu vanajumajala seljataga" /behind the ol'Gods back/ - in a safe place
I am starting to wonder if I have simply misunderstood that saying since childhood
No, I can confirm your interpretation
"Valmis või mitte siit ma tulen" i hate it
"Valmis või mitte, siit ma tulen"
Valmis või mitte, siit ma tulen
Valmis või ei, siit ma tulen
"Valmis või ei, siit ma tulen
It's a direct translation of the english phrase
There aren't much they can do about it
I remember Soviet Union
It's quite hard to be the bold one and do something about it
Life is so sweet and nice
Do you love estonian accent aswell : (
Same I ve been trying a lot to change my accent it sounds horrible
Yay : )
One, that I did not see here
Botas - trainers
And I don't think that I have ever even seen any of their products in real life
[For bonus]
Interestingly even Estonian, which isn't even an indo-european language, kinda has this same similarity
The estonian for dragon is either "draakon" or "lohe".
"Draakon" is somewhat more common nowadays, and is most strongly associated with rhe high fantasy type of dragons like Game of Thrones and LOTR
"Lohe" is a bit more archaic, although definitely still in use
It's just not as obviously a loanword, so the translation is not as specific to the types of dragons we're used to seeing .
Kite in estonian is "tuulelohe", which basically translates to "dragon of the wind", being composed of "tuule" meaning "of the wind", and "lohe" meaning dragon, as i said before
I mean if the American didn't speak Spanish and the Spaniard couldn't speak English it would be a logical backup option to communicate in French
If you're from outside the county(Harjumaa), where the capital is, you're basically from the wild West to those living in the capital
If you live in Harjumaa you are basically thought of as having you're life centered around Tallinn
And if you're from Narva, you ain't even in the same country
I would still consider Tartu and Pärnu and maybe a few other cities to not quite be the wild west, but other than that it basically is wilderness lol
Pärnu and Tartu still feel significantly different to Tallin, but maybe their not quite wilderness yet
Thank you I needed that
From estonia to lativa iv never had my passport checked you just drive over the boarder no guards no stops from estonia to finland on a boat never had to show a passport just buy a ticket online swipe it and go
my grandma lives near the border and sometimes does grocery shopping in latvia
Not that often, usually when travelling, Latvia is quite far away form my town (100km) and Riga (with activites) is even futher to make it worth to drive for no reason
Also prices are quite similar so it doesn't become a reason
Also wages are lower so that also isn't a reason
Helsinki is like 1
5h by ferry but then again you need to start buying tickets and everything is more expensive there anyway
Around 20-25% of the population are russians i live in estonia
I'm from estonia, they start teaching code here from the first grade
I think popular enough it should be legal (won't probably happen before some other big neighbours legalize it) . I know there are a lot of sunday smokers who do it rarely
But more young people have started to smoke (wich is not that good for their brain development)
But i think cannabis should be legal and controlled by the state, not that smokers will keep funding the underground gangsters/mafia and will end easy access to other drugs too arter they found their cannabis contact (wich is not hard to do if you walk arround with open eyes arround some parts of town)
A lot of countries has shown that war on drugs don't work, you need to reach helping hand for addicts not punish them as criminals
(this goes for other drugs too and i don't mean we should legalize everything)
Yeah THC got somehow legal as "food  supplement" or something like that (But the police are still harrasing those who grow and sell it once a while, even if everything is legal)
It's sad our politicans don't see the value how much money you can make by taxing it
But no, let the people finance criminals, that's fine
They don't understand by making it legal here, there would be much less street dealers selling it to underage kids (wouldn't say it would dissapear totally)
And all the new tourists we would get
But no, cannabis is "the root of evil" and road to all kinds of different drugs in their eyes
But i think younger people are starting to change their minds slowly, so i am hoping for the best
Also when i got arrested while owning under 1g and smoking a tiny pipe, they treated me like i was big criminal, and like almost 10 police officers were dealing with me totally, turing the whole deal in the police Station
And the same time people are getting beaten up in old town every weekend with no police in sight (not every weekend, but you get the point)
It's much easier to catch stoners, because most other drugs you inhale, eat or inject with seconds in some dark bathroom (not that i use any other drug)
But i doubt you are walking arround with brownies all the time and smoking smells and can't be done that discreet
We also have like Maikel and stuff, we also have names like Keitlin, Kätlin (Catylin) and Sessiilia (Cecilia)
I'm not leaving due to the economic situation of my country, but I do plan on working abroad for a few years just for the experience
Isn't it also dangerous to just wander around in deserted areas in ex-yugoslavian countries due to all the land-mines left from war times
>were you can be more that a few kilometers from structures
Checked google maps and up in the north of Norway there are areas of 100+ km with no man-made structures in them
I just checked this railway line on google maps and it definitely is not 3h of nothingess
It goes through several towns on the way and there are small villages every few miles on its way as well
>There is a lot of details lacking from google maps
I checked satellite images ) There is quite a lot of nothingess in Finnmark
Obviously compared to Siberia it's not much, but compared to central Europe where you can't go more than a few kms without noticing human footpring, it's quite a lot
>real forest
Wilderness is not just forests though
And you definitely have quite big areas where there is literally nothing but nature - judging by google maps there are ares of 100+ km between roads with nothing but swamps, planes and hills there
Very mildly if at all
Our previous president was born in Sweden
Unlike USA, Estonian citizenship is based on parents' citizenship status, not on being born in Estonia, so location of birth doesn't have nearly as much significance as it does in America
The president usually doesn't have much power but has a lot of representative responsibility,  so it is of some importance
In Estonia if a Russian got elected, it would ruffle some feathers
Just too much bad history with them ://.
Our previous president was born in Sweden and grew up in New Jersey
[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]
His birthplace was never a problem
I mean Toomas Hendrik Ilves was born in Stockholm, grew up in Sweden and the USA and only came to Estonia in the 90s. I think it's a bit different for ex soviet block countries, in some sense if you were born before the 90s you weren't born on the soil of the Republic of Estonia
Yea, we have it complicated
Honestly, as Estonia is a small country, it seems as all big media have pretty same moderate views and luckily all of them imo aren't afraid to criticise the government, even the government owned channels
But, when EKRE came to power last year, they complained that one journalist of ERR (the national broadcaster who owns a few radio stations and tv channels) criticised them too harshly and eventually he was fired
So here is that
Finland, because they're the only other Finnic nation that has its own country
I want to say Finland but reading the comments it might be one way love
We have been friends since the fall of Tsardom of Russia
Our president even Konstantin Päts wished to make a unified Finland ala Greater Finland on 1917
In 1939 Finland had volunteers from Estonia against Russia
Also Finnish and Estonian anthems melody's are literally the same
Finland
Tfw you don't consider us as a friend
I thought it was Lithuania because of Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth
Well we certainly are Finnic, just like Finland and some tribes in Western Russia
Now this is what i can agree with
Sibelius
Yes, I wear one right now
I have no idea what is written there
For me it was just 2€ t-shirt that covers me
Ok I'm reading it first time right now
"Dry Goods Tom Taylor MCMLXII registered trademark no 957 872"
Well among teenagers it's quite popular to wear shirts that say fuck or lit or w/e. Often in bold italic Futura
No, I bought it this year
Maybe it was produced 1962 :), I have no idea
Yes, you are correct
Jokes about Russians that aren't funny  Ahem* what did Ivan say to Dimitri
Nothing , they're both passed out drunk in a soviet age bus station
Kaiu raba or Kolgu raba
Both names are used
It's a bog in Estonia
People have gone missing, Multiple UFO sightings have been reported, compasses and GPS's can stop working
Time can stop too
It has even been tested, people have  took 2 watches and left one at the entrance of the bog and one inside the bog
The watch that was left at the entrance of the bog was way ahead of the watch in the bog
A grandma and a grandchild once saw a man with very brown skin, just red underwear who was walking very weirdly
A hunter set up a trap to catch an animal and set up a camera
So if an animal tripped over the wire, it would take a photo
When the hunter later went to check the camera, there was no animal on the picture
There was a man with a very curved back and with a walking stick
Every local was asked if they knew who it was and nobody recognized the man
That man has been spotted many times but nobody knows who it is
There have been more sightings of strange creatures but the old man is the most famous one
I just listened to a podcast episode about this place and other claimed paranormal sightings in Estonia
Definitely one of the spookiest locations
Sadly no, it’s a podcast in Estonian about crime and paranormal fenomena
13-15- Estonia
Right now there are 5 major parties in Estonia:
Keskerakond (Central Party)(Liberal)
Reformierakond (Reform Party)(Liberal)
EKRE (Right wing Conservative Party)
Isamaa (Conservative Party)
Sotsiaaldemokraatlik Erakond (Social Democratic Party)
There are also some smaller irrelevant parties
Occasionally buying something from local, but expensive bakery or restaurant
I have a choice of buying something way cheaper from a grocery store next door, but I still want to support the small local businesses
AND occasionally being a blood donor
In estonian it's nojaa
We say nojaa or nojah or alternatively no nii
First name and surname (father's)
My Danish teacher had a problem with the naiming system in Estonia
He had a baby here
In Denmark it's relatively common to have two first names and two surnames (judging from my Danish acquaintances at least)
In Estonia by law you can't do that
You can either have two first names and a surname or one first name and two surnames
But not both
I don't really know whether names like "Karl-Erik" or "Toomas-Hendrik" or "Pille-Riin" are considered two names or one name by law
People generally refer to people with these hyphenated names by their full name (i.e the second part is not a middle name)
We have it like the germans I think, a first ( maybe a middle name, depends on your parents) and usually the surname of your father, if you are a woman you may also have your mother's surname
You can have either of them
My family used to be im charge of a German noble man's mansion so yeah i guess i would've inherited that
But when the slavea rose up they burned the mansions down
I'm form Estonia
I would have been slave
I'm green at heart so I do support anything that minimizes pollution that China creates
And we can't really just blame them either
We also have to carry responsibility because instead of solving our pollution problems we just exported those to China
So, yes
We need closer economic and political cooperation with Taiwan
Our e-government was defeated by rats
And here i was, high and mighty, about to say that Estonians don't have IT problems
Same
Nohu
In english you can have stuffy nose, runny nose and you can sneeze or have sniffles or cold in the head
But there is no word to describe them all - I have problem with nose
Well almost: there are rhinitis and coryza but AFAIK nobody uses them
The word does exist in other languages: in german it is Schnupfen and in russian насморк.
Definitely this colorful monstrosity
Worst part is that it was finished just a year ago, even though it looks like something from 1990s
They can
It is not compulsory, but if they do, there is a national curriculum (to ensure that it is a useful subject and not just someone teaching only their own beliefs, they have to cover many religions etc)
They can also teach philosophy, often if the school has one, it also has the other
I think it is really useful, as it is normal for humans to think about "life, universe and everything" and also to think about what can and what can't be known
Teenagers especially like to think about life , death and universe and what it all means, so it's usually really interesting to have all those discussions
You also practice logic and critical thinking, get to know about all the stories that are represented in art and literature etc
It is also useful for history and social studies lessons, as different religions have influenced culture and politics and vice versa
In my own universe, I would merge philosophy and religions into one subject and make in compulsory for \~2 years, aged 14-16
They should integrate it with literature, history, social studies and maths etc
You have to teach kids to think, not only learn stuff by heart (though this is no doubt also very necessary)
Yeahbut only as a non-required subject
You may take this subject but dont have to
Yeah
It was one of the coolest subjects imo
Like a mix between of world history and culture
Christianity was only a small part of it
yeah, we had it too
it was an elective class though, so most people in my class didnt take it
I don't think it's actually far from truth
Especially in public saunas
Mõisaküla, just for the fun of it
It's our smallest settlement that has a "town" status - it has ~800 people
Also it's pretty much in the middle of nowhere and on a border with Latvia
Moving all the government structures in there would be a fun experiment
A city that is almost entirely made of government officials and diplomats
Uhh, either pärnu or tartu, they are already big cities
Our level of importance is well showcased in [one comment in this thread] that uses us as an example of a non-important country when comparing the importance of countries:
> Ngl, objectively speaking, it's difficult to argue that Germany and Estonia are equally important
I'm not saying that one country is better than the other
Power mattrrs
They are "deeply worried" and "voice deep concern" over the relationship we have with Russia
that relationship being, you know, war
I thought every country in Europe has free healthcare
Frankly, there are no real downsides to this
A stronger society benefits everyone
You know,  no-one has to go robbing houses to get their wifes cancer removed or to pay off the debt from that and so forth
It also helps with gender equality, as giving birth can make you bankrupt in the states
There can sometimes be long waiting that others have mentioned, but this has less to do with free healthcare and more to do with lack of doctors
This in turn has more to do with socio-demographic changes (old doctors die at quicker rates than new ones get their education) than anything else
Frankly, it is sometimes not 100% free, as there can be some minimal fees, that are meant to act as small barriers
Like when you first go to some specialist, you have to pay 5€ "visit fee", but I'm not sure if it is really connected to a lack of GP referral or is there in all cases
>. This in turn has more to do with socio-demographic changes
Seeing that you're from Estonia, I am sure you have to know that the biggest reason we have lack of doctors/nurses is that they can easily move to nearby EU countries and immediately earn 3-5 times more money
I have relatives working in Estonian healthcare and know pretty well that their pay is not nearly good enough for the amount of work they do
And on top of that they have to fight for every little increase in salary
Just some rambling thoughts, it's late:
The moving abroad part is true for some doctors, but I'm not sold that's a bigger aspect than socio-demographical changes - and it is even amplified by that
Our average age of doctors was 51 in 2018
Ain't moving abroad mainly done by GPs and not so much by other doctors
There are fields, where working abroad is very complicated (psychiatry - due to high importance of language), but we still have a serious lack of young doctors
And not just actual working doctors, but also a lack of kids applying for residency programmes
There were many years, when they took in less than 100 new kids a year, yet we had \~150 doctors retiring each year and it quickly built up
And the bigger cohorts born in 1988-1992 that have graduated by now are basically collectively on maternal leave
They are \~30 when they graduate, so they are in a hurry to buy a house and start a family, I think females also still make up a majority of graduates
They also often have more kids than the general population
The way socio-demographics amplifies even the moving abroad part, is due to the fact that you cannot get full-time work in smaller towns, as the populations there have been decreasing
Therefore you don't get full-time salary either
And these aspects might push people to move, both for higher salary and more interesting work
As for nurses, I assume you are absolutely correct though
They have had way more salary problems and they are also notably younger when they graduate (more time for adventures)
I don't personally work with nurses, so that part is foggier for me
Finland, Sweden, UK, Germany and Norway are most popular destinations
I really don't get Russian grammar Like you have set rules to your language, but there's a load of words that don't follow the rules, Also why so many genders
Mai ingliš is veri guud tänk juu
Veoauto is a great one to try to pronounce
Correct me if I’m wrong but I think both languages can put any words together to make a new word
Meaning there’s no official word
Well I got good news for you
[Start here] and go nuts
Once you complete the series you know everything you ever need to know about the conflict
[This video] and [that one as well]
might give you a humourous idea about it
For better or for worse they do seem to get very different treatment to other people
Pretty typical unfortunately, the Ukrainans suffered a whole separate genocide even before the war and most people know very little if anything about it too
Wow, what you've described is eerily similar to what I had in shool in Estonia
Down to having longer breaks after 2nd and 4th lessons
As far as I know Estonia copied a lot of things from Germany when we regained independance in 1991
The only difference is that we didn't have a free 7th hour (which kinda sucked on longer days)
And honestly I always hated that we started so early, I had to wake up at 6:00 to get to school
I usually was literally sleeping through 1st-2nd lessons
Interesting how similar it is to my school in Estonia, even the Wednesday thing
The only difference is that we don't have breaks longer than 20 minutes and as in the 11th grade we have 7-8 lessons we usually end around 15-16
Not sure it would work in winter though - here it would leave only a couple hours at midday for school, haha
But yeah, I think schools shouldn't start earlier than 9
It was pure torture to wake up so early (both for me&siblings and our parents)
And first lessons were not productive anyway - everyone was really sleepy
I am really glad I can now show up as late as 10:00 at work
Shortest day is 21 december - sunrise is at 9:17 and sunset is at 15:20
Technically 6 hours of daytime
In reality though it gets bright at around 10-11 and dark by 2, because sun rises reaaly low relative to horizon and barely iluminates surroundings
Plus usually its very cloudy, so even less light
It's actually even worse in Alaska and north scandinavia - they have polar nights with no sun at all for the whole winter
It just doesn't rise above the horizon at all for them
You can check out this incredible timelapse that shows difference between summer and winter in Finland - it's pretty much same here in Estonia
[A meteorite landed] on our biggest island and basically burned a lot of it down
The event was so remarkable that the story was kept alive for millennia among several nations until it could be written down
The war of independence
Liberating Riga from the Germans and almost capturing Petrograd was pretty cool
I heard  once that during the Tartu peace treaty signing, Soviet officials watched a military march, what they didn't know was that the Estonians let soldiers march multiple times so the Estonian army looked many times larger than it actually was
Also in 1944 the  Estonian national committee (government in exile essentially) declared a new government and seized Toompea from the Germans and ordered them to leave from Tallinn
The Estonian republic existed in Tallinn until the Soviets "liberated" it
Also it's kinda surreal that countries like Finland have tried to win Eurovision for decades (53 times for Finns for example) and we just won on our 8 try and became the first country from the former eastern bloc to win
Sort of a "you don't say" moment
It has to be Midsummer or actually the day before Midsummer when Midsummer is actually celebrated, i.e. on Victory Day on 23 June
The most recognizable feature would be what we call 'potato blond' hair (like natural, darker blond)
Could also be another Balt or a Finn, though
Yep, though there are different phenotypes generally i think i can recognize estonians
Tallinn old town, Pärnu (where I too love) and Saaremaa Island in the summer
The **locations** might be known only for the more obvious ones: Alaska, Florida, Texas, California, New York
Also maybe Oregon, Louisiana, Michigan, Virginia, New Mexico, Maine, Montana, etc really depends on your interests, of which places do you hear often
For younger people, the **names** of all the states will be familiar
For older ones, not all, but the more popular ones (mentioned in news and tv-series) will be
In Russian we have almost the same one
Казнить, нельзя помиловать! - execute, no mercy
Казнить нельзя, помиловать! - must not execute, have mercy
I have heard that the way they teach irish in schools is also wrong, that they teach with the wrong pronunciation
When topics about my own country then sometimes there is not an English page
Or on some topics i read both Estonian and English version of the topic, really depends how informative and popular the topic is
But most times i prefer to use the English, because our language "is so small", it's pain in the ass to Google anything in Estonian, sometimes you get so wrong results
So as much possible, i use internet only using English
I speak Russian and Estonian, so will go with both
Russian wikipedia is pretty extensive and very good for topics like science, geography, biology
However anything about history and especially articles about Russia/USSR have to be taken with grain of salt
A ton of "sources" are actually official soviet/russian encyclopedias
Best to take a look at English articles (or German in case of ww1 and ww2) and compare them
Estonian wiki - very good for anything about Estonia (history, politics, language, laws), not so good for anything else
Very small amount of articles and most available articles are pretty short
the estonian one is decent, definitely not as detailed or reliable as the english one in most things, but similarly to other languages, thr local topics are covered better
sometimes i also use wikipedia as a dictionary - i know the word/term in one language and then check its linked counterpart in the other language to get the correct name
especially useful for names of animal species or more niche foods which you cant always just check in a dictionary
Of course, water here is very good
Some people living in Tallinn complain about very slight chlorine taste which is added to fight bacteria if the water goes to old house with bacteria living in pipes
Naples has a huge graffiti issue as well
First thing I noticed
Made the whole city center look like a dangerous place to be in
Which maybe it was, I wouldn't really know as a tourist
Happy cake day
Bydgoszcz, Poland for me, with 346,739 inhabitants
Łódź was the first I didn't know
The last I knew was Nantes
Zaragoza
i know a lot more cities, but just not that one lol
Lol, same for me
oh damn, you guys got one more than us
Estonian also has the Instructive case (viisiütlev) like in Finnish
It isn't officially included because it's only used in a few words (like in Finnish)
oh, seems pretty dumb to count it as an indepdent case imo but good to know
>military complex , slavery and wealth obscenity
I mean first two points were core parts of Europe up until very recent history and I'd say last one is still not fully gone away
when your mouth is hanging open: "Close your mouth, your heart will get cold"
when you complain about your food being too hot: "you have a windmill under your nose" (ok this one could have been just my dad's invention)
when you're a shitty parent who believes theyre the only one whose opinion matters: "the child speaks when the chicken pisses" (chickens dont piss)
i cant think of any others right now
oh, we have the sugar one too
Estonian is pretty easy in this category, we only have very few exeptions like
Süüa (to eat) should be pronounced as süia, same with müüa (to sell) - müia
Everything else is pronounced the way its written
Everything is written as it is pronounced but not other way around
Two major points that make text->speech problematic
Palatalization: "palk" (log) and "palk" (salary) are pronounced differently
Length of syllables: "pall" is written in genitive and illative "palli" but both forms are pronounced with different length of "ll".
And to finish off the Finno-Ugric gang
Yeah the "palk" thing, didnt think of that
Usually you understand which one was meant by the contect
What is ø pronounced like
Is it like our Estonian ö?
Most likely
Yes
Saaremaa pirates kidnapped the king of Sweeden and ransomed him back to the sweeds
In Estonia our scouts (young eagles) are literally a sub category of the Defence Force (military)
While obviously very militaristic (since it was originaly created to prepear young boys for mandatory service) we also spend most of our time outside
Everything we do with the younger boys is centered around it being fun and  more playfull than just training, but for older boys the idea of military training is fun in it of itself (this is usually why boys want to join, they are drawn by the guns and "cool army stuff")
TL;DR We raise child soldiers but it's fun :p
I'm not sure but our scouts are present at military parades, so I'm guessing its more like the U.S but not as militaristic
Not sure tho, it isn't that popular here, most just send their kids to grandpa and grandmas house for the summer, or summer camp
No, but roman and byzantine coins have been found here
That smiling cashiers are creepy and unsettling
We really are that gloomy
Here in Estonia if it's public sauna (like in spa) people don't go naked
If it's private and it's just family/friends - yeah, naked
We can relate
Packages are put into parcel machines, leaving packages on porches is unheard of
[Machines like that] or more advanced "pack robots" like [an Estonian company Cleveron offers] There are hundreds of those and they are basically everywhere
They all work with the same principle - you enter your package number and the door opens
You can also send your own parcel via the machine
The machines also have payment option, if you haven't paid online
I think no city will ever beat [Norilsk] Russia
Podgorica, rest of Montenegro is really nice though
I used to visit Bratislava quite often while living in Vienna and of course it’s not as interesting as Vienna but I always liked it’s atmosphere more than Vienna’s.
Well the letter Õ. Our anthem is *Mu isamaa, mu õnn ja rõõm*, which means "My Fatherland, My Joy and Happiness", but if you write it with O-s as *Mu isamaa, mu onn ja room*, then it means "My Fatherland, My Hut and Feces".
I'm quite sure every language have words that are written same but
have different meaning depending from pronunciation
palk = log
palk = salary
When written there is no difference, when said there is difference
In Estonian that sounds like Mina tapan haned = I will kill the geese
As an Estonian I read it as
"I kill a goose"
Unless I am outside for a long time, yes I do
I like rain, not thunder i was scared of that
Not many thunderstorms in Estonia but when there are I love them, sometimes even go chasing if severe ones occur (derechos, smaller tornadoes)
They are cool but then again dangerous if you're not prepared
In estonian
Ninasarvik- nosehorny (rihno)
Jõehobu- river horse (hippo)
Merisiga- sea pig (guineapig) <-- noidea if thats how its spelled
Kaelkirjak- (this one has 2) neck spoty or neck typie (giraffe)
Lasteaed- child fence (kindergarden)
Kilpkonn - shield frog (turtle)
Jõehobu - river horse (hippo)
Mine persse - go into ass (fuck off)
Ninasarvik - nosehorn (rhino)
Laiskloom - lazy animal (sloth)
Pesukaru - washing bear (raccoon)
Tulemasin - fire machine (lighter)
Külmkapp - cold closet (fridge)
Hundinui - wolfs club/stick (cattail)
Puuvill - tree wool (cotton)
Pesukarhu is a raccoon, not a badger
In Estonian most words are similar, but aren't actually a combination of words
Like for example plane in Estonian is lennuk, it's obviously derived from the verb lendama, which means to fly, but no other connections there
Doesnt really change xd, at least this sentence
Tere, minu nimi on John, see on meeldivus kohtuda sinuga
Kust oled sa pärit
Hello, my name is John, it is a pleasure meeting/to meet you
Where are you from
I would translate "me llamo" as "me I call" to account for the conjunction of the verb
Also "conocerte" because it's "nice to meet *you*" Otherwise I'd agree with that translation :)
Homo sapiens, by far
Especially, when not properly socialized and educated from an early age
It is said that the most dangerous animals in our nature that **will** attack you are female moose and female boars, given that they have a calf or piglets around them somewhere
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
But otherwise bears and wolves of course, but they are unlike to attack unless provoked
Ticks, Boars, Moose, Bears and Wolves but won't likely attack unless provoked
Good point about wasps
That's truth
Not humor
Wasn't it illegal in Denmark to fly flags of other countries and unions
From Google:
Official **flag** rules in **Denmark** state that, unless special authorisation is given, it is **not** permitted to **fly** any other national **flags** than the **Danish** Dannebrog, a white Scandinavian cross on a red background
Okay, thank you for the info

Personally my favourite Estonian movie is "Truth and Justice"
That's also a good one
"Tangerines" is also highly recommended
Anyone with a spine would do
Merkel would be ideal due to her vast experience and being centre-right on a political scale
"Estonia has no sex and no future" is a running joke about Estonian language pertaining to the fact that there's no grammatical gender as well as no future tense in Estonian, i find it very fascinating how you can talk about future in present tense, we have something similar in my native Ukrainian, but it's more rare option, in Estonian though it's use all the time
I love the way estonian sounds in song, its beautiful
Its kinda sad though seeing that most people in your country speak the language that is not native
Same in estonian we have only TEMA
Pretty much
Sült, or meat jelly
Meat surrounded by jello
(estonia)
We probably got it from you or russians
Okei is very common but my estonian teacher always used to scold us a bit for using it
We lost our freedom in 1939 to Russians again and then we got it back in 1991
But there's still a Russian threat out there
Well everything is pretty awesome now, but boy, you're going to have a shit time
Well, we got occupied by the Russians again for some time but we're back
"We won the war
Buuut päts took over and gave away our country, but we got better"
What happened to all of east Prussia and everything east of the river Oder
I wonder if it would have been possible for a German from 1919 to think Germany stayed the same from then until now, and not know about the second world war
No kidding, it is a lot like Arabic, like I once learned 1-10 in Arabic because I was bored but I'd forgotten them over the years, then I looked up the number in Maltese right now and they were so similar I remembered arabic numbers immediately after reading them
Estonia has a village called "Aa" [
Ee sounds like the Dutch Twin of [Aa] :)
There's also a village called "Ao"
Is that the place where they invented a ja o?
Never been to Paris, never cared much for the Notre Dame (not meant in a bad way, just little to no dealings with it)
But anyone with a heart and mind will have, at the very least, a thought of empathy invoked for the French and the Parisians
I'm not even really religious and i thought it was quite bad
Although I'm bot religious i can still feel bad about those who are
First reaction was surreal and hard to believe it’s really happening, like one of the symbols of Europe burning
As if the Big Ben or Colosseum was up in flames
Kyiv has a mostly positive reputation i guess
Tallinn, us rest like to go there to visit itsa surreal expirence to vist the city
Idk we like it here and it's mostly seen as "the place you drive to for your job/bc of shops/bc you gotta get on your plane" if you live outside Tallinn or any other city
Well it is pretty dirty
There are actually 12 towns in  Luxembourg
Yeah i've been there
AS A BABY gottem
The Estonian government collapsed just now too
Big corruption scandal and our prime minister resigned because of it
* One fell because they fixed food prices during hyperinflation, which did lead to food stamps
* One fell because PM lied about selling rouble notes that we had left after adopting our own currency
* One fell because minister of interior recorder his private meetings with other politicians
* Next fell because PM has shade real estate deals
* One fell because minister of justice wanted to set minimums how many how many civil servants had to be prosecuted every year
* One fell because married PM danced & kissed with one other girl and resigned
* And last one fell because corruption investigation (they gave a loan to businessman far below market rates)
There is a possibility that next one will fall because of same incident because investigation just started and one involved party is included in next coalition
All this is for last 17 governments

It is not necessary to speak English to get by in Estonia, but most people in the younger generations have at least some degree of fluency due to having learned it in school and exposure to English-language media
Speaking additional languages is more of a nice-to-have thing, generally not expected
Most of those who are old enough to have grown up in the USSR can speak Russian to some extent, younger people generally don't (aside from the ones who are Russian themselves, of course)
Though I imagine it varies by location also, there are some places (mainly in Ida-Viru county) where most of the population is Russian, so Estonians living in those areas are probably more likely to pick up the language as well
That's mostly a thing in northern Estonia I believe
During Soviet times many people watched Finnish TV and might have picked up some language from there, but those broadcasts didn't reach the southern parts of the country
And afterwards learning Finnish still was/is worthwhile for people in Tallinn, especially those working in the service industry, due to the amount of Finnish tourists
But here in southern Estonia knowing Finnish isn't common at all in my experience
Sadly the Estonian Swedish dialects are all but extinct nowadays, as when the coasts were declared restricted zones after the USSR took over, most of the coastal Swedes were displaced and emigrated to Sweden
There is still a [small community] (around a few hundred people) of Estonian Swedes who remained or returned after we regained indpedence, but they mostly speak standard Swedish AFAIK
Learning Swedish as a foreign language is not particularly common among Estonians
Depends, if you're coming over for a little shindig and put your beer in the bridge then it's all good
Just randomly opening the host's fridge is rude however
Finland- cold on the streets, warm under the sheets and sauna
Russia- the food, the people, the culture
Russia has something for everyone
Latvia- Kārums and cultural sites plus the "brother from another mother" (as I like to call it) friendship
Sweden- the history we share together
Yes
My parents and grandparents would use Russian
It was impossible to understand until I started learning it and even after that they would have easily got away with it when just avoiding the most simple words
Now that I am an adult I sometimes use English with my partner accidentally and my parents are sure we're hiding something :D
I come from a Russian speaking community in Estonia, so my experience is a bit different
However, I have seen this behaviour in families where parents use Russian as the main language at home but who also come from a different culture
For example, my friend's parents are Ukrainian and would switch to Ukrainian when arguing, so that the kids wouldn't understand them
Similarly, my mum would speak in Bulgarian to her mum/friends when she didn't want me to understand the conversation
Georgian parents switching to Georgian from Russian
I guess this may raise questions about families not teaching the native language to their kids, which is quite normal
From memory, it was mostly the Tatar families who tended to speak Tatar at home, so the trick didn't apply to them
I guess the funny truth was that we as kids would switch to Estonian/English if we didn't want some adults to understand us
my parents spoke russian, even though my mom barely spoke it at the time
i grew up speaking estonian and my parents switching to more or less broken russian when they wanted to speak about secrets
but same, me and my brother switched to english when we didn't want adults to understand us
Its funny
I have never met or talked to any non native who could actually speak it except my russian teachers
> My native language is English and I FUCKING HATE that we expect everyone to speak English
It's not my native language and of course I expect everyone to speak it too, like how do you use the internet these days without it, I'm truly baffled
I've found plenty actually, seems mainly because of Uni
I know a Hungarian dude who speaks decent Estonian and I've met a German girl and an American guy who were so fluent I could barely tell they had an accent
Gotta say it is weird though
That is absolutely true and the only people I met there who were nice were ironically immigrants who couldn't speak English either but at least they did their best to communicate
either fresh and warm rye bread or a random drunk in public transport
Fresh air and pine forest
When I was a little child me and my family used to live in Austria and the only 3 places I had ever been to where Estonia, Austria and the Canary Islands
Since we only used to visit Estonia during summer time I was profoundly convinced, that the Estonian climate is the same as the one on the Canary islands
Boy, was I wrong
thanks to the olympic games i had heard of the city of torino, but i always thought it was in canada
i have since been to torino, italy, and can confirm that it's in fact in italy, even if i still forget sometimes
(this doesnt count as europe, but i also thought salt lake city was in canada, so you can imagine i was extremely confused as to why they'd hold the olympic games in canada, 3 times in a row)
oh, and i was shocked to find out that all of the eastern european countries werent in the ussr
that was quite an eye-opening history lesson for me
To put it bluntly, there's no balance of power, as even after 30 years of independence and continuous decrease of president powers we still basically have a situation where the president is de facto the head of the ruling parliament party, while the prime minister and their cabinet openly admit that they are part of president's team even though technically the law isn't supposed to allow for that
It"s just the reality of political scene in Ukraine
IMHO, so far this has allowed for several cases were presidents tried to consolidate even more power using their de jure and de facto influence to sway officials, attempt go rig the elections and install something similar to Belarus and Russia in Ukraine (those were Kuchma and Yanukovych), in both cases they were only stopped due to the power of public outrage that led to revolutions (Orange Revolution in 2004 and Revolution of Dignity/Maidan in 2013-14)
At this point, I'd argue that further decreasing presidential powers and making him/her a figurehead would prevent such situations from happening in the future
Usually alone, unless it's comfortable for the parents to drop them off
Yeah who live close walk or go by bike, but a lot of people take a bus
Yes, it's expected that kids will go to school on their own after a few weeks at age 7
I can read the "Povist vremyanyh lit" or "Chronicle of Bygone Years" / "Primary Chronicle", a history of the Kievan Rus' from about 850 to 1110, originally compiled in Kyiv in circa 1113 pretty easily, if I concentrate
It's written in Old East Slavic(which would later evolve into Old Ruthenian/Ukrainian/Belarusian which itself would evolve into modern Ukrainian) so it's a millennia old and includes so many of archaic words or words that changed their meaning but the overall structure and the spelling mostly remain the same(except for the few Cyrillic letters that are no longer in use)
Old Estonian looks like Welsh, Polish and German mixed into one
for some reason
[If you read the pages 57 and 56 of this then you'll see
] I can understand only one or a few words from each sentence
instead of "give an example" we say "bring an example", since thats how it's said in estonian
estonians also tend to just forget articles (a, an, the) altogether, since we don't use them
oh, and i guess also using the correct tense, since we have much fewer tenses in general and no future tense at all
Yeah, we have that as well
Estonian does not make a difference between "he" and "she" either and it does show
I mean I had English classes for 11 years in school, used English constantly during my Uni studies and still use it every day for my phd work
And still
Sometimes when I am writing a longer text or if I am speaking with a bigger group of people I use "he" instead of "she" or vice versa
It is not like I cannot remember the difference, ofc I know it
It is just that when I get carried away, then my brain is simply not used to dividing humans like that and doesn't care about me sounding stupid
i'm going to try my best, but sorry if the explanation is confusing
we usually just use present tense and imply the future part of it with adverbs such as tomorrow, next week, soon, etc
sometimes also the help-verbs "saama" ("to become") and "hakkama" ("to start")
for example: "ma laulan" means "I am singing" or "I sing" (present continuous & present simple are the same tense here)
"ma laulan homme" means "I will/am going to sing tomorrow". the tomorrow makes it known that the singing is not currently happening, but will happen in the future
you could also say "ma hakkan laulma" ("I will start singing") if you wish to not specify when the action will happen
in this instance, the form of the verb changes ("laulan" -> "laulma"), but it is still not a future tense, because "laulma" is the basic form of the verb and "laulan" is just the conjugated version of it ("singing" vs "i sing")
"ma varsti laulan" would mean "I will soon sing"
so yeah i guess in conclusion it's kind of confusing, we just use the present tense in different ways and the adverbs+context usually help express that the action is going to happen in the future
Estonia issues ID-cards since 2002
Every Estonian from the age of 15 is required by law to have an ID-card (you don't have to own a passport)
They're commonly used to give "digital signatures". I (and many other Estonians) don't own a passport since you need a passport only if you want to travel outside Europe
Also - perhaps controversially - since 2005 you can vote though the internet using an ID-card
You can actually do a lot of stuff using the ID-card through the internet
Apply for universities or apply for permits or do your tax declaration (literally takes one minute if you don't have your own company) etc etc
The card looks like [this]
Background color look exactly the same as on my driving license card ))
the estonian one's image is like
2 or 3 designs too old lol
Definitely to emphasize how intergrated the id system is
Super useful, especially that you have 3 seperate systems to authenticate yourself so you don't even need to use the card physically
You can authenticate via text message or an app
>The idea that I could get in trouble for not having any ID when going to buy some eggs is crazy to me
It's not that crazy
You're not going to be stopped by police during your grocery shopping (in fact seeing police is very-very rare here)
But for identifying you in post office, bank, police station - basically anything governmental or financial - it's a must have to identify you
i mean yes but also no
[New design vs 2(?) editions older design]
Unless you're buying alcohol or tobacco products(to prove that you're 18 or over) - no, it's not a  requirement
No private company or shop will ask for your ID, unless you ask for services or goods that require you to be an adult
Tallinn since the 1600s for sure
Before that, Tartu could've given it some competition for top spot, whilst before the Northern Crusades the most important castles were mainly in the south of the country
Tallinn grew it's lead more and more following Tartu's near complete destruction in the Great Northern War, the construction of the Tallinn-Narva-St
Petersburg railway and a massive population boom (don't know why) for only Tallinn in the interwar period
In Soviet times this effect was even stronger with Slavic immigration
sounds like a rap
I started learning English from Cartoon Network at age 4
A massive amount of cartoon network ever since I was 4
And video games and TV shows and so on and so on
Depends what you study
My program only accomodates for Latvia and Turkey
Id pick Germany in a heartbeat
E: Also depends where you're from, maybe in Switzerland it's very similar but coming from south/east Europe it's still worthwhile experience
Tall female, skinnier type of athletic, blonde, [long bob cut] and hiking
Swede
(/NO/IS)
A male with brown hair, light eyes, strong jawline and [crooked teeth] British
> Spanish and Italians also dress in light fabrics, but are way more coloured
This reminds me
We had an older Spanish male giving Spanish lessons in high school
You could spot him from a mile away, especially in autumn/winter
All Estonians were dressed in their usual shades of dark brown, grey and black with an occasional beige or if you're very lucky then navy or maroon
And there he was, long grey hair waving after him, skipping around in his red pants and yellow shirt, looking like the flag of Spain, in bright primary colours
With males it is more complicated, but with females it's usually really easy
But it's more about clothes and mannerism than facial features
Russian females dress either way more feminine or, if feminine is not their thing, then way more edgy
Bolder in every sense
Estonian females prefer more casual and neutral clothes
Usually young Russian females have something that shows off their pretty figure way more, like extra skinny blue jeans that have some sparkle on them or really short dresses - both of them go with extra high heels
And long painted fingernails, several rings or other jewelry, often wear a cross (orthodox, this also applies for males and is rare for Estonians
Older Russian females have this unfortunate diamond shape (I have met only a handful of skinny old Russian ladies in my life I'm afraid), red or dark violet hair, often a lot of perfume - once again, way bolder than your usual Estonian granny
We have one that I particularly enjoy
"Sittast saia tegema" - "to make bread from shit" with is to say you turned a bad situation into a good one
And one of our previous  presidents said a quote that goes like " The situation is shit, but that's our fertiliser for the future"
Yes, the Institute of the Estonian Language, they publish dictionaries and their website which provides advice is probably visited very often, as the grammatical rules of estonian are quite hard to remember sometimes
As a small country there is a lot of pressure on preserving the language, now there is even a language inspection which seems a bit draconian if Im honest
I think Luidja beach in Hiiumaa is really nice
I liked Tõrvanina beach in Hiiumaa a lot too
What is some great music from your country that you'd like others to know about
I would say TRAD
ATTACK
, they're even underrated in Estonia
Basically mixing folk-rock-techno by using old folk songs for lyrics or sampling and ending up with pretty catchy and upbeat songs
[Pass-pass]
[Lell'o]
[Sõit]
Don't worry about the lyrics, I can't understand them either
I think they're a good representation of new age folk-pop music
How can you just snub this [gem]
We have a LOT of dialects
Almost all islands have their own dialects, southern part of our country also has like 5 dialects, so does northern
Not for anymore, because communism
We still have *some* dialects, like the Hiiu and Seto dialects, but mostly just one unified language
Not for anymore, because communism
We still have *some* dialects, like the Hiiu and Seto dialects, but mostly just one unified language
Northern Estonian (the standard version) is very unified and has almost no regional dialects except for some people on the islands switching the õ for ö, the Southern Estonian dialects (Võro and Seto in particular) are so different, that they’re pretty much unintelligible to Northern Estonians and are often considered an independent language within the Finnic branch of the Uralic languages
In saaremaa they have some type of a mix of ö and õ
I don't think anyone seriously blames Belgium or Belgians for EU problems
If anything, french and german politicians get most of the hate
And referring to Brussels is just a form of speech, same as Moscow to Russian government or Washington to US government
Tbh Lenin as a Chuvash is more of a meme
His father had oriental roots, but it's not clear what ethnicity exactly
His mother was half-jewish if I remember correctly
So he had more of a mixed ethnicity
But he never spoke chuvash and was raised amongst educated Russian class of citizens
Putin as a Finnish is even more of a meme or conspiracy, but in actuality his ancestors come from Tver region, which is close to Moscow and quite far away from Finland
He is most definitely Russian
Also Gorbachev isn't Ukrainian, though he has Ukrainian roots(but that can be said about any Russian born in south Russian region)
Quick google search shows that drinking age of 20 in Scandinavia is only for strong alcohol
Anything like beer is from 18
Well it's more like 50%true/50% meme ))
In my school, at the beginning of this year we all got to choose a new subject
Multimedia, Programming, British culture, Arabic culture and creative writing
I don't think other schools do this, may be unique to our school
OMG
I have talked about this so much in Estonia, I thought that kind of classes don't exist
We only have handcraft classes where boys do wooden stuff and girls cook and knit
But the home economics type of class is desperately needed for the new generation specially, imo
I would've been thankful if someone had taught me some of it too
The classroom looks the same but we didn't have cleaning or finances subjects
We have it in Estonia
By default it's at least in my former school only for girls except cooking which was for both but technically if boys wanted they could choose to go to that class instead
Narva and Valga
Narva was split by the soviets into two cities
Well there's the city of Valga
At first it was a Latvian city but more and more Estonians moved there thanks to the new railroad to the extent where about 80% of the people living there were Estonian
We almost went to war with Latvia for that town in 1920, thankfully it never happened
Then there's Narva
If I remember correctly, then the city had a vote whether it would stick to Petrograd governorate or join the Estonian governorate in the late 19th century
Then when the war for independence broke out both sides of the Narva river remained under Estonian control
In 1940 when Estonian Soviet socialist republic "became a member" of the USSR, they did some border adjustments where the town of Petseri in the southern Estonia was given to Pskov oblast and the eastern part of Narva, known as Jaanilinn or Ivangorod under the jurisdiction of Leningrad oblast
And generally speaking, residents tend to stick to the side of their home country
My grandparents live there, they only go to the Latvian side for cheap booze and diesel
> What always bothers me is how many people from the west think they know exactly how things worked back then
I'm ex-citizen of Soviet Union and I lived considerable part of my life in Soviet Union
I still get some western people explaining to me how life was in Soviet Union
You surrendering is mostly meme, just like that "Polish used cavalry to storm German panzerkorps"
Neither is true and usually educated people know it
This sounds as stupid as calling US attack on Iraq as Cavalry attack because 1st Cavalry Division participated
It's just stupid
Nazi Germany, Soviet Union and other participants used horse mounted troops in WW2
Also horses were used for artillery
That does not make it cavalry
They fought as infantry and used horses for transportation
Also cavalry never charged German tanks
It's stupid nazi propaganda that still gets parroted by uneducated
Where
Every source I read mentioned that this just nazi propaganda
Troops on horses were used, but they never charged tanks
Yeah definitely old leggings, tops and sweaters are awesome for home but I wouldn’t wear them outside
I mean it's not that they're not really nice it's just they are extremely comfortable
[This one] is quite popular among students, containing the lyrics "Get out, get out of the country, those who drink Estonian vodka and don't speak Estonian
Which could be seen as quite hostile to any immigrants who haven't learned the language
It's a very fun tune though
There's also a lot of partisan songs from WWII era, with explicitly anti-Russian lyrics
And a few that are outright pro-Nazi
Those aren't really sung often nowadays (especially not the Nazi ones), but some are still quite recognizable, [this] for example
With a line like "ei iial tibla ori küll eesti rahvast saa" - "the Estonian people will never be slaves of the *tibla*" ("tibla" being a derogatory term for Russians)
Estonia basically always, why
Im Estonian my country's history is full of suffering and shit
I try playing the country to either prevent that or accidentally make it worse
Ck2: usually estonia
HOI4: Germany
Vic: prussia
Eu4: hungary
Vienna, because of the culture
Always wanted to go there and try thei schnitzel
Besides Switzerland and Monaco that have been mentioned here going to Harrods in London was quite an experience, watches that cost tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands, bottles of wine that cost thousands as well and so much more
Cars parked outside were of course also exceedingly expensive
I felt at Monaco like how I imagine a someone from Kongo might feel like in a regular European country, the cars people were driving cost more than I have made in my whole life
I was just about to say that I saw Belgian number plate in Estonia
During the summer there are mostly Finnish, German, Russian and Dutch number plates here
"Ät" - means nothing
We don't have our own cool name, but the funkiest I've heard is Russian "sabachka" - a little/cute dog, a cute diminutive, something like "doggo".
Равлик/ Ravlyk meaning snail  is the most common name, though when used in emails, for some reason we just don't say it, it is said as "at"(like English) sometimes when in context of mentions
Another less popular way to say it is песик/pesyk meaning "little doggie", though i personally prefer the snail option
I have only heard it called "ät", but Wikipedia says it's also called "kassisaba" meaning cat's tail and "kapsas" meaning cabbage
> "Ät"
It's "ätt"!
yes
usually finland, bc im not too excited about russia and well latvia tends to suck at the sports i care about as well
I love them
I think only microstates should exist all over the world
In my opinion big countries are genocidial bullies who only want war and destruction
Of course, sadly it wont work :(. So it's ideal, but never achievable
Russia ofc
Russia
It's always the russians
Russia
We don't have a specific name for them, but there are definitely cafeterias where you can get cheap, home-style food
We say "spikker" which means a secret tool, usually a piece of paper containing info to look or write off of during a test
In addition to "spikker" already mentioned in some other comments, another (somewhat more archaic) word for cheat sheet is "puks", "(maha) puksima" = to cheat, to copy (down)
"Puksima" can also mean "to headbutt", but I'm not sure if it's the same etymology
"spikker" in Estonian, always wondered the etymology :D
From this word we also have the verb "spikerdama" - "to cheat (on a test)"
Oh we have similar word with same meaning - “spikker”
1 000 000 = miljon
1 000 000 000 = miljard (you could also call this biljon, but it's rare)
1 000 000 000 000 = triljon
1 000 000 000 000 000 = kvadriljon (nobody really uses it)
We have (or had idk) the largest precent of alchoholics per population in the world (estonia)
Pretty much everyone does it, but no one looks the bus driver in the eyes while doing it
On long distance and country side lines
I have never seen anybody saying “Aitäh” to the bus driver even he/she is the last passenger getting off the bus
Nobody talks with anyone on buses here (Tallinn)
Previously some people bought ticket from bus drivers, but since public transport became free for city citizens and everyone else uses plastic card to buy tickets, nobody talks with drivers anymore
Well, i do it atleast
Not really
I used to say less untill it became a meme, now i say it always
Not that "i knew it guy", but Im not really surprised
Never played any of their games but I don't find it that weird that a company that has huge stackes in the chinese market also follows a political stance
Blizzard bending to communists does not meak me happy
I actually like ours a lot, it looks like a frazzled flag in the wind
Tbh Switzerland, because it kina looks like an octopus in the middle of everyone else
No, it *used* to be thicc in all the right places
And even then you missed Luxembourg
Let's just hope it won't go down like the Armenians
I don't understand why Turkey is still in NATO
It has bad relations with every neighbor, including EU member Cyprus and Nato member Greece, it spits on western values, it attack US allies in Syria, seeks closer ties with Russia
They should be kicked out of Nato, any cooperation with EU, be heavily sanctioned and not allowed to start a process of rejoining until they kick Erdogan and his cronies out of the offices and get back on secular, democratic path
Their "own country" would take pieces out of Turkey, Syria, Iraq and Iran
That's one of the reasons Turkey is invading right now
Terrorism is just an excuse
Why are you asking me these questions
Did you see me justifying Turkish actions
Higher Kurdish autonomy *is* the geopolitical reason for this
They also say "sorry" in a weird way
i dont think we bite into anything
the most commonly used expressions are "lusika nurka viskama" (to throw the spoon into the corner) or "sussid püsti" (loafers up)
When somebody is working (especially manual labor, say raking trees in the garden) and you walk past them, you say "strength
" and the other will reply "needed
Maybe it's common elsewhere too but I haven't heard about it
It's pretty much the one case where it's expected for two people to interact that don't know each-other
In addition only to maybe saying hallo in the hallway/corridor of an apartment building or when passing each-other on a forest trail
Ayy poetry club
We celebrate our national "Mother Tongue Day" on the birthday of the first Estonian poet who started writing in Estonian Kristjan Jaak Peterson
Greeting each-other in the apartment building has even survived in the Soviet blocks
But pretty strictly only in the hallways
Once you're in the parking lot or a store nearby it's more common to avoid eye contact
> How do you say the "Strength needed" part in Eesti keel
"*Jõudu
- "*Tarvis
Ida-Virumaa I suppose
It’s a county in the northeast with a large russian population
Maybe even Setomaa
It’s a small region in the South with a unique dialect and traditions
For example, every summer they elect an earthly representative of their mythical king Peko for the upcoming year
Hiiumaa the other island
For some reason being from the biggest island Saaremaa is considered cool but being from Hiiumaa makes you a hillbilly
Well, I moved out relatively young, but the general rule is that with adult kids (let's say 18 and up, could be younger) there is no problem, though one-night stands usually don't make it to your home, if there are other options
Over here, it is somewhat rare to stay with your parents after finishing high school
With teenagers, it depends on the family
Several families don't blink an eye either
In the ones that might not approve, you simply use the times when nobody is at home
[It became popular in both countries during the same time
As big as Samoa
Around 6 diffrent apples
We definitely have honey flavored cereals
Egg cups - yes
Can buy it from any supermarket
But pie birds - no, never seen them before
That's actually first truly unique thing I saw in this topic
I use it every week
Wait, some people don't have cheese slicers
I think we call them "oki doki". I'm not sure how to spell it though
Maybe it's spelled "woki doki" or maybe it's walkie talkie, when we say it it sounds childish
I think that the word "kiisu"(cat) is kinda childish and "kutsu" (doggy )
A weird thing in Estonian is we have this thing called "Little I" that makes words sound childish
When we say "kutsu" the little I goes between s and u. So it's pronounced [kutsju]
We say it in Estonian too
That's what I've been thinking about Brexit as well
The UK has historically had a very conservative stance in politics, which also explains their euroscepticism in part
But making such a monumental reform that brings massive political, economical and social changes based on a referendum won by a 4% margin just doesn't fit in here
Maybe we're all living in a simulation which started June 23rd 2016
As in several others here, we use it as a verb, so we "do sex" - seksima (-ma in the end says its an action)
Also, playful loving, although it is a bit old expression - armatsema (regular *to love* is *armastama*)
And then there are of course the coarser expressions like keppima (sticking), panema (putting) etc
&#x200B;
Edit: formatting
sex is a verb in estonian, so we just sex
or some of us do, i cant relate
We have “yellow media” for gossip news and tabloids about celebrities
And “black humour” for sarcastic dark jokes about death or other taboo topics
we call it pickle season
Wonder how many Estonians my age (17) know this
Only one person from my old class knew it, everyone else thought he was mad
Which is a bit sad actually, Lindgren's books are mint
I'd like to copy Not being poor from Norway
The cycling infrastructure of the Netherlands
Have a similar energy productsion as France aka >70% energy predused from nuclear
Salaries in countries like Switzerland and Norway would be nice
Not even joking
Also mediterranean weather would be nice too
Sometimes total obedience to rules is not good either
It leads to being too rigid and not open to change and innovation
And some rules and laws are stupid too
We actually had some oil reserves off the shore in the Black Sea but they were stolen by Russia
Happy cake day
Horilka, which is a Ukrainian word for vodka,more specifically percivka which is horilka with chilli pepper and spices, I never tasted it since I don't drink, but they say it's great
English was very easy to learn compared to any other foreign language I've studied, but I think that's mainly because of more opportunities to practice it rather than any inherent attribute of the language
No, it's actually super easy, barely an inconvenience
My native language is Russian, second language I learned was Estonian
Both are very different from English, so learning the basics of English was incredibly hard for me
Especially since it was during times when Internet and English mass media was not as easily available as today (late 90s early 2000s)
Some things in grammar that seem "easy" made it actually hard, for example - " sentence structure is straightforward "  , in Russian you can structure sentences in almost any order you want, so it was hard to learn rigid structures of English sentences (and I suck at it to this today)
You also conveniently left out articles (non existent in Russian or Estonian) and tenses (12 in English vs 3 in Russian and 2 in Estonian (present and future look the same grammatically)
English became much easier when I got access to unlimited Internet, but it mostly helped with vocabulary and idioms, not so much with grammar
this is pedantic as fuck
Be sure to max it out, though, whatever it is
>What the hell is a 401k?
Personal pension investment fund
They exist in Europe as well actually
Banks in my country offer them in additional to the main pension
They wouldn't even need that if they were just visiting
US citizens can visit EU without a visa for up to 90 days
Of completely different etymologies, I don't think there are any
But there are many [Estonian exonyms] that are noticeably different from their English names
Typically our names for cities are very similar to their original version with adjustments to better fit the language
Notable exceptions would be Cešis - Võnnu and Pskov -Pihkva
There are however many German names for our cities thanks to Baltic Germans
Here are a few
Tallinn - Reval
Tartu - Dorpat
Pärnu - Pernau
Kuressaare - Arensburg
Cannot think of really different cities and another user has already posted a good link, but some islands crossed my mind:
Swedish island **Gotland (eng) = Ojamaa (est)**
Finnish **Åland Islands (eng) = Ahvenamaa (est)** (just like Ahvenanmaa in Finnish)
Theres only one
Baltic port - Paldiski
No longer used though
Venice/Venezia is pretty different too
As is Nice/Nizza
We say Peking in Estonian too
There's Cologne which is actually Köln
What about you though
How much do you feel like an American
In Estonia:
- 1 euro: 1 liter of milk
- 10 euros: 1 mediocre meal in a regular pub and a beer
- 100 euros: monthly train pass for traveling near Tallinn ([zones I-V] about 1 hour distance trips from the city)
1€ -  A bag of chips
10€ -  A pack of pork ribs
100€ - A week's worth of food
Why would it need to include it
It's not like most people using that monthly train pass would also travel to Finland with it
Sorry, I edited the mistake
There is no nationwide ticket, only for up to about 1 hour trips from Tallinn
You can buy monthly tickets to other places as well, but these are for specific trips, for example between Tallinn and Tartu, which would cost you 213 euros
*Tallinn
And it would still be economically stupid as most people wanting to buy a monthly train ticket would *not* want to pay for the additional ferry ticket
Well, there aren't that many people who would travel to work this far daily
But there are plenty of people who would take a ride from Rapla to Tallinn for example, which is a 1 hour trip
>It's a joke, chill out man
What a lame excuse for a stupid comment
It's not exactly humour, is it
I didn't get that bad joke, sorry
At least back when I was in school, we started by doing all-caps print letters, then moved on to cursive
Cursive
Different cursive for English and also Russian cursive when we learnt that
First 2 years printed-like, then in cursive
Most write in cursive but i like tilted hybrid xd
In kindergarten we learned it like printed, beginning of school learned cursive and a few years later everyone just reverted to printed
My kiddo is in 5th grade and they still do it about the same
> I now write a kind of hybrid: block letters that I usually join within words
I write a hybrid style too
I use block letters when I want to capitalize something and then write in a style similar to what's printed
The only exceptions are a and l.
I haven't had a chance to try any, but I think I would probably like them as I enjoy most seafood
Maybe the Lasnamäe region of Tallinn
Majority of the population are Russians
It's a good place if you want to get stabbed or something
the first one i could think of is Kapa-Kohila
It's not a real place, but it sounds like one, and it's usually used to mean a place in bumfuck nowhere - aka the smallest most random town ever
"Ugh, their cottage is in Kapa-Kohila, I cba driving there every week
"You're acting like some hillbilly from Kapa-Kohila
Also I'd say Ida-Virumaa and maybe Saaremaa
It seems like Estonians like to make fun of people their not being able to pronounce õ
ÖÖÖÖÖ
I'm from Ukraine,it does look like Chernobyl
The cultural difference would be too much, it would be hard for me to integrate
The social security is much better in Europe and I would be much more comfortable with raising my kids here
My mom has spoken a bit about her births - but not to too many details
Enough to know she was hospitalized early each time, which one was born early and which one late etc
She was beside me when I gave birth so that might be one of the reasons
We are quite close with my sister, but she has never talked about her births
There isn't really anything overtly sexual about being pregnant, so it's common enough to talk about the details
Every time a new baby is on the way/has been born that's pretty much the only thing they talk about
I think nobody even asked how she is related to me
She was my rock during that emotional time, as my child's father and me had separated long before the birth
Definitely not too emotional :D
Germany - Saksamaa (derived from Saxony)
Finland - Soome (derived from Suomi)
Russia - Venemaa (from old-germanic: wened)
Sweden - Rootsi (from old-swedish: rods)
France - Prantsusmaa (from German)
There are also plenty of direct translations of the names of places, but they are not unique just directly translated:
Netherlands - Madalmaad (literally ‘low lands’)
Cape Verde - Roheneemesaared (green-cape-islands)
Ivory Coast - Elevandiluurannik (well
ivory coast)
Svalbard - Teravmäed (sharp mountains)
Russia = Venemaa
Sweden = Rootsi
England = Inglismaa
Finland = Soome
Just some fun examples
I've always wondered
why Igaunija
And now I'm wondering why cough cough hehe
Interesting fact: in Russian it is the same - Дания (Danija)
My hometown also had a cocktail bar/club/whateverthefuck called A.P.T.E.K for the same reason
There's also a bar called Kivi (Stone) so when somebody asks where you are you can say "Ma olen kivis" aka "I am stoned"
[Kalevipoeg] is our national epic
Faehlmann and Kreutzwald compiled this from legends in Estonian folklore and unified them into a whole story in a poem form
Don't know about the Latvian one, but Kalevipoeg is indeed the national epic of Estonia and probably the best answer for this question regarding Estonian poetry
Really cool to see someone know about it, really appreaciate it
That's really cool
Tbh, FIFA would be worse than Qatar if it was a country
I like Italian food over anything that is made in Northern Europe
Personally - except for some Italian food - I really dislike Southern European food, especially Spanish and Greek food
I lived in Spain for half a year and never have I had such bad food almost all the time
I guess I’ll just remain faithful to our meatballs and smoked flounder with glorious potatoes
(I do love Asian food though
I think that they can be pretty interesting
Nowadays there are a lot of nordic restaurants and I honestly quite enjoy them
Usually nordic food is very influenced by nature and earthy ingredients
From wild mushrooms to actual moss I think that generally nordic cuisine has a lot to offer
The tastes are maybe more subtle than in southern countries
Atleast that's my take
Rye and berries probs
Did Norway depart from Eurasia
Mostly it's called the *Saksa-Rooma riik* ("German-Roman State"), but *Püha Rooma riik* ("Holy Roman State") or *Püha Rooma Keisririik* ("Holy Roman Empire") aren't uncommon either
Flat-earth not so much but antivaxx and climate change deniers unfortunatelt are a thing
Ww2 is the reason we dont like russia
Ofc they have
If not for the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact and WW2 in general today‘s Estonia would look very different
>It was how we dealt with the aftermath of the war
That's literally the example of ww2 affecting foreign relations
You can't separate aftermath of the war from the events of the war - even the fact that Russians aren't allies comes from events of the war(occupation of eastern europe by ussr in 1944-45)
I don't see how someone can say ww1 and ww2 didn't have big effect on how UK foreign relations are shaped
Both wars sped up dissolution of British Empire, rise of the US and UK becoming second partner in UK-US alliance
It also set up the conditions for creating NATO and EU
Yeah, russofication
>If everyone had just gone home and had a nice cup of tea
If that was the case, there would not be any consequences of any major historical events, nor there would be any wars
That's not how world works though, so events of the wars, aftermath of the war and long-lasting effects of them are all interlinked with each other
yes
and not only on reddit
i've got into many unnecessary arguments on discord because american people misunderstand the meaning of what i say
but the thing that bothers me the most, is when i'm reading a thread and suddenly everyone is talking about something that i have no idea wtf is and there's no explanation
and like other people here are saying, the whole "too focused on race" thing the americans do
tbh it sounds so obsessive
Im noticing the same thing there, I like to lurk but when I think about it there's basically nothing said there that I could see on my country
Although I do love shocking them with our fuel prices and the fact that many cars have under 100hp
Lately I've been becoming edgier when switching to English, which is weird
And Estonian names mean they're probably from around Helsinki im guessing
Small corner stores where as a kid I would buy all sorts of snacks and sweets
Bubble gums that had tattoos or stickers in their wrapping
[Candies] that were way too sour to enjoy them
Chip bags that had pokemon [tazos] in them
Small stores like that are quite rare to find nowadays
But when I have stumbled upon one, they always have these novelty candies that you can’t find in regular supermarkets
Always brings back fun childhood memories
Calm after the storm was one of the best songs in the whole competition
It was no Sandstorm but honestly that song is better than at least 50% of the crap at Eurovision these days, I'd put it in the top 20% probably actually for that year
Oh my, Tooji is like that fuckboy who has so much attention from girls that nobody has ever told him how terrible this is
We do wear a red poppy, but it's done to honour all of soldiers who died/fought for our country, it's generally connected to the Remembrance Day on 8th/9th of May and focusses a bit more on those who died in WW2 and current Russo-Ukrainian war instead of WW1
It's a fairly new tradition(which was partially introduced/copied from you in a move to distance ourselves from the previous Soviet/Tsarist symbols of remembrance/war that were (St
George's Ribbon in particular) that were coopted/marginalized in use by Russian far-right nationalists and different collaborationist terrorists since the start of the war, alongside it's usage to glorify war
Right now we use the red poppy alongside a motto/slogan stating "Never again". I personally think it's a neat new tradition as it focuses on remembering the dead instead of glorifying death and suffering
Estonian isn't a slavic language, so to have something ending in "ia" is very weird for us
We say "Tšehhi" because to us that's comfortable
We've only had this one flag lol
"kadedus" means jealousy and to be jealous, you say "kade olema"
Estonia is similar, jealousy is "kadedus"
Estonian is actually a combination of two groups of Finnic dialects:
- North Estonian dialects are actually genealogically closer to Finnish than they are to South Estonian dialects
Standard Estonian is derived from one of the North Estonian dialects and it has been adopted as the spoken language by most Estonians
The only other North Estonian dialect still spoken is the Islands dialect, which differs on specific islands
They are quite similar in their vocabulary, but they have very peculiar island-specific accents
- South Estonian dialects are rather conservative and still have vowel harmony, making them very different from Standard Estonian
Tarto and Mulgi have almost died out, but they were strongly influenced by North Estonian dialects, so they were similar enough to understand, but had a very pleasant southern and archaic sound
[Võro] is still spoken and it can be a little tough for Standard Estonian speakers to understand, while [Seto] is even more different and is very difficult for Standard Estonian speakers to understand
Yep
South Estonian is thought to be the first to branch off from Proto-Finnic
North Estonian and Finnish diverged later
That is most likely because [North Estonians speak Finnish better] due to the importance of Finnish television during the Soviet occupation
Finns often consider South Estonian more familiar because it has retained vowel harmony
The news write it as "Pfizer/BioNTech vaktsiin".  By people, it is called either "Pfizer-Biotech" (had even forgotten the N is there) or shortened to only Pfizer (that we frankly say more like *Fitser*)
I say Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, others usually say BioNTech
Estonian, German, English, Finnish, Swedish, Latvian, Spanish, and French
Yeah kiitos is Finnish, tänan is estonian ( literally: I thank )
"aitäh" is more commonly used
Also in short it is tänks which sound like thanks
Completely forgot that word exists sorry lmao
Estonia was very very good at wrestling too between the two wars, 5 gold, 1 silver and 4 bronze medals between 1924 and 1936
Well considering how small Estonia is, everyone else is huge af
But to answer your question, Germany and France are really big for europe
Poland, or any non-European country of similar size
>Zurich
I have not been elsewhere in Switzerland, but I have visited Zurich \~3 times due to work
I really liked that it felt way less crowded than one would think, looking at the number of people that live there
The traffic is not awful at all, everything works like it should
I liked Bergen a lot
I must admit, I have never visited Oslo, I usually try to avoid the capitals
Binnish bemes :D :D :D :D
Well, Estonia [stores] all (and I mean *all*) data they have on their residents in Luxembourg
Toronto hosted for a long time (say 1960-2000) the biggest Estonian community abroad
The wealthiest Estonians during the Cold War lived in Venezuela
> Tartu
So it's Estonian
When reading your language, it really feels to me like our languages are related
Also one of the most memorable games in our Footballing history are against you
Isn't that what your politicians tend to call bribes
By letting the Polish submarine Orzeł crew escape from Tallinn in 1939, the Soviet Union found a good excuse to put a part of it's army on the Estonian soil
(They tought we were unable to protect ourselves, so they made us sign a pact)
Well yes, but if this incident hadn't happened, perhaps we could have defended ourselves better
English:
* 'Not at all' when replying to thank you
I have never heard anyone use it
* 'shall' for the future tense
* 'Supper' when referring to dinner, I have only seen people referring to 'fish supper' (fish and chips)
* 'Pupil' - apparently it's 'student' when kids are in school
I was taught I think circa 2007 that for future tense using 'shall' is archaic and we should almost always use 'will' instead
Quite soon after that I saw an old Top Gear episode when Clarkson said "Shall we take the Aston
" and I determined that it was bs and I shall use that word as much as I damn want
Oui oui, la souris est en dessous de la table
Definitely British English, if rumours are true she's now a head master in England
Stop acting like a complete cupboard hinge
Vienna in Estonian is called Viin, viin also means vodka in Estonian
Everywhere outside of Tallinn
Seriously though, the country as a whole is pretty sparsely populayed, but small enough that no place is really sufficiently distant to be considered "middle of nowhere".
Literally
pur whole country is in the middle of nowhere
but probably Setomaa, Vana-Vastseliina etc
Everywhere that isn't Tartu, Tallin, Pärnu or Võru really
I think closest to nowhere are the areas around the coast of Peipus as most of Ida-Virumaa and Võrumaa have stores, schools etc
while there you can expect to take a 20-40km trip to go to a store/school or use an ATM
Literally everyone moves from all around the country to the capital - Tallinn
There is some movement from Tallinn to its suburbs and nearby countryside, but it's mostly just wealthy people buying detached houses near the capital
All towns and villages outside the capital region are depopulating
The [speed signs] at [our ice roads] stretching to the islands in colder winters have a recommended middle speed limit as the middle speeds can cause resonance and break the ice - probably not for you specifically, but definitely for the cars coming after you
Also warning signs for falling icicles are quite common in Estonia
Better than discovering the back side of a sign warning of a mine field
Yet *Ice Road Truckers* always concentrates on Alaska
I guess that's one way of looking at it
But radioactive zones aren't always *that* dangerous and doubt there is that much of a quick change in the threat level once you're past the sign
With land mines, stepping on one would most likely be an instant death or a limb loss
Never heard of it in Estonia
But, apparently, we have 5 clubs playing it
Eggs
depends on the household
Milk
Well, Duh, it’d go bad in a day if it wasn’t refrigerated
Besides noone likes warm milk anyway
QWERTY with special letters of the Estonian language like õ, ä, ö, ü.
And more specifically we use the Swedish keyboard layout with some minor Estonian touches (such as the aforementioned letters)
The places where stuff like > or < or @ etc are are the same as on Swedish keyboards (i.e quite different from the English keyboard layout)
The Estonian layout:
Yeah, I have the swedish letter Å on my keyboard too but I changed it and when pressed it writes Ü. Also, how do you get the flag and country name next to your username on this subreddit
> Also, how do you get the flag and country name next to your username on this subreddit
On the right side of the subreddit (just under the join/leave button) there's a possibility to edit your "flair".
"Täitsa kena oled" you are cute
In Estonian “ I love you” translates as “Ma armastan sind”
[like this]
Yes
We are only "milk white skinned" because we don't receive enough sunlight for most of the year
As soon as we get to warmer places we get tanned just like anyone else
Same as being heavily tanned increasing chances lf skin cancer
We don't mind accents, unless its difficult to understand,  then its about not understanding what you say
I think when older people speak English with an Estonian/finnish accent, like on the news or Smth, some of us feel a bit embarrassed because rally english is a blight
It just sounds so harsh and like sandpaper to my ears xd
i dont go to restaurants often, but i dont see how eating alone could be weird
That's pretty much fancier shashlik
You lot didn't even bother giving it a proper name did you
We just call it sandwich cake
Yeah we do, Rassolnik is quite common
Estonia has 2
* Tallinn Old Town
*  Struve Geodetic Arc
Estland
I actually wrote an article about it, too
By the response I got there's plenty of people in Estonia who prefer the name Estland and would support changing it in English
Some people want the name of Estonia in English to be Estland (i.e the name it has in many Germanic languages)
Basically because it supposedly sounds less "Eastern".
I really don't like the Estonia (It's ok but strange), kinda sounds like a website for geology fans of something
Here are some variants that, in my opinion would be better:
Eesti
Estland
Igaunija (that's how latvians call this country)
Im fine with estonia, its latin
Horvaatia in Estonian
Finn
I love the name, but in Estonian it’s a bad word for Finnish people
Yeah, we usually call them Sasha
I personally don't really have any clothes with logos on them (though the [Vans sneakers] maybe do have
But clothers with logos are still commonly worn, especially Nike and Puma shirts and hoodies, also tiny logos on coats and jackets
But it is more of a sportswear thing and generally europeans dress "smarter" on the streets and don't wear sportswear unless well doing sports
So maybe that's why it seems less prevalent
An average casual look is something like [that] and [that]
>Probably not the advertisement they wanted but, you know, at least it shows their clothes are probably durable and versatile
Lol, that's a good one
Sweden
But, it was dispelled in the end of 90's when I first visited
During Soviet time I had quite romantic view of them
We're
not friends
Moi is also what Finns say and it's possible that it's a Low Saxon loan
We aren't nordic
Universal, not free
When 33% of your salary goes to social tax, that pays for healthcare, universities and pensions, it's not "free". It's just guaranteed to most of the society
We also kinda "pay" for it in much lower salaries than what you have in USA
20-30k yearly salaries are a norm even in Western Europe, in Eastern Europe it's often only 10k. 100k salaries are almost unachiavable for regular employee, not even for highly qualified IT specialists, you either have to move to leading position in a company, or start a business
Yeah, and cost of living in some poor african countries is even lower
Doesn't mean life is better there
The bigger the wage you have - more disposable income you have
Even with higher prices
And having debt doesn't always mean a bad thing
Especially if it's something like a loan to buy a house
>for what you get
Not everything we get from government is of good quality though
It's just enough to survive
Here in Estonia basic pension (if you didn't work) is like 190 euros, average if you worked for lets say 30 years is around 400ish euros
You better be saving separately or you will have quite poor retirement
Free healthcare
Well, you can wait for you doctors appointment half a year
or alternatively  you pay for it and get it immediately
>Let’s see, 33% of $40k per year
33% is only a social tax
Add to that 20% income tax and 20% vat tax on everything you buy (which makes many things cheaper to buy from american amazon or ebay, even with shipping costs)
And don't forget that 40k is a dream salary for majority of population in my country
Average is about 20k (in usd) and half of the workers get  less than 15k. So, still sounds great to you
>Perhaps, Africans have different values
I don't think civil wars, famines and overpopulation are "happy african values". Most of the population in african countries have shitty life, and it's not relative, let's not kid ourselves
>Eastern Europe
I make 10k, tax is 10%. My disposable income is 9k. Cost of living is 5k. I have 4k.
> I make 100k. Tax is 60%. My disposable income is 40k
You're the one who is simplifying
Firstly in Nordic countries tax is progressive, so 60% tax only applies to a portion of your salary above certain threshold
It's not like 60% of your whole salary is taken in form of income tax
Secondly almost nowhere the tax is 10%. In Eastern Europe income tax is between 15 and 20%. And good luck trying to live on 5k in any east european country
Maybe if you have a flat inherited from grandma and spend money on nothing other than food, it's doable
but usually most of your salary goes to rent, food, clothes,  and it's growing more if you have a family or kids
> Some people are perflecty content living in a hut for their whole lives
Oh sure
And thousands of africans who try to flee to Europe and often die in sea for it, probably just want to go on sightseeing tour, right
Also millions of east europeans who migrated to Western Europe probably just wanted to take a look at Westminster and Eiffel tower, right
> Since we are getting nitpicky, this is wrong
Only 7 countries have income tax rate of 10% and lower in Europe
14  ex-socialist/soviet countries have tax rates over 13%.
> Some don't mind having a family of 4 in a 20 sqm space because they're not you
I am pretty sure 90% of people in such conditions only do it because they have no other choice, not because they are "happy" about it
I know it, because I lived in a small flat with loads of family members, and I know people in such social circle
Almost nobody is fucking happy in such situation
>Everyone is the same
I never said that everyone are the same
I do know there are some hermits who are happy to live in a hut
But in  general people with less wealth and in more impoverished conditions are less satisfied with their lives
Migration patterns of millions of people from less wealthy to more wealthy countries (in many cases where people put their lives in danger) only confirm that
> Several are at 10 and under 15%.
But most are not
I do feel that Asia is closer to us than Africa - both in km and culturally
This might not apply to South-East Asia, but Kazakhstan and even Japan do seem familiar and surprisingly similar
But I am from Northern Europe and this is probably different in the South
When it comes to North Africa, then it is somewhat covered in history classes and social studies, but mainly in its relations to Europe
I also had the chance to study Arabic language at school and later took a course at uni, too
I do like Morocco tiles and ceramics and their cute Darija language
I know about Algeria being colonised by France (have read a lot of Camus)
Egypt plays a big role in history and is a popular tourist destination
I've forgotten most I've read about Tunisia by now and and I don't think I've ever really known anything specific about Libya
Actually, I was just discussing this fact with my friend a few days ago - that Libya is so big on the map, but that I can't really recall anything specific about it
Finland/Estonia also have a weird click with Japan, both language and culture-wise
There have been several articles about this topic, even in English like [this] and [this] from a quick google
Probably at the beginning of 20th century when we fought for our independence(estonia) from Russia
We also fought some Germans and latvians at the south of estonia
1918-1920
Fun Fact: Estonia had a lot of vikings
Most of the vikings lived in our two biggest islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa
They were very rich
Yes
Home Alone and Die Hard are shown on TV every year during Christmas
[Rullnokad ("rolled beaks")] by the way they roll their baseball cap "beak". Usually drives old BMW, drinks a lot and has lower than average IQ
Linked is a humor show making fun of them, but they are a real phenomenon
Oss
We also have a short movie about their culture:
Also ossid
I think *kalevipojad* has become more common nowadays
It is used for *gastarbeiters* that usually have some blue-collar job, most commonly in construction, in Finland (in rarer cases, Sweden, Norway etc) so they constantly ferry back-and-forth
Stereotypically, they have low education, are from a rural place, have shallow values (money, cars, women) and act annoyingly (drinking, loud etc)
Technically, Finland "has" them ;)
Finnish: Can understand sometimes, some words have a complitely different meaning tho
Hungarian: what
Two more false friends
"Raiskama" means "to spend" in Estonian (like spend money)
In Finnish it means "to rape".
"Pulm" means "wedding" in Estonian, but "pulma" in Finnish means "problems".
True
but someone still decided Hungarian and Estonian are somehow connected
Yay
Uzbek sons of bitches
Idk what that phrase means but i'd understand the Finnish version as: Elav kala on vee all (A living fish is umder the water)
Uuuh, i was close
No serious ones
Ask Russia, they apparently are very eager to "liberate" even more of our country
Similar in Estonian with "kurk", but it's only the same in nominative case, declension is different "kurk/kurgi/kurki" for cucumber, "kurk/kurgu/kurku" for throat
Definitely first with the nation, and thereafter country, then city and perhaps then county
I was born in Tallinn and i live Tallinn, but my family roots come from Hiiumaa island so I identify with Hiiumaa the most, because it's the closest to my heart, then Tallinn, then Estonia overrall
After that I identify as a finnic person and lastly european
Squirrel
>whatever the language
Estonian: *orav*
There are always exceptions
I'd say the difficulty with world is that most of the letters in that word are practically imaginary
*Orava* is the genitive form in Estonian, as well as a settlement
What country that is far away from your own, feels for some reason very similar
I know that Finland and Japan share quite some similarities and the people in respective countries are sometimes obsessed with each other
This does extend to Estonia to some degree, but it is not so big here
I personally also felt an odd connection when visiting Portugal
Now because people will come with the old "Portugal can into Eastern Europe" thing, I'll say that it's not really about anything like that
It is more about being very connected to the sea and having a certain melancholic tone in our cultures
And among all the southern places I've seen, they seemed by far the most calm, not yelling when they talk, not so focused on wild parties and drama
And small, a bit more down-to-earth, not so posh, as some bigger countries might seem
Czechia maybe
We are both very atheist and unreligious, both have high beer consumption, pretty much the same HDI, GDP per capita and democracy index
Both used to be unions (Livonia and Czechoslovakia)
That's all I can think of right now
Inside Europe from the places I've been to myself Slovakia felt quite similar to home overall
In terms of mentality of the people most of the Germanic-speaking lands are quite similar
Outside of Europe it's more tricky, from the impressions I've gotten perhaps New Zealand and parts of Canada would be the most similar but I've never been there myself

Thank you
The Japanese also love the Moomins, take off their shoes indoors, and the introvert-thing
And the mythology is similar
I've seen several articles, but these came right up on google atm [ and [
Basically they both have deep respect to nature and these animistic old beliefs really strong in their folk culture
They are also somewhat reserved and culturally a bit different from their neighbours
I've seen several articles, but these came right up on google atm [ and [
Yeah
Thy also both have their very own ballet style
The Russian high class used to speak a lot of French and at some point when there was political trouble, several Russian intellectuals escaped to France
I think New Zealand is a really good bet to most of the british isles
And yes, the sheep
Has to be [Taevaskoja]
We have a crossroad in Estonia where there's a sign - 2 km to Tapa city (Tapa means kill) and 21 km to Loobu village (Loobu means give up)
Also, we have a village called Litsmetsa which literally means "slut's forest".
I suppose Chornobyl pretty much sums it up
M/S Estonia
I kinda wanna believe in conspiracy theories that it was sunk on purpose by Russian spies since it had old soviet guns on the ship and they were on a route to US through Sweden
The primary reason why some of my relatives won't ever travel to Stockholm by ship
Safe to say it was a disaster for us all
Me  'im from Estonia'

We had a little bit of snow in November
It also snowed one morning a few days ago, but was already melted by evening
Yes, but little and rarely
It can be called something like "snowish" as well
Tallinn is very cold, OK
The ground becomes slippery and icy, OK
That's all
It is too weird to experience this situation in Tallinn as well as the rest of Northern and Eastern Europe in January
Global warming and accordingly us, human being, have spoiled the balance of the Earth
And I've lost my hope to see a harder snow at the forthcoming weeks
Some coats came down but they melted the next day
Only three times
Same here
Absolutely not
No telephone shopping, no TV shopping
None
Only online oe go to the store
We are very distrusting of phone and TV shopping
Sometimes considered a language, sometimes just a dialect, Seto, aka old Estonian
Also japanese has a nice tune to it and same goes to Icelandic
My favorite language apart from the Finnic ones is English
I love how it’s a mix of both germanic and romance roots with a very distinct pronunciation
What I do not like, though, are all those very specific English accents, such as Scottish, New Zealand English, Southern U.S. English, etc
We hate russians, probably because we have to learn their language
Tip of the day: don't force people to learn gibberish languages like russian
Depends what you mean by "foreign-born" of course
Our previous President [Toomas-Hendrik Ilves] was born in Stockholm to Estonian emigres and grew up in the United States and is a US citizen
He visited Estonia for the first time in 1984, when he was 31
After that he worked for Radio Free Europe and because of that he couldn't visit Estonia throughout the rest of the Soviet occupation
He first moved to Estonia in 1996, when he was 43 years old
All pre-Soviet occupation citizens and their descendants have been provided automatic Estonian citizenship, so he was able to become the President in 2006
AFAIK, Latvia and Lithuania have also had Cold War emigres as their presidents
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, president between 2006-2016 was born in Stockholm to WW2 refugees and grew up in New Jersey
As per Estonian citizenship laws he automatically received Estonian citizenship upon re-independence and became extremely prominent politically
His parents fled the Soviet "Union" during WW2
Toomas Hendrik Ilves, our 4th president, was born in Sweden, grew up in New Jersey, then later moved to Canada and then Germany
He came back when Estonia gained independence
He was Estonian, just foreign born
Before arriving, he was also Estonia's ambassador to the US and he became the Minister of Foreign Affairs when he finally settled in Estonia
My english teacher in 4th grade spelled sneakers as "snikers". I am wearing snickers apparently
Maybe, but school systems are different enough that it gets annoying finding the correct term in each case
Gymnasium seems to be common in (mainland) Europe and we know exactly what it refers to, so I'd go for it
Here we have the 3 king's day, all we do is take out the christmas tree
we call it "three king's day" and we don't really celebrate it, but it is a tradition to take out the christmas tree on this day or at least BY this day, and it is also the last day it is okay to wish happy new year
Only a monster would do such things
Ok german
I’d say all of Northern Europe, except for Denmark
Ai kurat, sa põder raisk (aw fuck, you goddamn moose)
When I visited Copenhagen and Arhus I felt that the Danes were talking very loudly
The shoes off part is true tho
Same in Estonia
BuT wE aReNt EaStErN EurOpE bEaCauSe We'rE nOrdIC
No no no no
There's a difference between nordic and Scandinavian as Scandinavian means that it's apart of the Scandinavian peninsula whilst nordic means it's in northern Europe
But uhhh
we'll see about that Latvia thing later
We have more french and british troops here and as for the question it makes us feel a bit safer
I think it's a big difference between having NATO troops over or them having an actual base here
I think that NATO is our ally not just US so I wouldn't like them to have seperate bases here
But I guess I understand the tactical reasons why they have them in Germany and so on
If we go for Slovakia then I would love to add poultry to list
Especially duck
Saddest part is I was eating it like 15 years ago passing by from Poland to Hungary and never after found this place and I'm not even sure where I was
It was more of the eastern part as I went to Eastern Hungary
> ”eww, bottled water” is a real reaction in Finland
I'd say it's the third most Finnish thing after the sauna culture and going completely nuts whenever you win at hockey
> bread I grew up with, and love
I think this is the key with bread
I love our bread and I get confused when other's claim they have good bread
For me, they rarely do
It's just what you are used to
Pierogi (pelmeen) and kefir(keefir), both are very common in Estonian households
We have some polish products
Not in Estonia
All the things that are usually sold in polish groceries in western european countries can be just  found in regular shops, so no point in having specific shops for them
The Bronz age giants in the Mediterranean( Greece, Egypt, Italy, phonetians, and China + Japan + Korea
Those nations at that time are fascinating to me
Hungary
They were the greatest power in Europe during the Middle-Ages, yet when we think of this time period, we think of Britain, France, the Vikings and Saxons, which were basically little petty kingdoms compared to Hungary
Soviet era Estonia from 1953-1980
Or pre Christian Estonia before the crusades in 12 century
Any time before year 1000
I am very curious about how Estonian language sounded back then, what the daily life looked like and what the beliefs and customs were
We don’t have much written history from that era, besides a few mentions here and there in foreign chronicles in addition to archaeological findings
So it would be fascinating
Or maybe when a giant meteorite landed in Saaremaa a few thousand years ago ([Kaali crater] I would love to see that
From a safe distance of course
Life has been pretty crap for most of the time in history so there are probably just two options for me
Mid90s because it was a crazy time here, wild music, wilder parties, people wearing tracksuits
Even if it was among the most dangerous peacetime periods of the whole last 100 years, murder rate, mafia, car crashes, all out of control
The other point would've been around 1928, the first republic era before The Great Depression came round
I'm pretty confident I could hum the Finnish anthem
Yeah, the Finnish one is quite familiar
I'll tell you when i see one
Since i live in Viimsi
Some do and some dont, cars seeming to be  the most popular way
The weirdest thing i have seen tho is a dude looking like he barely has money for clothes and shaving cream  and driving a brand new S class Mercedes
In Estonia I guess it has to be "Õnne 13". It has been running since 1993 and has aired 822 episodes in 28 seasons
A typical show of this type I guess, shows boring small town life even though it's filmed in the suburbs of Tallinn most of the time
No, but the South Estonian dialect is very strong and sounds like a small part of it is lithuanian+latvian and rest Estonian
Russification began in 19th century actually, but Soviets took it to the next level
People are "angry" at China for suppressing the language, culture and traditions of their minorities, such as Uyghurs and Mongols, but Russia has been doing it for centuries and nobody bats an eye
Time when colonialism was acceptable
Russia is systematically replacing and repressing the Crimean Tatars even in 2020
Also minority cultures are dying in Russia, as the education and government services are only provided in Russian
The only people who are preserving the Finno-Ugric cultures- and languages are old people (see Russian Eurovision entry on 2012), and when they are gone, there is nobody left to conserve these unique traditions
It's ironic when dogs like Lavrov and Putin are complaining about the "discrimination of Russians" in the Baltics, including the situation with Russian language in here
Like 5 years ago it was such a thick snow and like -30C but we'll gotta see this year
You’d earn more weird looks as a non-atheist than as an atheist
Most of the country is atheist
If someone says to me specifiacally that they're an atheist the only fear or thought that crosses my mind is that maybe they're going to start spewing some crap from a cringey youtube video which makes /r/badphilosophy look good
Religion is so unimportant in Estonians lives that it is seriously such an unimportant matter, and organized religion is sometimes looked as a big greedy business which some seriously hate
We (Estonia) are one of the most irreligious countries on Earth
So being an atheist is kind of a default option
People will be far more surprised if they find out that you do variuos religious things and go to church often
Easter and Christmas are still celebrated by most though, but it is more of a cultural thing nowadays than religious
Same here
one celebrity called her a mushroomer from an estonian island (for her casual outfit), but that got quite a bit of backlash, so idk if it counts as a joke
oh, she also kind of looks like Jungkook from BTS, but that one is obviously not a common one either
i suppose the one we do have jokes about is the prime minister, whose only purpose seems to be apologizing for the actions and words of the members of the other ministers
he is also notorious for not being able to give a straight answer, to the point where someone created a "round answer generator" that generates answers that dont actually answer the question, but sound like they do
Her god damn pointy ass nose and her hair (Kersti Kaljulaid)
Our prime minister Jüri "The apologizer" Ratas, we have a far-right populist party in our goverment along with a center/bit leftist party where Ratas belongs to
And the leaders of EKRE are constantly saying sketchy shit and Ratas has to apologize for them
The whole situation reminds me of a sitcom
"Went to the store and accidentally stepped on an old ladies toe, I was about to say sorry but thankfully Ratas was already there" and so on
He's a joke himself, being an ex-comedian
Generally with an S, but many Estonians make it a point to pronounce it with an Sh, but it sounds a bit pretentious as does the "over-pronunciation" of other foreign place names, especially well known city names
Learning Finnish as an Estonian is quite easy too
They have guns, yes
I remember one time when someone was shot, they were running st the policeman with a knife or something similar
Special units like K-Komando, comparable to S.W.AT
, use assault and battle rifles too
Is it true that the Swedish police uses horses
Every time estonian police uses firearm, it is most important news for a week
It is that rare event
That is why police used soviet era crappy makarov pistols until very recently (2017) - police did not complain because they used firearms only in shooting range
So - yes, the are carrying but there is sooo much paperwork when they happen to unholster it
we were taught the same
Tallinn is notoriousily pro-car
I think the little strips on the side of some roads are ment for bikes but other than being not marked, very narrow and not seperated by anything other than some pain on the pavement they also arent designed to be navigated in a logicaõ fashion
The end abruptly etc
I don't know how some are brave enough to try and cycle in 9 lanes of traffic so most just use the sidewalks if at all
My family gatherings are usually pretty boring but sometimes my grandpa drinks too much and starts talking about some random stuff and it's actually pretty funny listening to him
And he always talks about a time in the russian army when a loose propeller cut some dudes head off
"Sai sai
" "Sai" can be a very common thing to hear in Estonian considering that it means "did (someone) get the bread
" "Yes" note that the person getting the bread is unknown so it could be anyone but it's typically either you or we in this specific situation
It works the same way here in Estonia too
In Estonian it's the same though
Lembitu
Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald
Johann Voldemar Jannsen

Lydia Koidula
Konstantin Päts
Johan Laidoner
Julius Kuperjanov
Jaan Tõnisson
Jaan Poska

Would add to this list
Anton Hansen Tammsaare and Eduard Vilde
I thought of adding him to the list, but I didn't think that he was that historical since he was the president  just 20 years ago
I'd say it's a beautiful language, although it doesn't particularly strike out for that quality
It does seem to have sort of a very "round" pronunciation, which I think is an odd quality when it comes to languages
As for vocabulary, I like how much technical variability English has, while the grammar on the other hand doesn't allow for as much variance as Estonian
The stupidest quality it has of course is its nonuniform spelling, which often doesn't make any sense at all, aside from the etymological perspective
English is way better for scientific texts in my opinion
>  not the ugliest language around
Funny, for me personally it is French
[Here] is a good example of what English sounds to foreigners
Lots of other languages have more concrete pronunciation
Not necessarily rougher (like someone stereotypically pronouncing German as if everyone was an SS soldier kind of way), but still more concrete
French is also similar in that sense and a large reason why English sounds the way it does, especially if compared to other Germanic languages
French takes it to a new level though, it's not so much of a "round" pronunciation, but just hasty in the sense that it mashes everything together
We have this issue too, l communicate in English so much that most of my conversations with some Estonian friends are done in English too
The word knight comes to mind as a good example of a word that was pronounced very differently
I think the sound of our language is actually quite different, some dialects sound more like Finnish than standard Estonian
Nah, the virus isn't that big of a problem here, most people forget it exists even
It's hard to say
Even if we narrow it down to what you specified ...it's still pretty vague
Graduated from uni
Well, average graduate salary varies from 1200 eur to over 2000 eur depending on a university and field of study
Rents a flat
Well, you can rent for as low as 250 eur a studio or room in a flat, or you can splurge a 1500 for some fancy big flat in city center
But if you really want an average
Average net salary is around 1200 net
Average rent for flat ...I'd say 450
Add to that bills, groceries and assume no car - let's say another 250 eur
Plus some 100 eur on irregular purchases
So theoritaclly, if you live within your means, but not super-frugally, you can save up 400 eur a month with an average salary
In practice ... I have no idea how much anyone saves
Approx 500€ (wider guess 300-700) a month
I'd think that an average graduate would earn 1300-1400 (after tax) in the first year after graduating, though the full range is of course very wide, some jobs can earn you twice as much, some might get you stuck at 900
Average rent for a 2-room apartment would be from 350 to 450, with most options being 400-450
But if you have bought an apartment the loan payments could be quite a bit smaller
Everything depends on how much you spend on food, fun and heating etc, but it's an estimate
At what age can people start uni
In Estonia you are 19 if you start uni right after high school and as Masters takes minimum 5 years it is basically impossible to finish uni before 24
Most people take a year or two off (during or in between their studies to study abroad, travel or work) and several people change their speciality at some point, so usually people graduate Masters while aged 25 or 26
So this seems quite young
Damn, I'd be broke very fast if I spent so much on food everyday :D
Oh, this is interesting
In Estonia it is rather rare to do bachelor and not do a masters nowadays (they are considered more of a drop-out than a degree, influenced by the fact that before adopting the Bologna system our bachelor took 4 years to do, so a lot of people have 4-year degree and the 3-year one is considered a bit too basic)
On the other hand, having a part-time job while doing masters is also common
This mentality can really be stressful for Greek students
Then again, this really long uni study here means that people have less children than they want to, cause time runs out, so at least you guys won't die out at the same rate as we do :D
Then all the foreigners would be confused, everyone would be talking võro
You can drive through our whole country in 3-4 hours
So the life will return to normal course in less than a day
But for a few weird hours there will be a lot more people at the latvian-estonian border as all of 400k residents of Tallinn will appear there
Pretty sure there's no difference
1) I have no idea as I finished school in Soviet Union
2) I'm not that old yet and I still have functioning brain
So, no I have no nostalgia whatsoever
There may be some golden nomenclatura children who feel nostalgia
I have not met one as I don't know any
I move around regular people circles
3) Our ancestors were freed from slavery 1865
I havent go to it yet but i can say for certain that people have nostalgia for tgeir childhood not communism
The only people, that are nostalgic about the Soviet Union in Estonia are very old Russians
I can see how this might be different in other post-Soviet states like Ukraine, Belarus the Caucasus states and even some parts of Latvia due to the different economic situation
Afaik and have heard, Estonia had it a bit more mellow during the soviet times
I personally haven't heard anyone missing it but I also wouldn't say that my parents stories are filled with horror, everyone basically managed to live
All the horror stories are mostly from the WWI, times were much more difficult then, especially with the deportations
But I can imagine that maybe some old russians in Estonia are missing it a bit
As for estonians i haven't seen a single person that could forgive or look past the horrors
I've heard alot of stories from old people (even old Estonians) that they miss the soviet union and how everything was in order then, for example Edgar Savisaar one of the people who helped us get our freedom said a few years back when he visited Russia that there was more order and everything was "nice"  back then
About schools i guess we learn about it from top to bottom which makes most of Estonian youth dislike Russia and communism
Official soviet history has not died out - it is alive and well in Russia
Lavrov is bringing it up quite often
The main part is that Baltic states asked Soviet Union to join
(Which happened after SU had its armed forces in Baltic states and had organized general elections with only communist party candidates
But that part was omitted
The mass deportation of 1941 was explained as evacuation of civilians because of war
Most destruction of cities in 1944 was blamed on nazis
But mostly it was repeating over and over the glorious parts of soviet era - revolutions (1905, 1917 february and october)
Great Patriotic war (world war II on eastern front) and victory
"And then Russia invaded us (again)"
Al dente is the best
Being quite open about nudity
Like going to the sauna naked together or not having little changing booths inside the changing rooms
The graveyards are so pretty during Christmas/New Year's Eve
So many candles in the darkness
All the graveyards look pretty much like this:
(No snow on these pictures though
You usually won't break your skull on a Dutch granny's bike
Road biking and MTB'ing are quite different in their nature compared to commuting in the Netherlands (actually statistically in the Netherlands cyclist who wear helmets have more injuries - because they generally ride in a riskier matter)
It would be such a silly concept for Estonian
Most people know how to spell well enough and the difference between people would be rather arbitrary
English has a very nonstandard spelling, while Estonian spelling is more or less uniform and follows pronunciation very closely
There are only a few exceptions to it and most people would know them by heart
The youngest "real word" I could find was demarche even though I can't recall ever hearing it out loud
Prime minister (the one how has power) is chosen in the parliamentary election, where the party or parties who have the most seats become the government
For example, last election reform party got tha majority of votes but didnt form a government since they couldn't get a coalition
President is chosen by parliament
I don’t think there’s much pressure
It’s quite common and normal to be single and be focused on your career instead
In fact, I would say that way more pressure and emphasis is put on your career achievements, rather than creating a family
By the time one is in their late 30s, they are expected to be successful in their career
Besides, you wouldn’t want to have kids, unless you can provide them an economically stable and secure home
There is definitely a generational difference in this matter
In my circle of friends, it’s seen as a bit weird when someone marries and has children in their twenties
Whereas, it was the norm for the older generation to settle down and have children in their twenties
So it is quite common that parents and grandparents keep asking when will you be showing them your partner (if you don’t have a girlfriend/boyfriend yet) or when will they finally have their grandchildren (if you’re already in a relationship)
But they do it jokingly, rather than judging you for doing something wrong
I also haven’t noticed any difference between the attitude towards men or women
At least in my experience
If anything, women put pressure on themselves, since we feel like there’s a limited time window for us to do family planning
For example, I personally feel quite anxious sometimes when I think that I’d like to have a family one day
Due to biological limitations, I would have to plan it for my mid/end-thirties
But for that I would have to meet my soulmate within the next few years, which seems quite impossible since I’m so focused on my career
If I pass that window, I would probably have to consider adopting instead
yadi yada yada
No one else has put the pressure on me
Just me worrying about how to balance my career and personal life goals
Estonia is really small but
Tallinn our capital mostly low iq people
Tartu very educated people since its a university town
Eastern Estonia dibla dibla and dibla
Islanders think they vikings Vikings
South-eastern Estonia is like another country
It is **awesome**! We sometimes even do daytrips just like 100-200 km across the border (to see some new areas, buy some different products and just be in a different-language-speaking-area) and weekend getaways are very common both via car or plane (unfortunately, the railway system is not suitable for long-distance travel at my end of EU, but in the south they use it a lot)
Oh my, you really made me miss tiny travelling like that
Damn covid
Usually it makes no difference
It's not like I'm going to Sweden or Russia on a whim
Flights to cool places in Europe though are short and you can go to Latvia for cheap booze
Otherwise it's normal I guess
Especially for border regions, it can be just a strategical choice once in a while to visit the other country and buy products that are cheaper there
if your neighbouring country has cheaper grocery stores, you can save a decent amount by just shopping there
Where's this
Tornio
Yeah, my parents live 5-6 hours drive from me and have visited my place 3 or 4 times in the 10 years that I have lived here
For them, 40+ km is a long ride
At the same time, some of my friends casually drive 1500 km for a small trip and 200km on a daily basis
So it really depends
I've heard that in most countries people don't wear a [reflector] on their outdoor clothes for half a year like [that] No idea if it's true, though
Over here you get a fine, if you don't.
[This immediately comes to mind] Jokes aside I did notice a crazy amount of different types of beer glasses in Flanders when I was there
Oh one of those, we call them 'soome kelk' for fairly obvious reasons
Not very common either, mostly just left over from the the end of the last century, rural people probably still use them sometimes
I won one of those at a little contest six years ago, I think I've used it maybe once, otherwise it's useless
You buy sliced cheese, duh
Oh, we used to have similar ones like this:
Yup, most of November to March it is still dark when you go to work/school and already dark when you go back home
I've seen [similar] ones
Not very widespread though
Oh my god I read that totally wrong and I was proper confused
I read 'sink' as the Estonian word for 'ham' instead of well the kitchen sink
They are way too big for it to be suitable
If I was in a beer hall in well Bavaria it would make sense because I wouldn't want to get up to get a new beer too often
Yeah, over here there are several more stylish options for those who do not want to add a simple circle with some logo to their clothing, like a brooch [here] or [here] or a [tassel] or [animal characters] for younger folk (these were really popular to have on school bags)
Still better than having Soviet era high-density residential areas
The [Lasnamäe] district is notorious in the sense of low-quality Soviet era housing
Part of the problem is also that the Soviet occupation ended when this district wasn't fully completed yet
I mean, it would probably still look bad considering that it's all built on a low-vegetation limeston tabletop area, but it looks especially bad because it was never fully completed - it's not like anyone invested into new housing in the early 1990s and after that nobody had the incentive to improve this area
Western Estonian medieval towns are all beautiful
And Lihula is actually a town, it has the highest EKRE-voting share of all Estonia
And Russians
Don't get me wrong, Lasnamäe is definitely the worst of them, while [Annelinn] is comparably similar in Tartu
[Väike-Õismäe] is also quite bad, but some others are slightly better, like [Mustamäe] or [Pelguranna] even though they partly have older [still Soviet era] buildings
It has lagged behind Lasnamäe actually - at least Lasnamäe is being improved, but Väike-Õismäe is already too dense
Old cities are mostly new cities with old historical centres, i.e. old towns
These old towns are from different historical eras of course, so I can only speak of life in the medieval Tallinn Old Town, where many houses are from the 14th century
One of the main problems is plumbing as there is no room for proper plumbing inside the walls
You can see the problems in old town pubs for example where the toilets are often clogged
The houses can also have rather ridiculous floor plans due to their medieval nature
Have a look at the floor plan of [these apartments] for example
The courtyards can be pleasant though as they are often closed and private, although they aren't very practical due to being narrow and not getting much sunlight
Another problem is parking and access of course as much of the old town is a pedestrian area with limited vehicle accessibility
Nearest parking lots can be quite far and there are only enough legal parking spots on the street
In winters with more snow, the regular parking spots are often filled with excess snow piles and they aren't always removed in time
More about winters, the old town can get crazy slippery in the winter with its cobblestone streets and narrow and high sidewalks with often rather uncomfortable angles
Also, as the sidewalks are very close to the buildings and most houses have gable roofs, icicles are easy to form and they are a constant threat in the winter especially in the old town
Also, as the old town has many pubs and restaurants, it really isn't the calmest place to live - very few locals would actively look for a place to live in in the old town
>Old houses and flats have terrible insulation
I don't think it applies to all old buildings and it does apply to quite some new buildings as well
During the plastic-and-gypsum era of \~2000 the houses built here often had internal walls that are just a layer or two of gypsum and doors of papier-mâché, so you can basically hear people breathing in the other room
Old stone houses with wooden doors on the other hand
>5 floors no elevator building
Over here even modern ones don't have an elevator with only 4-5 floors
Besides, exercise is good for most folk, because most folk is fat, not paralysed
Interesting, over here it's the other way around: most old apartments have a height of  2
80 to 3
50, whereas most modern apartments are 2
40-2
>from 1900-1920
At least it's a glorious era
I really like buildings from that time
Ah, an alchemic
We had very common St Martin's Day and St Catherine's Day traditions that survived well into the 1990s. They were very similar with Halloween as kids would go door to door and ask for sweets
The difference was that they dressed up as bums or wanderers as the tradition comes from a former obligation of every parish to support their poor in times of need
> May Day is fuck all but a day off work these days for most in Britain
I didn't realize it was supposed to be something else
Well we have a place called "Põrgu küla" which means "hells village" and "Pulli küla" my best translation would be "tomfoolery village"
There's a duo of islands
One is Väike-Pakri (Small Pakri) and one is Suur-Pakri (Big Pakri)
"Small Pakri" is bigger
We also have a village called [Laeva] ("of the ship") which isn't anywhere near any major waterways
ok american
..I think a look at your country is a great example of why we should preserve lingual fragmentation
Most of the time and most of the people, yes
(I am a phd researcher at the moment and therefore don't count, as this means that it is pretty much my job to be stressed and work fullnighters)
Regarding a comparison with the 90s - stuff has changed somewhat, yeah
First, you were not able nor expected to work from home in weekends or beside office hours 25 years ago the way it is now
When you closed the office door, it was over
It ain't so any more, most of my friends check their work stuff on their phone like at least twice every evening after work
And then there is the cultural drift, as countries become more and [more individualistic] including that family is less of a priority over work than it used to be and people are in a way more alone than ever
I can see how these factors can affect mental health and this in turn can influence stuff like meals and sleep
But still, I don't think we can accurately recall the 90s as we ourselves were not in the same position 25 years ago
Halloween
Its still not a thing amongst older people  but most of the youth celebrates it
We only have towns, but I'd think that the most different is either [Kuressaare] that just looks a bit different being made of houses that have [white limestone walls & red roofs] way more than others (the island also has a bit different history than the mainland) or the capital [Tallinn] that has more [soviet vibes] and also more [modern vibes] than the rest of the country, let alone the [medieval old town]
I think that the most typical one could be any of Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Haapsalu, Võru, Paide
They all have these 3 most popular types of buildings: different [wooden houses] from 1880-1940, private houses from [1940-1960s] and a small [soviet district] (in small towns, they can be pretty green and liveable)
You wouldn't consider smt like Narva or Kohtla-Järve the most different considering they're majority Russian
I was thinking more about what towns look like, but population-wise, yes they are very different
And Kohtla-Järve also looks very soviet, but I simply forgot about the place or well that it's a town and not an *alev*. As a lot of the pretty old town of Narva was bombed town, this also looks a bit more soviet
So yeah, the contrast between Narva and say Viljandi is really very big
> Bielefeld
Wouldn't a good example need to actually *exist*?
It shouldnt, its oir secrect language
Plus you guys couldnt even learn it
Few examples from Estonian:
Kuuuurija (moon ivestigator)
Töööö (working night)
Jäääär (the edge of ice)
To be honest, all Finno-Ugric languages are very hard
Hungarian has 18, Finnish and Karelian 15, Estonian 14
fuck no, we'd have to teach so many people and the language is HARD
plus i want to keep my secret language for talking behind others backs :D
estonian too, but i would argue german isnt phonetic because they have some noun combinations that are pronounced differently
yeah, i mean those
and i guess you are right, there arent many
Saving the Latvians in 1919 and 1920
Maybe we should have let them declare war on us, then immediately surrendered
I mean, the French get a lot of white flag jokes but at least nobody claims their country has no legal continuity with pre-1944 France
Still probably wouldn't have made much of a difference other than having slightly fewer internet trolls to argue with, and on the negative side it might have led to even harsher repressions on the people for having resisted
So yeah we were kinda screwed either way
Cold - 20

This but everything is 5° hotter
Mostly agree, I'd say 5 to 15 is nice and okay
25+ and I can feel my brain slowly melting inside
I live at 59 and for me there is nothing really
I guess im used to it
Living at 59°56’N. It’s not that bad here
The sun rised at 09
10 in the morning today and set af 3
19 in the afternoon
You get used to it and I also like the cozy atmosphere in the december nights, where everything is dark, but you can see the lights shining from every house
I have a horrible sleeping schedule so i pretty much don't see the daylight at all
reflectors and the enjoyment of the dark really help
How Norse-influenced was ancient Estonia (pre-13th century)
Estonians, especially Saaremaa islanders, were known raiders and also pillaged Scandinavia at times
Also the gods in especially Saaremaa were named similar to "Thor", but there also existed local, Estonian pagan gods
So there was the pantheon of Estonian gods, but also an influx of Norse gods, so it's rather difficult to explain the actual religious situation in Estonia during that time
>Like, how did proto-Iranian loan words creep into Finnish independently from other Indo-European languages
It's really not [that complicated]
I heard that before coming the north we were at the coast of the black sea and then we split up Finns went to Finland and Estonians to Estonia
And our genes resemble the original Europeans more than Germanic and other people not Mongolian which was also a theory before hitler did the race research thing
Also, a clue into the origins of Estonians and Finns might be in linguistics
North Estonian is genealogically closer to Finnish than it is to South Estonian, so the Finnic people probably splintered in Estonia first and only then did Finns migrate onwards
Most likely especially insular and coastal Estonians were very strongly integrated with Norse people, either on good terms or bad terms or really both
The inland regions saw less Norse influence, but it was probably some kind of a mix everywhere
Either case, our Nordic/Northern identity has very old roots - it's definitely older than subjecting it to Internet memes would suggest
I'm not saying the ones that came later are any less European
Oh god, I can't do it for Tallinn
Each district should have its own song honestly
There is always a lack of doctors (GPs in particular) and teachers, also nurses and caretakers
Actually, being a teacher is a too-often-overlooked option
Think about it, almost 3 month summer vacations and no 9-17 work hours
I think positions of middle school teachers for physics, chemistry, biology and languages other than English are often vacant
IT and communication, finance/economics, energetics, law
These are top paying fields
>is about 900/m, well above national average
Uhm, isn't net average wage in Lithuania almost 900/m?
A type of farmhouse called "rehielamu", which combines rooms for drying and threshing crops with living quarters under the same roof
Incidentally the concept of "rehi" (a specialized building for the aforementioned crop drying and threshing) itself seems to be confined to North-Eastern Europe - I can't even find an English translation for it
That when people say bread they mean white bread
Turns out that black or rye bread isn't that popular everywhere
Also obligatory bagged milk (there are others, Canada
We don't translate those names in Estonian either
Åland Islands are awesome
It's quite easy to visit from Estonia, one just needs to hop off the Tallinn-Stockholm ferry during the night
They are a fantastic site for a bike trip - I did like a week long trip and visited over 60 islands
We have 2 or 3 pairs of bigger orange Fiskars scissors, honestly they seem to show up everywhere so I have no clue how many pairs we actually have
Not only English but pretty much the whole world
French - abricot
Spanish - albaricoque
Italian - albicocca
Russian - Абрикос (abrikos)
Swedish - aprikos
Estonian - aprikoos
Japanese - アプリコット (apurikotto)
Probably a wrap or some cheap [slimy burger]
Pretty much
*Lägaburger* or *lögaburger* ("slimy burger") is this cheap and simple style of hamburger usually made in the countryside and poorer suburb kiosks at night, when there's really nothing else open anymore
You know, in kiosks that have been there since mid 90s at least
It tastes fine if you're drunk, but it's really just cold cabbage salad with mayo in the middle of a burger with buns as soft as the belly you get after eating it
Do not forget to drink those four beers beforehand
I was searching for a photo and found this, so the comment seemed suiting
Nobody really advertises it under this name, it's just the colloquial name by Estonians for this burger
It goes by either *lägaburger* or *lögaburger* or sometimes *rotiburger* ("rat burger")
Abbreviations like *lägaburks*, *lögaburks* and *rotiburks* are also common
The slang word *roti-* ("rat") is used for whatever is cheap, gotten for free or flat out stolen, especially if it's of low quality
Must be the [Toompea Castle] in Tallinn, currently housing the Parliament of Estonia
I think the [Tallinn TV tower] Northern Europe's highest open viewing platform at 314 meters or 1,030
2 feet
I would say the most iconic building is the [Tallinn Town Hall] which is located at the heart of the old town
Toompea Castle is a good one, I'd also say Tallinn Town Hall (Raekoda), but only if we can include the Town Hall Square (Raekoja Plats) with it
i would agree, but tbf i only spent a day in prague anyways
Yep, although I'd say it's more like a symbol for Tallinn than for Estonia in general
Never liked raw meat and I am more of a cat person than dog person
Guess I am not a true European then, lol ))
Also, isn't raw meat dishes a big thing in Asian countries
I would like to note that illegally entering Chornobyl exclusion zone will get you a small fine of about 15 euros as well as deportation from Ukraine (usually followed by a ban to enter the country for 3 years)
* ?-1227 - though there wasn't really an unified Estonian state at the time, so not sure if that counts
* 1918-1940
* 1991-present
Hard to call this time free when the territory of Ukraine was divied between multiple factions waging war against each other
Estonia and Latvia, yeah
You guys had the Grand Duchy
Sorry but how do you even compare it with Riga
Even Helsinki is more similar to Riga than Tallinn
Tallinn is centered around a medieval walled old town which itself is rather picturesque but rest of the city was nothing more than a poor province for much of its history and it shows
Riga was historically the metropolis of the Baltics which is why it's still the biggest city and also looks way more cosmopolitan
Similarly to Helsinki, it has dense Art Nouveau quarters in the centre, something that Tallinn almost completely lacks
The Old Town is extremely overpriced, locals almost never eat/drink there
I suspect you spent your money there
not that special, but i once had a couple of asian tourists ask me where the stop for the tram number five was
there is no tram number five
i told them about other ways to get to their destination, but they didn't really want to believe that the trqm line doesn't exist
felt kinda bad for them tbh
i don't even know
i mean, i don't think i have ever been taught about fridges existing in other countries, i just kinda assumed they exist elsewhere too
astonishing how close-minded people can be
> Who is doing the police stuff in your countryside ?
Just regular police throughout the whole country
Military police is only reserved for small amount of tasks like escorting miltary convoys
The word "saks" in Estonian, meaning "noble or upper-class person", comes from the same root as "sakslane", the word for German, because Estonia was ruled by German nobles for several hundred years
The capital city "Tallinn" was named when Denmark used to rule Estonia
"Tallinn" sounds similar to "Taani linn", which means "Danish city"
Tartus old estonian nane was Tarbata and was related with taara who is one of the gods in the estonian pantheon
We really only have one good university: [University of Tartu] It’s a pretty nice university and part of the top 2% of universities worldwide
[Most of Estonia] *speaks* Standard Estonian already
The few dialectical areas that remain have rather distinct dialects usually too difficult to understand for Standard Estonian speakers, but they then switch to Standard Estonian as they all speak it as well, except for perhaps some very old people deep in the countryside
Some areas where Standard Estonian is spoken with different intention/accent, do not necessarily conform (islanders in particular), but they are easy enough to understand
Bottle deposit and recycling system
That you pay a small sum on every bottle bought and you need to return them to a recycling machine to get the money back
For a union that likes to pride itself on economic integration and environmental awareness, we've somehow just forgotten to make the best of such simple everyday problem
Why is every country building its own isolated system and how come not even all countries use it
If I buy a bottle from Finland, I should be able to return it in Estonia and get my deposit back
If the uneven rates are a problem, harmonize them
We forget that the bottles are at a higher risk of ending in nature if the deposit scheme malfunctions
That you have to own a reflector
Phone charger plugs
I would love to finally have single market
>use one EU-wide-system
I guess that's basically what [aghcsiz] wanted
We already have common border and currency systems that include majority of EU countries, that limits the powers of countries, so why not go with common car registration system
what do you mean savage land, organic waste brown and paper green is the only correct way
Varenyky, you make them with various fillings but regardless of what's inside it's iconic to eat them with either sourcream or some fried "salo"(pig fat aka reversed bacon) bits called "shkvarky"
I don’t think we have invented anything on our own, but we eat pelmenis and tortellinis and the like
Pelmeenid
Fun fact
Pelmeni were invented in udmurtia and it means ear bread in komi
Managing to buy your beer from the store before 10 PM when alcohol sale becomes prohibited
It's especially fun if you get to the store at 9:55 PM and there is a line
Can't drink more after you've run out
And if you run out, you're either shit at planning or have already had too much
So that drunk people couldn't buy more alcohol in the middle of drinking
Basically for closed container sale
Bars and restaurants have to open the container when they sell you alcohol after that time
Somewhere warm where there aren't so many creepy spiders or snakes

Very similar to the Finnish one, except the 3rd line is a bit different at the end
Another question on top of OP's, how do you start the game
In Estonia it's common to say in choir "kivi, paber, käärid, 1, 2, 3" (rock, paper, scissors, 1, 2, 3) before making your pick
We have the good old rock, paper, scissors (kivi, paber, käärid)
Although, me and my friends would sometimes invent new additions to make it more fun
For example, an eagle that would fly and grab the paper, but you could take it down with rocks or scissors
One Trump lackeys called us "suburb of st
Peterburg".
Famous French politician told  that "we missed perfect opportunity to shut the fuck up"
These people are very affected by external influences and probably would be less inclined to vote for the best interest of the country they live in
I'm young and i never lived in the regime
But heard about it from my grandpa
He lived next to a military airport in Tartu Estonia and he saw Russian pilots crashing their planes cuz they were drunk
Most of the building next to the airport had cracks in them because of all the vibration
But talking about the family, they didn't support the communist party thanks to that they didn't get a decent job and didn't get the permission to buy a car
Also if u had friends at the store they would put weiners under the counter for your family, that's because most of the shelfs were in empty
This stuff happened untill the collapse and some years after it
Nagu tina tuhka – like tin into ashes
Gone/lost forever
Well
most of Estonians know atleast some Russian so we're pretty okay in Russia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland
When going up, some kinda manage to get by in Finland but in Sweden we're screwed without English
To some extent I can get by in Finland
Besides Estonian I’m also fluent in English, German and Spanish so obviously I can also get by in these countries
Knowing German has also helped me a lot in the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark and Norway, I doubt though that I’d be able to get by simply by knowing German
I was just in Tallinn recently and was surprised how many signs/ads/etc there are in Finnish, especially near the port
I think, youd have a good chance on the islands as well
>Besides to countries that share your mother tongue (i.e. Germans in Austria)
Yea
Just drove from Estonia to Hannover Germany and back
It's really nice that u don't have to worry about hiding the drugs
Jokes aside it's pretty comfortable
Estonia joined Schengen in 2008, so there are still some remnants of border infrastructure
For example there's only 3 places where you can drive from Valga to Valka - where the checkpoints used to be
There's no actual infrastructure though, you just drive straight through
my granny lives near the border and casually goes grocery shopping in latvia
there's basically no checks, only the old border control buildings by the road, but they no longer work as border control and everyone just drives or walks by
or goes alcohol shopping in them
I have ended up in other countries without noticing
1752 Km(1082 miles) and on paper it says 17h 52min but I'm sure it took more
We slept in Riga and Poznan
Also there's a faster way to do this aswell with a car
You take a ferry to Sweden and from there to Germany
The cheapest fuel was i think in either Lithuania or Poland
The best roads were in Western Poland tbh
The most fun is when u get home and u can finally sleep
Well i actually had fun at the Agritechnica aswell (it's basically like a E3 for farming machines
The most horrible traffic was in Berlin downtown, their traffic system is so weird and doesn't seem coordinated at all
Thanks for this warm story
I hope u can still travel but maybe in the passenger seat
Oh we don't do any farming
We sell the equipment
My dad has a dealership here in Estonia
So he went to meet with the other salesmen and some important people to make some deals and talk about expanding the sales to other baltic countries
He's on his way to Phoenix Arizona to go to one company's 70th Birthday
Pc has some awesome artwork and my phone has a slightly nsfw picture of my gf
Never thought my little country would make anyones list haha
May I ask how we made the list ?
Well I'm glad to hear that =D
waffles
the flag, and then Brussels for the political importance
My Dutch friend telling me that they can't drive
Finland
I cant recall any jokes about finns
do u have any examples
i thought we mostly joke about russians and germans because of all the "estonian, german and russian
" jokes
and maybe latvians too because 6 toes and "s" at the end of every word
They usually are about how Finns are slow and dumb alcoholics
[Here are a ton of examples
Finnish is just drunken Estonian
Nice
ty, gonna have a nice night reading these
Never heard of that
Have fun
i think about 22 degrees is the norm here, but i have no idea what the tem is right now for me
maybe 23-24 since im sitting near the heater
How old are you now
Tartu, Estonia - often take long walks alone, including at night
Never had any threatening encounter
Fortunately violent crime against strangers is not a big concern here, the worst that might happen is some drunk students trying to start shit
depends on the area, but i personally have walked home from Tallinn city centre to a suburbian area (approximately a 1
5 hour walk
) at about 4 am to sober up from a party during summer, twice without any issues
i also frequently walk my dog alone late at night, but for that i keep to the suburban areas
i am a young adult woman
if i told my family they'd scold me though
idk i think its a lot about knowing the area and keeping to the bigger streets that have lighting
I live in 2 places, Peetri and Jüri
One is a more urban and the other is a more rural place
You can walk around at night casually in both places and nothing will happen
However, in places like Kohtla-Järve, you wouldn't even step outside in the evening
Same for me, feels very safe at night
Tallinn certainly has a reputation of danger in the smaller cities especially Lasnamäe, Kalamaja, Kopli and to a lesser degree Mustamäe.
oh def, i'd probably be much more cautious there
but city centre/old town, nõmme, kristiine, haabersti, maybe even pirita (idk dont have much experience there) are pretty safe in my opinion
and in mustamäe i feel relatively safe walking on main roads as well, because i am familiar with them
i think the sense of safety has a lot to do with how well you know the area, hence why i said it depends
I remember reading once in the news that on Midsummer's Eve in Poland over 20 people died in car crashes
Helsinki feels as safe your own neighbourhood in my experience
I'm sure fairly narrow rural roads with trees acting as barriers all around have something to do with it too
Biggest one is the peace treaty we signed here,
The finns also signed one here, tartu has also been destroyed multiple times over
See= this

Just be polite and respectful
And don't act offended if things in the country you're visiting work differently from your home country
That's really all what's needed
Eh In my personal opinion it's fine to be the "annoying tourist" here bc we only get like 2 tourists every week here in Estonia but eh depends on where you're going I guess
I'm starting to reconsider my decision to go to Germany
Example of flats for such price
Luxurious 120sq m flat in the center of Tallinn -[
Houses - literally 350sq m mansion with 6 bedrooms, sauna and garage
Basically for such price you can buy whatever the heck you want
And that's in Tallinn, most expensive city in Estonia
Even if we move slightly outside it the options are even better
For example 527sq m house -
A newish 200-300m^2 house in a suburb ([example] or a
100-year-old wooden apartment building ([example]
A 3-5 bedroom apartment in/close to city centre or a house a bit away from centre
You can get a 4 bedroom, 3 bathroom, big garden and 5994 m2 house for 400k.
Kremlin was a standard defensive structure for all Russian medieval towns
So they can be found in pretty much every big city in central Russia
Coming here
(Estonia)
It's not as beautiful as travel guides and other shit say
Tourist traps are tourist traps for a reason
There is something that is worth looking at
That's why I never avoid tourist traps
I visit those and then I make sure that I sleep and eat and have some fun outside of those
I never skip
Why I go Prague and never visit Karl bridge or that famous clock of theirs
When I went to Vienna I visited Schönbrunn Palace and that huge wheel they have, etc
Doesn't germany have the most beautiful old architecture
A racetrack
Looks pretty, has a great acquarium, 92 years of motor racing history, interesting palace
I've been there twice and I'd like to go again, too much of a shy kid the previous times
bats are called *nahkhiir* (leather/skin mouse)
we call dandelions butter flowers lol
That's a bit universal to every website unfortunately lol
The one at a street level is 1st floor, next one is 2nd floor
Basement can be both 0 and -1
This is one of the differences between UK and US English
In the US the first floor is at street level (i.e same as in Estonian)
And Estonia
We've got Lääne maakond - West county
And our largest island is literally named Island land (Saaremaa)
Everyone really likes to downplay everything
Honestly that stuff doesn't work all the time, electing Trump "was just gonna be fine", brexit "was gonna be fine" and so on
E:it's not going to be the end of the world is not a great argument for a shitty decision
I kinda hope the same but then again I thought the same thing when Trump was elected and when the brexit vote went through
I've kinda lost that optimism
Webpages really cant afford to adapt to every situation differently
If for example bigger countries implement it the hard way the websites will follow them and wont start making exceptions for smaller countries
Webpages don't have borders
Well, in this vote Farage did vote against it as well
I think he's talking about Farage in general
Not sure how true the claim is though
But it won't be up to the EU now to fine
It'll be up to the member states
at least i havent heard anyone ask for that/order than
Pros: Good education, modt people keep to themselves, cool parties
Cons: Extremely racist, sexist etc boomers around every corner
Reindeer meat sauce with potatoes I had once in Sweden was great, much better than our regular minced meat sauce
I wouldn't count on it thanks to utter incompetence every step of the way with vaccinations and stuff
Winter
Winter
Winter
You can be well off in your country but if you don't live in western Europe then traveling can be pretty difficult and I imagine that Estonia is pretty well off in that regard anyway
high tax, low wage
and bad weather
I’d say Pärnu
Tallinn and Harjumaa in general are thought of as arrogant urban people who have traded their “Estonianness” for success, while Tartu is thought of the city of intellectual bohemians
Everyone loves to sit on the beautiful beaches of Pärnu and spend a few summer-days there though
Maybe also the islands, especially Saaremaa
Yes, Pärnu or Haapsalu
Tallinn and Tartu generate too much negativity
Life goes on as regular as people are used to it
Heavy snowfall affects our daily lives a lot more, as does the melting period, when the streets are slippery
With extreme cold, cars do indeed start to fail, especially those produced for warmer markets
car doors can freeze shut so thats kind of fun
u have to get the car running and crank the heat up for a little so the locks warm up and hopefully start working again
luckily at least one of the doors has always opened
It depends on a lot of factors, wind especially
If you can switch hands often, it's not impossible to have a long conversation outside with no gloves on as you can warm your other hand in the pocket for a while
Also especially younger people often have [such gloves] for easier phone use
Personal projects generally in Estonian, at work whatever the standard is for the current project (usually English)
Almost all in English
Comments sometimes in Estonian, but rarely
English, despite pretty much every programming class I've taken teaching otherwise
In Estonia they are planning to open a bunch of Lidls and I’m not exactely happy about it
From my experience of Lidls in Austria they offer very cheap very low-quality food
While I lived in Austria there was an incident where they put horse meat in their lasagna for example
Their range of goods consited mainly of cheap off-brand products close to their date of expiry, often with packaging or other flaws
The whole atmosphere felt very cheap compared to other Austrian supermarket chains like Merkur or Billa
No, the only cheap supermarket chain we have is Maxima and it’s reaaally bad
Ofc they can
In fact most of my friends are girls
If it's casual, like a friend or family, I say "Jah
". Jah means yes
If it's formal, I say " \[Full name\] kuuleb
". Kuuleb means is hearing
For a long time I used to say "Jaa
" meaning yes because that's how my mom did it
Now I usually just say "Halloo
Estonia first became an independent country in 1918
Previously we had been ruled by various foreign powers since the 13th century; it is not known how exactly Estonians were organised before that as written records are sparse, but it was probably more like a number of loosely connected tribes than any sort of unified state
EDIT: also our independence day is February 24th, so Estonia is exactly 102 years old today
Founded 102 years ago today, restored independence on the 20th of August 1991
Estonia was declared independent in 1918, but "happily" joined the USSR in 1940
Then in 1991 Estonia declared itself independent for the second time
The point is that some argue that Estonia today isn't the same Estonia as it was before ww2
102yo as founded in 1918  its our independence day todayy
Before  1918, for many years (and i mean many) we were occupied by Russians, Germans etc and when not occupied, this land wasnt called Estonia
Yes
But I'm not really sure how effective it was
Yes
In Estonia we do learn to cook
We have a class that I believe starts in the fifth grade
In class we learn to cook, knit, sew, crochet, do embroidery and practice calligraphy
It’s for girls but for a year we switch with the boys and do woodwork instead
we had a cooking class/subject as part of the handicraft/home economics subject
It wasnt year round though
And we were about 12-16 when we had that subject
It was fun, but we had to be in teams and it could get kinda annoying sometimes, especially if you know a bit more about cooking than your teammates
Once every year
In Estonia this is actually a very controversial subject
In Estonia there are currently 72
000 stateless people (6% of the population), most of which are Russians
After Estonia split from the Soviet Union there were about 400
000 Russians living inside the borders of the now independent Estonian republic
The new law of citizenship stated, that only people who lived on the territory of the first Estonian Republic and their descendants are citizens of Estonia, everyone else has the possibility of naturalization which requires living in the territory of Estonia for at least 8 years and passing both an Estonian language and Estonian history exam
The only other option for the Estonian Russians was to apply for Russian citizenship, which would make their lifes in Estonia considerably harder though
And additionally with the [Estonian alien’s passport] you can travel visa-free to both Russia and the Schengen area, which is not possible with both the Russian or Estonian passport
In 2011 of the 470
000 Russians about 140
000 left for Russia in the 90s and of the about 320
000 remaining about 55% had Estonian citizenship, while about 25% have Russian citizenship and 20% are stateless
The Estonian center party (Keskerakond), which is currently the second largest party in Estonia wants to grant citizenship to all these people without the Estonian language and history exam
If you speak English then I really don't mind
A lot of people speak pretty decent English so you will almost never be in trouble for not knowing Estonian (you should still atleast try to learn though)
Also if you are going from outside to enter your  apartment  and hear your neighbors coming from behind on staircase - better hurry up and get to apartment first to avoid that awkward "hi".
~40min walk
20 minutes by bus
Very often at 18 and almost always between 18 and 25
I haven't seen Estonian really anywhere but i once saw a car with Estonian license plate in a small village in France
Also when my Dad went to the USA he was chatting with South African people and they said they have Estonian names there
Now I want to hear what those names are
That car with an Estonian plate was probably just someone on a road trip
I've seen Dutch, British, Czech, Austrian, etc plates here
Yeah true but when my family travels they like to rent a car
One name was Johannes(i know some other languages have Johannes aswell but apparently they write the name way that we do in Estonian)
I can't remember the other one
Yeah Johannes is quite a common male name here
It's a German name I believe, same root as John
You tell me
Yes but it's outside of Europe
That's what surprised me
Hey, stop
That's our line
Please don't throw things at me, fellow Swedes, but I would say the feeling is mutual
Hating the Danish is more of a running joke than anything genuine
Hell, sometimes Copenhagen feels like my second capital because of how close it is to where I live
Sorry, but you certainly can't find anything like [this] in your average European city
This level of neglect and decay is very shocking and unheard of even in the poorest parts of the EU
As a matter of fact I do
That's pretty cool, I've only ever heard "The Öresund Region" being mentioned in that context
Damn i thought i was the only one
Strauss is my favourite composer that's why i  watch it
I absolutely love buckwheat(tatar in Estonian) and its most commonly served with minced meat sauce here
Had those rarely in school lunches, always skipped them cause I hated it lol
> Balts
It's still present in Estonia
Called tatar here
Estonian name actually comes from the Tatars (people), because  buckwheat  came here from asian part of Russia
i had no idea it was from here
its not particularly popular, so i assumed we just havent really adopted it here
yeah, same here
my dad even gets annoyed if people step too far from the door with their shoes on
and by too far i mean like more than 1
5 meters lmao
I’m here cracking my brain - do we even have any original desserts
i have to say the name sounds exactly how it looks
i now craving honey cake at 2 am
mmm no, not with cheese
bread with just jam is a great cheap snack though
what kind of bread do you use
my mom introduced me to toast with cream cheese and strawberey jam, which is pretty damn delicious
apparently she found out about it when she was in germany in the 90s
There were sometimes high kings of ireland
You forgot Holodomor and mass deportations on cattle trains
We do have *jõuluõlu* in Estonian, which is very similar to danish julybryg
Another typical Estonian christmas drink is *glögi*.
Jõuluõlu here
It always suprises me how you guys are so similar in so many ways
Pretty sure, it’s the same
I live on the countryside alot of my friends houses have wood heating but people that have money usually go with ground heating since it's the most cost efficient way to heat your house
Well according to the [university metric] you clearly were doing something right :P
Though more seriously, in terms of advancing education in Estonia, I really gotta rep my man [B. G. Forselius] here
Don't get me wrong, the university was nice, but pretty much out of reach for peasants at the time
But that guy not only modernised teaching methods, initiated a spelling reform that brought written Estonian much more in line with the actual pronounciation, and started a seminary to educate Estonians to become schoolteachers, he also took two of his students to demonstrate their literacy before the Swedish king to prove that educating Estonians was worthwhile
In Estonian culture, this is considered a bro move
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Kamakura
I guess thats it
Former leader of the Interfront, lol
I'm sorry but Russians in Latvia are quite dumb to pick such a diehard Soviet as their representative
This means she's forever seen as an unloyal stagnant of the old guard whose voice will never matter in Latvia
She basically represents the last twitches of the dead empire
I don't know about any other people in my country but I do eat them
Yes, though we don't usually do it on a pan, many people have special sandwich maker  (mind you it's not a regular toaster), which allows to heat up sandwiches with filling
Jaan Anvelt i guess, he was a communist who was supported by the red army
In the capital (i.e Tallinn or Northern Estonia in general I guess) there's no word for "that" or "those". They just say "this there" and "these there".
Visiting Narva and Eastern-Estonia in general, it’s like a completely foreign country
Setomaa Estonia
It's a place in Southeastern Estonia
They speak seto dialect there , a normal Estonian can't understand that language at all
They even call it Seto country
They elect their own president
There's also Narva on the Northeastern Russian border where u can't get stuff done in Estonian because everyone speaks Russian
We call it Ministry of Defence aswell (Kaitseministeerium)
Even what we call our army (kaitsevägi) directly translates to “defence force”. We’re a peaceful bunch
I think fika is overrated
Just an excuse to be unhealthy with people you don't really like
Didn't think of that, but yes, it's a struggle
We actually have a saying for a similar situation: "hädas nagu mustlane mädas" - "in trouble like a gypsy in mud".
In estonian black person ia "neeger" but the pc term is "mustanahaline"
It‘s the norm here too
>not so much in other countries
Pretty much like that all over Eastern Europe
>I know that line cutting is going to happen
It's not about cutting the line
Chiming mid-line that is already formed is considered rude in Europe as well
However when new line is formed  it doesn't matter what order was in other line - it's a new line after all
Question for a Spanish person
Is it similar/the same in Spanish
I'm currently learning Spanish and this made me curious, since both a Frenchman and a Romanian agreed on it
> with sauna all over Europe staff will kick you out if not naked
Really
Never had such  experience (though I've never been in germanic countries where I heard they are pretty strict on that) but in other countries I never had problem with not being completely nude in sauna
Towel is fine imo
Btw, I am talking about public saunas, not at home
Obviously with family it's completely ok to go naked to sauna
But in public I am just not that ok being completely nude
*[The Singing Revolution] is an exceptionally good documentary about Estonia's recent history
In Estonia we pass around a human-like doll in december, called Tahma-Toomas
If the doll stays behind your door after the 21st of december, it shows that the family living in that house is lazy and sloppy
As most of the old traditions it's becoming a rarer sight by the year
From neighbour to neighbour
we watch that too, every new years eve
Konstatin Päts
Who
Allowed the Soviets to establish bases in the country to avoid bloodshed and confrontation, trusted the Soviets to not interfere in Estonian internal affairs
7 months later, a Soviet coup and occupation followed, tens of thousands being deported or perished during the 50-year occupation
A touchy subject, but by far the largest mistake in Estonian history
Then again, the question must be raised, whether there was any other possibility
The Finns opposed this plan and retained their independence, but whether the Baltics could've done the same
must be debated
Totally agree on this one, although obvious bias
Some of the plates getting alot of attention here are really complicated looking and not just because of the embellishments, but also just weirdly grouped and, at times, way too long combinations of numbers and letters, that don't seem intuitive at all
Seem like they would be a pain in the ass to remember, but i guess it depends
Let's see
There's no anime (besides Ghibli )/ manga avalible here
At least I don't know any stores that sell anything like that
Most of Netflix

A government that actually works
90 :)
Well there is something fishy when one party that has done some questionable things has been the most popular party longer then I have lived
We can't choose our president either, the government does that
Not super rare but most people don't have them
They're more common in the younger generations
In the past hyphenated names were more of a thing (eg
Anna-Liisa), but nowadays the hyphen is more often omitted
Quite uncommon, I'd say about 25% or so of my acquaintances have one
Even fewer use them
[The planned high-speed railway terminal in Tallinn
Hey, I'm from Estonia and here are top picks from me:
No, u/Prygikutt didn't say, but they've already scaled it down, although it looks essentially just as good
Yeah, I couldn't find the picture of the scaled down version but I've seen it
I would have posted it, but I couldn't find it either
Not very in-depth, but it was covered
In Estonia we skimmed it, not too much but we talked about it
I remember we covered something about it in class but I didn't listen so I can't remember what it was we talked about there
Well, here in Estonia it's obviously not a forgotten thing
Wouldn't say it was a massive topic in school history lessons, but it did have it's own part in textbooks
It's just well known overall due to being close to both Finland and Russia
There was something about it in 5th grade and something in 9th
Municipal police or mupo, we call them half police, because they check tickets on buses and trams and they act like they have the power but they can only give tickets
They think that they are police but no, hence the nickname of "half police" .
I remembered the time when they made fun about mexicans on Top Gear after reading that
Yeah, I never said mexicans are actually lazy people
Mexicans are some of the most hardworking folk out there
They contribute way more to the US economy than a lot of Americans will ever realise and that is sad
Hasn't it been shown that after a certain amount of worktime, the productivity significantly decreases and so, working yourself to death with overtime will not net you good value
Estonia has a rather logical approach
Dual citizenship is not allowed, but if you have birthright Estonian citizenship, then the state cannot take away your Estonian citizenship simply because you have another citizenship as well
In effect, dual citizenship is not allowed only for people, who have obtained Estonian citizenship through naturalization
I don't like the idea of somebody getting a citizenship while keeping the old one, simple
Most countries differentiate between birthright citizens and naturalized citizens in some way, especially in specific citizenship-related rules
Another country's citizen coming here and voting on stuff on the other hand absolutely would affect me
I just like to listen to angry Russians, other than that i don't like other languages
English and Dutch
Least favorite: Italian and French
I am usually called a shortened version of my name but from my dad I've gotten "Mees metsast" (man from the forest)
Despite my mom being Estonian she likes to call me Кабан(pronounced Kaban) a Russian word for a boar because I eat a lot and very fast
For a sec I though we were using Cyrillic here
Similar in Estonian - "in Bordeaux" would be *Bordeaux's*.
I think it's because of the language
Atleast that's what I've heard
We use a lot of double vowels which for some makes our language sound stretched out, like baby talk
I think it depends more on the rain, wind and sunshine than actual temp
And also if you're underslept and if you've eaten enough
But if I'd have to guess, then generally from about 17 degrees with "nicer" weather and low physical activity
But this is coming from an almost underweight tiny female
I actually have more problem with long-term slightly-too-cold than short-term very-cold-exposure
As in I can easily go and walk my dog for 10 minutes in my home clothes (like T-shirt+skirt) in winter with -10 Celsius, but if I am sitting still at the office and it's 17 degrees, I can get very very cold by the end of the day without my hoodie
My partner, on the other hand, wears shots basically all year, so there you go
I'd guess he's T-shirt ready a few degrees before me, once again depending on the other factors
Gotta love Scotland
We have the mythics like Kalevipoeg and Töll
Then Lembitu, who unified the estonian tribes to fought against the germans then we have Kuperjanov who was a partisan leader during the indepenedence war and laidoner who was a general then baisically every forest brother
[Blackcurrant] Was kind of shocked myself when I heard about this lol
>Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable
It's not like that over the whole Europe though
Here in Estonia it's illegal to drink in the streets (unless it's like an open terrace near bar)
You can be charged even for having an open bottle in your hands
We are not a Nordic country :(
Yandex has an alternative for pretty much every online service you could think of
And yandex taxi is actually available not only in Russia
It is pretty popular even here in Estonia
> can they force you to pay without beating you up
Social pressure
Many people will give in to not make up a scene, especially if the amout of money is small
As for "why not beat you up" - that is a very clear case of robbery with force, which can be reported to police
While in that scheme there is not much to report about
We are forced to learn russian
That's the main complaint
Sure, teatch us russian, but also do a better fucking job at teaching the russians inside Estonia how to speak estonian
The ENSV flag, cuz hammer and sickle
* USSR flag
* [Flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic
* Nazi Germany flag with swastika
* Nazi SS flag
* That nazi flag with iron cross
* [Flag of the Russian Saint George Ribbon]
* [Black and white celtic cross flag]
Probably missed some
There's plenty that make most people roll eyes or scoff if somebody waved these without irony or historical reasons
Same for Estonia

The hallway of axes
You would have about kids swinging and 1 or 2 kid(s) would have to run through
I stopped playing it when I for some reason froze while I was running and was hit
my dad taught me the palm slap game but i never really saw anyone my age play it
Blind chicken- basically it was hide&seek + catch mixed
hiders would have to avoid the seeker and the seeker was blindfolded
Oh and not on the ground because ground was basically off limits to hiders
So a bunch of kids, 1 with blindfold, would climb around an old iron structure
Idk how we didnt fall off
I did that a lot with my friends who I'll call A and B. I stopped playing it when a 35 year old grown ass man started chasing us
And luckily he only got A. B and me got away
But I'll always remember the moment when I was on the grass, unable to drive my scooter just to turn around and see the man 10 metres away from me
Läskit skotit homoilee
Russia because they've historically been a pain in the ass neighbor for all sorts of reasons, invading, genociding, deporting, looting, blocking trade etc
I guess we could get better along with them if they chose to switch to democracy and stop being a nuisance to everyone around them
China because we don't really want their money, influence and technology here due to CCP being a terrible institution
Same fix as mentioned above
Belarus too lately, because Baltic countries kind of formed an united bloc to contest the recent election results there
Yet again, same solution as mentioned above
Russia
They killed our people and colonized and stole the land of the estonians and our brother people

I’m sure this applies to every former soviet country
Frankly, swedes were colonialists, and colonized finland

I disagree with about everything our current government under prime minister Ratas does
no gas deals with germany/europe in general
Every time your Minister of Foreign Affairs opens his mouth, support for NATO inches a bit higher here
The thing is, it's already over 90%, so we're hitting limits on how much we dislike your country's foreign policy
It isn't a good one, it creates conflicts, allows no trust and no cooperation, and pushes your neighbours only further and further away
Just as it does in Estonian
The word was borrowed from Baltic languages into Estonian
I know Russia *tries* to use that tactic, but fortunately for us, the EU also has some kind of unified foreign policy and Germany is far from being the only decider on that front
And if you have four EU members throwing sticks to the spokes of cooperation with Russia all the time, the truth is, it will be difficult for the Kremlin to achieve anything meaningful
We have the power, for example, to forever veto visa freedom for Russians
And this is only from a perspective of other countries actually having the will to cooperate with Russia
In reality, Russia's approval ratings in Europe are abysmally low, with only a few exceptions (Greece, Bulgaria)
>I think conflict in Ukraine is more of a road block in Russia-German rapprochement
Sure, but I would put it under the wider problem of Russia's "fuck my neighbours" attitude
>But it’s rather naive to think that political elites in Poland and the Baltics would be able to indefinitely resist political pressure from major EU members, if one day they decided to change their Russian policy
Especially if UK really leaves the EU
They couldn't hold out as the last of the Mohicans, for sure, but they still have influence on the issue
Baltics in particular rarely voice opposition in the union, so when they do, it's not to be taken lightly
Besides, it's difficult to imagine a situation where Poland and Baltics are vehemently against while rest of the EU is in favour
>I’m pretty sure that Russia beneficial as an ally to Germany would also be beneficial to the Eastern Europeans as a neighbor
Russia as an ally of the EU would benefit us all, but these are just empty words
The question is not whether we would like to cooperate, any sane person would
The real question is what concessions are we willing to make for that goal
And the Russian strategy of ignoring the "irrelevant" players and playing directly with the big boys is also against the EU interests
There are plenty of small countries in the EU that would be against such attempts
Germany would face opposition from the European Commission if it tries to go solo (something that somewhat already happened with Nord Stream 2)
In Estonia private tuition is not really a thing
We have a rather good education system and even though some secondary schools are considered better than others (to get you into a good Uni) , the main reason behind it is just that some schools can collect a higher proportion of highly motivated pupils, rather than these schools having tremendously better teachers
The national minimum curriculum defined by the law is rather detailed and the books are usually quite the same between schools - there are simply not that much different coursebooks available as there are like only one million people who speak Estonian in the whole world
Crazy, right
Therefore, private tuition is usually only a thing if you are actually having trouble with a single subject (usually Maths / Physics / some language) - and in this case, the tutor is usually a just young Uni student who passed his secondary school with flying colours
In recent years, I have seen some prep-for-entrance exams courses, one was for an art school and one was for Medicine
Don't know about the Art prep, but the Medicine one was cheap, online, and mainly meant for those who had graduated a long time ago and wanted to refresh their memory and get some more up-to-date knowledge
Other than art schools, there are basically no entrance exams, but national high school graduation exam grades are used (you can choose some of the subjects and some are compulsory, but within the same subject, the exam papers are the same for everyone and take place at exactly the same time in every school)
Medicine asks for a national exam in Estonian and  in addition to this you need either national Maths exam or take an entrance exam in Biology or Chemistry
I think the reason behing re-introducing entrance exam in Medicine was the fact, that on some years, the national exams happen to be easier than on others and entrance exam gives more equal opportunity for all students, as some take a gap year etc
Medicine has really high competition and I bet they got some kids just applying every year, hoping to get in on a year that had harder exam than their own year was
I personally didn’t know anyone who doesn’t keep eggs in the fridge
Also all of the stores keep eggs on refrigerated shelves
I have an opinion: If something is sold in a fridge/cooler/refrigerator, it should be kept in the refrigerator at home to try to follow the same circumstances
So, yes, I store my eggs in the fridge
Huh, where else are you supposed to put them
Even if you can keep them at room temperature, fridge is just the most convenient place to store food (unless you have some special room or cellar for that)
We call it viht
Why the fuck would you eat nutella with butter
Ever since my trip to Russia and \~8500 km in a train all together (riding time \~6 full days, longest in one go was 39h), European distances seem
lame
We never felt the distances were too long, quite the opposite, in the end we wished there were more trains to take
As we often took night trains like from 7 pm to 8 am, we really didn't have too much time enjoy the scenery etc
Anything under **20h** ride is very close
Anything under **100h** is worth considering for sure
Up from that is for train freaks only (I might be becoming one of them)
Sadly, getting anywhere from Estonia by train is a hassle - you can't even buy a train ticket from Estonia to anywhere outside
But I've done it a bit as we have a border town with Latvia and they actually have made the schedules match, so you can take a train to Valga, then hop off and in the same tiny station hop on the Latvian trains and get to Riga
But to get to all these European connected railways, you have to repeat this trick 2-3 times I think
From Tallinn:
- Within mainland Estonia: train or bus
- Latvia: bus
- Estonian islands, Finland and Stockholm: ferry
- Everything else: flying
>goes to Russia, St Petersburg and I don't want to go to Russia
I recommend keeping an open mind
Train trips in Russia are awesome
Yes, Russia is not rich and yes, the living standards are different, but there is a lot to see (it is BIG) and it's not unsafe
Have a look at [Kamchatka] that is like Iceland on steroids or take a peek at the [buddhist temples] in Buryatia and beyond
People just think that all of Russia is like the sad towns they see in Hollywood movies where it represents "where the bad guys live". Tourism-wise, I find Russia cool
I just avoid talking about politics
Ever
Anywhere
Yeah, sometimes, but I guess that's included in the previously mentioned categories
Although in that case we would usually fly to Helsinki
If we use Riga for a connecting flight, then we usually fly, especially if you come from Northern Estonia
Otherwise Latvia is a bus territory, while Lithuania is already a bit too far for that to be comfortable
I've done the train journey to Latvia as well, but it's a hassle and definitely not worth it from Tallinn
From Tartu it's also like half a day's journey as the train schedule is not aligned on the border and you have to wait in Valga for a couple of hours
The quality of old Latvian trains isn't helping along either
Yeah, same here, over here the mentality of "Russia bad" was really strong (understandably) for like the first two decades after independence, so there is a generation who knows really little about Russia, other than it's poor and drunk
It has started to change a little, as kids actually actually get friends who have a Russian parent or watch some youtube travel stuff
"What a snappy retort," said Fred
Why so
Tallinn airport isn't that big due to Estonia's size and the proximity to two bigger and easily accessible airports - Helsinki and Riga, the latter especially for Southern Estonia
We might have our main lines covered from Tallinn, but for further destinations, we need to take connecting flights anyways, and sometimes it's not faster to change flights mid way, but to just go through Helsinki or Riga
>It has started to change a little
Lol, no it hasn't.
They are extremely short, you don't even get offered coffee, only a biscuit or a candy
But they save you a lot of time as going through both harbours and driving to Vantaa Airport would take up a lot of time - instead coming to the small Tallinn Airport extremely close to the city centre and flying to Helsinki is rather quick
Dunno, in university it seemed better in my time, but I have no kids going to school, so maybe this is just as bad in schools still
Nope, not a single bit of Russian, back to the 1600s my family in all lines has lived on the island
So if anything, then Swedish might be somewhere, but even that is unlikely
Yeah, in this case we mostly fly to Helsinki
of course
i think i learned at 4 or so years old with side wheels and for my 6th or 7th birthday i got a "big kids bike" without side wheels and with gears, that i started learning to ride right away
i like bicycling, and i bicycled a lot as a kid, but honestly im still not very good at switching gears unfortunately
idk man
city traffic is terrifying too, havent tried riding there yet, i usually ride on the sidewalks and go for longer trips into the forest or to these special rollerblading/bicycling roads
There are school trips to other countries in almost every European country, Are you sure you don‘t have any in Finland
In Estonia we usually visit Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia or sometimes the UK
I even know a class who went to Kazakhstan
Mostly the soviet era
Compound words are pretty fucked
Also groups of words like järgi/järele/järel are kinda the same but using them correctly is pretty tricky
I can't even tell the correct way right now
There are actually plenty troublesome rules, maybe my estonian is just very shit but I often find that it's too hard as a language
Damn, ours is 3

Was as low as 2
62/hr in 2016
Sure is, specialists with master's degrees don't get paid that much often here
Well London and Dublin are among the most notoriously expensive cities in Europe for housing
UK in general is very expensive on that front
Other places in the world with similar reputation include Sydney, Vancouver, Bay Area, Toronto, NYC
We do however pay 300+ euros for a two room apartment plus utilities(which can be over 150 during winter months) in Tartu
I was getting that minimum wage back then in 2016 and I would've been homeless without my parent's support
Living costs are comparable
No, because I can't afford it
Average wage is meaningless, a minority get paid that much
Tallinn in particular is really becoming Western-like in terms of costs for sure
Btw I reckon a big part of the reason why people drink less in Belgium is that you cannot afford to with these small beers that cost a lot, I think I ordered only one beer in total from a pub there because of it
Statistics do not agree
That said, I only found fairly crappy beer in stores for 2€ when I was in Flanders a few years ago
>the nation such a person resides in (in my example, Italy) to make the same sort of government pensions or financial assistance to the unemployed to non-citizen residents, even if they are EU citizens
That's totally wrong
I am not sure if EU does require that, but from my knowledge all (or almost all) EU countries will provide you government benefits (such as pension and unemployment payment) as long as you work there officially and pay taxes
It's even against the law to not provide you those if you pay taxes
I know a guy who lived and worked in several EU countries and he is eligible to collect the pension (based on how much he worked) from each of those countries when he retires
Generally I loved it as NYC is definitely a very unique setting
I'd love to live there for a short while, but of course not for any longer period as it would get a little depressing
There are many older style highrises in NYC that I liked, but some of the ones from especially the 1970s and 1980s felt like they are just a huge boring facade the first 10 floors or so
i think Frozen's translation to estonian is one of the clumsiest sounding ones i have ever heard
"Lumekuninganna ja igavene talv", which translates to "The Snow Queen and the Eternal Winter"
someone broke into my familys small house in the middle of nowhere and stole a really good husqvarna lawnmower and some winter tires
they literally smashed the window glass in enough that they could properly open the window, then got in, opened the door from the inside and carried all the good stuff out
we dont live there, visit rarely (once or twice a year at best) and mostly use it for storing stuff
so there's no heating or water or anything
Presumably via German influence, Estonian also talks of a mother tongue and fatherland
Unless it's a old building where windows haven't been changed these are the standard
Also as windows are the main things that get changed here due to better insulation it can actually be a bit tricky to find other "regular" windows
It's the most normal window there is
All other types are considerably less common
I'm in Estonia, and these are pretty much standard windows here
As an American expat, I was totally surprised and enthralled with them
Doors to balconies work the same way as well
Just as an aside, no windows here include screens (none that I have seen, anyway)
There just doesn't seem the need for them here in Estonia
most places have this type of windows, except for older houses with older windows
Aksually, guy keeps getting bigger and when I first watched him I thought he's American because of his accent lol
Not common with people you already know
I have really noticed it being very popular among russians
I go to a school that has a lot of russians and sometimes it's almost comedic seeing someone come to class and then proceed to shake hands with everyone
Well there's the South Estonian variants (Võru, Seto, Tartu, and Mulgi), though to what extent they count as different languages than just dialects is debatable
There was also [Estonian Swedish] though sadly that's pretty much extinct nowadays
Estonian and Russian are two commonly spoken languages as a matter of course
The third one should be either Finnish or English because of the increasing number of expats here
Well, besides russian there's a tiny minority of german speakers and sweadish speakers but the largest minority (excluding russian) is Võro dialect which it self divides into other dialects
Võro currently has 90k speakers here, võro sounds a bit like finnish actually
In Estonia we have only Estonian as a language but it has many accents
like a LOT
Its not classified as a language of its own but Seto, which is old Estonian spoken in south-eastern Estonia
Livonian too
tho the last native speaker died in the 90s.
They still teach it tho
They have youtube videos of it
Its closely related to Estonian
Belgrade because of the song "Balkan, Balkan, Balkan, ovo je Balkan, come on"
Well in Tallinn and tartu (the 2 biggest cities) if you're a resident of that city you have free public transport and to travel with the free public transport you have this green card that you put up to the card reader
If you aren't a resident then you will have to put money on the card and the ticket price will be taken off the card when you put it to the card reader
Does that make sense
Public transport is in most cases free in Estonia
You just hold your “Ühiskaart” against a chip reader to validate your free trip
Alternatively you can also load money on your Ühiskaart or just hold a debit or credit catd against the chip reade
I don't (transport is free in Tallinn)
1) prepaid stored value card which works on all buses in the country and can be topped up online or in many stores
2) season tickets that can be loaded to the same card, also available online or the same stores as the previous method
3) cash while boarding (most expensive)
4) contactless cards (only in Tartu and Tallinn)
Costs the same as a single ticket using the prepaid card
5) QR tickets, available online
Cost 1€ per ride, available in Tallinn and Tartu only
6) Android app that ties to your prepaid card and used NFC on your phone along with special SIM card
This is what I've been using
It really baffled me how they still use paper tickets in Vienna
If u are under 20 u can also get free transport in major cities
Even if u are not the resident of that region
Residents do not get free public transport in Tartu
I thought DfT was pushing mobile ticketing
In my opinion it's inferior, because QR codes take longer to scan and if your phone dies you're out of luck
Smart cards that work nationwide would be a much better solution
I might have remembered that wrong then I guess
You can’t. You can only swipe your Ühiskaart (public transport card) which everyone uses since only this way you get a free ride
I busses you can just pay the driver, you will recieve no ticket though
In trams you either have to use the Ühiskaart, your smartphone or swipe your debit card or credit card
They also have weekly/monthly/yearly/etc tickets, they’re still just a slip of paper though
From what I've seen QR codes still take 2-3 seconds at best, while NFC smart cards are nearly instantaneous
If you don’t qualify for a free ride and have to use the money loaded on your Ühiskaart, the machine will also print you a bill, for me this bill doesn’t really qualify as a ticket, since you don’t have to show it anywhere and if you happen to see a ticket inspector you can just show him the card which you used to pay for the ticket
This only applies to busses though
In trams you lack even this option
Oh, well that’s new
When I studied in Vienna I had a ‘Top Jugendticket’ which was valid for a year and it was just a slip of paper
maybe things have changed
In Estonia we used to say 'hernesupp' which means 'pea soup' but now we've taken a more international approach and say 'cheese' more
"Do you speak Russian
Or better yet, "Do you speak Russian or "Estonian"?"
When on TV, I don't remember who but some celebrity was asked where she is from
She answered Estonia
The interviewer not jokingly, but very seriously then asked her: **"Oh, Estonian is a dialect of Russian, right
"**
I'm fairly certain it's the second
I just go with the classic "La souris est en dessous de la table". Doesn't get much of a better reaction tbh
Haha, sometimes it's the other way round
I am Estonian Russian and once a Swiss person, after learning that I am from Estonia, started telling me how much he loved Tallinn and how it's different from Eastern Europe/Russia and how unpleasant Russian areas of Tallinn are (probably Lasnamägi)
It was a bit awkward explaining to him that is where essentially where I am from
I have gotten questions from people to check if I spoke Russian or Estonian (I speak both)
I didn't really find it offensive, I guess I don't really look Estonian (more southern Slav) so people were more likely to assume I am not an ethnic Estonian
The most frequent comment used to be ''kaksteist kuut' from Erasmus students
(Edit - from Russian Estonian to Estonian Russian
When I was around twelve me and my mom were walking around in Tenerife and there was a guy who started loudly singing" KIIIMI Räikkönen, Kimi RÄIKKÖNEN" TO ME
I first heard it watching clips of rally crashes
You could always tell in what general area the rally was from the sounds of the crowd, they either said kurwa, vittu, blyat, merde, merda, scheisse or oh fucken' 'ell
>Russian Estonian
There is no such thing
Why call yourself a nonexistent ethnicity if you're just a Russian, a well known ethnicity
>It was a bit awkward explaining to him that is where essentially where I am from
I know the story, I'm from Lasnamäe myself
I feel the same way about it as those tourists though, probably even worse
You're a Finn
In what universe are you living if you don't know that Estonian is a distinct language
It's as if they are wondering whether such a language exists and they are deriving the hypothetical language name from the country name
I think they ment Estonian Russian, i would consider it different enough from Russian Russian, as they speak Estonian and would be at least partially integrated into Estonian culture and day-to-day business, no idea why would you reject it
Also, no offense, but Lasnamäe is indeed sketchy as hell, but oh,well, at least it's not Kopli
Or everybody being gay there
Source:Finland
You call it council estate, we call it home
Estonian Russian makes more sense, but "Russian from Estonia" or "Russian of Estonia" is the term actually used in Estonia
No way should it be used as sort of a mixed or integrated group name
Actual mixed ethnicity of someone is usually said with a hyphen anyways
>Also, no offense, but Lasnamäe is indeed sketchy as hell, but oh,well, at least it's not Kopli
At least Kopli is getting better and fast
There are some major projects going on there and near and the entire peninsula, actually North Tallinn in general is gentrifying and Estonianizing rather quickly, with many Russians moving to Lasnamäe or other areas
But that's given to a Finn automatically, by hearing their accent
"Russians from Estonia" or "Russians of Estonia" are the perfectly acceptable, perfectly understandable and the actually used descriptions
if no potato no lifeo
Make vodka from grain then
Handball really
That's surprising, it's such a minor thing here it is barely mentioned in TV sportsnews let alone anywhere else
But they are in English
You can't drink at a football match
What a shame
That said I've never seen a proper match from a stadium so I wouldn't know how it is
I've been an F1 fan since 2002-2003 and I can't disagree unfortunately
There's a chance for a genuine title fight this year but frankly I'm not optimistic, Mercedes' rate of development is so large I expect them to start steamrolling completely again in a few months if not already starting this week at Catalunya where I expect them to dominate
Any people putting stuff like cider in their soft drink bottles, mixing vodka or rum with coca cola or any other shenanigans like that
Eat potato, no more no less
Heck yeah videogames and booze
And Estonia would probably sit next to Finland
What if i like pasta
Hey hey hey we'd be more on the quiet side
Unless we and Finland get wasted together
Potato
I guess we'll go with  Latvia and Lithuania
Most of it
I went to school in Soviet Union and what we were taught during history classes was quite bad
Better for older time periods, but even then it was more of the propaganda then real history
As revolution of the working class
Estonian Republic was vilified a lot
Of course we actually had old history books still circulating
A British comedy TV series "Yes, Minister" / "Yes, Prime Minister" assuming the quality of the humour remains it would be hilarious
That we have WiFi in forests
Mostly shared by other Estonians whenever the topic is IT
“Skype is an Estonian invention/idea/thing”
Well yeah, there were 3 Estonian guys working on the source code, but the company was established by Swedish/Danish guys
Mobile data isn't the same as WiFi
You need a licence to buy a gun and another licence to use it
For those you need to pass a medical exam, get first aid training and pay the fees
I don't know the statistics, but I'm pretty sure the guidelines are quite strict
After all, I haven't really heard of a machine gun shooting in the news
Or of any shooting for that matter
Quite popular
I myself have been sent to science camp 3 times
I mean we were thaught a bit but it changes so much and honestly the actual part of "doing" taxes doesn't even exist here like it does in the states
The death penalty was completely abolished in Estonia in 1998, in order to comply with the European Union laws
The last execution took place in 1991 when a murderer was executed by a firing squad
I think 1x a day is the most usual one here as well, but most people wash their hair less often, like every 2nd or 3rd day
Now with covid restrictions, I bet everyone washes less
I used to shower every other day (I basically don't sweat), but as my bathroom is in renovation it's more like every 4-5 days now, as it's a big hassle
Some old people just go to sauna once a a week, but I think they usually have a mid-week tiny-wash as well
I've never heard of anyone do that
Sounds like a good idea though
I use a pizza cutter
Well, we usually like to joke about the islanders and their petty in-fighting between the different islands
>and the fact that if you looknat the map and picture Finland being a maiden, Turku is in the spot of the asshole region
Most pictures of the Finnish Maiden show Turku at her skirt though
Tallinn is the capital city, Tartu is the cultural capital and Pärnu is the summer capital
Kaunas is a city in a naturally beautiful valley that looks like is still in the 90s. Or rather it at least looked exactly like 9 years ago when I was there last
Well Narva is bigger than Pärnu, but because it's mostly populated by Russians, then obviously Pärnu feels bigger in our national consciousness
> I still shudder at the price of a pint down there
I remember getting some fish and chips and a pint in a pub fairly close to Trafalgar square and realizing that I worked three hours earlier in the year to pay for that
Ludicrous
So from that point on if I got any beer it was either from a supermarket or the cheapest beer I could find at the hostel pub (with a discount) which was Fosters
It tasted like sweat
Based of what I've seen Aberdeen is the grey-est city in the entire world
Haha the tour guy used that line too, quite like Antwerpen though, central area at least
Well, true
Pärnu is the third biggest Estonian city
At this point in history Narva is just a town which happens to be in the same country
Tartu though is a big small town in the way it feels to live in for sure
Tartu definitely punches above its weight
It has an important university, one ministry, the Supreme Court and several scientific institutions
Like Pärnu which by area is larger than New York City now for the same reason
> It's a very small risk that everyone has to be *willing* to take in order to leave in a safer society
"Willing" implies that there's a choice
That's the opposite of "mandatory". I would argue that the system in Sweden is one where almost everyone is willing to take the risk to have a safer society and it seems to be working well
For the most part, no, except for Russian monarchs whose names are usually written as the Estonian equivalent when one exists, instead of a direct transliteration (eg
Katariina instead of Jekaterina)
But the Elizabeths, Louis's, Felipes, etc generally stay in their original form
Hehe knugen :')
Metsatöll - Küü
Metsatöll - Oma Laulu Ei Leia Ma Üles
Metsatöll - Vaid Vaprust
All of these are great but i like especially this one
This is pretty amazing too, but honestly most of Metsatöll's songs are great
Stalin
I'm addicted to building unbelievably expensive custom castles (yeeeeeeaaahhhh)
Aitäh sulle (singular)
Aitäh teile/Teile (plural/formal)
"Thanks" is "aitäh" or "tänud". The latter exists as verb "tänama" and it is conjugated pretty same way as in finnish (tänan, tänad, tänab, täname, tänate, tänavad)
And then you can also use "ole/olge tänatud" (be thanked) to thank one or multiple persons
The n word
Pretty common, though not among 50+ year old businessmen or similar
Most popular among teens and young adults and metalheads of all ages, also among hippies and in art/culture scene
For Estonia, probably anything by Nublu or Tommy Cash
Our reputation in the music industry is probably that we're pretty big into every kind of drug out there
We were in a weird situation, because at first came the Soviet occupation who deported over 10 000 people in 1941
Those people were the ones who were active in military, who were public activists, politicians, businessmen and so on
Then came the Nazi occupation, they oppressed the people who previously collaborated with the Soviets
Then in 1944 Soviets occupied us again and they oppressed the people who, due to previous Soviet oppression, collaborated with the Nazis
The Soviets just made those people disappear without really categorising people who took part in the Holocaust, who fought for them or who were just forced to collaborate
The Soviet society didn't even recognise Holocaust as a separate event - It was all a "crime against the Soviet people".
We had our own ss division
And although nazis were bad I'd say they were better for us than the Soviet Union
They weren't really punished as most retreated to the forests or deserted
estonian for example
Yes
Sober people also sing at day time when dance and song celebration takes place
The singing revolution
On the 23rd of August in 1989, a 670-kilometre human chain composing of 2 million people was formed from Tallinn, to Riga, to Vilnius
People sang forbidden and patriotic songs and held hands to protest against the Soviet government
War of independence right after WW1
Won a war against Russia, defended our lands from Germans, and established first independent Estonian governance since the 13th century
Built up a democratic state
Unfortunately all lost thanks to two mustached angry cunts
Well, the Baltic Chain was part of the revolution era, but not really part of the "Singing" revolution and I'd say it wasn't the most pivotal moment during that era
But besides the Singing Revolution, it could be that it was the 1st song festival in 1869, if we are talking about forming the national identity altogether, as it was during the Estonian National Awakening
Slavery was also historical event that had enormous impact
Even today Estonians consider "working to death" as proper way to live
Especially older generations
Yes, but you can hardly count centuries of serfdom as "an event".
Yes, it is hard to call it event
And still it defines so much of our national identity
herring on rye bread with green onions
DIS-GUS-TANG
not sure if it’s truly a national dish, but everything about it is awful to me
The most impressive ones in Estonia:
- Estonian National Museum (Tartu)
- Estonian Maritime Museum at the Seaplane Harbour (Tallinn)
- Estonian Open Air Museum (Tallinn)
- Kumu Art Museum (Tallinn)
Don't forget Museum of Occupations
There was recently [a film] about the same concept
I loved the Imperial War Museum, the National History Museum though I got completely lost in
I had to leave a bit early because I had other plans and it took me at least 15 minutes to find an exit
The use of signs was so poor I felt like I was in Italy
Yep, it's organized by the Estonian emigre community there
The managers are all members of the same student organizations that are active in Estonia as well, most of them having chapters in Toronto
I actually know a few of them personally
And Toronto used to host the biggest Estonian community abroad from about 1960 to about 2000 when Helsinki took over
Not to flex or anything but we got 1 in Tallinn our capital and no more
KFC "just" came to Estonia and there was a lot of hype around them, huge opening lines etc
Now it's just another fast food joint and it's down to preference
It's mostly down to location
A kfc opened up in my city, and the wait time there was and entire hour for a day, not as long anymore
Bro u wrong I went to tartu a few weeks ago and there was one by the Lõunakeskus, packed to the brim too
Ülemiste and Kristiine keskus makes it two I know about
Feels bad man
Atleast you have a reason to come here now except to buy cheap alcohol so that's an improvement
Wait what another one
4 now
Yeah bro check google maps
Yo there's 4 now 2 Tallinn 1 Tartu 1 Narva
If you don't cook, you don't eat, if you don't eat you die
Regardless of your desires and skill you will be made to learn how to cook by necessity or die in the first months of university as you left your parents
I really struggled with it until I realised that I don't wear dress shirts so I have literally no reason to iron, only did it because my mother irons everything, completely useless if you ask me
I still think we often consider each other neighbours
Whenever we have comparisons about how 'the neighbours' are doing, Lithuania is always there
I the capital, you have traffic jams and commute that takes more than 20m. Higher salaries, higher living costs and all these typical things
But as we are a small country, I think the main difference is that you don't know so many people personally, and therefore it is more difficult to organize many things
In a small town, stuff is often easier or cheaper because your friends mother owns the place you want to rent and your other friends uncle works at that catering you want to order foods from and the theatre director is your friends older brother etc, everybody knows someone who knows someone
We don't really have major drug dealers
[Our police mostly just attacks kids for having a spliff
Even I've heard of him, saw stuff about him on some Netflix show
Most likely the territories that were heavily Russified during the Soviet occupation
Bring foreigners in and give them expectations that they are now glorious colonizers, then they will seek back to their glorious motherland after the colonization ends
Saaremaa 100%, people there have always had a problem with authority and by that I mean they had a tendency to rebel and kill all occupiers
They were basically Vikings in the early to mid middle ages
We have purple
Blue is pretty common too
Sometimes you'll see black aswell
Here, up to around 4 or 5 or so, parents stay at the party
It would be unreasonable to think the parents of the birthday kid can manage to take care of all the other kids as well as their own
same here, except when it's a toddler party or something, when you kind of need a parent for each kid because otherwise it would be very chaotic
usually the parent just takes their kid to the party and later picks them up again
I think we had precisely 1 lesson in a book in 7th-8th grade dedicated to dialect words from different parts of the country and the fact that shouldn't use them unless it's an informal conversation
Ukrainian dialects have been largely homogenised over the last century with only a few odd words surviving in the areas outside of the west ukraine
West Ukraine on the other hand, as it has the Carpathians, is still a home to a few "highlander dialects like Lemko/Boyko/Hutsul etc
which differ greatly from the modern literally ukrainian, they sound quite similar to what everyone talked like in early 20th century before the language was standardised again under Russian bias in 1930s.
I love every kind of fish sandwich
Favorite is kiluleib
Looking at the most common route, taking a train for \~200km is \~10€ if you buy full price and \~7
50 for a student
It is relatively inexpensive
Buses can be both cheaper and more expensive for the same distance, depending on the carrier, the time of the day and also on how comfy and how quick it is
Yes, bicycles are basically allowed on all trains, the warning just shows where it's not recommended due to a bigger amount of passengers etc, but afaik you can take a bike on any train, they all have the holders etc
But I didn't know they'd be regarded as fast tbh
They are fast enough for me, but not especially high-speed, that 200km with a few stops takes 2h.
In few years when Tallinn-Tartu rail is electrified and Elron buys more electric trains it will be cut to around 1h 30min
The point is that it's not like cities/towns of our size have faster trains operating between them anywhere in Europe
We can see high speed trains, but they operate between far bigger cities
Yeah, for any foreigners to know, the "cities" we connect over here are like 440 000 people and 95 000 people - and that's for the biggest two, the rest have less than 55 000 people
The Ministry of Education is in Tartu, just about everything else is in Tallinn
Tõde ja õigus (Truth and Justice)
It's about a guy who bought some farm land to raise his family on, but the soil turns out to be total crap, his wife dies, and he keeps getting into fights with his neighbour
They recently made a film adaption of it, which is actually quite good
Always imagined Germans as those orderly people who follow the rules, EXCEPT reality differs
When I was in Germany,in every city i've been to, German pedestrians don't follow the traffic code at all,they don't wait for the green light,they cross the street wherever they like it and I'm honestly surprised i didn't see any car accidents during my stay in the country
I am really happy with our disposable income atm
Granted, we are a couple with no kids, getting 30 any day now and both have a Masters degree, so atm we are well off
Bought an apartment a few years ago, slowly planning on getting a house in a few years, my s.o. is interested in economy and money, so pretty active with investment stuff by now and also gives me advice on that matter
I do feel that we have achieved a lot considering that we both come from really poor families, like parents earning about minimum wage and nobody else in our immediate families had a Uni degree etc - so we have not had an easy start, no mommies getting us a job or networking for us, but the good education system and social system **really** help out a lot if you're smart and/or hardworking
In estonia its low and getting lower, personally
I dont have any pocket money since my parents rarely give me any (im 16) . I dont even have a credit card
>Europeans have a lot less incentive to save and invest than Americans
That is not entirely true
We don't have same pressure as in America, but saving and investing is still very important, especially if you plan to buy property
Also, pretty ironic to hear that from swede, when 75% of adult swedes invest in funds
>Afaik it includes work related pension plans
No, that figure specifically included only investments outside mandatory pension plans
>Few people actually save up to buy
I didn't mean saving to buy as in save 100% of house value(obviously very few people do that, though even I personally know some who did so), however even for mortgage you need to save up 10-20% downpayment
I don't think he was talking about median wages, but rather about above average wages
100k+ wages for top specialists pretty much don't exist in Europe
Average return on market over last 20 years is 10%. It's higher than average inflation (which is around 2-4%)
Over time with compound interest investing is smartest choice
At the very least you're not losing your money to inflation, realistically you're growing it
Even without any additional contributions money invested now after 10 years will grow in real value two times
>So your investment 10 years ago at best would not have decreased
I mean, it's much better than losing half of that saved money value to inflation if this money would be just staying on bank account
As an Estonian
perkele
Pfft hard to tell really, probably the national station ETV as it has lost the least viewers in the past decade, young folk don't really watch TV anymore, certainly not live
ETV (Eesti Televisioon; Estonian Television)
Main TV channel of the Eesti Rahvusringhääling (Estonian National Public Broadcasting)
Number 1 is ETV(Estonian Television) and 2 is ETV2
Both are state funded Channels that are free for everyone and don't have ads
People don't watch tv much anymore and commercial channels have lost huge amout of viewers while ETV has lost the least
Does not matter - all channels are losing but ETV is still so much more popular that it is not even funny
Weekly 10 most popular shows are usually all from ETV
We can create words that just go on forever
Jäääär (jää+äär) -  the edge of ice, kuuuurija (kuu+uurija) - observer of the moon or my favorite -  "kuuliteetunneliluuk" (kuuli+tee+tunneli+luuk) or in (somehow) translation - the hatch for the path for the bullet
Fun fact, that word is the same no matter what way you read it
Ah, a fellow Finno-Ugric language, we know the feeling
You wanted to mess with outsiders learning your language so much, you screwed yourself
You wrote it slightly wrong, forgot 'lennu'. So it would actually be "Kuulilennuteetunneliluuk" (Kuuli+lennu+tee+tunneli+luuk)
The translation is slightly wrong but I might just be nitpicky now
I'd translate it as, "The hatch for the tunnel that the bullet is flying in
The direct translation word for word would be, "Bullet flight path tunnel hatch
This isn't really a word, moreso that it's a quirk of stitching words together
But it's fun either way
Damn, I forgot the lennu, thanks for the correction
But yea, its just absurd and funny haha
We also spell it "idee" =D  plural is "ideed"
Most people seem to think estonia has wifi everywhere and even the woods
not true at all
Eh, in most places it's just free (taxes), in Estonia primary school was free and in high school it was like an euro a day
>you would have to pay for it
Here in Estonia until 10th grade food in school is free (well, "payed by taxes", but free on the spot for kids)
I havent seen them, or you were talking about me
No, at least as far as I know
I dont think it is
A lot of people eat while walking
" In every port around the world, you will find at least to estonians " ( it went on about gathering news or something but anyway
) this is kinda bitter-sweet for me
On the one hand estonians are around the world and wherever I go I can find them but also that indicates a brain drain, people leave and don't do good work in Estonia
uhhh Kerli from the pop scene maybe
she has her own songs, but she also wrote "Skyscraper" for demi lovato
and Arvo Pärt from the classical music genre
No one really
The only one who has *some* fame in some circles is [Arvo Pärt] I.e classical music
He's (supposedly) the most performed living composer in the world
Example:  (this specific song has been used in quite a few movies)
No Contact
That's sad
Estonians really keep to themselves, you can say hi and bye to the bus driver but just passing someone, no
You thank the bus driver in Estonia only on intercity buses, but that's mainly because you often leave from the front door or the driver will have to give you your luggage
no way omg that sounds horrifying
i do that when i walk past someone i know (if they also notice me), but not to strangers
I see what you did there
I like to hear Spanish, they seem to speak with a lot of emotion and really quick from time to time
Also Finnish, because it sounds beautiful
Any German, Russian, Swedish, Danish, Polish political ruler in the past 800 years
Hmm, long list
Not much bad, actually, just the same as most others did
You held southern Estonia for about 60-70 years
But I imagine there was quite the animosity towards any foreign rule - you owned the area at a time where the Estonians were split between three countries, known (creatively) as the Three Kings' Era
You may have not but it absolutely happens, particularly online, there are friends with whom up to 80% of communication is in English
I have to agree with you, when I was a wee lad so around 15 years ago our language was far less affected by English than it is now
>  If you learnt everything in a junior cert Irish textbook you would be very close to fluent and be quickly able to become very fluent
But you see almost nobody learns to speak a language in school, this applies to every language
There are these bastards here too who just refuse to use Estonian even though they can actually speak it rather well
Forest brothers
They were guerillas who lived in the forest
2009
Now is the best time for Estonia, but 2009 because I would get in on Bitcoin on the ground floor and bet on major events I remember
Lets see
10 years ago we had financial crisis, in 90s we transitioned from socialism to capitalism and were overall quite poor, 30 years ago we were under soviet rule, before that ww2 and nazi occupation, in 30s under local authoritarian "strong man", in 1900s-1920s - revolutions, ww1, part of russian civil war, recovering from war
Earlier - under Russian, Swedish, German, Danish, Polish rule
I think I will stick to current day
One party hovering close to 50% in polls alone is a very dangerous sign in a democracy, especially in a country where there's no dual-party system
>There's no way extremist or heavily populist politicians can have a large hand in determining policy even if they receive more votes than usual in an election
We're currently experimenting with that in Estonia, and unfortunately, the loud ranters continue to dominate over the other coalition partners
It has stopped the populist party's surge in polls because they actually have to govern the country, but my god, what a shit job they are doing and their ratings are not falling
So it's a so-so result
Half of a store, its a tiny version and a place to pick up stuff from there Web-store
We all agree that we are in the baltic, the rest is opinion, so heres mine
We arent nordic, we share nothing with them except the finns, we more or less belong to the eastern european region
Latvia and Lithuania are brothers (and Estonia and Finland are brothers) but Latvia and Estonia have been roommates for quite a while
Sharing a lot of history and even territory (Livonia)
Rocks
don't tell the italians
The only puzzling thing is the red area to the right (with the red backing and plastic/aluminum chairs - all the other chairs are quite fancy wooden ones)
[Mu isamaa on minu arm] was seen as the unofficial anthem when singing our real anthem was forbidden during the Soviet occupation
[Ta lendab mesipuu poole] and [Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään] are also very iconic
Tbh it's hard to pick just a few, we have a lot of well known patriotic songs
Mu isamaa on minu arm (my homeland is my love)
It was often sang as a protest to soviet rule and it was considered to be made the official anthem in the 90s.
"Eestlane olen ja eestlaseks jään"
The one from the life of Brian
Next thing you are going to tell me that the Ministry of Silly Walks actually exists
How did you manage to forget Koit by Tõnis Mägi
would also add "Isamaa ilu hoieldes", though it's a bit more modern
latvia and lithuania are basically the same
'Almost similar' is a very subjective thing
I’d say Estonia and Finland, Russia and Belarus, Germany and Austria, Latvia and Lithuania, Serbia and Montenegro, Kosovo and Albania, Greece and (Southern) Cyprus, Portugal and Spain, UK and Ireland
Quite many are different in Estonian:
- 1 (H) - Vesinik
- 6 (C) - Süsinik
- 7 (N) - Lämmastik
- 8 (O) - Hapnik
- 14 (Si) - Räni
- 16 (S) - Väävel
- 26 (Fe) - Raud
- 29 (Cu) - Vask
- 47 (Ag) - Hõbe
- 50 (Sn) - Tina
- 51 (Sb) - Antimon
- 79 (Au) - Kuld
- 80 (Hg) - Elavhõbe
- 82 (Pb) - Plii
- 83 (Bi) - Vismut
Then there are many others that includes letters that are not represented in the Estonian name, but are still somewhat logical, for example they might have K, H or Ts instead of C, F instead of P, Ts instead of Z, I instead of J, Ks instead of X, Ü instead of Y, V instead of W, or for example Rhodium (Rh) is Roodium and Thorium (Th) is Toorium
They are horrible in English, I am doing my current degree in English and the only thing that annoys me is the constant translating of element names in my head, it's not automatic yet
It makes so much more sense for Na to be Naatrium (in Estonian) than sodium (???) etc
We have same thing in Ukrainian:
Hydrogen - Voden' (Water-thing)
Carbon - Vuhlets' (Coal-thing)
Oxygen - Kysen' (Sour-thing)
Parts of Northeastern Estonia went through massive Russification during the Soviet occupation, so nowadays the situation looks like [this] Their youth definitely still speaks Russian
And although many younger Russians in Northern Estonia are more integrated nowadays, the ones in Northeastern Estonia are often poorly integrated and don't speak Estonian well
Well, there are many dialects but they all pretty much fall into 2 categories: South and North Estonian
North Estonian is the standard
South Estonian is so weird and I think I understand Finnish better than South Estonian
"Tee tööd ja näe vaeva siis tuleb armastus" (Do work then love will come) from A.H.Tammsaare
It's often said, altough it's quite interesting as the direct quote seems to have a meaning that hard work will pay off and not to give up
However everyone who has actually read the book and isn't too ignorant (not everyone) knows that in the book the love didn't come and the whole working to death basically was the tragedy of the novel
E: also from ex-president Lennart Meri "the situation is shit, but it's the fertilizer of our future"
"Work hard and love will follow" A.H. Tammsaare from  "Truth and Justice"
We will not qualify like always
Couldn’t care less though
Because it was the biggest city and generally already considered the main city of estonia
Some country side bus lines are free for everyone
Go to Tartu instead of Tallinn though
Its better

I feel like Spain should allow a free and well-organized referendum (maybe with a 60% or 2/3 threshold for independence)
I’m pretty sure such a referendum would fail and the whole legitimacy problem would be solved

Impossible now I think
First thing I read about Rinne’s goverment was - they are gonna raise social spending
oh, ok, how the f did that turnaround just happen
I agree my initial phrase was based on emotion
But europe needs less left wing and more right wing touch at the moment in my opinion
well, my problem is - too many social liberals and too less economy ones
Portugal and Italy definately need their own Macron to cut spending and state sector
Liberals in american sense are socialists (SDP) in Europe I guess
And many green parties also fall into that category
It is argued that europe’s problem is too much socialism, the economy is not sustainable like this

True, just a few weeks ago there was a game of Jeopardy in Estonia, with so-called "wise-man round", all previous champions etc
Usually they got like 90-95% questions right
Then there was the Albania round
0 out of 5
Complete and utter lack of any knowledge about Albania
Damn, Russias getting all of it
We here in Estonia don't get any of it sadly
Snowing in communism
you're a pretty great lad yourself
Having not to pay 25% tax on something is a subsidy, you don't get money back, but
you have to pay less, so, a subsidy, that costs money to the state
What do they want the governments to do exactly
“Change the world” is a really vague slogan
Kids don’t understand that these changes have consequences that they don’t have to deal with yet
Going renewable means your expenses go higher
Raising petrol prices or instituting a car tax will raise your expenses
We saw how people react to these changes in France
Everyone wants a magic fairy to save the world but no one has any real solutions
That’s why no one takes these kids seriously
Estonians can be identified by their handsomeness
The Estonian in the sketch also is very similar to the common look in Estonia at the time
Like [here] a famous singer after the war
Yea for me the estonian looks the most familiar and also the latvian is pretty good
Many estonian criminals must've not gotten caught because of this tiny inaccuracy
>*extermally* mixed
Bloody hell, that sounds ominous
Few
For example forest brothers killed hundreds of Soviet soldiers
I mean Soviets didn't like it so I think it counts as a crime
I'm not sure tho
It's way too gradual to make such bold conclusions, but Estonians have intermixed a lot with Germans and Balts, while Finns have a stronger genetic drift
Estonians are still the most closely genetically related to them, but more distantly than say Latvians are to Estonians
Yeah we may be similar to Finns in language/culture, but our looks are quite distinctly different
We can usually tell if someone is a Finn or not
That one is a bloody good anecdote though
Erm, you are mixing up terms
These are ethno-linguistic groups, so these ethnicities are defined by language
Estonians and Finns are the related ethnicities and Latvians and Lithuanians are the other related ethnicities with the two groups not being related
Their genetic relations are far more complex of course
No, you still don't get it
These ethno-linguistic groups still are ethnically related while Finns and Estonians are not ethnically related to Latvians and Lithuanians, while their genetic relation might be more complex
You are making it look like Estonians and Latvians are ethnically related, which they are not, regardless of any genetic similarities
Of course they are entirely different things
Depends what kind of research
If they do genetic research, then they go into genetics, but if they do any kind of linguistic or cultural research, then they go into linguistics and culture
Most ethnic groups in Europe identify themselves by language - essentially nobody identifies by common genetics
I think you might be missing something in your understanding of basic concepts
Estonians, Dutch people, Latvians, Greeks, Finns - they are all ethnic groups, specifically ethno-linguistic groups, who all have their own cultures
Americans on the other hand are not an ethnicity, they are a nationality - in Europe these are mostly interchangeable as most European states are based on a single ethnicity where other ethnic groups are in a minority
That's why you can be an Estonian in the Netherlands without being a Dutch, but while you can be an Italian in the US and an American by nationality, you won't be an American by ethnicity
Of course with the US and with the New World in general it can be even more nuanced as most Italian Americans are Anglicized peoples and speak American English as their native language and they have retained varying levels of Italian culture
I am not saying any of that, you just seem to have a very weirdly unknowledgeable understanding of what an ethnicity is
It's a sense of common group belonging, either due to common language (ethno-linguistic group), common religion (ethno-religious group), common regional identity (ethno-regional group) etc
Common background is a key aspect of them indeed, but it's not about some ethnic purity, but about common background, i.e. common linguistic or religious or whatever roots
>then parts of the countries are per definition ethnically related
Other than people of mixed families - no, they are not ethnically related peoples
Estonians are a subgroup of Uralic people and Latvians a subgroup of Indo-Europeans
Uralic people and Indo-Europeans are not ethnically related
Germanic people and Balts are ethnically related because both of them are subgroups of Indo-Europeans - this is why Dutch people and Latvians are ethnically related, but neither of them are ethnically related to Estonians
Yet genetically Latvians are much more closer to Estonians than to Dutch people due to millennia of living next to each other
But these are two very different concepts

I mean Poland is making abortions illegal even when woman is raped, so I'm pretty sure that unfortunately same sex marriage won't be legal there any time soon
Of course you know, but what do you think about it, will people riot or something
This seems like such a big issue, like how is it even possible in EU
Wow, great, another chance for the "comedians" of reddit to say how bad 2020 is
Not like it's been played out since April
In Estonia whole winter this year is basically a 90 day November and currently it is storming outside
Minus 5 in Vardø. Quite unusual in February
I will never forget that three hours of winter this winter
Cold and rainy

What a wonderful result for France and Europe
Pretty picture is not an argument
Comprehensive studies with actual numbers and scenarios behind it would be
If only train travel was any good here
2026 can't come faster
First we need proper train infrastructure
Travelling on train takes much longer time than plane (difference can be up to 10x if traveling from one side of Europe to other), some parts of EU are outright cut from others in terms of railway system (only option for Baltic countries and Finland to travel anywhere far enough are by plane)
FYI there are several railway developments ongoing but they're mostly interrupted by the locals, so go figure
This is exactly why I support Rail Baltica, which has become quite controversial in my country
Same for HS2 in the UK
So pretty pictures and unfounded feelings should drive policy logic and data be damned
By the number of upvotes you have gotten it seems they do
Where is your evidence

When Europe went to shit
It's easy to think that things are bad now but 2014/2015 and even 2016 were really bad
We have actually come a long way in Europe and the debates have become more relaxed and although a lot of things changed I feel like we're a bit more reasonable
Even in this sub, I remember that I stopped visiting r/europe for 2 years, it was unbearable
They are certainly not anti-Russian
And I think it´s incredibly dangerous for EU, if the EU approaches this situation as an anti-Russian movement
It just isn´t and trying to portrait it as such simply puts the democratic movement in Belarus into troubles
"Other news on the CNN, Italy has declared war on France and already occupied southern France".

Whats this female perspective exactly for a managerial role in the transport department
Well ... government changes or 'mild-revolutions' take time (and when the time comes it happens super-fast)
Even if this time there is no 100% regime change it drives a point
That point being it encourages the people
Before this Belarus rarely if ever had protests
To now 100,000 or so people getting on the streets
It can be seen a wakeup call for both Luka and the people who so far thought "whats the point
" as you are doing
Some might still stay at home but some might radicalize
But in the end yes, revolutions don't always end up doing anything or even if they do the end isn't always the best result at least in the near-future
It's more of the usual class warfare of more-or-less 1 guy vs the now growing opposition it has
As long as he has the military/police backing him he has real practical tool to surpress the anti-Luka people
It's more so a first time show of force by any real opposition but sadly unless things really escalate Luka could hold on to power
Still again Luka has pinky promised some mild changes as it think it was a public vote and some other possible law changes while with the other hand he is trying to surpress freedom of movement/speech so it's yet to be seen what the end result is or if the opposition gets a bigger voice inside Belarus
I mean my own country saw an opportunity when the power of Moscow was weak and took to the streets
It was a lucky time to protest and show the areas unity
On the backs of those common folk on the streets, they managed to quickly form a local-government of sorts and while Russia then tried to quell the resistance it was too far gone and they simply appeased
While other former block countries did the same but then Russian still had some power and some of those protests became bloody with people getting killed, run over by APC's etc
revolutions can work sometimes but there is no actual "How to regime change" law book so every time it works differently
Sadly, they won't be much cool and peaceful when they die from Covid-19
Ussr was already crumbling by late 80s and Gorbachev didn't want to use force to hold the power forever
Totally different circumstances from todays Belarus

>But it doesn't set the extermination of races as the main goal of its existence
Yeah, only extermination of bourgeoisie, wealthy peasants and "enemies of the state". Guess it's okay if you're deported or killed based on your class instead of your race
> if the Russians did not stop them
Sure
Russians
Let's completely ignore these nations that were conquered by the Red bastards and forcibly drafted into Red Army
I can't believe these guys are actually defending Soviets for "freeing" us
At this point everything was better than Soviets, even Germans
USSR made demands to Finland and still invaded it multiple times, yet this pinko defends them wholeheartedly
I guess they really can't comprehend our reality, since they lived their merry and trouble-free life up in the North
It's easy to judge if you don't care, want or can't see history from our POV
That would be somewhat true (although still as horrific) if soviets gave the chance to "change class" as you said
But they never did
Once you were on their list of "enemies of the state" (and the list was numerous - cossacks, clergy, member of literally any party except communist, middle- and wealthy peasants
) there was not turning back
Even worse - with time definitions of who is on the list became arbitrary and random
Literally anyone could end up on the list, you could be the most loyal to the state, but NKVD could still execute you to fill the quota of "traitors". Great purge of 37-38 annihilated tens of thousands high ranking communists and red army officers
And also Soviets didn't shy away from terror based on ethnicity, since many ethnicities were seen as fifth column of hostile forces (sounds familiar, doesn't it
I wonder what those poor Estonian veterans, who were unfortunate enough to be forcefully drafted into German army, would have though of this statement
Remember *Czech Hell*? Sounds equally bad, doesn't it
Now, what would it make your ancestors
You're retarded, aren't you
These are bold words and assumptions coming from a Swede, who's own people and government supported Germans during the war by supplying them with iron
And later, during the Cold War sent Soviet refugees back to USSR just for them to be sent straight to Gulag to be torture and killed
Did I really have to remind you of this again
So, "that guy" is *probably* you instead
Sharing is caring
The same articles get posted all the time
The false narrative of that has been debunked countless of times, but the commies don't care
It doesn't say Hitlerism
There are no people in this thread yelling that True Nazism has never been tried and it was just excesses of one man
Alliance with Nazis was an expansion plan for the Soviet Union too
The difference comes from people actually putting it in practice or attempting to and people just cosplaying
Actual attempts always call for terror of the proletariat and all sorts of other nasty things like scapegoating
They have such a firm belief that it will all be worth it in the future
This is in direct contrast with systems, where freedom and pluralism are central
China is not the one protesting these things in Europe
It is eurocommies and Russia
>of course what they did differs from "a textbook definition"
The "textbook" prescribed totalitarian violence, terror and even genocide of unworthy nations

There were tons of movies made about WW2 in Ussr, some of them very high quality
And they worked very well in terms of propaganda - many people in post-soviet countries believe to this day that Ussr defeated Germany alone and allied contribution was almost non-existent
Problem is - barely any of those movies were shown on the western side of the Iron curtain
Western people were just not affected by this propaganda
For an entire year, UK was the only nation at war with Germany
If it wasn't for their resolve, the war would've certainly ended differently
Well, it's kinda hard to do when both sides tried to not let the other sides propaganda thtough
The American war films werent shown in Ussr either
- 9/11: 2,605 US citizens per 285,082,000 people (2001 figures) = 1 victim per 109 436 people;
- MH17: 193 Dutch citizens (incl
dual citizens) per 16,865,000 people (2014 figures) = 1 victim per 87 383 people
Indeed, the Netherlands had a proportionally bigger victim count

Thank god
I go to the city centre by using public transport, but I will not get rid of my car, because I want to travel freely, like, going to the countryside, visiting grandparents or our summerhouse
And when buying groceries I will also go by car, because
I have it already
I take public transport when I need to go to the city centre, or when I plan on getting drunk somewhere :D
Going to the office was easy, I lived next to the office building, by accident
But will change jobs soon, so again, going by car, but I already dread the traffic in the evening leaving the office, a bus goes also there directly, but then I'd have to walk \~15 minutes to the bus stop, then travel by bus etc
Going by car will be faster, but more stressful
At least I can look forward to the summer when I can go with my bicycle or motorcycle
The only hope for the no-car idealists is when public transport is so easy and fast and comfortable, that young people don't want to buy cars anymore
You can't force someone who already has a car to abandon it
Maybe it won't get used as much
Also, my brother is having a baby and will buy a car soon because of that
Even though they live near the city centre and their parking situation is very bad
Great own a car but do you need to take it to the city on short trips
You're then just limiting the ability for cyclists and pedestrians
Yea sure it's cool to own a car but cars are wasteful, no fighting that
Im happy that you live in a place where cars everywhere arent a problem but Im honestly done with trying to solve puzzles in my head just to walk in the city and not get run over
It's not normal that in the city center the walkpath just stops and you have to continue your walk through a parking lot
I honestly wish that my city's goverment would pull it's head out of it's ass and start doing the same thing
Now they have just greated more and more space for cars for years and wow guess what, the traffic is still shit
This is some dystopian shit, i would never be okay with it
Terrorism seems to be really working
The values that we need to fight for are the values of liberty, it's easy to pacify a country but to actually have such a region like Europe is a miracle in history
Im appalled that this needs to be said in r/europe
Funny how you say that, I know some Danes that moved to Estonia and say they like it a lot more
It’s not crowded, we actually have nature, good standards of living, and nobody beheads anyone
Not strange at all, if you think about it
Small number of them, dispersed over the country instead of concentrated in specific areas, means they will assimilate with the wider society instead of forming an insular community where extremist views can get reinforced
And also because of the low numbers, it is not really worth it for radical organizations to spend resources on targeted recruitment here
The extreme peace and cooperation
Of course we want safety but why are you want to give away your freedom to get it
This is just quite an Orwellian comment if you think about it
Id argue that the whole humanity people have seeked liberty despite it being more dangerous
Definitely something has to be done but through sustainable policies not surveliance and yes the first one is hell of a lot more complicated
And yes maybe through surveilance etc we get rid of extremism(which i doubt) but do you think you'll get your liberties back
The data doesn't back your argument up
It's a combination of your confirmation bias and the fact that you have better access to news today than you did 15 years ago
With the internet and social media, every example of death by police has a much higher likelihood of reaching you so it serves to paint a false narrative compared to the past
Think to yourself: would the recent MAGA hat teenager story have blown up the same way 20 years ago or is it completely a result of our clickbait media era where people do minimal to none fact checking as it's all about getting the story out as fast as possible
Without the internet, newspapers would have till the next morning to make adjustments so doing proper research into their stories served as an incentive as people value quality
Nowadays getting a story out takes 2 minutes and if you fall behind competitors you're losing readers
That’s a whole lot of words just to say you’re wrong anyway
It’s a downward trend, or at worst, an even trend
Damn, everybody is suddenly a cheese expert
You do understand that it's Russia pushing Europe and Europe pushing Russia *back*, right
You sound like Europe should stop pushing Russia back
I am afraid problem is not just oil&gas, there are also major business interests in Russia

Now if fixed radars detect you doing +3kmh and moving radars (on police cars) detect you doing +7 they don't register it as violation
I agree if I first saw this in my news it sounded like the dumbest thing ever
They are basically treating the dribers as school kids giving them a time out if they behave bad

I doubt such a referendum would work here today, especially after the populist conservative party has been fighting against said rights
There's a lot for us to learn from Ireland, as well
So the first is “Perseauk”, I’m not too sure about the second one but should be “Türa lits ära piilu minuga ei maksa norida” which means “Fucking bitch, don’t look/peek, it’s not a good idea to pick a fight with me” and the third is “Kusen su ema hauale”
None of them is too widely used tho
"Perseauk", "Türa lihtsalt minuga ei maksa norida (smth like that)" "Kusen su ema hauale"
Very good, you are well equipped
I think static automatic radars “red line” is “x7”(by gps)
Late 90's was a different time
Come visit again if you haven't. /r/Eesti if you have questions
/self-designated PR department
Well, “Türa” means basically fuck and “Lits” means bitch, so from “Türa lits” we get “Fucking bitch”
“Ära piilu” means “Don’t peek” or “Don’t look”,
“Minuga ei maksa norida” is the harder part
“Minuga” is “With me”, and “Ei maksa” is literally translated to “Doesn’t cost,” but in this context it would mean “Isn’t worth” and “Norida” basically means “Pick a fight,” so from this we get “It’s not worth it to pick a fight with me
So we get “Fucking bitch, don’t peek, it’s not worth it to pick a fight with me”
Well, he was really pissed off about it and all the media attention so in that case the fine had a good effect
Türa (or tra) is a pretty common word, but is mainly used by itself, it's more of a fuck than fucking
'Türa küll' is pretty much 'for fucks sake', 'tra sa teed' is 'what the fuck are you doing' etc
Vitt (vitt-vitu-vittu) is another popular word and is used rather similarly
Vitupea was popularised by a short film and means fuckhead
Mida vittu - what the fuck
Black metal feeds off the darkness of the north

Black represent dirt iirc
Actually the colors really dont have any meaning, its just interpitation also a petition for lithuania to use their old grand duchy flag
"New flags" is quite a fancy term for old flags that were simply banned during the Soviet occupation
Nailed it with estonian existential depression
we're not that emo
are we
Countryhumans but actually good
love your artstyle
That's an interpretation invented during the Internet era, it's not historical, nor something official
No, that's just a coincidence
Blue represents the sky above our land, black the soil and our bleak history, and white purity and hard work
>Black represent dirt iirc
Officially the colours don't represent anything and the supposed symbolism was invented later
Same in Estonian Valgevene
I think Croatia might be Trans-*[Istria]
The idea of Latvian flag is almost as old as the idea of the Austrian flag - from the 13th and 11th century respectively
Rich and bountiful soil
More like "soil", which is value no
1 for recently emancipated former serfs
Wdym "too communist" it literally has been used for most of your history and its literally your coat of arms
Our flag was definitely not, nor was our state
You never used it as a national flag since the beginning of the 20th century, but only as a state flag (which is a secondary category)
>But Austria still had the idea first
Pretty safe to say that the Latvian idea was by no means affected by the Austrian idea
>and having 2 flags that similar will just confuse everybody
Lol, you haven't been paying attention to flags outside Europe
Its rad
>or the Moldovan
Well, that's what happens if you violently cut a country in two
Thats just dumb, that flag was around before communism was a thing, it represents lithuania when it was strongest
We, latvia and lithuania had our blues with communism and russians and so we detest communist symbols, but to associate the color red with communism is too far fetched, and again frankly dumb
Maybe lithuania had their reasons to choose the current flag over the old one but i dont know
>allowing his passenger to leave his car while stopped without police approval

Where's the Russian flag
The biggest enemy for the Russian people has always been their government
Literally every third former Soviet country is now an "enemy" for them
Tells you a lot about their "friendly" and "mutual respect" based foreign policy
Meanwhile, totalitarian dictatorships like Turkmenistan or North Korea
Nah, they're all buddies, considering they share more values with Russia
How are we behind Latvia and Lithuania
I call foul play
At least we finally managed to pass Georgia
Ah yes the 1940 Estonian brutal occupation of Russia
And who could forget that the estonians deported the russians into võru
My oh my How brutal the Estonians were to the russians
Of course we hate russia when they're sending their goddamn spies in our countries and kidnap our people to get their agent back
I'd say Russia and Russians have been a lot unfriendlier to me my whole life
Only actually met 3 or 4 nice Russians in my 30 years of life
Terrified Russia is going to try and annex Estonia as some point (again)
Ohh no, anyways
"You damn Czech people, complaining when we blow stuff up in your country
Ugh
so unfriendly
Sadly this is literally literally the reasoning Russian politics sometimes have
We did something bad but you also reacted bad so ergo you are bad
But we were actually "taken" by NATO according to Russia
Not like local people actually wanted to join an organization that would protect from a empire next door who, in various names, has shown aggression towards us right
Like every year they lambast us for "NATO drills", well technically true
They fail to mention that, as we are in NATO like 95% of those "NATO troops" are Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians
Our own troops
in our country
doing drills
Like it's so ridiculous that I can't even fathom someone in Russia going like "Yup, NATO brought in tens of thousands of soldiers again into the Baltics to piss us off and oppress the locals
Just out of curiosity what'd be the ideal Russia in your opinion
* Belarus (the illegitimate dictatorship, not the people)
* China
* Kazakhstan
That's kinda it, really
Same here in Estonia
Tbh We Estonians would still be quite suspicious of russia
I think our prime minister must answer to that question on next meeting in parliament
She probably is already preparing overview about who and in what point did mistakes what leaded to this disgrace, and what are our government plans to fix those shortcomings
Also congratulations to our southern sisters for winning us this time
The horror
The horror
My grandmother has told me the tales about Võru
apparently she was forced to wear a bracelet around her wrist
Guess they didn't like when we joined N.A.T.O. and E.U. after the Soviet "Union"
I don't think we want to be in any kind of union with you guys
Your money is always welcome here though
According to 2019, 44% of non-Estonians(ethnicity) supported NATO
Data suggests that the better assimilated into Estonian society the people are, the more they support NATO
Among age groups the lowest is noncitizens 40-59 and highest among people under 30
Mood
Same
You don't get it
You are just a worthless pawn in the game of the big boys
You don't decide anything, your vote in the Estonian so-called elections mean nothing
You are effectively controlled by America
Big boys like Russia can make their own decisions
The fact that you live slightly better than some other post-Soviet countries (but definitely worse than Russians) is only because your parasitic economy is being fed by the West, but not for long
Soon (TM) you will come crawling back and beg Russia to annex you, because you need to survive somehow
Also, don't bring any quality of life, economic development, wage level, human development, education, life expectancy or any other similar statistics, because these are all fake CIA fabricated numbers to make Russia look bad
The truth is everybody is envious of Russia
Ooh oooh oooh
putin happened
Speak for yourself, please
Im gonna be honest The ideal russia in my eyes as a foreign estonian is a Russia divided into multiple constitutional monarchies
Kazakhstan is kind of a classical dictatorship case as in their foreign policy avoids confrontations at all costs and extra attention is paid to internal policy
Therefore, Kazakhstan tries to avoid choosing sides, but will do the minimum necessary to show Russia it's on board
Russia is an extremely important economic partner for Kazakhstan, so they can't really afford a stand-off either
Meanwhile, Kazakhstan has become more vary of Russian influence and is trying to strengthen the national identity and language
This to an extent just enough to not irritate Russia too much, e.g. Russia remains an official language, so Russia isn't really in a position to take a political stance on Kazakh language
I mean Transylvania is a part of EU now so you never know
Might be hope for you guys yet
I don't hate Russians
I do hate your Governments
I have no idea how the hell you always get the worst ones
You have to do something to fix it
I have no idea what
I'd agree if i Were a citizen myself
Too bad that I am shit in drawing
You can literally google it
TIL she has a sister
Mate, we had all the snow melt in a few days, it's depressing as all hell
It can't be worse than +40 in central France like it was a few years ago can't it
Dictatorship is one big party when you're still young
But who's gonna have your back when it's all done (Yeah)
It's all good when you're little, you have kill fun
Can't be a fool, son, what about the long run
Looking back Lyudmila always ah mention
Said me not giving her much attention (Yeah)
She was there through my KGB-ation
I wanna show the nation my appreciation
Remove counter strike and put "attempting to" after remember and change planting to plant
"Verito"
My father's school actually had a shooting range in the basement
Yeah, Putin's main opposition is awfully careless around chemicals, right
He kindof has been for years
And what does it mean "as a russian"? That you get your news from government owned channels
Which, might be a suprise, is a European language
European here
Never seen something like that
These are usually used during temporary events and festivals, like porta potties
Stationary public toilets are usually indoors
If you listen closely, you can hear Italy crying in the distance
A tragedy
Many people lost their jobs, the social safety net in East Germany became worse, pension ages rose and now East Germany is a benefactor of NATO imperialism in the Middle East and Afghanistan
Yes the grey aliens For Estonia, Latvia and Belarus
B I G   U K R A I N E
Yes, that's correct, sad when people leave us out of the fun
And estonian workers on south finland
We go to Latvia to buy cheap alcohol, it's a circle of life
Going to get glögi from christmas market in your honour
It's the densest international ferry line in the world with quite huge ships, which themselves have large stores and pubs on them
Getting wasted on these ferries has become part of the culture of both countries
They are going to work abroad so they too can go to another country to buy alcohol
Yes we do, albeit a smaller one focused towards locals this year
And considering Tallinn is like 3rd or 4th in Europe (not too many above them elsewhere in the world, if any at all), it all adds up
Glögi is called mulled wine in English
For us getting to Åland means jumping off/on the Tallinn-Stockholm-Tallinn ferry in the middle of the night and finding yourself in almost empty Mariehamn
I've loved it every time I visit
Lol Sweden would have been a better choice
If this were Estonia, neighbours would be at each others throats all the time about petty issues
ah, finally
no russia and latvia
imagine having red on a flag, couldn't be me
ayyyyy
i dont know that they'd go out and literally start fuel bombing the police though, no
heres a video that covers the general situation [
Turkey is in the EEA
Eurostat disagrees with you:
28 degrees in Rovaniemi, something is very wrong with this weather
I can't understand heat like this living 800 km south of Rovaniemi
It is very odd
I'm from Estonia - we used to have rainy and not very warm summers but this year
even those people who love hot weather are suffering
Some people say that 30 degrees are unbearable here because air here is very humid but I dunno, I just want to die
I love this weather and I hope it keeps getting warmer (as long as every living being doesn't die because of it)
If nothing changes, I guess Svalbard is my only chance to survive
Or maybe South Pole, they say there's a nice chilly weather out there
Yeah, you can
People are used to different temperatures in different places, but I'm sure that almost everywhere climate changes noticeably
I remember in Rome woman who owned the apartment my family stayed in was complaining about "cold" spring
It was 26 degrees in the evening
In Estonia these temperatures are very rare even in the summer, and in the evening it's always less than 20
Well
Fuck
Do you have to pay for penguins in Iceland
Oh, in Estonia we don't have neither of those except our former president
He was a real penguin in a suit, I promise
He was pretty expensive to take care of but he was free to look at
We were the first nation controlled by penguins
And that's only a beginning
*happy estonian noises*
America - "English mofo, do you speak it
Plus it's using damn hieroglyphs so you can't even read it if you haven't learned it
This made me plan to go to EU elections this May for the first time
Hopefully no one from Estonia voted for this bullshit, but if someone did - they are not going to get my vote in May
I am truly sorry on behalf of most of Estonia for this utter shitstorm that our dear MEP Andrus Ansip has brought upon us
&#x200B;
Fucking wankers
&#x200B;
Well this fucking sucks, will at least VPNs work
Wait, so  does article 13 mean that Memes will get copyrighted or whats the problem
>Blame the politicians and goverments who pushed this shit through, not the the EU
It's not like those are completely separate things
Those politicians and governments are literally part of EU system after all
It doesn't mean you can't criticize a system that allows such things to happen in the first place
I don't understand how did you come up with the idea that we're against democracy here
So any criticism of a system that involves democratic elections is somehow an attack on democracy now
If I am against some laws or directives that come from democratic system, that doesn't mean I'm against democracy
It's as stupid as thinking that if I'm against poor road conditions, I'm suddenly against having roads altogether
How complicated is that for you
>You can criticize politicians for their decisions
But the politicians don't exist in a vacuum
Their actions are also affected by their parties, ideologies, connections, lobbying
There is more about the EU than just democracy
It’s-20 in Estonia
Honestly it's fine
We're used to it, but more importantly, we're equipped for it - clothing for being outside and heating+insulation for being inside
It was around zero yesterday and -20 today, but absolutely no difference for me inside
Cars start making sad noises below 20, but they almost always work too
Not me, my dorm room has no ventilation, last summer during the heatwave I spent days absolutely naked in the room dying because there was no air moving at all
Yup, it kinda feels like little needles poking your face and you're left thinking why do I live in a place where even the literal air hurts
I'll take dry +40 over that, -40 is just too much to be outside, no matter how many layers you have
Not directly because of the Allies winning but because of how the war ended up and what followed after that the countries of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland exist today
There are more of them in Central Europe and the Balkans but things were complicated there and I don't have the expertise to deduce which countries started more because of WWI or WWII or due to mostly unrelated conflicts
Go ahead and read The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, you might change your mind
Don't forget the rapes
That description particularly of a single soldier on the Eastern Front is so visceral
Made it seem much worse than Al Quiet on the Eastern Front did at least
The defining question of our generation
Wait, but Iceland is in Europe
Why the LLL on the roof though
Doubt it's standard equipment
This is a vehicle used for fairs/display only
It's probably the most common police vehicle, the most recognisable anyway
No reason not to use it
We don't have muscle cars as part of the police fleet
Besides a few exceptions it's all pretty civilian, like these transporters, Volvo wagons, Skoda RS Wagons, etc
I know they exist but I've never seen one
Yeah, I found that a bit funny when I found out as well
Cringe o'clock in /r/europe again
Tallinn experience is better: the bike lane is a...bike width suicide lane along a major magistrale road, but cars still park there
Happy independence day to our southern brothers
*Estonia wants to know your location*
Water levels are always hard
well, but the whole idea of a sauna is to be hot, I don't think it would feel comfortable to drink an ice cold beer in the sauna
A warm beer will nicely warm your insides up aswell, making the inevitable jump into the cold pond even more enjoyable
Americanization that's why
English is a global language now, seen, found and understood everywhere
Reminds me of the video for a Death Metal song ["Haavad Uulitsal" \(Wounds on a street\)
I don't know what's so cool about swear words
Literally the same in Estonia with Estonians and Russians
It has a "Pre-Covid" flair tho
That's an Estonian band tho
Erm, obviously the same as in Finland
Oh, nvm then
M8, look at My flair
False, Finns would never stand that close to each other
What are rules
Have you got rid of the trees that start right on the tarmac's edge yet
I was thinking of the roads I saw in Masuria actually indeed when I said it
I'd like to point out that if Trump was Putin's spy, or whatever, he wouldn't have killed 200 Russian mercenaries in Syria, 2017
Also, he wouldn't have sold Patriot missile defense system to Poland or started selling LNG to Europe
And I'm speaking this as an Estonian
We live in fear of Russia, yet right now, we feel safer than with Obama
Happy national day cousins
No worries, that's a Pepsi max, so no sugar
One small feedback: this could be done on a single map
It didn't come about without major backlash from backwards fuckwads here either
In fact backlash was enough that for a long long time I wasn't sure if it passed or not
Because then everybody will be gay and it'll spread like a disease /s
This looks like architectural rape, to be honest
It's absolutely disgusting for my sensibilities
That's totally different perspective
If the surrounding buildings are still like that there, this looks so out of place
Damn Russians have to ruin everything
What if the mink version is milder and will limit the spread of the "original" covid
This is a possibility
Viruses tend to evolve to milder and less lethal forms, its basic evolution (no point killing the host) and you can't be infected with both at the same time
>can be a bomb during vaccine development
This is a scary thought
This kind of jump to minks or whatever other animal will happen again and again
You can't stop it
Right now the actions taken are only in the interest of vaccine industry
The depressing thing is the polls don't show much of a shift, in fact PiS lost a bit, while Konfederacija gained, I assume Kofnederacija is even more right wing since it incldues reacitonist parties
For example Wales currently receives around £680 million per year in EU funding
The UK receives £2
2billion per year in structural funding

Only easy and flexible "green" is hydroelectricity and the Netherlands is flat without suitable rivers so there's that
It is not often a question of choices
No matter how much the Netherlands wishes it you can't become like mountainous Austria (63% hydro) with great rivers getting your electricity from hydro
EDIT: just vote to have mountainous terrain, bro
You meant it sarcastically, but there is truth to that
Denmark's electricity system is connected to Scandinavia and the mountains you are looking for are in Norway and Sweden
Again hydro, because hydro is the only on-demand renewable energy
It is not irrelevant
There is one very important thing in electric grid and it is balancing
Wind turbines generate electricity when the wind is blowing and do not generate when it is not
Yet you need a stable supply and that is where the on-demand sources come to play
For hydro you can turn it up or down by regulating how much water hits the wheel and you regulate it to compensate for windy and non windy periods
Norway and Sweden, with being the best land for hydro, has an oversupply of the on-demand capacity
That is why Denmark connected to them can run their oversupply of wind turbines
Cut the connection to the Scandinavian networks and the turbines wouldn't work
So you see
You already described one example of using Norwegian mountains - night excess storage
Other is Norway turning their hydro up and down to match Danish needs
Of course Russians wish the world community and democratic blocks like the EU let the dictators have free reign everywhere, but it is not really up to you
Brits like to drink tea
Finns like sauna
Now go ahead and DESTROY those claims with FACTS and LOGIC too as there are certainly some Brits and some Finns, who do not like these things
Meh
It's a Russian expressing a mainstream view in Russia about what the EU should be in his opinion
An outsiders view saying that the EU should be impotent in hindering Russia and countries like them
Pretty much everyone I compare Estonia with has less AIDS than we do
Thanks Russians
I actually think, if done tastefully its pretty great
&#x200B;
We had a cheap foodstore chain expand to our old town buildings and they had some pretty cool decorations
Like one of their stores is on the cellar level so you have random \~13-15th century stone walls next to the isles, random well spots I guess, simply covered off with see through reinforced glass you can walk on etc
&#x200B;
So its nice to have a functional thing inside old buildings if they keep the decor and somewhat adapt their own style to the place
28c ish in Tallinn today
Spent the whole day in bed sweating and sleeping
Send help (and beer)
I went swimming in the sea yesterday, it was okay
And it is not even July
I'd say anything above 20 is way too hot
I also went swimming and it was quite cold
On average -5°C. According to Wikipedia, the record low is -36,8°C, but that is definitely not the usual winter temperature
And I feel horrible even below -10°C.
They built the museum around him
>PZL Świdnik won't be touched by the courts because it's the rulings party beloved company
Apparently they were touched by someone if some regulation inspector banned their old chairs
Cant some EU courts help with the issue
If I am not mistaken, that's the chain the Night King borrowed to reclaim the dragon
Now it all makes sense
Something is seriously wrong with Germany if they think Russia is more trustworthy than the USA
> Russia is more trustworthy than the USA
This combined with Nordstream 2 and the investments taking place is very worrying
lol
Trump only talks, Putin orders assassinations in the EU
In many ways we even encouraged it
Think about all those times anybody has raised issues about regulations in Europe and how it's stifling
This is often just met with "lol if you can't follow the rules, then your business shouldn't exist". There's no desire to even understand *why* some of these rules are difficult to deal with
The idea doesn't get developed, the company doesn't advance and suddenly we're surprised that all of our computing is run by foreign companies
It's not a viewpoint, companies have no obligation to follow any sort of moral code because it's VERY subjective what is moral behaviour in any given situation
Also I'm pretty sure you don't have to be a cynical person to realize that most moral codes large companies follow are designed for PR purposes
Following laws however is a different matter altogether
Woah dude
Happy independence day, Ukraine
Also nice to see that it's close to my country's reindependence day
Should have called the Netherlands Holland
Alright
its pretty well done lmao
I dont get the Sweden one tho
their insult is that Denmark  has Skåne
Or that Gotland has disappeared
Ughhhh
Low blow but you succeeded for me
99% Invisible has a terrific episode on H-Day
Ah what a beautiful picture without immigrants
Humanitarian reasons based on the flawed theory that increase in their living standards brings forth (classical) liberalism, respect for human rights and all these other nice things
Macron is terrifying here
Most beautiful city in the world, fight me bih
Thats so vultureous
> at least 3 more years
Lol, what are you smoking
While it's of course spectacular that this is the case for an entire city, it really isn't that uncommon
Many modern cities across the world located at coastlines or riversides have their city grounds supported like that
Just a little addition - only 10% of venetian lagoon is open water, rest is wetland covered only by shallow layer of water
So it wasn't like they just made a city in the middle of sea
Still it was an amazing achievment to built a city in such a harsh terrain
>And nobody gives a fuck
Belarus lived 70 years under soviet totalitarian regime and now 25 years under Lukashenko regime
Unfortunately so many years in totalitarian state make people very afraid to go against security forces of the state
But we have seen what you are describing from France and US in the last few years
That doesn't sound as outrageous as what's in this clip
In  not as corrupt countries this is how they greet you if they think you sell weed
Unfortunately it isn't if you've been keeping track the rising power and brutalism of many governments in these regions
kremlin bots hard at work
Best decision ever
What could EU do about any of those issues except sanctions
Unfortunately  none of those countries are in EU or NATO so we can't intervene directly
I do wish though that we would cut energy dependence on Russia
Things like NordStream 2 should be stopped
Being Finnish you should remember the last time orders came from Moscow area
They attacked Finland and blamed it on you guys for starting it
They also had no trouble annexing Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland and heaps more during that same period
So what way is it
Without NATO - get attacked, with NATO - get attacked
Historically it wouldn't matter, NATO or no NATO
With current Russian and EU politics there is a "whos cock is bigger" game anyway
Nuking a country in modern ages is not something countries do lightly
We have seen nuclear powers (US, Russia) wage wars, they won't resort to nuking
You would immediately become the worlds hated country if you did that as you would be a threat to everyone
As nukes go it doesn't matter if you are Finland, USA, Russia or some small island republic - nukes don't care how powerful you are and are a threat to the entire world and countries, including Russia
>EU is not a military union
There is a mutual defence clause though for EU
u/JakubMarian also uses regular Kremlin-influenced rhetoric
He has added those random mixed Russian-Estonian ares in Western and North-Central Estonia in order to make the geographically very small Russian-speaking areas "more proportional". The real situation looks like [this]
His maps may look all pretty and that, but they are often horribly shallowly researched
True, but in Estonia, he is doing it entirely arbitrarily
Western Estonia and North-Central Estonia (areas between Tallinn and Northeastern Estonia) have very few Russian speakers
If they are literally using age-old Kremlin rhetoric, then what else is there to say
[Gorgeous]
[Stunning]
[Utterly beautiful]
[Right]
I lived in that house for a short while
It was not
There are no examples of stalinist architecture here, really
A couple of residential houses but you can hardly tell
There was a huge housing crisis up to and including the 70s - my mother grew up in a communal apartment, 11 people per 3 rooms (3 families)
Jesus, that's 68,000 victims more than in Estonia
From the article I'd assume the mutilation happened in Germany
That doesn't sounds like a safe place to live to me
Oh the irony
It looks like a lot of paperwork, but anyone who ever worked with documents will be able to tell that it's not a lot
Especially considering that it must be a pretty big order
I mean my work contract+NDA take about third if not half of papers shown on this pic
I like the wall
We're going to miss you, UK
This is the cherry on top of the suck cake after losing Nicholas Parsons
Sorry that your government is shite
Maybe there's a way to delay the technical leaving
Doubt they would bother anymore
I hope Poles keep giving the middle finger to Soros globalist swine
Wonder if Spanish speaking SA countries will form something similar to the EU
Norway is so cool for doing this
Could you not, many thanks Europe
Thanks for the link - I checked the 50s video in it and it was very inspiring, thoroughly enjoyed it:)
Im reading about this event for the first time and for some reason the Dutch commentators don't seem very positive about it - what is the reason
It seems like a very cool and unique occasion
> Article 7 requires unanimity
Four fifts:
Wth, *111th*??
Cool now I can brag how much better we are than Latvia and all the other countries ranked lower than ESTONIA
What else could it be
There aren't that many countries in Europe
We're gonna start our own nordic club, with blackjack and hookers
Estonia can into nordic
Or Turkey actually behind both Russia and Belarus
> I'm pretty sure my symptoms are just my regular allergy/cold
Try to explain it to people near you when you cough in public transport
It should be a crime to give public spotlight on those "psychics". In Estonia you can see those crooks on TV every day
But they are not confronted
They are local celebrities
It would be awesome if someone were to actually test them and show the public what they really are
Because it's a lie
Eventually people will want to pay these psychics to tell them what they want to hear
And they will pay a lot
Nazi Germany bad, soviet union bad, liberation of auswitch good
There, can we stop the shitshow
Yeah
It's not like the people are usually stepping between every single tile so much to prevent growth
Just mentioning that this thing is not comics
It is caricature
This reminds us that "My parents want to kick me out at 18" and "I have to pay rent to my parents for living at home" are some of the "I'm too european to understand this problem" that we can read about here on reddit, on the subreddits where americans post
Capitalism at its fines
Nothing more to say
Yes, me neither, I just
made a silly joke
Please stop upvoting
Post links to prove it
That's some Russian internet and I am sure getting the color of fake blood right would not be that difficult
Now you are assuming out of the gate that all this was fake and there was no Russian assassination plan
That's the Russian in you thinking it and if you are already thinking that then why wouldn't the evil Ukrainians kill him for real
After all your lot pretends that this is a huge evidence toward Russia didn't do nuffing so just killing that poor SOB would have prevented all that
Ah, finally we have a warm sea
Worth it
So much more sun
What
You are afraid that Latvia will attack Portugal or something
fuck, we're away from russia
I have some bad news for you
At least she changed her style since 1812
at first I though "ohh nice Estonia has at least a tiny yellow part in the south" but then I realized it was a lake
The huh
yo what the fuck
Is there a particular reason why the French Atlantic coast has little to none settlements
Glad you didn't become [Finnish]
> also socialism in Hungary ultimately led to improving workers and farmers lives, at least in a materialist sense
No it didn't. It lead to misery and lost opportunities as did socialism everywhere
It has never worked
Anarchy
Just another day in London
I swear our general area is some of the worst climate in existence
October and November are gray, depressing wastelands and then once it starts snowing and gets cold it won’t leave until like May
Awful, awful weather all the damn time
Only summers are nice sometimes
The shitty climate is one of the many reasons why I can’t wait to get out of this country
The heat is great, I’d love to have 25-30 degrees all year round
Sick and tired of the cold misery here
I liked it
I would rather have it instead of dreaded 5-6 month long grayish winter
But hey, I'm just one of those few freaks who enjoy even +40°C  ))
>We were all cold as balls here in Portugal this weekend
I have always found out that southerners don't really comprehend what "cold" actually is
Around 10 years ago I was in Turkey on vacation in autumn, and when we arrived there, pilot of the plane reported that the weather is sadly "a bit chill". It was +20 outside
More than the average summer temperature here in Estonia
So yeah, it's damn cold here
Right now we have +4 with snow, with 0 at night
We only had above +10 for  a few days, maybe a week this year
What's worse - it's now even always nice winter with bright snow and nice frost
It fluctuates between -10 and +5 for most of the winter, some weeks it's all wet and gray and depressing
For the entirety of the 2 days
That must have been tough
also in the news in Estonia:
Yes
We need another Ice Age so Europe would be bigger
Would solve overpopulation, more resources
> apparently it was fresh enough to be drinkable back then
It's supposedly still kind-of drinkable around the inner areas, [according to these comments
What book would you recommend that I can read to get a better perspective on that war ?
*cries in Monaco*
tbh it's probably Italy
Why russia tho
Many comments right now are by people coming over from these far left subs it was crossposted to
Nazis: Let's invade Western Poland
Commies: Let's invade Eastern Poland
Centrist: Guys ... let's not invade Poland at all
There is a lot of flairless users, few of them posters of /r/europe, but a lot of them not and posting mainly in far left subreddits
I have installed a Reddit Pro Tools chrome extension, the latest version of which makes it very easy to see where the person posts
So see ... it was Nazis and Commies doing the invading and the democracies are guilty of not stoping them
And that means both Nazis and Commies are scum and neocons are the good guys, who should be listened
For some of the most recent ones, this is essentially right after regaining or restoring independence
It made no conscious decision to legalize homosexuality in 1922
It just made a decision to throw out the whole Russian Empire's criminal code and paragraphs against homosexuality went with that

Bruh i didnt even know .-.
Today is like opposite day as we have Estonians and Latvians like u/toreon and u/LatvianLion making excuses for communism
I really, *really* cannot agree with you
All the supposedly non-authoritarian ideologies that you mentioned are absolutely fringe ideologies that have no relevance in our society
Communism *is* inherently totalitarian and inhumane
>but never about Nazi ones
False
>the participation of local quislings and SS people in various exterminations
Because the Estonian SS units did not participate in any exterminations, this is [a historical fact]
>Why are they holding pride parades if they were forcibly recruited, you ask
Because they fought against the re-invading Soviets
Wow, I really love people talking about stuff they don't know anything about (except through random tertiary sources)
>The Museum of Occupations in [Tallinn] [Estonia] \[...\]   is dedicated to the 1940-1991 period in the [history of Estonia] when the country was occupied by the [Soviet Union] **then** [**Nazi Germany**] and then again by the Soviet Union
>The Museum of the Occupation of Latvia \[...\] The Museum's Mission: \[...\] Remember what happened to Latvia, to the people and  land of Latvia during the Soviet and **German National Socialist regimes**, from 1940-1991;
>Kaunas Fortress is the remains of a fortress complex in Kaunas, Lithuania

By the way, I, too, can't understand why the Baltics would place more weight on looking at the regimes and crimes that are more relevant for them
It's not like the scale of Soviet crimes in the region was vastly larger in terms of both numbers and length
Oh wait
>Parades of SS veterans
They are just misunderstood people forced to  join the SS
Baltic Waffen-SS (which have very little to do with actual SS except for the name) units were literally declared to be innocent of any war crimes during the Nuremberg
As for the actual collaborators, plenty has been written about them by local historians
Nobody is building monuments to honour the *trawniki* douchebags
>Why are they holding pride parades if they were forcibly recruited, you ask
Siri, what is 'camaraderie'? Why do WW2 vets meet in the West and in Russia
Moreover, nobody - except maybe the Russian state media - calls, for example, the commemoration event for the Battle of Tannenberg Line, a "pride event".
>no the USSR is not even close to a good example of what Communism is
The USSR was undeniably the epitome of a communist state
>I'm also always suprised to see more animosity towards communist regimes than towards racist and fascist regimes
That isn't entirely true, it's just that no country and no tons of people actually defend racist and fascist regimes
Daily "flooding of communist and Kremlin sympathizers into that thread".
Capitalism is the best model we can ever hope to achieve
There isn't even anything wrong with capitalism as it's essentially just a freedom to do business and right to own property
Whatabout-whatabout
Examples
Haha
What the fuck
No we don't. What an idiotic thing to claim
Spouting Sputnik misinformation, classic
No we do not have such monument in the middle of capital square
Thank you for some sanity in this thread
Estonia has been through a lot, and the USSR committed heinous crimes to us
However, this has lingered as an erroneous understanding of ‘communism/socialism/leftism = bad
’ and I think we should be more intelligent than that
Hey, most of Northern Europe is actually very socially left in concepts like healthcare, but it is almost taboo to recognise this for some people
The trials we’ve suffered weren’t solely due to the nature of communism as an ideology, and by claiming that we severely undermine the dangers of totalitarianism, and the power of, for lack of a better word, cruelty
Let’s not pretend the soviet rule was cruel because they were communist and they couldn’t have done better - it was cruel because they were cruel
And now this fear is being funnelled into conservatism and radical fear-mongering from the bumbling individuals of a certain party
What a great time, eh
Issue is that such a monument doesn't exist
Blatant lies
Be ready because we will implement a harsh
ly effective e-services network
Międzymorze when
But why are you bringing social democracy into this
Who even claimed that social democracy is totalitarian like communism
Why do you feel the need to defend communism if you are a social democrat
They weren't the SS in the regular sense
I'm sure they were proud of being in the same unit with each other and for fighting against the Soviets
The Estonian Museum of Occupations, the Museum of Estonian History, the Estonian Jewish Museum etc
Non-communists usually don't care about such communist nuances
>sweatshops
Bad and inhumane regulation by these territorial states
>fucking up the planet
Insufficient regulation
>ridiculous endless growth expectations
Why is that even bad
>stock market crashes
That sounds like too optimistic criticism
>private health care leaving millions without the means to afford proper care
First of all, speak for your own country, and secondly, it's really all about lack of regulation
>Huge income inequalities
Really depends on the country, but you can regulate that *if the nation has the will*.
>bank bailouts
That may not be an entirely bad things, you know
They are too late, if our current dumb government tries to step out of the project they have to pay steep fees
Luckily they were too late and given the track record it was probably a desperate cry for attention by conservatives as COVID-19 has been taking most of the headlines
Of course they are not the same as communism is not the only totalitarian ideology
And I don't understand why you need to bring in those fringe side-ideologies here if we are talking about communism in general
>After 1945 you couldn’t find a single SS who was their member “in the regular sense”.
They weren't members of the "SS in the regular sense" even during the war as their units were ideologically very different from the regular SS
>Most country did not accept that excuse as sufficient to allow them to hold parades
Most countries did not have SS-units that were so different in their ideologies and whose lack of crimes was acknowledged by Western Allies
In fact, only Estonia and Latvia did
And you are really exaggerating with the word "parade" here
You can google them yourself
And as I said in another comment, you are right, there is no "Museum of the Crimes of Estonian Collaborators"...
[Yes
But such people will never care about that because that turns their simplistic world view upside down and right now it is too easy for them to blame entire occupied nations of literally organizing the Holocaust with their rhetoric
Yep, now you are getting it
Actually, I don't think so
I don't know of any to be honest, besides a few KGB museums at their former premises, but these are more about their methods than about their crimes
I'd rather die in a ditch somewhere than in a hospital like this
Can someone please make this for more countries
Try to get one into your car through front window while driving 90+ km/h
Its lethal
Seems like Estonia has 1 pornstar + one chopped up pornstar with some body parts missing
Uhm we Estonians are basicly pagans
How do you explain that haha
ahahaha Latvia is brown, not even mad that we are small, because Latvia is brown :D
Happy birthday
What the fuck happened to Latvia lmao
Palju õnne, Leedu

> who left the country becouse of transition to capitalism
Many people in East Germany were also so angry about the Berlin Wall being brought down by bloody capitalists that they left in disgust
Tbf, that saying is a famous paraphrasing of Hemingway's lines *No well-run yacht basin in Southern waters is complete without at least two sunburned, salt bleached-headed Esthonians [sic
] who are waiting for a check from their last article
And that had nothing to do with emigration, but with Estonians and their strong maritime culture
Yep, it's a very common saying among Estonians
Sometimes it's even shorter when we see another Estonian: "In every port
" or "In every port of the world
I like the French straight roads
the illustration is wrong though, it should be these three in a human centipede formation
Estonia’s maximum will be raised to 120km/h soon
hehe 110 in estonia
if it even exists, then that 110 might be like a km piece of road in the middle of nowhere because the highways i go on are always 70-90 kmh
Will be 120 here in a bit
Estonia and Latvia merged
Well, it's 120 in Estonia actually
In Estonia on new 4 lane roads there is 120 when the weather is good
> the farmer gets to set the price
So can the farmer be like "this sheep cost me one million billion dollars"?
But 110 is only on short sections, mostly it's still 90
See juba on

? I can understand "alus".
Õlu
That's brainiacs' word
Normal people call it "õlts". /s
Kali in Estonian would generally mean kvassi, but sometimes it is also used for beer

white nights are easily the best thing about the northern climate imo
Or the worst, being woken up in the middle of the night with the sun in your eyes is not great
nothing worse than freezing your tits off while watching the sunset at 3pm lol
Young children are more useful than adults anyway, they don’t try to resist as much
Spare some snow for the rest of us
I for one enjoyed this winter, there were a few snowy days for snow lovers too to eat it all they want
For what year is this map made
Railways ever built/used or current ones
Estonia is wrong: there is no functional railway link between Tallinn and Haapsalu (was closed and dismantled after 2004) nor between Rapla-Virtsu (was closed in late 1960's)
A segment of Tallinn-Pärnu railway between Lelle-Pärnu has been closed in 2018 for indefinite time
REIS TALLINN-TARTU-VALGA LAHKUB KÜMNE MINUTI PÄRAST
from denmark to finland
who the hell paid for that
Indeed it does
I ment the Riisipere-Haapsalu segment specifically
Now they're planning to rebuild the Haapsalu connection again
It's crazy to think for me that some countries don't have much pre-renaissance architecture
Despite multiple wars waged on my country territory with lots of damage, we still have a loot of medieval Gothic architecture
What else is new
communist apartments still serve good
What are you celebrating on Halloween exactly
Do the separatists have a plan for what they want to do now
I would wager they don't.
This likely won't end very well for Catalonia
>Only 70 pro-independence votes out of 135-seat chamber
Pretty embarrasing
They don't have any allies, except for Scots
They're gonna get annexed by the Spanish king
Well as far as the situation goes, Im sitting in Barcelona, near the Passage de garcia station and everything is exactly the same
Because 10 extra votes really shows a big majority, especially considering the importance of the thing they're voting on
As for why it's embarrasing - you'd think that
Well yeah, I never claimed it wasn't. Just remarked on how it's a pretty small one
>I doubt you would’ve said it’s "embarrassing" if anti-independence won by a slim majority
Embarrasing for the diehard pro-independence movement
Ofcourse
>do you think it would be embarrassing for the anti-independence movement if they won by just a slim majority
Considering they're way less popular & populistic
>Because apparently it’s embarrassing for a certain side of an issue to succeed in what they’ve fought for for so long
Well yeah, pretty embarrasing when you claim "oh everyone here supports the independence
" and then end up winning by a small margin
Or just go full Nero and make the next years one twice as big
Build a port and they will come
And they gave us hitler
Fattiehead
It is just falsely called "an alliance" when it was nothing of the sort
It was a foreign occupation
Bingo
Soviet "Union" too, maybe for some of the priginal members it was a Union, although even those were never elected in a democratic way, so even that is doubtful, especially considering the bolshevics lost the last election they fought in the Russian Republic
Turkey's weird
What made me surprised is that there were statues for him up to this day
I though everyone knew he was probably the worst ever colonizer, and his actions shocked even people living in his age
Even other colonizers like British were astonished and how poorly and brutally he run Congo and launched campaigns against him
We need to take historical context into account
King Leopold was horrible even by the standards of his own time
Read about him - even other colonial powers like UK were shocked at how awful things were in Congo
Well, even Belgians itself were not fond of it, when they found out about it
Belgian parliament had to vote to transfer Congo under control of Belgian government to stop it being Leopolds private land and institute some reforms to stop most brutal practices
You mean full out war
Maybe Putin needed to get some heat off because of Belarus and Turks are also fine with some limited slaguhter
*Slightly angry Estonian noises*
Or they might just run out of money for weapons
The workers still need wages, weapons programs are expensive
Excessive military spending was a big part why Soviet Union collapsed

oh god are those IB learner profiles I see on the walls
>the average redditor thinks that more books = more intelligence
You can't make this shit up
Harry Potter and other such fiction books are entertainment just like movies and games
Just because you read youth literature doesn't mean you're somehow smart
> These nutcases tend to whine for some weird reason
A piece of shit acts like it, who would've thunk it
I mean have you looked around
BLM has taken over the world but globally the effective genocides going on in China, Yemen and against the Kurds don't get anywhere near as much attention
They're not doing it anymore now are they
They got them from taxes paid to them mostly
The king of Belgium denounced the bruralities committed in the Kongo last year:
Also, nobody cares about your nazi ancestors
Hell, I think most of the Germans alive today probably had nazis somewhere in their family tree, but nobody goes around actively praising them and neither do they go around denouncing them because it seriously doesn't matter
And how exactly would you say they got their wealth unfairly
I'm not a monarchist btw, but I certainly wouldn't say that they got it unfairly
Being a monarch is a 24/7 job with very little privacy as you're constantly in the public eye
Add to that the fact that they have no real power anymore so it comes with few benefits that outweigh the negatives
Of course, monarchism itself is an outdated system and I'm sure it'll just fizzle out sooner rather than later, but there's no need to be angry at them today
You're just wasting your own energy on a subject that doesn't really matter anymore
Also, your flair says you're swiss
In what part of your life has the monarchy actually negatively impacted you
Actually, the correct translation is "rush B no stop". Very common mistake for beginner russian learners
Unpopular opinion, this metro doesn’t look good
What happened to the glorious ornate Soviet undergrounds
Tacky
That’s like saying Versailles is tacky
Look up the Moscow and St
Petersburg metros, they’re like a work of art
They’re clean and safe as well, I don’t really know why they wouldn’t be
Apparently I am Central European
Ahahaha, that's pretty wild
"Excuse me the fuck" - Estonians                             we are most definitely not central Europe
Eastern is at least tolerable, northern too, half nort half east imo
I’ve always felt we’re more central or northern than eastern european
Can Estonia into Nordic
Heh I don't care if this may be crazy but hell yeah we're central european now
Switch the colors around a bit and you have a low-effort r/PoliticalCompassMemes meme
And I took that personally
If estonia isn't northern Europe I don't agree
The Baltics Central Europe
What a joke
The [UN] and [EU] classify Baltic States as Northern Europe
>Culturally
Estonia aligns heavily with Finland in this regard, having linguistic and cultural ties
Much of our history has been tied to Sweden and Denmark
I’m not sure on which basis you’re saying Estonia is culturally Eastern Europe
Russian occupation didn’t affect our cultural identity
>Geographically
Estonia is further north than Denmark, so I’m confused
Sharing a border with Russia can’t be the reason we’re Eastern Europe as you could drag Finland along with that reasoning
>Socially
Not sure what this means, but Estonia shares social values with Scandinavia, not with countries further south or to the east
Since independence, the course has been towards a welfare society and we have a very high HDI today
That depends a lot upon what are your criteria
If it is Soviet occupation, then of course, we are Eastern Europe
If it is cultural traditions we are Northern Europe (Lutheran religion, traditions, historic ties etc
If it is geography, it gets complicated, even if you look at the map you see that Baltics are out of place, as they seem to belong to either Northern or Eastern Europe
But above all, there are nearly no criteria according to which the Baltics are Central Europe
What are you talking about
What is "culturally Eastern European" about Estonia
But Estonians don't want to be Scandinavians
You must be the first non-finnic person I've seen who says that it's easy to pronounce
I've given a taste of words like õlu to my German friends and yeah they cannot get it right
No, that's the ö
You guys actually belive china
That may not be as Italy has also reached their capability for tests per day
Isn't Turkey also the country with most imprisoned journalists
Since when has Finland owned the Estonian islands
Other than Soviet Finland having Saaremaa and Hiiumaa island, I'm totally ok with Estonia under Finnish flag
And what is with Poland what is Poland ?
I think we got the best deal out of this of them all
(other than *maybe* Denmark)
At least we're not Sweden
Estonia can finally into Nordic
It sounds a lot stronger when spoken in a Romance language
You know your languages, good for you
Spanish too is a Romance language
Had birds singing in the trees week ago
They are not doing it anymore
:D Tallinn here to refute your map, try not to get hit by the wind chill
It's colder than this picture
Enjoy this murderous weather while it lasts
It was -22, so I had to put on an extra layer
Looks like this year we are going Iceland for getting that nice warm sun
I was going to go to sauna tonight
I have changed my mind now
7° in Canada today
Please give us our cold weather back
Even colder today, someone capture the image in half an hour to match that of yesterday, sun is still lower than last time
20 minutes after yesterday, Portugal is warmer, but UK
Denmark are freezing, Scandinavia and Central Europe got properly cold, compared to yesterday;
I think cold winters with solid snow cover usually mean more mosquitoes in the spring/early summer
In a sense this could be thought of as true
More global warming allows more access to fossil fuels in the north, and at the same time more global warming means weaker gulf stream and colder europe, at least in the medium term
Maybe it goes to jungle in Europe and Greenland after, in the long term, or just dead
So better to sell all the gas as soon as possible
I'm kidding, I hope your empire switches to solar and wind and nuclear and geothermal, sooner rather than later
Could you explain the British response to weather
Is it really that you lack some ability or services to handle this weather
Chlorides on the roads, snow ploughs, winter tyres
Or is it more mismanagement and health and safety bs
How about those temps at 7 m/s wind
Currently at -14 C; 8,6 m/s; amounting to -28 C equivalent with calculated wind chill
Maybe my weather map is pessimistic, the canadians think wind isn't that big a factor, three degrees warmer
Atleast you guys have close to none mosqutios in Souther Finland in summers, atleast near Helsinki while I have been there, however in Estonia they are freaking everywhere
60 isn't 100, and I don't mean just self-consumed energy, but the exports
There is potential to export a lot of electricity and other products not based on gas
Gas is easy, but the customers aren't going to be there forever, not for the current volume; trace amounts at best
By altitude, you mean latitude
Works fine for Berlin, will work fine for Moscow
I know cloud cover is a bitch at St
Petersburg, and at that latitude the seasonal variance is pretty big
But I'm pretty sure you could float a solar power plant in lake Ladoga to supply almost all of December-January energy needs with room to spare
Combine that with wind and storage, should work out fine
Check out the cost drop trend of high efficiency panels
High efficiency panels is a must this far north
Geothermal is tricky since it is non-renewable in that using it pushes the thermal gradient away, so you have to keep drilling new wells
But what I mean is hot dry rock, super deep geothermal, not volcanic miracles that are Iceland and Kamchatka, where nobody lives
Also as an efficiency booster for heating systems
Might not be economical now, but when nobody is buying gas, there are unemployed qualified drillers, for a while
Geothermal as part of heating systems could help take the edge off the 12-fold difference between December and June difference in insolation near Petersburg, shouldn't bed that bad further south
I think maybe that's only because you have too many trains
Have you tried having less trains
Maybe that'll work better
I'm kidding, trains are great, but playing with more than 10 is not fun
I'm not talking about Russia dominating the world nuclear industry, which in it's current form has little growth potential, due to it's excessive cost
Needs smaller, safer, lower maintenance and cheaper to install reactors
It's a diminishing market in the face of aggressively cheapening alternatives
I'm talking about domestic energy production, I'm talking about growing this number, which you already seem to have already set goals to reach 25%
> [In 2012 total electricity generated in nuclear power plants in Russia was 177
3 TWh, 17
78% of all power generation]
Exporting nuclear technology is not going to replace the major export industries, demand for mined resources is likely to grow, while demand for fossil fuels is likely to drop
I mean, maybe it's good if fossil fuel exports dwindle
You do make 70% of your electricity from those fuels, maybe it gets cheaper for your own people
Let's not kid ourselves, solar, batteries and wind is going to cost less and less per joule generated and stored as the manufacturing base grows and matures and new technologies keep getting invented and adopted, much faster than traditional thermal power plants and burning stuff
[Apparently, Sweden and UK have similar passenger modal share, almost twice that of Finland, but UK has a lot more total passenger-kilometers (a factor of ten more) than sweden, as well as more rail network distance per area]
Which makes sense comparing the countries population densities

Damn, this sucks
He is half Estonian, how so
Edit: Regarding the downvotes
Ok, maybe this is not terribly important tidbit about him, but bear in mind that this was jokingly posted as an answer to an Estonian how is not pleased with the election results
Exactly, he is pro-EU and besides probably would be more receptive to listening of the Estonian side
I'm really pleased with this result
I see they're taking notes from the Italians
WW1 and WW2 reference

ngl, finnish is drunk estonian
Go and live in Finland, that's the only way
Don't worry - you'll always have Estonians who think that your language is ugly
I mean I also think that Finnish isn't exactly a nice sounding language, but it's not like Swedish is any better at all, it sounds like a bunch of alcoholics at 7am hugging their toilet bowls
Don't know any Swedish to understand the thread, but don't worry, we're on your side no matter what
*And so the Estonians were left crying in the corner
More vowels = the language sounding more drunk and a shitload of finnish words for things are basically estonian words with a vowel stuck to the end like lampu, üksi, kaksi, kolme, neljä, viisi, kuusi, hotelli, passi, bussi to name a few
That's not even mentioning how many words just have a a lot more umlaut vowels
Well Finnish speaking ones mostly as basically every alcoholic in my family has or is working in Finland and speaks the language

To everybody saying "it's not 100 years, there was an occupation".
I don't know who titled this post, but here locally, we don't actually celebrate it as "100 years *of* independence", but as "Estonia's 100th birthday".
Elagu Eesti

It is not 100 years of independence
Did we forget the Soviet Occupation from 1944 - 1991 ? lmao

Funnily enough, that's where I grew up
And yet there are political parties in Estonia who dont think that
The one currently in power has quite radically changed it's operating going from "agasint liberalism" to pro-liberalism over the year
As it quickly learns that communism doesnt really work in real life :D

Uhh yeah about that
Hmm
MI-6 has had some budget cuts and needs to update the database
We were independent from 1918-1940 as well and people use 1918 to count the age of our country
A link for those who also were curious:
See nimi
Sorry, sõber
I think we need to subtract the Soviet occupation from the 100 years, if we’re going to say “100 years *of* independence”. If we are referring to “100 years since the declaration of independence”, then 100 years is technically correct
Well, yeah the independence part is misleading
We are referring to age not independence, vennas
Yes,  the age of the day our independence was declared, not the overall age of the Republic
Exactly what happened
While the Nordic Council was formed, Estonia was occupied by the USSR

Can't be true, Estonians speak quite good English
Go to a gas station in Poland though and try to speak English and see what happens even though they're supposedly higher than us
My empirical evidence suggests this map is total horse manure
I've travelled fairly extensively in Poland and Hungary and locals were so terrible at English that in Poland I was better off using Russian (which I can't speak for shit btw) and in Hungary my mom had to speak in German (which she has only barely picked up watching German soaps)
Same applied to Latvia and Lithuania but that was over 10 years ago, maybe it has improved significantly over this time
Some stone or something went through Timo's seat, up in the ass of Timo
I don't call bullshit, been there three times no issues, locals were very helpful as well
I call bullshit on most of the red eastern block here though
I've had issues in Latvia for sure, trying to get from the airport to Riga coach station I got on the wrong bus and had to ask directions from locals, my terrible Russian was more helpful than English
Rallienglanti, kyllä. Always reminds me of this
Tbf Hollywood alone has been vital in spreading the exposure of English far across the world
You're speaking Swedish mate, English is the most normal language ever compared to Swedish or Finnish or Estonian
I very much disagree mate, if you want to learn any other language besides English you better move to a country that speaks it, using duolingo or whatever on its own is useless, you almost immediately forget everything once you pause
If I didn't consume 95% of my media in English I'd never have learned to speak it and I'd forget it it within a few years
I studied Russian for four years, German for three and Spanish for two
Most of that time was wasted as you cannot learn to speak anything like that
Putin does, and unfortunately it's all that is needed for Lukashenko to hold his power
yeah with that name, I have a feeling OP isn't actually posting this just because he's outraged by sexism

Well I think its the regulations put in place
&#x200B;
Norway, Switzerland are arguably quite small countries population wise so they have a fairly good reaction time and results when it comes to making political, economical changes that the countries people accept
&#x200B;
Theoretically everything EU has can be done as an EU partner also but the negatives of EU are also its positives
You simply are apart of the common zones, free economy and peoples movement etc
You don't have to regulate with every other country while having to abide to some rules EU as a whole votes for
&#x200B;
So UK being this, former world ruler, still has a lot of red tape to cut trying to negotiate with everyone and the EU trying to solidify the position
I'm sure in like 50 to 100 years they might be come on top as they could regulate better deals then EU itself (more so an EU that is battling the rise of far right, so also a little bogged down in terms of regulations)
&#x200B;
Practically though it became a shit show
As usual "divide and conquer" got in the way, people weren't happy May's flavor of Brexit and everyone starting fighting how to Brexit so they might never make it even to that stage
Never mind building up the ties and relations with countries after Brexit
So time is money and as far as I understand the UK haven't been as effective so with every passing month they are losing money that they supposedly would of gained by being apart of EU
&#x200B;
Also a little bit of "It's the EU's fault
Oh shi
now we are on our own, well it's Theresa who is to blame now
" , we have just reached the stage where every more vocal politician is at the head of Brexit negotiation so
I don't know who to blame now

Excellent, the effects of Estonian culture are finally taking hold
Lithuania is a Catholic country that was once part of the  Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and became Christian voluntarily
Estonia was made Christian by German and Danish crusaders that brought the religion here "with fire and sword". Also it later became a protestant nation
Estonians never really embraced Christianity fully, except perhaps in the 19th century
It was always mixed with paganism, which the foreign nobility and clergy overlooked for their own convenience
It has never formed a strong part of our identity, especially as it was brought here by crusade and was often a sign of foreign rule
Add to it heavy Soviet anti-religion policies from the 1940s onwards and you have yourself a society where religiousness is seen as an oddity - a respected oddity, but an oddity nonetheless
Going to post my reply from the deleted thread
Lithuania has been at the forefront of this issue in Europe right now
Mad respect to them and they can count on Estonia’s full support
There is a transitional council formed by the opposition which had a meeting today
One way to get rid of Lukashenko is for his commanders and government to lose all trust in him
This could be done by making sure the lower ranks start siding with the protestors (like law enforcement and factory workers) and ending in the higher ranks distrusting him
CGP grey made a great video called The Rules for Rulers
When you lose all your keys, you go crumbling down with your system
However I 40% believe Lukashenko will be assassinated by some means

The word resembles Pizdjets to me in style somehow
Same
You can get a half liter bottle of water for like 30 cents in Estonia
At the airport iirc it’s 1
60 for a liter
Water shouldn’t be expensive
It's been around 10-15 degrees and raining non-stop for the last 2 weeks here in Estonia, not sure who came up with 18 degrees on this map
but we definitely don't have any heatwave
Sauce
It hit 22 degrees today when the prediction was way below 20 and I’m wearing an autumn coat
And the best part is I’m in Estonia where your high is marked as 17-19 degrees for my country
yeah
fuck him
problem is that Estonia doesn't have coal
1 prime minister per log
Hahaha, someone has edited the english page to refer to Ratas as 'Sitaratas'.
In direct translation it means shit wheel
The main reason IMO is that Ratas - as an actual centrist - is attempting to play by the rules of the liberal establishment, which makes him a weak spot in the coalition
In any kind of scandal or "scandal" regarding EKRE, for example if one of their politicions called abortion murder, the media would not go and speak to EKRE politicians themselves
Because they would double down on what they believe in and not give a shit about the media
Instead, the media goes to Ratas and ask him about how horrible it is that, for example, Soandso called doctors murderers
To which Ratas would meekly agree that "this is unacceptable blah blah", both validating the criticism and making himself look weak and hypocritical
Statelessness allows them to go visa-free both to Russia *and* the EU
While also being fully fledged EU citizens
Estonian citizens need a visa to go to Russia
Many of them identify themselves as Russian, they have family in Russia
Btw, after a change in the law in 1995, all children born in Estonia after 1992 may obtain Estonian citizenship unconditionally
There's very good reasons the situation is the way it is
It's the result of 30 years of people having 3 choices
If you force it in any way you'll end up angering some people and giving Russia a way to stir up problems
Sure Estonia could've done some things better but it's a very delicate situation
I will never not miss Andalucia
*cough cough* estonian city *cough cough*
I think you're confusing Pskov with Pechory
Pihkva, yes
It actually was an Estonian territory in the first Republic and if I'm not mistaken even in the russian empire
The whole region used to be ours
"Petseri County had previously been part of the Guberniya of Pskov, and belonged to Estonia in 1920–1944
The territory of Estonia covered an area of 47 549 km2 in 1920–1944, nowadays it covers an area of 45 339 km2
And read the end of the first paragraph here :
That speaker rig
no, that's the president
That's the most Russian government thing to say
Also this isn't a protest, just a very crowded street
Welcome to the party ladies and gentlemen, pleasure to have you all here
This comment section is such a wholesome gold, everyone now wants to get on the list
Aha
Estonia moving up in the world
I am also surprised what did the Aussies do to offend the great glorious leader Putin
Out of curiosity, what do you think the Bronze soldier incident was
what the fuck are you smoking
sputnik
i hope you forgot /s
As far as I understood, they were accepted to participate because they are very big fans of the contest and are willing to wake up at 5AM to see it live
You recall wrong both otherwise thats the gist of it tho its a lot more complicated than your summary
Why do you spout such bull about Estonia being next and furthermore because of Bronze Soldier
Im telling you this as an Estonian living in Estonia, who has had to research into politics and be updated on recent developents
We arent going to be next
Im just fascinated on what you base such claims on
But then your claim is just a guess
You dont take into account  major differences between Ukraine and Estonia
They wouldnt be able to gain the support of the majority of ethnic Russians here
The Pskov oblast is a lot poorer than Estonia so the greener pasture thing wont hold
After 2007 we have become pretty good defending against misinformation and cyber attacks
This brings us to NATO´s  [CCE COE] and the  [Enhanced Forward Presence] which act as a deterrent
[If you have time to use Google translate on this page, you should check it out( it also is relevant to the first paragraph)
Now for the EU part: its not a military organization but all its members, especially Eurozone is very ingrained and in many ways act more like a country than a union of countries
So the Western EU couldnt afford to just sanction and softly protest
Also i would like to mention that we have been able to market ourselves really well on a global stage, which matters
So it would be too risky and useless to do an Ukraine here
A soft annexation of Belarus would be more likely or even expanding more into Ukraine but by no means im saying that it will happen
To your edits: Estonia doesnt border Kaliningrad and our borders are either water or bogs for the most part
There is no outright hostility between people
I think its not so much about the spirit of Nato and more about the open conflicts and the rest of the stuff going on like the plague and NS2 just to name a few
They didnt let us join with open hands as well and we had to jump through quite many [hoops
]  Referring to the article the best example is: ".... no quarrels with its neighbours and for border issues to be resolved

Estonia monoculturalism is "shining" through tough, then again out of these groups we probably only have Jews so the unknown is uncomfortable

If this shit happens, No law can stop the internet,
We fight
We share
We still make memes, content
In 1994 the Estonian country of Ida-Virumaa had a homicide rate of 64/100k
Idk about Moldova but Latvia is one of the baltics, post ussr countries and I heard from a Lithuanian that their rates were pretty high as well, it might have to do with that idk
Gun go boom, there is a reason why Eastern Europeans talk about the crazy '90s.
Its population is majority Soviet occupation era Russian immigrants
> pretty small city
> 620,000
Does not compute
And the capitals of Lithuania, Estonia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Portugal and Ireland are smaller than that with Latvia, Finland and Denmark having capitals that are only slightly bigger in terms of population
Small city my ass
EeLäLe
Both the population and area sizes follow that too
Estonia being the smallest

Ehm, there are places and beers where 8€ is a fair price, but most likely you payed that for a 20c to produce beer
Actually during Covid (summer) it was the first time in
a lot of years since I went to town hall square to have a beer there
Below 4€, while it would've been 8€ just a year before
ahahahhahahahaha
No, we just want people to spell the name of our capital city correctly
I'm sure you wouldn't like it if Warsaw was misspelled frequently
It's like the other person said, we just want it to be spelled correctly
If I can spell Worcestershire, the UK dude can spell Tallinn
Well it is with one *n* in Russian, so that can be a thing, sometimes
But "Talin" is just
I dunno what that is
Then it is difficult to say
An off the mill beer costs 1-1,30 in a shop, while a price of 3€ in a bar would be considered fair
While a local craft beer can be anything from 2€+ in a shop
More likely 3€+
10°C xd
Currently 20°C at 1632 in South-Eastern Estonia, i'd say its mostly 12-20° with quite common heavy rain and sometimes thunder noises

Yeah, we have similar systems for fishing etc
For example if you go fishing on a lake you have to buy a ticket for that location online, in an app or send a paid sms
Wait, what
Not a single higher spot in Estonia, but a few bumps in Latvia and Lithuania
Do your research, we have huge "mountains" compared to them =)
Oh yeah, and forests
We have one of the most forested countries and
not even a bush
Anyways, nice map
Debated many Russians with this view who even admit Manilas false flag
The end result is usually "We kind of knew Finland would be pro-German so we attacked them first" which I find even more frustrating
Similar argument with Poland "Well we needed to grab the land as Germany would of grabbed it anyway". So you become an aggressor and kill another countries soldiers, generals and you somehow are mad that they object to it
Same reason with Baltics, you start your usual USSR oppression and are mad when a bigger percentage join the Germans in the fight as Germany occupies the land from the USSR (some joined the Soviets, some joined resistance, some escaped to the West and some became also more or less paramilitaries for a third party as Finland might be considered)
I "thank" Winter War because Finland stood up and that kind of leaves a big black spot in USSR/Russian history as they can't really claim moral superiority during WW2 era, forever more or less
I do also agree and know that the Russian spirit brought down the Nazi war machine as most Germans died on the Eastern front, I contribute this to the ordinary farmer Russians and not the USSR leads who were technically as bad as Nazi German leaders
IMHO the war was a lot more grey than black and white, Hitler obviously took the cake with his ideas of trying to eliminate an entire race on stupid eugenic principles, tracing bloodlines and whatnot while leaving close friends with Jewish blood who he liked alive so
a very sad and strange period of human and European history
We got rocketry and medicine off the ground, no need for WW3 guys
Maybe space battles
(Poland can join as a middle man)
I like how they *technically* don't say that Finland shelled Mainila but instead say that some guy wrote in his memoirs that he got a message that they had done so
They've had a lot of practice with disinformation after all
Wait up, we coming too
YOLO
Hey, Soviet Russia was Orwell's main inspiration for that concept
I don't think many people are surprised that Russian state controlled TV is full of lunatics
Technicalities, Baltic SS legions were acquitted of crimes as they were SS by name but not by formalities is the short version
A comparison would be "Nike/Adidas" and "Nice/Adibas", Germans by 1944 didn't really follow any assembly instructions when getting men to fight for them as new units were made
It is in utter bad taste though as the letters SS kind of represent the worst in Nazism fanatics and the Baltic units were named after that
In reality all sides can commemorate, in Estonia German side gathers near Sinimäed, Soviet side used to gather in downtown, now they gather in the military cemetery due to a infamous Bronze Soldier
Both sides hold speeches and proclaim what a great fight it was, a little vodka is passed around and both sides commemorate in their own way
So to Russians I say stop looking it from your hill, Estonia as many others were dragged into the war, we were very adamant on our position, neutral but Soviets had to force their mutual defensive pact and march soldiers in our territory
So just because a person gets conscripted into an SS unit he is by default non equal to a person who got conscripted into a Soviet unit
Nah, our northerners are even weirder

What's the difference between farming for meat and leather vs farming for fur
Seems like the real solution would be to improve standards/update regulations
Outright ban to me seems unnecessarily drastic
Looking at the historical perspective meat has for most of human history been a luxury product only for the holiday table of the common man and I can't really see how fur or leather is any different
There are cultures that do not eat any meat and are totally fine
I have a feeling that some of the ban advocates are Greenpeace types that don't really seek compromise and are totally willing to make false claims or exaggerate
you dont even know

Funny thing to most people is that sauna keeps going no matter the heat

Low maintenance and very low operating cost for sometimes substantial amount of heat generated, too bad the system is expensive to set up for an existing house
Oh, these are good too, just in my town the ground pumps seem to be the most popular variation
What, how is Skype Swedish
One of the founders was from sweden, but the technology is from Estonia, and their main office is here in Tallinn, next to my office

I'm starting a petition to make "European Union" an actual country where every European Union average is withheld, be it wage, population, utility bills, land mass, happiness, female to male ratio etc etc

How old is it
My favourite bit from Asterix was when (it was one of the many issues where they dealt with the Romans) Caesar was with his companions and said something along the lines of "and now we'll go eat
You too, Brutus" and Brutus was having this inner monologue "he's getting on my nerves with this "You, too Brutus", one day I'll show him". They had many real-life moments integrated in to the stories
Asterix comics were so much fun

One suicide in Vatican would put its suicide rate at 100 in 100 000

Are you sure you're still talking about beer
That's logical, because growing tomatoes here in the north is more difficult, and not everyone could have grown them like

At least not in such scale as potatoes, so that you could eat them every day
I was thinking to go on Sahara desert tour this year, but I think I just travel Poland and save some money and have same experience
I recently worked on a software project, which involved scraping "random" recently updated websites and this or similar messages appeared on about 20% of all websites, which my scraper saw

Or maybe they weren't selling the data in the first place and there's no way to justify the additional cost of the liability and compliance that the regulation places on them
We had an online game shut out European users
It's not like they were selling that data
No it isn't. Every web server by default logs things like IP addresses, which is personal data
It's not
Except those are not the only conditions of GDPR
Just having to read through the regulation and being fully aware of its implications costs tons of money even if you don't have to do ANY changes

Honestly, if you were the creator of some technology-oriented thing like a website or application then I do not see why you would keep it in Europe
The situation here is not favorable: just look at what you have to deal with to sell something inside the EU
You have to report to *every* tax authority of every nation that's part of the EU just for VAT
The EU does not have a good environment for starting business that are web-oriented
Yea in Estonia education is a major thing
Its so weird to feel yourself in Spain but than realising that 3 days ago it was shit apocalypse
I think I have seen everything now
Couple of years ago it was snowing in the middle of June
Today it was 27*C and I had my toes in nice cold snow pile
Strangest feeling ever
Most bizarre thing was last week - it still felt like very early spring / late winter
Now suddenly it is middle of summer
The temperature feels amazing but it's hard to use your brain
Just doesn't really function anymore
Hell yeah we finally get some warmth too
I was looking at the tempature on a day to day basis
A few days ago it was 3 degrees, the next day it was 23 degrees, the next after was 28
We essentially skipped spring and went straight to summer
I thought I was going crazy
Same here send help
This
I had the weirdest day today in Estonia
Also in a place where they had like 25x25m snow pile and 25-28 degrees
So obviously we had a snowfight in the heat
Weirdest experience I had in a long time
Definitely is pathetic, goddamn slowflakes, I walked around outside and it was fine, hot compared to +5 degrees it was just a week ago but fine

Hi Julia
I love that you're fighting for us and for a free internet
Now that this issue has gone so far and it has become obvious that we the people need to raise our voices, could you give us some suggestions on what to tell out MEPs
I myself am Estonian and thinking of contacting my MEPs but unsure of what to write for them and what to do to make them take us seriously
This issue needs a better spokesperson than a young woman with Bieber's haircut
Aight boutta move a country over, might check up on an old discord friend too
Regarding Estonias internet and prices, i think my dad got a pretty good and cheap deal that telia is trying to trick him out of
Same here, I usually won't bother watchin videos
It's faster to read something that to watch someone talk about their stuff
Speaking speed < reading speed
It's that simple
Especially bad if the video sucks and doesn't talk about what's promised, then I have wasted minutes of my time, that could be spent somewhere else (reading some other stuff on reddit usually)
That's some good humour
You should be a stand-up comedian
/r/SweatyPalms/ it is too tall

Whatever happened to British people sarcastically hating 'krauts' and 'frog-eaters' out of spite and jealousy, and just for the fun of rivalry and not routed in actual xenophobia
Those were the good old days
Why no one likes Estonia
Sadly yes
I didn't say dislike
It's one of the top countries in terms of average height and it has a low crime rate
And Estonia likes Finland
Thank you

Work night = töööö
Ööklubi* - nightclub for non-weirdos
You have to put a -d (ööd) at the back if you want to say good night in Estonian (head ööd)
Yup, hyphenation is optional, but öötöö is a legit word though, doesn't even need a hyphen, literally the word for night-work/nightshift
Jää-äär is another one of these
Means edge of the ice
You might understand it as a joke, but honestly the pic describes it perfectly

Really explains why every prominent Russian during that era came from the Baltics or Germany
Same-ish situation in Estonia
Estonian area was an autonomous zone where Baltic Germans rules the land and German was the language of administration and the cultural elite
Only during the Russification period did Russian Empire try to change it
What's up with Estonia is a better question
Why was the Karjala area so highly populated relative to the rest of the country, better farming land and Lake Ladoga
Swedish Empire had universal education and this was not dismantled by the Russian Empire
Sure is, I love reading but it's such a time investment that with all of the other entertainment being available it's very difficult to get started with a book
I think I can count the books I've read since starting university in 2014 on one hand, certainly on two
I definitely know about that, my great grandfather was an Ingrian who grew up in a village south of Leningrad
Sometime during WWI he was forced into the Red Army where he mainly built bridges and when he finally got back to his home village in what must've been 1947 or so most of it had all been destroyed so he went to live in Northwest Estonia
There's more to this story but unfortunately I, the biggest history nut in the family, was born a bit too late and the stories he personally told me were both confusing ( as he was a bit senile) and I didn't have context for them as I was about 13 when he died
Still I do remember some bits about being bombed by German planes though
[UK has an opt in service here] signed up a couple years ago and the calls stopped within a week, haven't thought about it until now
I didnt get many robo-calls but I did get UK based call centres ringing and asking for the homeowner
Opt out services are better though since most dont know, or cant be bothered, especially the elderly, who I would guess, are more likely to pick up and give these people the time of day
Nah, I'm good right here
So is this heatwave directly caused by climate change or is it just contributing
No thanks, we are already melting with 25C
Can someone give me a quick summary of what's going on
Those fees are exist because accepting card payments costs to the merchant
These fees should be presented to the end customer by charging more for using the credit card option instead of making the product more expensive for all payment methods
This law sounds like it was lobbied by credit card issuers or processors to push out other cheaper payment methods

The "average" wage is pretty deceiving, as it doesn't show divide between regions and different income classes
For example in my country the difference between the richest (capital) and poorest region in the average wage is more than 500 euros
Median wage is also significantly different from average - almost 300 euros lower
For majority in eastern Europe travelling is luxury
Even those who do travel, usually go to neighboring countries with similar prices
Traveling itself is not that expensive, while accommodation and eating in restaurants definitely is
People just work around both of these by staying at cheaper places and eating store-bought food or food that they brought with them from home, depending on how much they can afford
We honestly wouldn't be there without the very open and always helpful Finnish and Swedish markets nearby
Of course it has a downside as well as our prices are more inflated than in most other post-socialist countries
Portugal is actually behind 8 post-socialist countries in terms of wage (PPP)
Prices are lower
Estonia's average gross wage in spring 1992 was 16
4 euros
Right now average net wage is 42% of that in Finland
If you take the difference in prices into account, then Estonia's wages are about 70% of that in Finland
It's pretty logical that the offset from the mean is larger above-mean than below-mean, hence why the average is way above the mean
Or Romania above Greece
Or Greece being barely higher than Macedonia or Albania for that matter
Growth will of course slow down the closer we get, but yeah, catching up to a reasonable degree within a few decades isn't something Utopian anymore
Also they have six toes on each foot
There really should be a graphic for it
All the best to Latvia
Congrats my southern neighbours,we had a shared struggle for independence and will be brothers forever
Especially now that almost everything is much cheaper to buy in Latvia(for the geographically uneducated,i live in Estonia)
Happy indepedence day from Estonia, thanks for selling our booze for half the price
The roadtrips down south makes us almost Nordic :)
Congratulations my little 6 toed friends
Congrats from Estonia
Your capital is the nicest in Baltics
They have Daugava
Dont worry it will change soon enough
Of course you have to tolerate hundreds of thousand of drunk Estonians, at least we keep to border area
How do you think we got what we have
20 years of drunk Finns spending hundreds of millions
We dont buy just booze
Also building materials is very popular
