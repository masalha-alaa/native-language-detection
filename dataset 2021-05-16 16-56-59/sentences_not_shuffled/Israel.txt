This shit happens everywhere
Israel had Yemeni immigrant newborns kidnapped in the 50s as well
Do you think the reunification was a bad move
Yeah, like I sometimes say terms that make sense in English but not in Hebrew
Translating things like "I'm gonna take a shower", or "could you take a picture of me" makes zero sense translated, but I say it often because the do in my head and I don't notice
Yeah
I even think in English
My friend says that my Hebrew is getting worse and I don't even notice it (since I combine English with Hebrew or just directly translate sentences from English)
> Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Only one thing bothers me - capital letters
Same here
But
English and Hebrew are even more different - Hebrew is not even an Indo-European language - and there's even differences in the alphabet departments
(Can't have a mess with capitalization rules of the hebrew alphabet has no capital letters \*taps forehead\*)
Hold on, people didn’t like it when you spoke English with a Finnish accent or when you had the neutral English accent
Personally, I love it when people have an accent while they’re speaking English
Maybe just because it makes things more interesting
There have been a handful of times, while I was traveling, where I’ve mistaken a Dutch person for an American because their English was so good
But many do have an accent
The guy who works at a nearby office but joins the rest for parties

We're the guy who was fired, so he set up his own little company
We would be the annoying businessman who started his own little startup company, and goes around looking for investors
Germany eventually gives up and pays him to leave, after being accused of being racist for not investing

Today the familly my came to house mine
Uncle one and the familly his no can to come, because that they flew to greece
To my opinion to fly now is missing point because that need to stay in quarentine to length [2]weeks when return, and they flew only to 3 days
Very easy to understand that the sentence the this
Without a second thought

What would my jewish mother do without her food
I've always found it interesting how similar the English word "Seven" is to its Hebrew counterpart - "Sheva"
Well if you talk about Germany to an Israeli they'll think of Nazi Germany but being German in Israel is fine
Only if the EU does anything people here don't like
It's pretty common
People who worry often filter the tap water, but I think that more often than not it's tap and not bottled water
Due to the climate we also need to drink quite a lot, so bottled water would also be expensive and inconvenient
Always
I often translate phrases directly from English, without noticing that that's not how you say them in Hebrew or that they don't make sense in Hebrew
Wasting water
In translated shows sometimes characters leave the tap on for a while without using it, and it always made me cringe, even as a kid watching cartoons
It's something you just don't do here
Well than you'll hate Israelis, we always put either mustard or Tabasco on our schnitzels (if you can even call them that, because our schnitzels are made out of chicken)
In Israel "Russian" is used more as an umbrella term for both Russians and Ukrainians, since mostly all of them speak Russian at home (I think)
It is probably a generational thing here, because my dad's Ukrainian co-worker always gets offended when jokingly called "Russian" by my dad, whereas my friends casually call our Ukranian friends "Russian" and they don't mind (at this point I don't even remember which are Russian and which are Ukrainian)
Can you not even dip the schnitzel in ketchup
How do you do the X in X in your flair
Because I'm both Israeli and German, even though I live in Israel and I wanted to do Israel/Germany as my flair
I want to see the "Z" key on a Polish person's keyboard
Jesus christ
I advise you not to come to Israel then
Well it's very popular here (though considering we only have one food that originates from Israel, the Ben Gurion Rice or Israeli Rice, it's not too surprising)
I'd love to visit Austria someday
To be honest, I'm not as interested in the Jewish history in Austria as just general history
I also hear Austria is a very beautiful country, I saw a picture of an Austrian town placed right beneath the Alps
It's only a shame that I won't be able to visit the town of Fucking since it changed its name

Jokes aside, it's a great scene
Many actors try to speak Hebrew too and I find it very cute
I understand why this scene was not that dramatic to you but for me it's a scene that I'll remember for the rest of my life

Israel's constitution is actually a series of basic laws, each being a different chapter of the final Constitution they're all supposed to be consolidated into sometime soon
The one which will become the first chapter is the infamous Nation-State basic law:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people
The Nation State basic law is literally ripped straight off a draft constitution written by a far-right NGO
And I would have preferred using the Israeli Democracy Institute's "Constitutiton by Consensus" proposal much more
*That* proposal's first article reads:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The State shall be called "Israel".
> (b) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state
> (c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens
> (d) The system of government shall be a parliamentary democracy
I even outlined my "ideal" version of the Nation-State law, with "Constitutiton by Consensus" elements injected in:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination
> *(b1) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is *not* unique to the Jewish people
> *(c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens
> *(d) The system of government shall be a parliamentary democracy
Like I said, it's ripped off a far-right NGO's proposal
Actuslly, it's only a normal Act of the Oireachtas, the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 (the one which formalized Ireland's withdrawal from the commonwealth) that says "the Description of the State is the Republic of Ireland".
Though I am writing a constitution for a post-IndyRef2 Scotland, and my draft does have "The Description of the State is the Republic of Scotland" written in it
Absolutely not unique (E.G. Icelandic and Traditional Chinese), but it changed relatively much less in the last 2000 years
Hebrew has it too- Yare'akh (ירח) for any kind of moon, and Levana (לבנה) for our moon exclusively
One of Jerusalem's icons is a statue commonly called "The Monster". It's a big statue on a sandbox which kids (and adults) can go up into and slide down the Monster's 'tongues'.
Here's an image of it:
Western Wall and old Jerusalem
I can't really think of any examples of a film or series set in Israel, to be honest

Not even four days have passed, and you got me into a rabbit hole and knowledge about runka bullar
EXTREMELY OVERPRICED, like Lego sets go for like 150$ for a big set
[France and the UK have them too
Sun - female (shemesh, שמש)
Moon - male (yare'ach, ירח)
If you go into poetry you might see the word "Levana" (לבנה) for the moon, which is female
That word isn't used outside of writing though
The Moon (HaYareach) is Masculine, while the Sun (HaShemesh) is Feminine
And yes, these have pagan origins
That's more or less how the ancient Canaanite Sun and Moon gods, Yarikh and Shaphash (see the resemblance
) were called and gendered
All the times I've been to Europe were great, the worst thing that I remember happening was when I forgot my Switch charger at the hotel and found out after I've already returned to Israel, but even that wasn't too bad because my uncle who lives in Germany was able to pick it up and send it to me
When I was in Cyprus I kept wondering how cars were going with no one in the driver's seat
Hitler
Close second is jesus (the nickname he was given by the rabbinate of the time literally means 'may his memory and name cease')
Benjamin Nethanyahu and Benny Gants : basically I'll sum it down quickly,in the Knesset which is the parliament of Israel you need a percentage of seats to become prime minister,so there is 2 main parties and they both hate eachother, Likud (right wing,ran by Nethanyahu) and Blue and White (centrist left ran by Benny Gants)
So we had a period where noone won the election twice so on the 3rd election it was gonna happen again so Benny Gants gave the votes that were for blue and white and gave them to the Likud party
Is it because we are better bankers
I'd say pretty hard, mostly the genders in singular and plurals
For example, for objects that are male, their plural form would end with -im, and female plurals end with -ot (for the most part)
So you get stuff like para>parot (cow>cows), or kadur>kadurim (ball>balls)
However, sometimes this doesn't apply, for example on the word "beitza" (egg) which is female, but the plural form is "beitzim" and not "beitzot", or the word "av" (father), which is male, but the plural form is "avot". And sometimes there are words that are both male and female, like the word "ruach" (wind)
Numbers are also gendered - you could say "shalosh" (three, female) or "shlosha" (three, male)
This confuses even native speakers and we often use the wrong gendered numbers on stuff, and if we aren't sure of the gender of an object we turn it's plural into single, example again, the word "beitzim". "Kama betizim" (few eggs)>"betiza achat" (one egg, the 'one' being the female version)
If you're learning Hebrew academically, you will also get confused by different sentence parts, such as the different types of 'descriptions'.
Pronuonciations are pretty easy once you nail down the 'ch' sound
TL;DR it's a pretty hard language, and you will get confused by the gendered words
Israeli here: Pretty ducking hard
Hebrew itself is hard, especially for someone who is used to Germanic or Latin languages, and even worse for English speakers
At least we have two grammatical genders and no cases
But the writing system is weird and reading without nikkud requires a lot of familiarity with the vocabulary of Hebrew
Further more, each verb is written and said differently, according to the gender of the subject
There is הרים (has lifted, male) and הרימה (has lifted, female)
Same goes for adjectives and nouns
Some variations are written the same way without nikkud, but are read and spoken differently
The accent is hard to nail
It is hard for English speakers to say ח or כ (without dagesh) for example
Grammer is hard, too
People here sometimes crack jokes about Americans trying to pronounce "חריימה" and similar words with an American accent, and of post Soviet block Jews mixing up genders
So yeah, really fucking hard
Here is a common Hebrew blessing:
היבט האש, אינסוף, חדות שתיים!

Eilat
The whole city
All the hotels and cool touristy places are jam-packed, it's fairly far away from the rest of the country, so if you're going there you'd be inclined to stay there instead of visiting actual cool cities (like Tel-Aviv), and you only get full, dirty beaches or full, dirty swimming pools
Not to mention hoe expensive everything there is - it's cheaper for Israelis to travel abroad for a week than to stay in the country and spend a few nights in Eilat
If you want a good place on the beach go to Natanyia (bonus points if you know French)
Otherwise, you could go to Tiberias and visit the Sea of Galilee
Or, if you're not into water, you could come visit my hometown of Jerusalem
Dead sea really, sure it's the lowest place on earth and it's pretty famous but when you go into the sea all of your body becomes extremely scratchy
Are these normal coffee shops though
Any recommendations for a good website/book to learn about the Aboriginal sites and culture
I visited Berlin in Christmas 2018, it was really beautiful
It's the first time I've seen a place decorated for Christmas, let alone an entire city
I didn't actually visit for the history though, I went there because of Christmas and to visit my uncle
Let me see if I get this right: the English words "Coffee Shop" in the Netherlands mean weed place, and normal coffee shops are just called Cafés like normal, but are never reffered to as coffee shops
I don't really have any specific questions, so do you have any interesting facts about their culture
Thanks, I learnd something today
I'll try to remember that if I ever visit the Netherlands
That's really interesting thank you for posting that
But 56,000 years and 30,000 years don't sound quite right
\*Zdravljica plays in background\*
That sounds amazing
It has rained maybe 4 times since March here
And it’s constantly sunny
I hate it
Bulgaria was never Yugoslav lmao
probably why they are the balkan trash
The user who observed that southern Europe has a considerably different relationship with alcohol than wealthier, more reserved northern Europe seems to have been right on the money, at least if the comments here are indicative of reality (and I think they are)
Here in Israel drunkenness, especially public drunkenness, is not a major taboo, but it is kind of seen as trashy/embarrassing/dumb
From what I have heard and seen it is similar in Italy, Spain, Greece, etc
, where alcohol is common but drunkenness is not
I am originally from the United States and I actually think the OP is onto something about Americans
Drunkenness is definitely something expected (but not always appreciated) for college students
It is mostly a taboo among high schoolers because it is seen as dangerous for them and others (and it often is)
And for anyone over the age of 30 it is more or less expected that people should be married and at home with their family
It's  a sign of immaturity if you are 31 and out at a bar in much of the country
I think it's changing, though
Studies show that fewer and fewer teenagers drink alcohol and party in the US
But as people marry later and delayed adolescence becomes more of a thing it is far more common to see 30 year olds in a club or bar getting wasted and nobody thinking anything of it
It's a frankly weird dynamic in US culture where really young people are becoming kind of puritanical while everyone is becoming more libertine
There are none, though I'm sure that if we shared the same alphabet with Arabic we could understand a lot of it

Here it is common to have a flag and hang it outside the window on the memorial day and independence day (they are adjacent, today is actually the eve of memorial day)
It's also common to see car mounted flags on independence day
But you don't really need to own one since in the days before many stores give one with purchases of anything, from newspaper to food
Israeli here
Everyone I know has the blue and white banner somewhere in their garage
And even when it isn't independence day here, you can see a not very small amount of houses with flags flown outside of them
Same except synagogue
> The only time I remember a death being announced during a TV show was that of Yithak Rabin's assassination
Why would Austrian TV stop broadcasting because the Israeli PM has been assasinated
Yes, but actually stopping the broadcast instead of just making it the top headline
> Estonia and all the other Nordic countries
eesti = nordic confirmed
Probably Azerbaijan or India,like culturally we are different but we are great allies
The groom stomping and breaking a piece of glass, usually a wine glass or a light bulb

OP didn't want you to translate that phrase from english to irish, only to write it in english but according to irish rules
Naw, I love snow and cold climates
I’m sad I now live somewhere where is hasn’t rained since March 13th and it was 32C yesterday
It’s boring being sunny and warm every day 3/4th of the year
It's just nice to have a casual-ish conversation sub where Americans don't dominate every conversation
I don't even care what the topic is
I mean, Palestine
We make TONS of jokes about that being a fictional place
You can just take a few hours to drive to any city you want
Also people are more familiar with the different cities and locations around the country since, you know, there are less of them
I feel your pain with tech companies

smh Georgraphically speaking Portugal should be on GMT -1
> In short: Russia considers annexation to be the will of Crimean people who were against Euromaidan and following coup
There is a rather solid framework under that kind of claims to people's self determination, even though Russia and many other countries usually supress any kind of sepratism
Among Russian society, belief that Crimea should have been Russian was always widespread because of historical ties
Had the Crimean referendum been handled fairly, the option to join russia would have had 65% of the vote
But even that 65% majority is 34% less than the very-likely-doctored near-unanimous majority the official results give
It's very common for Israelis in high school to go on a trip to Poland
These are subsidized by the government and as such for many Israelis it is their first time abroad
Many of the teens who go on these trips don't actually care about the history and are more interested in shopping in another country
There's also the phenomenon of dumb kids who think they're somehow taking revenge against people who cooperated with the Nazis by just being assholes to people on their trip
Everything outside the continuum formed by the Haifa-Tel Aviv-Jerusalem metro areas is called the Periphery, and it is somewhat derogatory
An even more derogatory term is "the second Israel" - the population there is mostly Mizrachi, so it ties in the Inter-Edah conflicts as well
Not European here, and I think ALL Europeans dress well
In my country most of the time you wear a t-shirt or tank top, shorts and sandals or maybe shoes
That's it
I'm very happy about it as I have no sense of dressing, and those cloths are very comfortable

My mom is leaving Israel in two months for France, and I hopefully will be following and leaving in a year
The situation here is pretty much as you described
High rents, no jobs, we even have a literal criminal as the head of the country
Glad my mom was born in France and that me and my sister also have EU citizenships
It's happenned before and it will happen again
I think that not serving in the military would be far more controversial than not being born here
I gotta ask: what about a politician born in the UK
HaAretz (literary "the land"), widespread left wing paper
France, because we had Arab states surrounding us, seeking revenge for 1948, they had the whole mess with Algeria, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend
Unfortunately, this didn't last
Once the French let Algeria free in 1962, they decided to call the alliance off
Once the Six-Day War broke out in '67, France told us "you're on your own", stabbed us in the back, and took the Mirage 5 (a variant of the Mirage 3 co-developed with Israel for the IDF's needs) with them
We retaliated by stealing the Mirage 5's blueprints, building our own, and then improving its aerodynamics and adding American engines and christening what resulted as the Kfir
That explains why our ministers are so loud and energetic then
Israel has the same thing with Ness Ziona
Either a small town yeshiva student in some shtetl in poland/ukraine/belarus

The pharse "אין לי כוח" ("en li coach), literally translates to "I don't have power" and means you don't want to do something without saying you don't want to do it

Every building in Petach Tikva is a monstorsity
The whole city is a monstorsity
No one's really sure why it exists (if it exists)
Idk, I live in Jerusalem, most buildings are either old and ugly, very old and nice, or new and alright
Nothing really stands out
If the name didn't change over the last 50 years, the city's name is "LODGE"
Israeli here:
Lag Ba'Omer  is the holiday on which religious jews celebrate the beginning of Jewish Mysticism (a.k.a. Kabbalah), but for majority of Israeli jews its a celebration of Bar Kochba's early victories against the mighty Roman Empire in 132 CE
The wars we won (Independence War, Six Day War, Yom Kippur War)
We were out numbered and had to fight on a few fronts
Yom Kippur was espcially surprising, since most soliders were hungry and exhusted (since you don't eat on Yom Kippur)
In Israel we got rid of the 5 cent coins a long time ago
No one liked them, so now the lowest coin is 10 cents
This also means prices have to be rounded, so stuff would be 10
90₪ instead of 10
99₪
Yep, all prices are like that
It used to be that stores were allowed to make prices x.99, but since people had no reaslistic way to properly pay for that, the passed a law that requires prices to be x.x0
The swirlies are the symbol for the Shekel, Israel's currency
They look like the letters ש and ח together, which are the first letters of the name of the Shekel (New Shekel, Shekel Khadash, שקל חדש)
Israel here
we have ruins from every conceivable perion in both historic and pre-historic times
> Parliamentary democracy where the parliament elected by the people chooses (usually one of their own) as head of government, with a high degree of power over all affairs of state
The head of state is either a president elected by some form of assembly (Germany for example) or a monarch (UK, the Netherlands) in both cases the role of head of state is mostly ceremonial with political power being rather limited
There are also Parliamentary Reoublics with directly-elected Presidents, such as Slovenia and Ireland

just GET THE FUCK OUT OF EUROPE

I'd say the Wholesale Market/Gindi TLV complex, all the buildings flanking the Ayalon highway, and the start of Rothschild Boulevard
Outside Tel Aviv, the biggest contenders would have to be Modi'in and Charish

Knowing English is pretty much taken for granted for anyone under 40, but a lot of people also speak a third language - mostly Russian or French, since their families cone from those places
Tel Aviv with its 6200ILS (1560EUR) for a 1 bedroom apt joins the party
A few missiles incoming every couple of years launched towards the city are included, of course
Yup, it's really funny when you meet Danish tourists who think that Tel Aviv is really expensive and that salaries here surely are extremely high, only to find out the average salary here is actually closer to Spain's :)
A small time in 1956, and later on between 1967 and 1982, actually

The [Free State of Prussia] existed in the Weimar Republic until 1935 (de facto) or 1947 (de jure) tho
What's the difference in pronounciation
Pretty much noone other than Arabs and people with Arabic parents/grandparents speak Arabic here
Does that phrase not exist in English
It exists in Hebrew
Yeah, the Hebrew Academy
No one listens to what they have to say, though, and everyone makes fun of them
My school is next to a university where the Academy is placed, and it's so funny because you see how they have invested in paths and statues for all buildings except the Hebrew Academy, which have a tiny flight of stairs that you would miss if you didn't know what you're looking for, that leads to a forest that you have to walk through to get there
The building itself is nice, though
Tel Aviv and Jerusalem I guess
They are the largest cities in the country, both very important historically, and while Jerusalem is the capitol some countries have their emmbassies in Tel Aviv
Tel Aviv is considered very left wing and progressive, young and as the "big city". It has a lot of big malls, sky scrapers and more modern architecture
Jerusalem is considered more conservative, has a very large population of ultra orthodox jews, and overall has a surprisingly larger population than Tel Aviv
All buildings in Jerusalem are built with the same type of stone, the Jerusalem stone
There are also Be'er Sheva and Eilat, who are the largest cities in the Negev (the desert in the south of the country) and rival each other about which one is the "capitol" of the Negev
It's called "shtrudel" in Hebrew, like the pastery
no, nothing new in the middle east
your gas is not from Iran anyway
Mashina's ballad for a double agent
Hebew has two endings per mil, no endings per bil, and one ending for everything else
So 10^6 is milyon, 10^9 is milyard, 10^12 is trilyon, 10^15 is qwadrilyon, et cetera
Million is the same as English (מיליון)
Billion is "Milliard" (מיליארד)
Butting in when people ask stuff about European countries
Being pretty much the most controversial country in the world, if you bring up Israel it's always gonna be either I love Israel or I hate Israel
Many people do, but far from everyone
France looks like a star, and Denmark looks like the head of a dragon
Switzerland looks like a waterbear
It's really depends, if someone has a strong accent it's really easy to tell
But sometimes(especially americans) native english speakers have such a bad grammar that i question whether or not they're native speakers
In addition, there are a lot of schools in israel that teach you english with british/american accent- resulting in a yemen jew with clear yemenese accent in hebrew to sound like an upper class 20th century london man for example

Yellow journalism is the same as in English, journalism that's gossip-y and bad
I saw someone fron the UK commenting that it's the same in English, that's how it got to Hebrew
I don't know the origins of it in English though
It is used more commonly in Hebrew than in English, which is why I wasn't 100% sure that it was also the same in English until I saw that guy's comment

קדושה (Kdosha) - Holy
peace/piss/piece - native Hebrew speaker here - we unintentionally mix those words alot
Not just the same, its Identical
WW2 and Jews
hmm let me see
Tel Aviv is known for being the best place for younger people in Israel, Jerusalem is known as the best place for religious people and Eilat is known to be the best place to go on vacation by everyone in Israel
and that is how you brexit
so the UK, Switzerland, Greenland and Norway are stupid ???
I don't know if the list will get bigger
צ'כיה (chekhya) is the common term in hebrew, as opposed to הרפובליקה הצ'כית (ha-republiqa ha-chekhith) which sounds too official/blind translation from the english
It's just called the "Pfizer vaccine".
Complaining, more specifically about prices (though we would also win in general complaining)
We would like to compete
If you beat us we'll just call you and the judges antisemites (maybe that should be our sport)

We use QWERTY
Hebrew doesn't have accents, it has dotting, but everyone is able to read properly without dotting so we don't have that on our keyboards

Hummus, who makes it best and how do you eat it
~~Bare hands~~ Wipe with pita or with the fork
I meant with [pita] but yes, you wipe with pita
I've edited the original post so someone will not start to eat literally with bare hands :)
wait
what
how
red onions + Hummus is weird mix but I'm going to try it next time and remember this redditor ^
Literally every old hebraic names like Ahaziah, Jeoshaphat, Zimri or Baasha
All the time lol, everyone is concerned about stuff happening here
That's why I feel same
Imagine this but you still get rockets from Kosovo, terrorist from Bosnia, threats that Romania will wipe you of the map, temporary peace with Bulgaria and Hungary, Croatia in civil war that all sides are against you
Well, more or less it's same
a lot of things are different, yes
Just I find it funny :)
That the occupation of the West Bank is immoral, and even though we suffer from security issues much more than (almost
) any other Western nation, continuing the occupation isn't the only solution and we should look for more sustainable, moral ones
r/cirkeltrek lekt makkers
In Israel it's [arsim]
"baz" - a falcon, and feeling contempt towards someone (verb)
"tom" - end, and being naïve
"Lekales" not commonly used (archaic) but means both to curse and to bless someone
might be off topic but I for one would really want to see the latter spelled "požyčać sobie"
or even just "pożyċać sobie"
Italian just flows
When we first got independence until relatively recently
There just weren't a lot of Israeli born people
It's not usual but there are a lot of domestic abuse and murder reports happening right now
I don't really know foreign movies set in Israel other than stuff about ancient Israel, if you know anyone please comment
I know the 3 big ones: Germany, France and the UK
Not all the lyrics though
Never
Last time it actually snowed was like 2015 I think
Tbf it snows pretty much every year, but it doesn't stick, so you might have a bit of ice outside for a night, but after that it's gone
In Tel Aviv most people are fine with it,but in Jerusalem or a religious town
Oh god, that could go wrong
That he has purple hair
I think you can use both (we use the same letter for both s and sh for this word in Hebrew) but I prefer s
Other than the ones I know, Hebrew and English, I would choose: French, German and Arabic
French because my family is French and we want to move to France in the future
I am also currently learning it
German because then I could read what my family in Germany wrote before and during the Holocaust
And Arabic, since it's useful in Israel
They teach you how to read and write it at school but I could never get ahold of it, the writing just wouldn't get into my head
Well we had a war with Egypt because of the Soviets,it got us peace with Egypt so I guess it went well
that's the german rules for using commas - they're sued to separate suboridnate clauses there, not to mark breaks in stretches of speech
sauce: am hebreophone, we used to use the german rules for commas until 1994 ([for reasons I have explained elsewhere] where we switched to the english ones
David Ben Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel
He declared independence and won the war of independence
Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the man who revived the Hebrew language
Chaim Weizmann, first President of Israel
He was also a chemist, and one of the largest research institutions in Israel is named after him
And I don't know if it counts because he was born in Austria-Hungary and died before the country existed, but Theodor Herzel, who is called the Visionary of the State
He was one of the major (if not the biggest) players in the rise of Zionism that would eventually lead to the formation of Israel
We have a mountain in Jerusalem named after him, which holds a military cemetary, the highest national ceremonies and the national Holocaust museum - Yad Vashem, among other things
Any idea on what he was trying to say
In Hebrew the word for Hammer is "פטיש" (Patish) but when written in Hebrew it could also mean "fetish"
"Motek" means sweetie in Hebrew, sounds less cool knowing that
Is there a difference in pronounciations
We had spelling bee competitions

You vote for a party
Each party has a list of the ranking of their members (with party leader being #1)
After all votes are cast, they calculate how many seats each party got (120 seats total)
If a party got less than 4, they are out of the race and won't get any seats
If a party got, say, 14 seats, the 14 highest members of the party will get to become the members of Knesset
In order to elect the Prime Minister, the person competing for the job needs to first have at least 61 signatures (in a limited amount of time from the election) from MPs reccomending him to be the PM
Once the future PM gets these, he shows them to the President, who then allows him to start forming a government
If our future PM couldn't get 61 signatures but no other competitor could get them as well, the President reccomends whoever he thinks has the best chance of forming a government
In order to form a government, the PM needs to get at least 61 MPs to join his coallition (including himself and his party members)
In order to do that he can offer to give MPs different minister roles (BTW, the PM can just make new minister offices
That's why we have over 30 ministers in Israel, my favourite is the "Minister of Jerusalem" which is a seperate job from the Mayor of Jeruslaem)
Once you become an MP, you get have the seat until the next election
That means that the PM can also "steal" MPs from their party if he convinces them to join his own
And that's it
Once he makes agreements with 61 MPs or more , he becomes the PM and the head of the coallition
The head of the opposition is the leader of the party that got the most votes but didn't get into the government
_**TL;DR: you choose a party, the members of that party get seats proportional to the number of votes they got (120 seats total), the person who can get more than 61 MPs to join his government becomes PM**_
And in the middle of the Presidnet's term, too - a lot more sensible than the French way of holding Presidential and Parliamentary elections close
To be fair a government consisting of 61 memebers would be very weak and would fall in a vote of no confidence almost immediately (the votes of no confidence and the like can only be voted by MPs who are present at the Knesset at the time, so it would be very easy for the opposition to arrange for everyone to be present and outnumber the people of the coalition)
I think the current coalition consists of 76 members
However, I double checked and the number of ministers we have is 34, so it stays about the same ratio
(It is actually a real problem here
The country is already in huge amounts of debt and economic downturn, and now taxpayers have to also support the salaries of 34 ministers)
The benefits I see is that campaigning for legislative elections aren't held in the shadow of the Presidential Campaign, and that the Majority in Parliament can serve as an effective check on the President
Part of the reason the French President is so powerful is because his party always has a majority in the National Assembly, which gives him the de facto ability to appoint a loyalist Prime Minister and control the legislative agenda
For Israel: Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold)
Actually I (unfortunately
) had better luck with Israeli trains than with Deutsche Bahn
I only lived in Germany for a 9 months or so, but I had really bad luck almost every time I travelled long-distance, Especially in Sachsen
To the point that I would prefer taking Blablacar than the train if I knew I have to get somewhere on time
I think there's a thing called the "Tower Tour" visitors can take, in which the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wooden scaffolding, can be viewed
>!In case you don't know, quoting factiods from the wikipedia article, like me and u/orthoxerox did, became a meme since the Russians suspected to have poisoned Skripal did just that while claiming to be tourists
We preserve the original names in hebrew too
They're widespread in Israel too
קען איך אויך פארבינדן די פארטיי?
Why is that weird
Lot of people get Hebrew wrong but it's always warm to hear someone knows few words in your language
Shalom
Ohh same here
That's is really weird in fact
Even Chinese try to speak English which is much harder for them
We do
It's called "magav" (מג"ב), which is an acronym for "border guard". It's a branch of the police force that has officers specially trained in combat, whose roles are between soliders and police officers
From what I remember it was set up as part of the police force because we signed a treaty saying we won't have soliders on our borders, so we instead put "police" there
In the countryside normal police does the job, Magav is a force to deal with more violent situations
This is a big one: the Hebrew word for human, "אדם" (adam), is similar to the word for earth, "אדמה" (adama)
You probably know the story behind this one: how God created man from earth in the bible
We finish high school at 18, then a 2-3 years of military service, and then many people take 1-2 gap years to travel
I also took a volunteer gap year between high school and the militarily
So I finished high school at 18, and will start uni at almost 25
Others will finish high school at 18, the military at 20-21 and directly start uni at that age, so it really depends
The fast and furious series
Here in Israel, every carchase will not be stopped by our ever-vigilant police officers (who are better in harassing citizens, sexually assaulting their colleagues and giving you thousands of shekels in tickets for even looking at your phone\\dashboard than stopping criminals), they will be stopped by our always-furious drivers or by our big traffic jams
(Seriously, traffic jams are horrible here

We're not trans-continental at all and most Israelis won't identify as European (although I suspect a sizeable minority would, or at least would identify as an Aspiring European)
But- When faced with the above choice, most Israelis would say the feel more European than Asian
Even though we're not even partially in Europe, funnily enough
I guess it stems mostly from the fact that traditionally Israeli was banned from many competitions/organizations in the area (Soccer championships, Olympics Qualification, Basketball Leagues, Music Competitions, UN Security Council Regional Group, etc)
So in many aspects, especially culturally, Israel is more related to Europe than to Asia/The Middle East
But since English and Italian use the same alphabet, isn't confusing to read English code and then transitioning to reading Italian
Don't you sometimes try to read Italian in English/English in Italian

>Israel, because I’m in the process of getting Israeli citizenship
Awesome
We'd love to have you here :)
Are you also planning to move here, or is it more of a conveniency thing, as Israeli passport is sometimes more useful than a Russian one in some countries
(Totally no judgment in case that wasn't clear- I myself, an Israeli citizen, am in the process of getting a German passport for the same reasons)

Fair prices, especially for computer related stuff, for the price of a mid ranged phone we can buy a budget phone
Israel has duel citizenship, and it is great
A lot of people have more than one citizenship (myself included), and there are always ads everywhere to get a foreign citizenship for those who don't have one

Far too many to count, because hebreophones don't even notice most of the time
Late 19th/Early 20th century German had a lot of influence on the just-revived Hebrew, to the point that there's a sizable chunk of identical expressions shared by the two languages
For (one among many, many) examples, Hebrew and German have near-identical month names (the only difference is that Hebrew has the Au in August pronounced like English)
In Hebrew we call the Solomon's Camel, so there might be a correlation there
Edit: the word in Hebrew is גמל שלמה or gamal schlomo (read as if you're reading German) if anyones wondering

Well, first there's (idk how to describe it) "vibe" it's calming and soothing
The law dictates that everything must be built out of "Jerusalemic stone" which makes everything look old and experienced
The mix in population between haredics, islamic/christian arabs, jews, armenians and more is apparent in the workplace/streets(although neighborhoods are mostly separated
The masses of pilgrims who come to the city makes it unique
sitting on the shchem gate of the old city at night and seeing el-aqs'a shining from floodlights on the background of the almost black dark and peaceful old city quarters is an experience i wish anyone could have
Addition:
Terrorism is a thing in Jerusalem and it really scares people who live in different parts of israel to come to the city, but the bit sad truth is people that grew in Jerusalem don't notice most of the terrorism from it being an everyday thing

STUNTCEPTION
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Poland
>The government’s drive to subjugate the judicial system and a growing tendency to criminalize defamation are beginning to have an effect on the freedom of expression of independent media outlets
Some courts are now using article 212 of the criminal code, under which journalists can be sentenced to as much as a year in prison for defamation, although the civil code offers citizens all the protection they need if they are defamed
Even if the courts usually content themselves with fining journalists, the use of article 212 encourages self-censorship by the independent media
The Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza continues to be the leading target of government lawsuits
Partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces
Their new directors tolerate neither opposition nor neutrality from employees and fire those who refuse to comply
Many protests have been staged outside the offices of the management of the state-owned TV broadcaster TVP
After one of these protests in February 2019, the TVP evening news programme “Wiadomosci” broadcast video footage and personal details of ten of the demonstrators
TVP also filed a complaint against Polish ombudsman Adam Bodnar, who said its references to Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz amounted to hate speech and implied that this could have encouraged the person who murdered Adamowicz in January 2019
Serbia ranks 93rd on the list
Turkey ranks 154th on the list
Turkey ranks 154th on the list
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Malta
>Malta saw a change in government at the start of 2020 -- the result of weeks of mass protests in the country’s capital demanding resignations after numerous revelations linked the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia to the heart of the government leadership
Former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was forced to resign along with his chief of staff Keith Schembri, who has been linked to the journalist’s death in testimonies by those charged with her assassination
Yorgen Fenech, a director of Electrogas, arrested as the mastermind behind Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder to a shady energy deal she had exposed
The public inquiry into the journalist’s death and wider circumstances -- which the Maltese government finally launched two years after her death and only following pressure from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, among others -- is revealing a picture of political interference - intended to disrupt investigations and shift blame away from those at the helm of government
>In January 2020, a court in Malta ruled that government orders to clear tributes left by citizens at the protest memorial for Daphne Caruana Galizia in Valletta breached the activists’ fundamental right to freedom of expression
The constant clearing of the memorial, over almost two years on orders of the Justice Minister, was made with the “thought and specific intention” to create division while hindering protest and burying calls for justice
The weakness of the rule of law in Malta and the challenges it places on journalists have been documented in reports by major European bodies, including the European Parliament and the Council of Europe
Maltese journalists from six independent media houses told a delegation of MEPs from the European Parliament Civil Liberties Committee that they feared for their safety and operated in a culture of intimidation and threats
Media threats during the past year continued, with several documented instances of denial of access to information or press events, toxic rhetoric by government officials, failure to recognise non-State issued press cards, as well as unlawful detention of press members (including international press) following a press conference in late 2019
A report by RSF in collaboration with The Shift News documented press freedom challenges in Malta, including government officials directly targeting and attempting to discrediting journalists covering government corruption
Media ownership remains dominated by the two main political parties in the country, leading to propaganda and disinformation
Norway is number 1 on the list
Montenegro ranks 105th on the list
This is what the creators of the ranking said about Austria
>Political upheaval was triggered in Austria in May 2019 when German media outlets released a secretly-recorded video of a meeting in Ibiza between Heinz-Christian Strache – the then deputy chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) – and a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch
Dubbed the “Ibiza-Gate” video, it showed Strache ready to accept secret funding and electoral support in exchange for access to government contracts
The acquisition of a stake in an influential Austrian tabloid was also discussed
The ensuing outcry brought down the right / far-right coalition government and led to an early general election
This in turn resulted in a new coalition between Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s right-wing party, which still had the largest number of parliamentary seats, and the Greens, a party that claims to respect the highest press freedom standards, which entered into government for the first time
This new coalition has moved the government back towards the centre without affecting the still tense relations between Kurz’s conservative party and particular media outlets, which continue to be denied access to certain government-held information
Norway ranks 1st on the list
This is what the creators of the ranking say about Greece
>Centre-right New Democracy party enjoyed a landslide victory over incumbent Syriza in the July 2019 general election
Soon afterwards, a new presidential decree, placed public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
It remains to be seen how this new set-up will affect press freedom in the country
Elsewhere, journalists continued to face difficulties in doing their job, with a reporter covering demonstrations marking the 46th anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising being attacked by police, a photojournalist covering the evacuation of a squat being arrested and detained, while the headquarters of the Athens Voice weekly newspaper were ransacked by an anarchist group
Ukraine ranks 96th on the list
The full list
>HOW THE INDEX IS COMPILED
>The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF
This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated
The criteria evaluated in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information
Norway is number 1 on the list
Russia ranks 149th on the list
Belarus ranks 153rd on the list
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Spain
>Elections in 2019 saw a breakthrough by the far-right party VOX, which came third in terms of votes
VOX has distinguished itself by its crusade against the media, with its supporters stirring up hate against journalists on social media and physically harassing them on the ground
Its leaders have had no qualms about publicly insulting journalists and refusing them accreditation for the events they organize
Hatred against journalist is not limited to VOX
In Catalonia, where the political climate is extremely polarized, journalists have been the targets of physical violence by both the police and independence supporters
Investigative journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment, with several being accused of violating the confidentiality of a judicial investigation and others being the targets of raids and searches
Even if most cases are eventually dropped, there is a growing tendency on the part of the judicial authorities and the police to override the protection of journalists’ sources and to obstruct investigative journalism

>  On 13 February 1975, Turkey declared the occupied areas of the Republic of Cyprus to be a "Federated Turkish State", to the universal condemnation of the international community (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 367)
Ohhh Aremenia
I've had an ongoing fling with an armenian girl
she had 5/10 face 10/10 body and 19/10 stories
I could listen (and would love to again) her talk about her country for hours
They are promoting hatred and in the case of the holocaust Antisemitism
The reason is simply, in order to believe that 6 million deaths were fake or largely falsified you would need a huge conspiracy to push that agenda
That means that you believe that the Jews have an agenda and are willing to make up these massive lies in order to pursue it
Because these claims all rely on the need of a massive cover up, those behind it are to blame as i have yet to see deniers say it was a bookkeeping error but an agenda done to discredit the Germans/ gain support etc
That just sounds like summer in Israel lol
Now show us the top class hospital of Romania
Deep state at work here
Jewish circumcised Israeli here
Yes, absolutely
A Jewish politician somewhere has to stand up and spearhead a bill to ban it, to avoid calls of antisemitism
Fuck this practice, and fuck everyone who supports it
[The medical benefits of male circumcision] mean that is it certainly not ridiculous at all
When you live in a country with a very high HIV rate, literally any reduction in getting it is huge and worthy of consideration
Two words "Universal Healthcare". If you travel to rural Africa, United States, Jungles of Southeast Asia etc then access to clean water to shower and medical care will be much more restricted and difficult to get
The USA is focused on our own bullshit but we wish you the best in yours

This is not how Journalism works
You need to specify why they were protesting
Were they protesting against the government
As in to change it or to protest against its specific law or action
Who organized it
When people ask how are you here, you always say "beseder" (בסדר), which is just the translation of "ok". No other acceptable answer
I visited Ljubljana right before the pandemic, at the end of august 19
It was beutiful
i really enjoyed the canals, the big castle in town, the food market near the church and the side trip to lake Bled and it's castle
Top one has 50% being Jews
The bottom one has no Jews
One of the sad differences
Palestinians held a 'day of rage' in the West Bank and Jerusalem against France
For the first time in decades - because of France - they view us as a lesser evil
&#x200B;
Thank you France for helping solve the conflict and helping normalize Israel in the Middle East

Wait
a map of Europe that doesn't have a Switzerland-shaped hole in the middle
What's sad is one doesn't know if islamists or anti-semitic Europeans are responsible for attacks like these
They differ if literally everything beside one thing: hatred for Jews
In fact, they sort of fit each other
edit:
literally from Palestinian hamas' charter (constitution):
>"The \[Jewish\] enemies have been scheming for a long time ... and have accumulated huge and influential material wealth
With their money, they took control of the world media
With their money they stirred revolutions in various parts of the globe
They stood behind the French Revolution, the Communist Revolution and most of the revolutions we hear about
With their money they formed secret organizations - such as the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs and the Lions - which are spreading around the world, in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests
They stood behind World War I ... and formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world
They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains
There is no war going on anywhere without them having their finger in it
" *(Article 22)*
First of all, that's good news
Doesn't change the point I made through my comment though
I agree our government should be criticised
The problem occurs when you have those critics believing Hitler should have finished the job
&#x200B;
Trust me the Islamic Jihad for liberation of Palestine, Hezbollah and IICR of Iran aren't fighting Israel because of Palestinian rights, they are fighting Israel because they hate Jews
r/angryupvote
Hey, something good coming out of Eur*pe
Such a mystery why these people have such a bad places as their home countries
It's true to an extent that Israeli actions could be viewed to an extent as anti Palestinian but . France doesn't occupy the West Bank and doesn't mistreat Arabs, and look you have shit like this
So imagine what Israel has to deal with
It will only get worse in the years to come
Kinda takes way too long to say lol
I am not sure if I am proud or ashamed that I knew exactly which two countries would be top
Well to an extent they did
>Hookworm, a disease of extreme poverty, is thriving in the US south
Why
>Children playing feet away from open pools of raw sewage; drinking water pumped beside cracked pipes of untreated waste; human faeces flushed back into kitchen sinks and bathtubs whenever the rains come; people testing positive for hookworm, an intestinal parasite that thrives on extreme poverty
The Southern areas are home to some of the most extreme poverty in the world
It's a map originally made by the Habsburgs to confuse the Swedish invaders
The ruse failed, however, as the noise made by scores of nobles being thrown out of windows gave away the location

No voting rights for bikes
Basically North Korea
Because unless a country signs a bilateral agreement with the EU, they need to decide whether to give visa free access to each country individually
Most people outside of Europe can't spell Croatia, let alone give them visa free access
Many countries signed bilateral agreements with the EU that give EU members visa free access to their country
The Micro-states being Non-EU countries are excluded from such bilateral agreements
Currently the strongest passport available for sale is the Maltese passport
Many countries signed bilateral agreements with the EU that give EU members like Italy visa free access to their country
The Vatican being a Non-EU country is excluded from such bilateral agreements
Depends on the year but right now the German passport is the most powerful
The figures are based on 223 distinct visa policies
There are places like American Samoa which are not countries by any stretch of the imagination, but nonetheless have their own visa policies
Yes, they absolutely would
Who the fuck were luxembourg and malta fighting
Regarding the Suez crisis the canal was seized months before, they failed to retake it
Tactically speaking they weren't defeated, they suffered a strategic defeat due to diplomacy failure and perhaps that they didn't advance far enough
I don't necessaroly agree, there's some merit in separating milotary results from strategic victory
A definitive proof that Israel is the only permanent safe place for Jews in the world
Anti-semitism is rising in Belgium
Why is that
I'm personally a leo Jew but I know a few cancer Jews
Meh it hurts when you are young but as you grow older you get used to it
I want to one day befriend someone like that, and then after a while of being friends just casually reveal I'm Jewish, to see what happens
As a Jew this really touched my heart, I've seen so much anti-semitism on reddit recently and it kind of gets to you're mind you know
Hate the current government
Why do they think Sweden is socialist
Yeah I remember a thing from a couple of months ago where this fox news reporter talked about how "there's something rotten in Sweden" or some shit and this Swedish guy basically debunked everything she said
When he visited USSR he argued bread queues are good thing because that means no food is being wasted xDdd
The Republicans definetly fit a lot of the characteristics of fascism
Cult of tradition, rejections of modernism, irrationalism, nationalism, a conspiracy about a wealthy elite, militarism, etc
Back when there were 4 continents

Technically Semitic is a very broad language group which is currently considered  a pretty poor denominator of common ethnicity given how widespread its usage has become
Its like 'Germanic' which encompasses hundreds of different individual groups but even more generalized since it spans all the way from Syria to Yemen and North Africa
Ethnic Jew would be like Ethnic Dane in the Germanic category

You can read a childrens book in 4,5h. I'm assuming he's holding them off the Brothers Karamazov for now
Being inside and focusing only on something close to you all the time without pause is bad for your eyes, especially in childhood, no question about it
Its bad regardless of using a flash light though
Visit Israel it’s cooler
Four million tourists visited Israel last year and not one of them were killed
Yeah but that’s Eilat
It’s like if Ireland had an island territory way south and saying it’s hot there
You mean Northern Ireland
Why would the IRA bomb the south
And the British didn’t control the south
Doesn’t make sense
Relax there lad was just asking questions
I heard a lot of Irish people look at the IRA favorable that true
This shit happens everywhere
Israel had Yemeni immigrant newborns kidnapped in the 50s as well
Do you think the reunification was a bad move
Yeah, like I sometimes say terms that make sense in English but not in Hebrew
Translating things like "I'm gonna take a shower", or "could you take a picture of me" makes zero sense translated, but I say it often because the do in my head and I don't notice
Yeah
I even think in English
My friend says that my Hebrew is getting worse and I don't even notice it (since I combine English with Hebrew or just directly translate sentences from English)
> Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Only one thing bothers me - capital letters
Same here
But
English and Hebrew are even more different - Hebrew is not even an Indo-European language - and there's even differences in the alphabet departments
(Can't have a mess with capitalization rules of the hebrew alphabet has no capital letters \*taps forehead\*)
Hold on, people didn’t like it when you spoke English with a Finnish accent or when you had the neutral English accent
Personally, I love it when people have an accent while they’re speaking English
Maybe just because it makes things more interesting
There have been a handful of times, while I was traveling, where I’ve mistaken a Dutch person for an American because their English was so good
But many do have an accent

To my opinion to fly now is missing point because that need to stay in quarentine to length [2]weeks when return, and they flew only to 3 days
Very easy to understand that the sentence the this

I've always found it interesting how similar the English word "Seven" is to its Hebrew counterpart - "Sheva"
Well if you talk about Germany to an Israeli they'll think of Nazi Germany but being German in Israel is fine
Only if the EU does anything people here don't like
It's pretty common
People who worry often filter the tap water, but I think that more often than not it's tap and not bottled water
Due to the climate we also need to drink quite a lot, so bottled water would also be expensive and inconvenient
Always
I often translate phrases directly from English, without noticing that that's not how you say them in Hebrew or that they don't make sense in Hebrew
Wasting water
In translated shows sometimes characters leave the tap on for a while without using it, and it always made me cringe, even as a kid watching cartoons
It's something you just don't do here
Well than you'll hate Israelis, we always put either mustard or Tabasco on our schnitzels (if you can even call them that, because our schnitzels are made out of chicken)
In Israel "Russian" is used more as an umbrella term for both Russians and Ukrainians, since mostly all of them speak Russian at home (I think)
It is probably a generational thing here, because my dad's Ukrainian co-worker always gets offended when jokingly called "Russian" by my dad, whereas my friends casually call our Ukranian friends "Russian" and they don't mind (at this point I don't even remember which are Russian and which are Ukrainian)
Can you not even dip the schnitzel in ketchup
How do you do the X in X in your flair
Because I'm both Israeli and German, even though I live in Israel and I wanted to do Israel/Germany as my flair

I advise you not to come to Israel then
Well it's very popular here (though considering we only have one food that originates from Israel, the Ben Gurion Rice or Israeli Rice, it's not too surprising)
I'd love to visit Austria someday
To be honest, I'm not as interested in the Jewish history in Austria as just general history
I also hear Austria is a very beautiful country, I saw a picture of an Austrian town placed right beneath the Alps
It's only a shame that I won't be able to visit the town of Fucking since it changed its name

Jokes aside, it's a great scene
Many actors try to speak Hebrew too and I find it very cute
I understand why this scene was not that dramatic to you but for me it's a scene that I'll remember for the rest of my life

Israel's constitution is actually a series of basic laws, each being a different chapter of the final Constitution they're all supposed to be consolidated into sometime soon
The one which will become the first chapter is the infamous Nation-State basic law:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people
The Nation State basic law is literally ripped straight off a draft constitution written by a far-right NGO
And I would have preferred using the Israeli Democracy Institute's "Constitutiton by Consensus" proposal much more
*That* proposal's first article reads:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The State shall be called "Israel".
> (b) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state
> (c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens
> (d) The system of government shall be a parliamentary democracy
I even outlined my "ideal" version of the Nation-State law, with "Constitutiton by Consensus" elements injected in:
> **1
Basic Principles**
> (a) The land of Israel is the historical homeland of the Jewish people, in which the State of Israel was established
> (b) The State of Israel is the national home of the Jewish people, in which it fulfills its natural, cultural, religious, and historical right to self-determination
> *(b1) Israel shall be a Jewish and democratic state
> (c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is *not* unique to the Jewish people
> *(c) The State shall act with equality towards all its citizens
> *(d) The system of government shall be a parliamentary democracy
Like I said, it's ripped off a far-right NGO's proposal
Actuslly, it's only a normal Act of the Oireachtas, the Republic of Ireland Act 1948 (the one which formalized Ireland's withdrawal from the commonwealth) that says "the Description of the State is the Republic of Ireland".
Though I am writing a constitution for a post-IndyRef2 Scotland, and my draft does have "The Description of the State is the Republic of Scotland" written in it
Absolutely not unique (E.G. Icelandic and Traditional Chinese), but it changed relatively much less in the last 2000 years
Hebrew has it too- Yare'akh (ירח) for any kind of moon, and Levana (לבנה) for our moon exclusively
One of Jerusalem's icons is a statue commonly called "The Monster". It's a big statue on a sandbox which kids (and adults) can go up into and slide down the Monster's 'tongues'.
Here's an image of it:

I can't really think of any examples of a film or series set in Israel, to be honest

Not even four days have passed, and you got me into a rabbit hole and knowledge about runka bullar
EXTREMELY OVERPRICED, like Lego sets go for like 150$ for a big set
[France and the UK have them too
Sun - female (shemesh, שמש)
Moon - male (yare'ach, ירח)
If you go into poetry you might see the word "Levana" (לבנה) for the moon, which is female
That word isn't used outside of writing though
The Moon (HaYareach) is Masculine, while the Sun (HaShemesh) is Feminine
And yes, these have pagan origins
That's more or less how the ancient Canaanite Sun and Moon gods, Yarikh and Shaphash (see the resemblance
) were called and gendered
All the times I've been to Europe were great, the worst thing that I remember happening was when I forgot my Switch charger at the hotel and found out after I've already returned to Israel, but even that wasn't too bad because my uncle who lives in Germany was able to pick it up and send it to me
When I was in Cyprus I kept wondering how cars were going with no one in the driver's seat
Hitler
Close second is jesus (the nickname he was given by the rabbinate of the time literally means 'may his memory and name cease')
Benjamin Nethanyahu and Benny Gants : basically I'll sum it down quickly,in the Knesset which is the parliament of Israel you need a percentage of seats to become prime minister,so there is 2 main parties and they both hate eachother, Likud (right wing,ran by Nethanyahu) and Blue and White (centrist left ran by Benny Gants)
So we had a period where noone won the election twice so on the 3rd election it was gonna happen again so Benny Gants gave the votes that were for blue and white and gave them to the Likud party
Is it because we are better bankers
I'd say pretty hard, mostly the genders in singular and plurals
For example, for objects that are male, their plural form would end with -im, and female plurals end with -ot (for the most part)
So you get stuff like para>parot (cow>cows), or kadur>kadurim (ball>balls)
However, sometimes this doesn't apply, for example on the word "beitza" (egg) which is female, but the plural form is "beitzim" and not "beitzot", or the word "av" (father), which is male, but the plural form is "avot". And sometimes there are words that are both male and female, like the word "ruach" (wind)
Numbers are also gendered - you could say "shalosh" (three, female) or "shlosha" (three, male)
This confuses even native speakers and we often use the wrong gendered numbers on stuff, and if we aren't sure of the gender of an object we turn it's plural into single, example again, the word "beitzim". "Kama betizim" (few eggs)>"betiza achat" (one egg, the 'one' being the female version)
If you're learning Hebrew academically, you will also get confused by different sentence parts, such as the different types of 'descriptions'.
Pronuonciations are pretty easy once you nail down the 'ch' sound
TL;DR it's a pretty hard language, and you will get confused by the gendered words
Israeli here: Pretty ducking hard
Hebrew itself is hard, especially for someone who is used to Germanic or Latin languages, and even worse for English speakers
At least we have two grammatical genders and no cases
But the writing system is weird and reading without nikkud requires a lot of familiarity with the vocabulary of Hebrew
Further more, each verb is written and said differently, according to the gender of the subject
There is הרים (has lifted, male) and הרימה (has lifted, female)
Same goes for adjectives and nouns
Some variations are written the same way without nikkud, but are read and spoken differently
The accent is hard to nail
It is hard for English speakers to say ח or כ (without dagesh) for example
Grammer is hard, too
People here sometimes crack jokes about Americans trying to pronounce "חריימה" and similar words with an American accent, and of post Soviet block Jews mixing up genders
So yeah, really fucking hard
Here is a common Hebrew blessing:
היבט האש, אינסוף, חדות שתיים!

Eilat
The whole city
All the hotels and cool touristy places are jam-packed, it's fairly far away from the rest of the country, so if you're going there you'd be inclined to stay there instead of visiting actual cool cities (like Tel-Aviv), and you only get full, dirty beaches or full, dirty swimming pools
Not to mention hoe expensive everything there is - it's cheaper for Israelis to travel abroad for a week than to stay in the country and spend a few nights in Eilat
If you want a good place on the beach go to Natanyia (bonus points if you know French)
Otherwise, you could go to Tiberias and visit the Sea of Galilee
Or, if you're not into water, you could come visit my hometown of Jerusalem
Dead sea really, sure it's the lowest place on earth and it's pretty famous but when you go into the sea all of your body becomes extremely scratchy
Are these normal coffee shops though
Any recommendations for a good website/book to learn about the Aboriginal sites and culture
I visited Berlin in Christmas 2018, it was really beautiful
It's the first time I've seen a place decorated for Christmas, let alone an entire city
I didn't actually visit for the history though, I went there because of Christmas and to visit my uncle
Let me see if I get this right: the English words "Coffee Shop" in the Netherlands mean weed place, and normal coffee shops are just called Cafés like normal, but are never reffered to as coffee shops
I don't really have any specific questions, so do you have any interesting facts about their culture
Thanks, I learnd something today
I'll try to remember that if I ever visit the Netherlands
That's really interesting thank you for posting that
But 56,000 years and 30,000 years don't sound quite right

The user who observed that southern Europe has a considerably different relationship with alcohol than wealthier, more reserved northern Europe seems to have been right on the money, at least if the comments here are indicative of reality (and I think they are)
Here in Israel drunkenness, especially public drunkenness, is not a major taboo, but it is kind of seen as trashy/embarrassing/dumb
From what I have heard and seen it is similar in Italy, Spain, Greece, etc
, where alcohol is common but drunkenness is not
I am originally from the United States and I actually think the OP is onto something about Americans
Drunkenness is definitely something expected (but not always appreciated) for college students
It is mostly a taboo among high schoolers because it is seen as dangerous for them and others (and it often is)
And for anyone over the age of 30 it is more or less expected that people should be married and at home with their family
It's  a sign of immaturity if you are 31 and out at a bar in much of the country
I think it's changing, though
Studies show that fewer and fewer teenagers drink alcohol and party in the US
But as people marry later and delayed adolescence becomes more of a thing it is far more common to see 30 year olds in a club or bar getting wasted and nobody thinking anything of it
It's a frankly weird dynamic in US culture where really young people are becoming kind of puritanical while everyone is becoming more libertine
There are none, though I'm sure that if we shared the same alphabet with Arabic we could understand a lot of it

But if you are lazy you would probably go for McDonald's
Here it is common to have a flag and hang it outside the window on the memorial day and independence day (they are adjacent, today is actually the eve of memorial day)
It's also common to see car mounted flags on independence day
But you don't really need to own one since in the days before many stores give one with purchases of anything, from newspaper to food
Israeli here
Everyone I know has the blue and white banner somewhere in their garage
And even when it isn't independence day here, you can see a not very small amount of houses with flags flown outside of them
Same except synagogue
> The only time I remember a death being announced during a TV show was that of Yithak Rabin's assassination
Why would Austrian TV stop broadcasting because the Israeli PM has been assasinated
Yes, but actually stopping the broadcast instead of just making it the top headline

eesti = nordic confirmed
Probably Azerbaijan or India,like culturally we are different but we are great allies

Naw, I love snow and cold climates
I’m sad I now live somewhere where is hasn’t rained since March 13th and it was 32C yesterday
It’s boring being sunny and warm every day 3/4th of the year
It's just nice to have a casual-ish conversation sub where Americans don't dominate every conversation
I don't even care what the topic is
I mean, Palestine
We make TONS of jokes about that being a fictional place
You can just take a few hours to drive to any city you want
Also people are more familiar with the different cities and locations around the country since, you know, there are less of them

smh Georgraphically speaking Portugal should be on GMT -1
> In short: Russia considers annexation to be the will of Crimean people who were against Euromaidan and following coup
There is a rather solid framework under that kind of claims to people's self determination, even though Russia and many other countries usually supress any kind of sepratism
Among Russian society, belief that Crimea should have been Russian was always widespread because of historical ties
Had the Crimean referendum been handled fairly, the option to join russia would have had 65% of the vote
But even that 65% majority is 34% less than the very-likely-doctored near-unanimous majority the official results give
It's very common for Israelis in high school to go on a trip to Poland
These are subsidized by the government and as such for many Israelis it is their first time abroad
Many of the teens who go on these trips don't actually care about the history and are more interested in shopping in another country
There's also the phenomenon of dumb kids who think they're somehow taking revenge against people who cooperated with the Nazis by just being assholes to people on their trip
Everything outside the continuum formed by the Haifa-Tel Aviv-Jerusalem metro areas is called the Periphery, and it is somewhat derogatory
An even more derogatory term is "the second Israel" - the population there is mostly Mizrachi, so it ties in the Inter-Edah conflicts as well
Not European here, and I think ALL Europeans dress well
In my country most of the time you wear a t-shirt or tank top, shorts and sandals or maybe shoes
That's it
I'm very happy about it as I have no sense of dressing, and those cloths are very comfortable

My mom is leaving Israel in two months for France, and I hopefully will be following and leaving in a year
The situation here is pretty much as you described
High rents, no jobs, we even have a literal criminal as the head of the country
Glad my mom was born in France and that me and my sister also have EU citizenships
It's happenned before and it will happen again
I think that not serving in the military would be far more controversial than not being born here
I gotta ask: what about a politician born in the UK
HaAretz (literary "the land"), widespread left wing paper
France, because we had Arab states surrounding us, seeking revenge for 1948, they had the whole mess with Algeria, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend
Unfortunately, this didn't last
Once the French let Algeria free in 1962, they decided to call the alliance off
Once the Six-Day War broke out in '67, France told us "you're on your own", stabbed us in the back, and took the Mirage 5 (a variant of the Mirage 3 co-developed with Israel for the IDF's needs) with them
We retaliated by stealing the Mirage 5's blueprints, building our own, and then improving its aerodynamics and adding American engines and christening what resulted as the Kfir
That explains why our ministers are so loud and energetic then
Israel has the same thing with Ness Ziona
Either a small town yeshiva student in some shtetl in poland/ukraine/belarus
Or, a librarian and/or tailor in one of the big cities in the same region
I would probably be a trans-saharan merchant, capturing slaves and other goods from West Africa
The pharse "אין לי כוח" ("en li coach), literally translates to "I don't have power" and means you don't want to do something without saying you don't want to do it
Very usedul in Hebrew and it's frustrating every time I want to say the same thing in English but can't
Every building in Petach Tikva is a monstorsity
The whole city is a monstorsity
No one's really sure why it exists (if it exists)
Idk, I live in Jerusalem, most buildings are either old and ugly, very old and nice, or new and alright
Nothing really stands out
If the name didn't change over the last 50 years, the city's name is "LODGE"
Israeli here:
Lag Ba'Omer  is the holiday on which religious jews celebrate the beginning of Jewish Mysticism (a.k.a. Kabbalah), but for majority of Israeli jews its a celebration of Bar Kochba's early victories against the mighty Roman Empire in 132 CE
The wars we won (Independence War, Six Day War, Yom Kippur War)
We were out numbered and had to fight on a few fronts
Yom Kippur was espcially surprising, since most soliders were hungry and exhusted (since you don't eat on Yom Kippur)
In Israel we got rid of the 5 cent coins a long time ago
No one liked them, so now the lowest coin is 10 cents
This also means prices have to be rounded, so stuff would be 10
90₪ instead of 10
99₪
Yep, all prices are like that
It used to be that stores were allowed to make prices x.99, but since people had no reaslistic way to properly pay for that, the passed a law that requires prices to be x.x0
The swirlies are the symbol for the Shekel, Israel's currency
They look like the letters ש and ח together, which are the first letters of the name of the Shekel (New Shekel, Shekel Khadash, שקל חדש)
Israel here
we have ruins from every conceivable perion in both historic and pre-historic times
> Parliamentary democracy where the parliament elected by the people chooses (usually one of their own) as head of government, with a high degree of power over all affairs of state
The head of state is either a president elected by some form of assembly (Germany for example) or a monarch (UK, the Netherlands) in both cases the role of head of state is mostly ceremonial with political power being rather limited
There are also Parliamentary Reoublics with directly-elected Presidents, such as Slovenia and Ireland
But when
To all my grandfather's uncles and nephews & nieces and all the extended family i could have had: GET THE F*(K OUT OF EUROPE
THERE'S NOTHING GOOD HERE FOR US
GO to Eretz Yisrael, GO to North America
GO to South America
GO to China
or Australia
just GET THE FUCK OUT OF EUROPE
soon spanish will write -ción as -ção too
I'd say the Wholesale Market/Gindi TLV complex, all the buildings flanking the Ayalon highway, and the start of Rothschild Boulevard
Outside Tel Aviv, the biggest contenders would have to be Modi'in and Charish
bagget
Knowing English is pretty much taken for granted for anyone under 40, but a lot of people also speak a third language - mostly Russian or French, since their families cone from those places
Tel Aviv with its 6200ILS (1560EUR) for a 1 bedroom apt joins the party
A few missiles incoming every couple of years launched towards the city are included, of course
Yup, it's really funny when you meet Danish tourists who think that Tel Aviv is really expensive and that salaries here surely are extremely high, only to find out the average salary here is actually closer to Spain's :)
A small time in 1956, and later on between 1967 and 1982, actually
> source: see flair
The [Free State of Prussia] existed in the Weimar Republic until 1935 (de facto) or 1947 (de jure) tho
What's the difference in pronounciation
Pretty much noone other than Arabs and people with Arabic parents/grandparents speak Arabic here
Does that phrase not exist in English
It exists in Hebrew
Yeah, the Hebrew Academy
No one listens to what they have to say, though, and everyone makes fun of them
My school is next to a university where the Academy is placed, and it's so funny because you see how they have invested in paths and statues for all buildings except the Hebrew Academy, which have a tiny flight of stairs that you would miss if you didn't know what you're looking for, that leads to a forest that you have to walk through to get there
The building itself is nice, though
Tel Aviv and Jerusalem I guess
They are the largest cities in the country, both very important historically, and while Jerusalem is the capitol some countries have their emmbassies in Tel Aviv
Tel Aviv is considered very left wing and progressive, young and as the "big city". It has a lot of big malls, sky scrapers and more modern architecture
Jerusalem is considered more conservative, has a very large population of ultra orthodox jews, and overall has a surprisingly larger population than Tel Aviv
All buildings in Jerusalem are built with the same type of stone, the Jerusalem stone
There are also Be'er Sheva and Eilat, who are the largest cities in the Negev (the desert in the south of the country) and rival each other about which one is the "capitol" of the Negev
It's called "shtrudel" in Hebrew, like the pastery
no, nothing new in the middle east
your gas is not from Iran anyway
Mashina's ballad for a double agent
Hebew has two endings per mil, no endings per bil, and one ending for everything else
So 10^6 is milyon, 10^9 is milyard, 10^12 is trilyon, 10^15 is qwadrilyon, et cetera
Million is the same as English (מיליון)
Billion is "Milliard" (מיליארד)
Butting in when people ask stuff about European countries
Being pretty much the most controversial country in the world, if you bring up Israel it's always gonna be either I love Israel or I hate Israel
Many people do, but far from everyone
France looks like a star, and Denmark looks like the head of a dragon
Switzerland looks like a waterbear
It's really depends, if someone has a strong accent it's really easy to tell
But sometimes(especially americans) native english speakers have such a bad grammar that i question whether or not they're native speakers
In addition, there are a lot of schools in israel that teach you english with british/american accent- resulting in a yemen jew with clear yemenese accent in hebrew to sound like an upper class 20th century london man for example

I get what you're saying, we have a lot of immigrants here so I'm used to all kinds of accents and dialects
Despite that, a lot of americans simply do not know how to speak english with correct basic grammar
Mizrahi music about sex and marriage,it sounds like a person complaining about their life but singing it with a shitty voice
Non-dutch non-american people
America's government organization gets cursed from the state level downwards, the dutch water board system would fit in quite well there
"Blue" means erotic but I think that's the same with other languages
Yellow journalism is the same as in English, journalism that's gossip-y and bad
I saw someone fron the UK commenting that it's the same in English, that's how it got to Hebrew
I don't know the origins of it in English though
It is used more commonly in Hebrew than in English, which is why I wasn't 100% sure that it was also the same in English until I saw that guy's comment
Hungarian Bird Language is exactly like bet-language in Hebrew (the subject of Israel's first Eurovision winning song
), except the v is swapped for a b.
yes
Oh, no
Dana was our third winner
A-ba-ni-bi (bet language for "ani" meaning I, as part of the phrase Ani ohev otach (I love you) was our first in 1978, and Hallelujah was our second in 1979
In our country some politicians had such suggestions, about 1 usd for disposable surgen mask, it didn't pass, now those mask cost about 5 cents
I would copy how people drive from pretty much any other country other than most of the middle east and India
We mostly have that with country names
Egypt=mitzraim(מצרים)
China=sin(סין)
Spain=sfarad(ספרד)
Jordan=yarden(ירדן)
France=tzarfat(צרפת)
England=anglia(אנגליה)
Syria=surya(סוריה)
India=hodu(הודו)
Lithuania=latvia(לטוויה)
We do have different names for polish citys, but idk the local names
Lublin, lodge varsha and more
The two I can think of are Ako being called "Acre" and Yerushalaim being "Jerusalem"
Latvia is Lithuania
Yes indeed, Sephardi is someone from sepharad tzarfati(changed to sarfati because of language barrier) is someone from tzarfat
The Netherlands -> Holland
האימפריה הרומית הקדושה (Ha-Imperia Ha-Romit Ha-Kdosha)
אימפריה (Imperia) - Empire
רומית (Romit) - Roman
קדושה (Kdosha) - Holy
peace/piss/piece - native Hebrew speaker here - we unintentionally mix those words alot
Not just the same, its Identical
WW2 and Jews
hmm let me see
Tel Aviv is known for being the best place for younger people in Israel, Jerusalem is known as the best place for religious people and Eilat is known to be the best place to go on vacation by everyone in Israel
and that is how you brexit
so the UK, Switzerland, Greenland and Norway are stupid ???
I don't know if the list will get bigger
צ'כיה (chekhya) is the common term in hebrew, as opposed to הרפובליקה הצ'כית (ha-republiqa ha-chekhith) which sounds too official/blind translation from the english
It's just called the "Pfizer vaccine".
Complaining, more specifically about prices (though we would also win in general complaining)
We would like to compete
If you beat us we'll just call you and the judges antisemites (maybe that should be our sport)

We use QWERTY
Hebrew doesn't have accents, it has dotting, but everyone is able to read properly without dotting so we don't have that on our keyboards

Hummus, who makes it best and how do you eat it
~~Bare hands~~ Wipe with pita or with the fork
I meant with [pita] but yes, you wipe with pita
I've edited the original post so someone will not start to eat literally with bare hands :)
wait
what
how
red onions + Hummus is weird mix but I'm going to try it next time and remember this redditor ^
Literally every old hebraic names like Ahaziah, Jeoshaphat, Zimri or Baasha
All the time lol, everyone is concerned about stuff happening here
That's why I feel same
Imagine this but you still get rockets from Kosovo, terrorist from Bosnia, threats that Romania will wipe you of the map, temporary peace with Bulgaria and Hungary, Croatia in civil war that all sides are against you
Well, more or less it's same
a lot of things are different, yes
Just I find it funny :)
That the occupation of the West Bank is immoral, and even though we suffer from security issues much more than (almost
) any other Western nation, continuing the occupation isn't the only solution and we should look for more sustainable, moral ones
r/cirkeltrek lekt makkers
In Israel it's [arsim]
"baz" - a falcon, and feeling contempt towards someone (verb)
"tom" - end, and being naïve
"Lekales" not commonly used (archaic) but means both to curse and to bless someone
might be off topic but I for one would really want to see the latter spelled "požyčać sobie"
or even just "pożyċać sobie"
Italian just flows
When we first got independence until relatively recently
There just weren't a lot of Israeli born people
It's not usual but there are a lot of domestic abuse and murder reports happening right now
I don't really know foreign movies set in Israel other than stuff about ancient Israel, if you know anyone please comment
I know the 3 big ones: Germany, France and the UK
Not all the lyrics though
Never
Last time it actually snowed was like 2015 I think
Tbf it snows pretty much every year, but it doesn't stick, so you might have a bit of ice outside for a night, but after that it's gone
In Tel Aviv most people are fine with it,but in Jerusalem or a religious town
Oh god, that could go wrong
That he has purple hair
I think you can use both (we use the same letter for both s and sh for this word in Hebrew) but I prefer s
Other than the ones I know, Hebrew and English, I would choose: French, German and Arabic
French because my family is French and we want to move to France in the future
I am also currently learning it
German because then I could read what my family in Germany wrote before and during the Holocaust
And Arabic, since it's useful in Israel
They teach you how to read and write it at school but I could never get ahold of it, the writing just wouldn't get into my head
Well we had a war with Egypt because of the Soviets,it got us peace with Egypt so I guess it went well
that's the german rules for using commas - they're sued to separate suboridnate clauses there, not to mark breaks in stretches of speech
sauce: am hebreophone, we used to use the german rules for commas until 1994 ([for reasons I have explained elsewhere] where we switched to the english ones
David Ben Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel
He declared independence and won the war of independence
Eliezer Ben Yehuda, the man who revived the Hebrew language
Chaim Weizmann, first President of Israel
He was also a chemist, and one of the largest research institutions in Israel is named after him
And I don't know if it counts because he was born in Austria-Hungary and died before the country existed, but Theodor Herzel, who is called the Visionary of the State
He was one of the major (if not the biggest) players in the rise of Zionism that would eventually lead to the formation of Israel
We have a mountain in Jerusalem named after him, which holds a military cemetary, the highest national ceremonies and the national Holocaust museum - Yad Vashem, among other things
Any idea on what he was trying to say
In Hebrew the word for Hammer is "פטיש" (Patish) but when written in Hebrew it could also mean "fetish"
"Motek" means sweetie in Hebrew, sounds less cool knowing that
Is there a difference in pronounciations
We had spelling bee competitions
in English classes
You vote for a party
Each party has a list of the ranking of their members (with party leader being #1)
After all votes are cast, they calculate how many seats each party got (120 seats total)
If a party got less than 4, they are out of the race and won't get any seats
If a party got, say, 14 seats, the 14 highest members of the party will get to become the members of Knesset
In order to elect the Prime Minister, the person competing for the job needs to first have at least 61 signatures (in a limited amount of time from the election) from MPs reccomending him to be the PM
Once the future PM gets these, he shows them to the President, who then allows him to start forming a government
If our future PM couldn't get 61 signatures but no other competitor could get them as well, the President reccomends whoever he thinks has the best chance of forming a government
In order to form a government, the PM needs to get at least 61 MPs to join his coallition (including himself and his party members)
In order to do that he can offer to give MPs different minister roles (BTW, the PM can just make new minister offices
That's why we have over 30 ministers in Israel, my favourite is the "Minister of Jerusalem" which is a seperate job from the Mayor of Jeruslaem)
Once you become an MP, you get have the seat until the next election
That means that the PM can also "steal" MPs from their party if he convinces them to join his own
And that's it
Once he makes agreements with 61 MPs or more , he becomes the PM and the head of the coallition
The head of the opposition is the leader of the party that got the most votes but didn't get into the government
_**TL;DR: you choose a party, the members of that party get seats proportional to the number of votes they got (120 seats total), the person who can get more than 61 MPs to join his government becomes PM**_
And in the middle of the Presidnet's term, too - a lot more sensible than the French way of holding Presidential and Parliamentary elections close
To be fair a government consisting of 61 memebers would be very weak and would fall in a vote of no confidence almost immediately (the votes of no confidence and the like can only be voted by MPs who are present at the Knesset at the time, so it would be very easy for the opposition to arrange for everyone to be present and outnumber the people of the coalition)
I think the current coalition consists of 76 members
However, I double checked and the number of ministers we have is 34, so it stays about the same ratio
(It is actually a real problem here
The country is already in huge amounts of debt and economic downturn, and now taxpayers have to also support the salaries of 34 ministers)
The benefits I see is that campaigning for legislative elections aren't held in the shadow of the Presidential Campaign, and that the Majority in Parliament can serve as an effective check on the President
Part of the reason the French President is so powerful is because his party always has a majority in the National Assembly, which gives him the de facto ability to appoint a loyalist Prime Minister and control the legislative agenda
For Israel: Yerushalayim Shel Zahav (Jerusalem of Gold)
Actually I (unfortunately
) had better luck with Israeli trains than with Deutsche Bahn
I only lived in Germany for a 9 months or so, but I had really bad luck almost every time I travelled long-distance, Especially in Sachsen
To the point that I would prefer taking Blablacar than the train if I knew I have to get somewhere on time
I think there's a thing called the "Tower Tour" visitors can take, in which the interior of the hollow spire, with its ancient wooden scaffolding, can be viewed
>!In case you don't know, quoting factiods from the wikipedia article, like me and u/orthoxerox did, became a meme since the Russians suspected to have poisoned Skripal did just that while claiming to be tourists
We preserve the original names in hebrew too
They're widespread in Israel too
קען איך אויך פארבינדן די פארטיי?
Why is that weird
Lot of people get Hebrew wrong but it's always warm to hear someone knows few words in your language
Shalom
Ohh same here
That's is really weird in fact
Even Chinese try to speak English which is much harder for them
We do
It's called "magav" (מג"ב), which is an acronym for "border guard". It's a branch of the police force that has officers specially trained in combat, whose roles are between soliders and police officers
From what I remember it was set up as part of the police force because we signed a treaty saying we won't have soliders on our borders, so we instead put "police" there
In the countryside normal police does the job, Magav is a force to deal with more violent situations
This is a big one: the Hebrew word for human, "אדם" (adam), is similar to the word for earth, "אדמה" (adama)
You probably know the story behind this one: how God created man from earth in the bible
We finish high school at 18, then a 2-3 years of military service, and then many people take 1-2 gap years to travel
I also took a volunteer gap year between high school and the militarily
So I finished high school at 18, and will start uni at almost 25
Others will finish high school at 18, the military at 20-21 and directly start uni at that age, so it really depends
The fast and furious series
Here in Israel, every carchase will not be stopped by our ever-vigilant police officers (who are better in harassing citizens, sexually assaulting their colleagues and giving you thousands of shekels in tickets for even looking at your phone\\dashboard than stopping criminals), they will be stopped by our always-furious drivers or by our big traffic jams
(Seriously, traffic jams are horrible here

We're not trans-continental at all and most Israelis won't identify as European (although I suspect a sizeable minority would, or at least would identify as an Aspiring European)
But- When faced with the above choice, most Israelis would say the feel more European than Asian
Even though we're not even partially in Europe, funnily enough
I guess it stems mostly from the fact that traditionally Israeli was banned from many competitions/organizations in the area (Soccer championships, Olympics Qualification, Basketball Leagues, Music Competitions, UN Security Council Regional Group, etc)
So in many aspects, especially culturally, Israel is more related to Europe than to Asia/The Middle East
But since English and Italian use the same alphabet, isn't confusing to read English code and then transitioning to reading Italian
Don't you sometimes try to read Italian in English/English in Italian

Enjoy Israel, there's a large Russian speaking community ;)
>Israel, because I’m in the process of getting Israeli citizenship
Awesome
We'd love to have you here :)
Are you also planning to move here, or is it more of a conveniency thing, as Israeli passport is sometimes more useful than a Russian one in some countries
(Totally no judgment in case that wasn't clear- I myself, an Israeli citizen, am in the process of getting a German passport for the same reasons)
Existing in Israel,

Almost every single large fast food place
Starbucks, KFC, Subway, Taco Bell (Or any Taco place, really
I have never tried one and have no idea where I can find them), and I haven't seen a Burger King in years
To our credit, though, we are really good at food we stole from arabic countries like Falafel or Kube
Fair prices, especially for computer related stuff, for the price of a mid ranged phone we can buy a budget phone
Israel has duel citizenship, and it is great
A lot of people have more than one citizenship (myself included), and there are always ads everywhere to get a foreign citizenship for those who don't have one

Far too many to count, because hebreophones don't even notice most of the time
Late 19th/Early 20th century German had a lot of influence on the just-revived Hebrew, to the point that there's a sizable chunk of identical expressions shared by the two languages
For (one among many, many) examples, Hebrew and German have near-identical month names (the only difference is that Hebrew has the Au in August pronounced like English)
In Hebrew we call the Solomon's Camel, so there might be a correlation there
Edit: the word in Hebrew is גמל שלמה or gamal schlomo (read as if you're reading German) if anyones wondering

Well, first there's (idk how to describe it) "vibe" it's calming and soothing
The law dictates that everything must be built out of "Jerusalemic stone" which makes everything look old and experienced
The mix in population between haredics, islamic/christian arabs, jews, armenians and more is apparent in the workplace/streets(although neighborhoods are mostly separated
The masses of pilgrims who come to the city makes it unique
sitting on the shchem gate of the old city at night and seeing el-aqs'a shining from floodlights on the background of the almost black dark and peaceful old city quarters is an experience i wish anyone could have
Addition:
Terrorism is a thing in Jerusalem and it really scares people who live in different parts of israel to come to the city, but the bit sad truth is people that grew in Jerusalem don't notice most of the terrorism from it being an everyday thing

זה איסלנדית בשבילי
I think it would've been only fair here to also include Israel so we can say we also use "It's Chinese to me"
-Can we make memes
-Well no but actually no

It's so strange to see so many cars just parked on the road
Here we park with two wheels on the road, and two on the sidewalk
Happy independence day from the very differently faced side of the middle sea
He was high enough that the operation to cleanse Jews in the area of the general government (the Parts of Poland that were not directly annexed to Germany) during WWII was named [operation Reinhardt]
What’s the name of the town
Can you translate the summary or give English sources
It seems only in  Polish language
Go, France
Go, Europe
Together for strong independent countries
The EU was a nice concept, but it's a failed experiment at this point
It costs the bigger and more successful countries plenty of money, and offers very little return on investment
It failed to help Greece in its time of need
And it's a bureaucratic nightmare
At the same day of the Holocaust day in Israel
It is a lot to learn from
ok, because nobody asked
who is that bitch "Jew Silihtar Boda" and why Jews are involved
As for the letter, sounds like internet before the internet
according to the date, it should be [Midhat Pasha] but he was not Jew
Meanwhile, it's nearly 50° in some parts of Israel
I wish
Can we split it 50/50
Please
^send ^help
It is, thankfully I live in Jerusalem
I feel bad for my cousins in Tel Aviv, though
There are plenty of cities in the US alone that out number the population of Sweden in its entirety
This is comparing apples to oranges
And soon the very last holocaust survivors are going to pass away
I can only imagine what will happen then
I currently live in Hong Kong, and if you compare the 1960's  to it today - you'd think it is two different cities
Truth is, Europe has always been relatively developed compared to the rest of the world, hence way one may think its a radical change, but compared to some other parts of the world its pretty stable
Yeah although to be fair in Hong Kong high-rise drive was built mostly due to lacking of space rather than the whole Dubai rich/show-off phase
Brexshit
ITT: cancer
As an Israeli we were never introduced to "Polish death camps" in school
It was always "German camps in Poland".
This is 100% a political move from the Polish government, it has nothing to do with lost land in Poland as this law won't affect any kind of these things
Yeah
Nothing about the money
It's just the government in Poland trying to create a political stunt and our government trying to use this stunt in order to stunt another stunt
STUNTCEPTION
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Poland
>The government’s drive to subjugate the judicial system and a growing tendency to criminalize defamation are beginning to have an effect on the freedom of expression of independent media outlets
Some courts are now using article 212 of the criminal code, under which journalists can be sentenced to as much as a year in prison for defamation, although the civil code offers citizens all the protection they need if they are defamed
Even if the courts usually content themselves with fining journalists, the use of article 212 encourages self-censorship by the independent media
The Warsaw daily Gazeta Wyborcza continues to be the leading target of government lawsuits
Partisan discourse and hate speech are still the rule within state-owned media, which have been transformed into government propaganda mouthpieces
Their new directors tolerate neither opposition nor neutrality from employees and fire those who refuse to comply
Many protests have been staged outside the offices of the management of the state-owned TV broadcaster TVP
After one of these protests in February 2019, the TVP evening news programme “Wiadomosci” broadcast video footage and personal details of ten of the demonstrators
TVP also filed a complaint against Polish ombudsman Adam Bodnar, who said its references to Gdansk mayor Pawel Adamowicz amounted to hate speech and implied that this could have encouraged the person who murdered Adamowicz in January 2019
Serbia ranks 93rd on the list
Turkey ranks 154th on the list
Turkey ranks 154th on the list
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Malta
>Malta saw a change in government at the start of 2020 -- the result of weeks of mass protests in the country’s capital demanding resignations after numerous revelations linked the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia to the heart of the government leadership
Former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat was forced to resign along with his chief of staff Keith Schembri, who has been linked to the journalist’s death in testimonies by those charged with her assassination
Yorgen Fenech, a director of Electrogas, arrested as the mastermind behind Daphne Caruana Galizia’s murder to a shady energy deal she had exposed
The public inquiry into the journalist’s death and wider circumstances -- which the Maltese government finally launched two years after her death and only following pressure from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, among others -- is revealing a picture of political interference - intended to disrupt investigations and shift blame away from those at the helm of government
>In January 2020, a court in Malta ruled that government orders to clear tributes left by citizens at the protest memorial for Daphne Caruana Galizia in Valletta breached the activists’ fundamental right to freedom of expression
The constant clearing of the memorial, over almost two years on orders of the Justice Minister, was made with the “thought and specific intention” to create division while hindering protest and burying calls for justice
The weakness of the rule of law in Malta and the challenges it places on journalists have been documented in reports by major European bodies, including the European Parliament and the Council of Europe
Maltese journalists from six independent media houses told a delegation of MEPs from the European Parliament Civil Liberties Committee that they feared for their safety and operated in a culture of intimidation and threats
Media threats during the past year continued, with several documented instances of denial of access to information or press events, toxic rhetoric by government officials, failure to recognise non-State issued press cards, as well as unlawful detention of press members (including international press) following a press conference in late 2019
A report by RSF in collaboration with The Shift News documented press freedom challenges in Malta, including government officials directly targeting and attempting to discrediting journalists covering government corruption
Media ownership remains dominated by the two main political parties in the country, leading to propaganda and disinformation
Norway is number 1 on the list
Montenegro ranks 105th on the list
This is what the creators of the ranking said about Austria
>Political upheaval was triggered in Austria in May 2019 when German media outlets released a secretly-recorded video of a meeting in Ibiza between Heinz-Christian Strache – the then deputy chancellor and leader of the far-right Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ) – and a woman posing as the niece of a Russian oligarch
Dubbed the “Ibiza-Gate” video, it showed Strache ready to accept secret funding and electoral support in exchange for access to government contracts
The acquisition of a stake in an influential Austrian tabloid was also discussed
The ensuing outcry brought down the right / far-right coalition government and led to an early general election
This in turn resulted in a new coalition between Chancellor Sebastian Kurz’s right-wing party, which still had the largest number of parliamentary seats, and the Greens, a party that claims to respect the highest press freedom standards, which entered into government for the first time
This new coalition has moved the government back towards the centre without affecting the still tense relations between Kurz’s conservative party and particular media outlets, which continue to be denied access to certain government-held information
Norway ranks 1st on the list
This is what the creators of the ranking say about Greece
>Centre-right New Democracy party enjoyed a landslide victory over incumbent Syriza in the July 2019 general election
Soon afterwards, a new presidential decree, placed public broadcaster ERT and state news agency ANA-MPA under the direct supervision of the new Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis
It remains to be seen how this new set-up will affect press freedom in the country
Elsewhere, journalists continued to face difficulties in doing their job, with a reporter covering demonstrations marking the 46th anniversary of the Athens Polytechnic uprising being attacked by police, a photojournalist covering the evacuation of a squat being arrested and detained, while the headquarters of the Athens Voice weekly newspaper were ransacked by an anarchist group
Ukraine ranks 96th on the list
The full list
>HOW THE INDEX IS COMPILED
>The degree of freedom available to journalists in 180 countries is determined by pooling the responses of experts to a questionnaire devised by RSF
This qualitative analysis is combined with quantitative data on abuses and acts of violence against journalists during the period evaluated
The criteria evaluated in the questionnaire are pluralism, media independence, media environment and self-censorship, legislative framework, transparency, and the quality of the infrastructure that supports the production of news and information
Norway is number 1 on the list
Russia ranks 149th on the list
Belarus ranks 153rd on the list
Here's what the creators of the ranking say about Spain
>Elections in 2019 saw a breakthrough by the far-right party VOX, which came third in terms of votes
VOX has distinguished itself by its crusade against the media, with its supporters stirring up hate against journalists on social media and physically harassing them on the ground
Its leaders have had no qualms about publicly insulting journalists and refusing them accreditation for the events they organize
Hatred against journalist is not limited to VOX
In Catalonia, where the political climate is extremely polarized, journalists have been the targets of physical violence by both the police and independence supporters
Investigative journalists have been subjected to judicial harassment, with several being accused of violating the confidentiality of a judicial investigation and others being the targets of raids and searches
Even if most cases are eventually dropped, there is a growing tendency on the part of the judicial authorities and the police to override the protection of journalists’ sources and to obstruct investigative journalism
Girl with Pearl Earring is 17th century, what does it have to do with Napoleon
>Let's not twist historical facts around just to shit on Turkey
And then you twist the facts
here is interesting fact
>  On 13 February 1975, Turkey declared the occupied areas of the Republic of Cyprus to be a "Federated Turkish State", to the universal condemnation of the international community (see United Nations Security Council Resolution 367)
Ohhh Aremenia
I've had an ongoing fling with an armenian girl
she had 5/10 face 10/10 body and 19/10 stories
I could listen (and would love to again) her talk about her country for hours
They are promoting hatred and in the case of the holocaust Antisemitism
The reason is simply, in order to believe that 6 million deaths were fake or largely falsified you would need a huge conspiracy to push that agenda
That means that you believe that the Jews have an agenda and are willing to make up these massive lies in order to pursue it
Because these claims all rely on the need of a massive cover up, those behind it are to blame as i have yet to see deniers say it was a bookkeeping error but an agenda done to discredit the Germans/ gain support etc
That just sounds like summer in Israel lol
Now show us the top class hospital of Romania
Deep state at work here
Jewish circumcised Israeli here
Yes, absolutely
A Jewish politician somewhere has to stand up and spearhead a bill to ban it, to avoid calls of antisemitism
Fuck this practice, and fuck everyone who supports it
[The medical benefits of male circumcision] mean that is it certainly not ridiculous at all
When you live in a country with a very high HIV rate, literally any reduction in getting it is huge and worthy of consideration
Two words "Universal Healthcare". If you travel to rural Africa, United States, Jungles of Southeast Asia etc then access to clean water to shower and medical care will be much more restricted and difficult to get
The USA is focused on our own bullshit but we wish you the best in yours

refer to the comment above
Ohh, I see what you did there
Holy shit that is based as fuck
Hope EA bankrupt
This is not how Journalism works
You need to specify why they were protesting
Were they protesting against the government
As in to change it or to protest against its specific law or action
Who organized it
When people ask how are you here, you always say "beseder" (בסדר), which is just the translation of "ok". No other acceptable answer
I visited Ljubljana right before the pandemic, at the end of august 19
It was beutiful
i really enjoyed the canals, the big castle in town, the food market near the church and the side trip to lake Bled and it's castle
Top one has 50% being Jews
The bottom one has no Jews
One of the sad differences
Palestinians held a 'day of rage' in the West Bank and Jerusalem against France
For the first time in decades - because of France - they view us as a lesser evil
&#x200B;
Thank you France for helping solve the conflict and helping normalize Israel in the Middle East
/s (although am half sarcastic but also half serious)
You have to pay for this DLC
Pasta with ketchup

Pretty interesting
From my experience visiting many countries in eastern Europe it just really depends where you go, some places have tons of proficient speakers while others have little
Very few
He has at least 80% of Belarus
It made its way through the court system
Courts do not go fast
Wait
a map of Europe that doesn't have a Switzerland-shaped hole in the middle
What's sad is one doesn't know if islamists or anti-semitic Europeans are responsible for attacks like these
They differ if literally everything beside one thing: hatred for Jews
In fact, they sort of fit each other
edit:
literally from Palestinian hamas' charter (constitution):
>"The \[Jewish\] enemies have been scheming for a long time ... and have accumulated huge and influential material wealth
With their money, they took control of the world media
With their money they stirred revolutions in various parts of the globe
They stood behind the French Revolution, the Communist Revolution and most of the revolutions we hear about
With their money they formed secret organizations - such as the Freemasons, Rotary Clubs and the Lions - which are spreading around the world, in order to destroy societies and carry out Zionist interests
They stood behind World War I ... and formed the League of Nations through which they could rule the world
They were behind World War II, through which they made huge financial gains
There is no war going on anywhere without them having their finger in it
" *(Article 22)*
First of all, that's good news
Doesn't change the point I made through my comment though
I agree our government should be criticised
The problem occurs when you have those critics believing Hitler should have finished the job
&#x200B;
Trust me the Islamic Jihad for liberation of Palestine, Hezbollah and IICR of Iran aren't fighting Israel because of Palestinian rights, they are fighting Israel because they hate Jews
r/angryupvote
Hey, something good coming out of Eur*pe
Such a mystery why these people have such a bad places as their home countries
It's true to an extent that Israeli actions could be viewed to an extent as anti Palestinian but . France doesn't occupy the West Bank and doesn't mistreat Arabs, and look you have shit like this
So imagine what Israel has to deal with
It will only get worse in the years to come
Kinda takes way too long to say lol
I am not sure if I am proud or ashamed that I knew exactly which two countries would be top
Well to an extent they did
>Hookworm, a disease of extreme poverty, is thriving in the US south
Why
>Children playing feet away from open pools of raw sewage; drinking water pumped beside cracked pipes of untreated waste; human faeces flushed back into kitchen sinks and bathtubs whenever the rains come; people testing positive for hookworm, an intestinal parasite that thrives on extreme poverty
The Southern areas are home to some of the most extreme poverty in the world
It's a map originally made by the Habsburgs to confuse the Swedish invaders
The ruse failed, however, as the noise made by scores of nobles being thrown out of windows gave away the location
*For more fun Cezch related facts, throw a noble out of the window
Sounds like an okay idea
No voting rights for bikes
Basically North Korea
Because unless a country signs a bilateral agreement with the EU, they need to decide whether to give visa free access to each country individually
Most people outside of Europe can't spell Croatia, let alone give them visa free access
Many countries signed bilateral agreements with the EU that give EU members visa free access to their country
The Micro-states being Non-EU countries are excluded from such bilateral agreements
Currently the strongest passport available for sale is the Maltese passport
Many countries signed bilateral agreements with the EU that give EU members like Italy visa free access to their country
The Vatican being a Non-EU country is excluded from such bilateral agreements
Depends on the year but right now the German passport is the most powerful
The figures are based on 223 distinct visa policies
There are places like American Samoa which are not countries by any stretch of the imagination, but nonetheless have their own visa policies
Yes, they absolutely would
Who the fuck were luxembourg and malta fighting
Regarding the Suez crisis the canal was seized months before, they failed to retake it
Tactically speaking they weren't defeated, they suffered a strategic defeat due to diplomacy failure and perhaps that they didn't advance far enough
I don't necessaroly agree, there's some merit in separating milotary results from strategic victory
A definitive proof that Israel is the only permanent safe place for Jews in the world
Anti-semitism is rising in Belgium
Why is that
I'm personally a leo Jew but I know a few cancer Jews
Meh it hurts when you are young but as you grow older you get used to it
I want to one day befriend someone like that, and then after a while of being friends just casually reveal I'm Jewish, to see what happens
As a Jew this really touched my heart, I've seen so much anti-semitism on reddit recently and it kind of gets to you're mind you know
Hate the current government
Why do they think Sweden is socialist
Yeah I remember a thing from a couple of months ago where this fox news reporter talked about how "there's something rotten in Sweden" or some shit and this Swedish guy basically debunked everything she said
When he visited USSR he argued bread queues are good thing because that means no food is being wasted xDdd
The Republicans definetly fit a lot of the characteristics of fascism
Cult of tradition, rejections of modernism, irrationalism, nationalism, a conspiracy about a wealthy elite, militarism, etc
Back when there were 4 continents
this is the most american thing ever, i'm surprised there weren't more bald eagles and hamburgers involved
Technically Semitic is a very broad language group which is currently considered  a pretty poor denominator of common ethnicity given how widespread its usage has become
Its like 'Germanic' which encompasses hundreds of different individual groups but even more generalized since it spans all the way from Syria to Yemen and North Africa
Ethnic Jew would be like Ethnic Dane in the Germanic category
&#x200B;
just wondering, what country was your original
So you don't want to be related because of him

Weird days we live in when germany is considered morally superior over the nation liberated its own concentration camps
UK is actually short for Ukraine
It's actually colder than usual for the hellscape of weather here
You can read a childrens book in 4,5h. I'm assuming he's holding them off the Brothers Karamazov for now
Being inside and focusing only on something close to you all the time without pause is bad for your eyes, especially in childhood, no question about it
Its bad regardless of using a flash light though
Visit Israel it’s cooler
Four million tourists visited Israel last year and not one of them were killed
Yeah but that’s Eilat
It’s like if Ireland had an island territory way south and saying it’s hot there
You mean Northern Ireland
Why would the IRA bomb the south
And the British didn’t control the south
Doesn’t make sense
Relax there lad was just asking questions
I heard a lot of Irish people look at the IRA favorable that true
