Lithuania often ranks among the top countries by suicide rates
It's like ~1/4000 lithunians is gonna kill themselves
We have the highest overall and male suicide rate in the world
That Lithuania most of the time tops the first place by the suicide rate in the whole World, not just Europe, which is extremely sad and depressing
Lithuania has the highest murder and alcoholism rate in the EU
Yeah I wanted to write this
The only anti record that came into my mind :)
In the town where I live (~1000 people, ~750 lithuanian) at least one person commits suicide over the course of three years
The record was 1 person per year, three years in a row
We’re number one or two in per capita alcohol consumption annually too
Many people might see that as some kind of badge of honor though
Tbh I'm not sure, entire studies are happening right now to find out why
I think it's the blend of our horrible past, history where killing yourself was more prideful then losing
And today's stigma about suicide, still stigma even tho it's hurting our home sooo badly
But correct me if I am wrong, those concentration camps were not made to purposefully kill people, just group them up and lock them up
Something like what USA did to local Asians during WW2, rather than extermination camps of Nazis
I need Russia to join EU
Badly
Poland
It is just too big, to drive through, I would prefer a boat
I know that they are not in EU but Ukraine and Belarus
We do that and Lithiania once again extends from Baltic sea to the Black sea
Kaliningrad
Because it's most densely military area in Europe
Just for our safety
That's it, nothing more
Estonia or Norway
Estonia, so they could be truly *baltic*
Vycka tavim didžiuotusi
You just can't outplay that snake, can you
Totally related to the topic
Don't overthink
Can we replace their government with water
Not for us
We only border Kaliningrad
For all plastic bottles and cans there’s an Extra 10 cent fee, BUT if it has a “deposit sticker” then u can deposit it at a recycling box and you will get kinda like a coupon check which you can give to cashiers, and they will give u 10 cents
Our % of teenagers alcoholics got bigger lmao
Getting in a union with Poland and then losing half of the territory to them
When we were occupied by the Russians, after ww1 getting independence, then being occupied by soviets, nazis and then soviets again
Or maybe during Lithuanian - Polish commonwealth when Austria, Prussia and Russia just slowly ate up the country
Truly bruh moments
We had something similar with Lithuanian President Brazauskas and Latvian PM in 1990s.
Wouldnt it be 21 years
Well actually the HoC has been slowing down progress this whole time with regards to Brexit
There have been many instances where party line was more important than the actual interest of the country
Lithuanians wouldn't put it that way
Yea
But you said litteraly
Looks about the same here in Lithuania
Except the at least half decently skilled or a little motivated people can manage to improve a lot by doing well at their jobs
However, children are usually cared for, and even growing in the most severe poverty can be escaped with enough determination to seek education
Personally witnessed at least 5 such cases where children from poor alcoholic families made it out to be upper mid class
Why is this place like that
It's the mentality of that group that breeds this type of behavior
They have taken over that neighborhood mostly illegally and turned it into a place no one else would even think of moving to
But since it's not actually theirs they do not take care of it and just trash the place
We had a similar thing in Vilnius
He'd probably die in a mysterious way it he did it too publicly, though
All the time
I use English *way* more than Lithuanian, so I usually start forgetting words in Lithuanian and only know the English (and sometimes French) translation
Luckily - not yet, and hopefully never
I'm a language lover in general and sometimes go out of my way to speak Lithuanian and respect the grammar as much as possible
If I didn't pay as much attention I would definitely be getting worse, because English is SO prevalent
I lived in the US for many years and spoke my native tongue only an hour or two a week when I called my family
It was all mainly a catch-up, no deep discussions
I moved back home over a month ago and there’s an obvious struggle to retrieve some words
Usually I can say it in English first and then trace it back to Lithuanian but I noticed that sometimes in the middle of the sentence I can’t retrieve any of the words even though I know what I want to say
I suspect it will go away when Lithuanian becomes dominant out of sheer use
Just like how it was when I first moved to the US
I look at languages as different codes and, well, it’s downright confusing to operate in 2 different codes at the same time so one of them has to take a back seat
At least in my experience
I study in Ireland so I have to speak English
After returning home I realised that I am replacing some words with English ones
Kinda reminds of some Russian songs with additional English words which make a song a bit incomprehensible
Also it affected my accent a bit- my speech has become more slurred and fast
Many English words have become slang and are often used in my own language
You do this more with younger people and talking about very modern/technological topics, but yes
Often times it's easier to express something in English
I lived in the US for 11 years and everyone that noticed my accent and chose to acknowledge it thought it was the coolest thing
That really helped me with “owning” it
My accent is basically RP + Estuary English (Not as strong as Adele or anything)
That's fine by me
In general though, I have no idea what a general Lithuanian accent is since most people I know have very different accents, so I don't really have an opinion on that
Do I like it
Well, it's barely existent
I don't even know what sort of accent I have
Consuming so much British and American media has made my accent into one that my parents don't even understand
They understand someone with a heavy accent better, because there's is heavier too
But do I like the lithuanian one
Mehh, not really
Sounds like a lighter version of Russian, so onfe again, meh
I lowkey feel ashamed of the Lithuanian-English Accent
It just sounds so bad
I don't think I have a big accent compared to others, because I speak english a lot so for me, if there is an accent, I don't even care about it
I think german accent is easy to understand for other europeans
It's good, I'm not bothered by it
I study in the US and people only say it's a cool accent after they find out that I am not Russian lol
Lithuanian here living in UK, please understand that some of us try to lose it for the sake of clarity, sometimes it's really hard to understand what others are trying to say due to their accent
Besides, I find it satisfying pronouncing things properly, especially smooth R instead of rolled one
I don't think sounds are part of the accent, but due to lack of training/learning the other language
And for the life of me I can't pronounce thirty three without making it sound so bad I can't understand what I'm saying myself
I can read pronounciations, I know each and every sound in English language, I have no problems with them individually at all, but the combination th and r (three) just kills it for me :D
American accent is acquired from us, non english speakers, watching movies and YouTube in English
At least I was told I have somewhat American accent and I spoke English about
A month worth of time in my entire life aside from school before coming to UK
Be proud of American accent as I think it's the most clear and easy to understand one, at least for us, non-native English speakers who basically learnt English through movies, YouTube, internet
I live in UK for almost a year and I still have hard time understanding one of my coworkers accent, just a thick british one, muffled and fast paced mannerism of speach
Living in UK for a year, I've been asked if I'm Polish far more often than if I'm Russian and probably only once or twice it was nailed down to Lithuanian, by other Lithuanians that is
We sound Slavic due to similar sounds consisting in our Language I assume, same rolled R and some other that are surprisingly difficult to notice and get rid off I think
From my experience (Lithuanian here), I can easily tell Russian-English accent apart from ours
But I have hard time seperating British and Lithuanian accents due to being so used to hearing both
My biggest problem with my accent is lack of clarity, I've learnt to speak slower than usual just to sound clearer and not to skip so many words
In Lithuanian you can very often skip I, you and similar words, because context usually is very clear what you are talking about, different grammar rules help with that
Eg: person A: have you vacuumed the living room
Person B: (I've) vacuumed (it) already
Words in parentheses are skipped
Poor example, but first thing that came to mind and showcases 3 out of 5 words in that sentence being skipped
And a little bit of direct translation, vacuumed should be changed to done to make more stylistic sense I believe
I don't know if that accent in the video is a stereotypical Lithuanian accent, just as an example one of the most prominent features in the Lithuanian language is devoicing (making the last few sounds of  words softer/quieter), this doesn't happen in the video
This is also a feature in RP, albeit it's less pronounced than in Lithuanian
So if you meet a Lithuanian with an RP accent, you can usually tell because they devoice too much
Then again, IDK if devoicing is a thing in russian, so maybe
Besides, most of the people I met think foreign accents are sexy
Exotic, fun and interesting would be more precise description, so there's that
Have a nice day :)
1st
Appreciate the color
What does it mean
2nd
Just watched the video
That's so thick and cringy, they sound so incredibly monotonous and not a single English sound in place, I couldn't understand half of them personally, especially politician reading notes
With girlfriend we joked about how he wrote down a text in Lithuanian letters and just read it without knowing what he's talking about
At the end, our former president, Dalia Grybauskaitė talking with Obama, a better example of our accent, or mine at least, but very monotonous and for that reason alone I do my best to make highs and lows in a sentence just to sound like a human instead of robot
This level of monotonousness (is that even a word
) sounds like a robot speaking, google translate text to speach
Most of the clipps forgot about R and Th sounds, which are not present here, so I guess it's a bit difficult to learn them
Mostly because their screens don't crack as much (at least from what I know)
I love how you mentioned the edl but not the real issue
Or you could just be specific and say that it’s home to sharia zones
At my school popular is
"Electricity went out in my house, so domophone doesn't work, therefore I cannot get out"
[image of domophone]
There will be two teams:
Labor staff (cleaning, fixing various stuff, growing food)
Nerd staff (IT devs, laser geeks, scientists)
Both of the groups will be known as people who knows what they do, however they also like to indulge in alcohol / energy drinks or both
By indulge I mean these drinks are their food
And you hope that you don't find them in the middle of the binge
2 weeks here
Wait, you have to work somewhere for an extra 5 months after you tell them you want to leave
Is that how it actually works in practice
Or do both sides "come to an agreement" 99% of the time
Yup
Fun fact, people tend to use words that are used in their languages, for example elevator/lift
In Lithuanian language it's "liftas" so it was easier to learn and use "lift", however as american influence grew, people shifted to "elevator".
Oh yes
If I need to decide which word to use - I use the one which is easier
I spell in British, like coloUr instead of color
yeah first time i read about that i genuinely thought i was reading the onion
Oh I saw article about this in Lithuania
This is fucking crazy
The first thing that came to mind is Gundė. It's a female name from a book I read (the book was originally published in 1911 in America, and then in 1913 in Lithuania)
Jorė (f), Visvaldas (m)
Male:
Jogaila ( powerful rider)
Aidas ( echo)
Gintaras ( amber)
Kestutis ( patient)
Radvila ( finding hope)
Female:
Jūrate ( sea goddess)
Jadvyga ( defender)
Skaiste ( pure, virgin)
Kūnigunda ( belligerent)
Sanita ( sunpuddle)
Ona (grace)
Svajone ( dream)
I also know a guy from my hometown named Svetogor (sublime)
I'd say for women it's Ona (or Onutė) is a more relatable name for the older generation and not popular among young people
For men it's something like Algis (or Algimantas)
Isn't Jorė a pretty hipsterish contemporary Baltic name
I wouldn't call Skaidra an outdated name here in Lithuania
Also Bronė, Petronė, Vanda
Bronius, anything-slovas (Stanislovas, Boleslovas)
True, true
I imagine a grandma when I hear this name
The new hip thing to do with names nowadays is ripping them off other obscure languages
I know Kaan who is a son of physicians
Well, somehow I imagine a baby of young eco-friendly parents
haha I can see that
I don't get these shortened names in Slavic languages
Just how do you get those names into excistense when they're sooo different from the original xD
Oh yeah, I get that, we're all just lazy really
But what I don't understand is how you get such different shortened versions from their original names
The English ones are all pretty similar to the original
In 2050 there will be groups denying fossil fuel damage, like there are antivaxers now
Yeah
For some reason when I hear Lithuanian music on the radio at first I have to take a second to understand what language it is, before realizing that I'm a complete moron
Half my friends speak Lithuanian with English words in between, so mo, not really
Lol, idek how to say turnout in Lithuanian :D
Lithuanian is one of the oldest indo-european languages
It hasn't changed for ~2000 years
Lithuania was the last country in europe to be baptised
Kryžių Kalnas "The Hill of crosses" is believed to contain the highest concentration of crosses in the world
Not only are ther crosses on crosses on crosses, but there are also crosses underground, becouse the hill kept getting buldozered in the soviet times, but people were constantly rebuilding it
In Lithunian folklore there are multiple pagan holidays, that are still celebrated to this day
On one of them, only one plant of fern is believed to bloom and the one who picks it will gain supernatural powers
It's celebrated on the shortest night of summer
Pagans in Lithuania used to domesticate snakes
They were supposed to protect the house from evil spirits in exchange for food and warmth
Number 2 was actually colonies held by the Curonians, although it could be argued they were a vassal of Lithuania so the PLC indirectly did have colonies
The Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth held Moscow for 2 years not just Poland
It really frustrated me that PLC is rarely mentioned in European history but then I guess 'History is written by the victors'.
Nr 1 is absolute nonsense
The language has most certainly, notably changed in the last 2000 years
Hell, 2000 years ago the Lithuanian language didn't even exist as a distinct entity
I'm assuming you meant to say that Lithuanian is one of the more archaic languages in the Indo-European family
This impression rests largely on the high degree of faithfulness with which it has preserved the aspects of PIE phonology and nominal morphology
Calling it the “oldest” IE language is a misnomer, its conservatives in these areas cannot be gainsaid, and probably does exceed that of all the other contemporary IE languages (although such things are not easily quantified)
It should be remembered, however, that the language has not been equally conservative in all domains

Don't think, if this would be difficult, because Lithuanian language's sentence's structure is very flexible
Well we can try, even don't think that here something very different would be, quite good should work out, close to what would be with English structure
Recently, ours street, building was happening
Laying new asphalt and new sidewalk building
Builders quite quickly with it took care
New street looks good and is very more comfortable
Well in Lithuania there is this instance, the houses speaker claiming to be good at English
It sound like as if she is re doing her English speaking exam again
Cancelling basketball tournaments/events
I'm also used to staying at home all day but started getting stir crazy yesterday after all weekend
Going out for food and seeing the empty streets was even worse
This is freaking me out
Spent 2 weeks there last Summer (a week sightseeing + a weeklong 100km hike through the mountains)
After that, I will NEVER forget Iceland - MAH GAHD is it stunning
I rarely see my country posts
Like there’s snow in Africa and they need winter clothes :Dd
Wait what
I just realized that its written like this, I though it was kinder + garden
I feel like it's the case for anyone older than 20, or maybe even now
When I was a kid, it was completely normal to call black people "negrai(negroes)" or "negriukai(little negroes)", it's just how everyone called them, my parents, my grandparents, even my middle school teacher, when she wanted us to perform a scene from an old russian cartoon "[Chunga Changa] she told me and some of my classmates that we will be playing the little negroes, so we even did blackface for it, smh
I'm actually cringing writing this right now
Only when I had access to the internet, and learned english, years later, did I understand that this word is offensive
You're not alone
Last year I went to London Christmas fair and they were selling fake packaged snow there
I understand it doesnt snow in UK and they really have warm winters lately, where its just rain, but cmon
Come to Lithuania
We still have random                - 30C for at least a whole month in winter with so much snow you can barely walk or drive somewhere
If everywhere else its just rain - we still have winters and summers, but those are becoming extreme (meaning we used to never have +40 in the summer or - 40 in the winter)
No, but for some reason some people here are really hostile against Polish people
Can someone explain why
Definitely not against current Germany, but certainly in a historic sence
Nowadays we consider Germany to be advanced and peaceful, but in WW2, a quarter-million were killed here by Nazis (8% of the population), so to say that everybody's forgotten about those times, especially when the descendants of those victims are still alive, would be a total lie
Basically - people still remember the horrors, but realise they don't have to define modern day Germany
Not so much
I remember my dad mentioning that when he was in the USSR army, the sentiment was that everybody hated them
Now we’re more focused on being Russophobic
I worked for a German family in Alaska for a few years and I could pick up some scent of superiority maybe from the old members of the family
However, at one point there was a young Germany grown guy and he actually said out loud that though unfortunately Germany didn’t succeed taking Europe by force, it’s pretty much owning it through money now, so the goal was achieved
I was LIVID
Good thing I was on my way out to lunch
So, personally, it’s not that I have particularly negative feelings toward German people
I’m afraid that they still have negative feelings toward the rest of us
Nah, not really
We have a kinda neutral relationship with germans
It's more of an anti-russian sentiment here, becouse after all, more harm in lithuania was caused by russians than germans
Lithuanian here:
While its true that germany through history was oppressive and expansive, its nothing compared to russia
Germany bothered us since 1200ad, devoured and germanized fellow tribe Prussia, then took the name for themselves
During ww2 killed as much as 70% of most cities population (cause of jews, about 100k were killed in total)
Now the relations are great
Look on germany is positive, as we strive to achieve german quality level
In many cases we succeed, even surpass you, but due to lessee level of automation our prices cant compete (and also trust in our quality)
Russian invasion not only took the freedom, but took away our right to thoughts, language, culture, faith
Destruction of these things took place before ww1, then came back after ww2 with stalin
If we say germans in lithuania commited a genocide against jews with 100k casualties, then we say russia commited genocide against lithuanians with 150k casualties
This does not include exiles who returned
So no
No offensive feelings towards germany, even though it was arch- enemy for 300 years
Well, some of that
Though I think the main reason a lot of Lithuanians dislike Poles, are the Poles still living in Lithuania
Especially around Vilnius
I don't even think you can even count them as poles
They only consume propaganda filled Russian Media
Often speak a mix of Russian and Polish
Are especially anti-europe, conservative and most importantly - Pro Putin
It's ridiculous
For some reason I always thought Porsche was italian
Probably because of the way it’s pronounced in Lithuanian, it doesn’t really sound like a german surname
It's way more "Italian", than it is "French" or "German".
Rockstar isn't British
Rockstar North is based in Edinburgh, that studio has been making GTA before it was bought by Rockstar
Also -
Rockstar Games, Inc
is an American video game publisher based in New York City
(It would surprise me that they're not, considering I routinely ride out with their cycling team here in NYC
Or Smirnoff, for that matter
In many places Stolichnaya and Stoli are actually Latvian
It's literally the worst imitation
It looks like a poor attempt at being Swiss, more than anything Scandinavian
I'm pretty sure that there's a Scottish slang phrase for that
Montreal is kind of French ;)
Did I step on that British nationalism
Maggi is huge in Europe
Have you been to the instant soups and sauces aisles in Tesco or Sainsburys
Yeah
Right
That's why my comment on where Rockstar is from, you reacted like that
Tap water for sure, all of it is directly from springs
Tap water only
Unless traveling
Though we sometimes bottle tap water as well
Talking about soviet union in a positive manner
(Probanly only ok in Russia anyways) and/or any russian propaganda really
Though it is not really a BIG no no, just big cringe
Soviet/nazi symbols are banned from public, CCCP tshirt would get you in trouble in the same way "holocoust is fake" would get you in trouble in Israel
Other than that, nothing like that exist really
You can say or do wtf you want to anyone as long as its not against the law
Putting on a fake smile
Instantly writes off a person as untrustworthy or weird
Messing with historical facts
Example: we joined cccp willingly; belarus is the real lithuania; vilnius belongs to poland
Say these and any lithuanian will leave without saying a word or a heated argument could start
Its ok to have an opinion, even if its wrong
but saying these things literally spits on our recently dead relatives who took us where we are today
Bad behavior in sauna and that Lithuania is somehow related to russia is the same here
Saying lithuanians are russians is a thing that can honestly earn you a well deserved punch in the face from some people
In Lithuanian, among other languages, words Olandija and Niderlandai are synonymous and both are used when reffering to the Netherlands, so don't get too angry at foreigners :))
In Vilnius we have ticket inspectors in some stops for public buses
One time the bus I was in as a child got stopped and at that point we only had paper tickets
I was sitting and had my ticket in my pants pocket
When the inspector came to inspect my ticked I had to stand up from my seat to pull out my ticket
Fucking old granny rushed to take my seat right out of my ass as soon as I stood up
I didnt even have the time to pull out my ticket before my seat was gone
From that point, old people can take a walk, because I will never give my seat away, unless they ask first
As a person who lives in Poland, old town Kraków is definitely worth seeing
We were supposed to go to Auschwitz too, but the lockdown was so sudden we didn't.
I'm not there anymore, however I visited Wieliczka while I was
Out of all of the places I've been to in that region Ojcowski park narodowy was my favourite
The caves there are really impressive
Lithuania placed last in its first year of competing in Eurovision
Ovidijus Vyšniauskas made a beautiful song but the judges had the audacity to place him dead last
(1994)
I'm pretty sure that Lithuania placed last in our first Eurovision
I'm not sure though
Lithuania is the same from my experience, we are kind to non-white people, but behind their backs we talk a lot, mostly because they are so exotic there and when we joke around some jokes are borderline racist, but from my personal experience it was never with ill-intent
Imagine one of those african kids pictures when they met Asian person for the first time and all 15 children squint their eyes with said Asian person in photo
No ill intent, just something exciting I guess
Coming from a person on whose languages mainly consists of o,u,I only
On a serious note I guess it is because Denmark is a really flat nation and snow I guess is not the same as 'up norf'?
Possibly the same name origin, my Godparents son's name is Ovidijus as well, purebred Lithuanian for the last generation or two at least
Some times it does, but rarely
When discussing history with russian friends, some times we argue till we go home
But in general we try to avoid such subjects or refrain from commenting their opinion in a serious way, cause we cant get to a conclusion
With polish friends - not so much
Likely because you still live in what you call history
We do the opposite
We dwell on the bitterness of history, we constantly compare today with what was, trying to run as far away from it while it is still possible
We feed on that biterness to create something sweet
It drives us
Not really, all we have is 100 days
Basically, a 100 days before the exams, the graduates come and throw some fun
thing
For example, one time they just drove their cars around the school stadium
Other times, it isn't as creative
This year they justblasted music at the school entrance and ripped off Coachella
I wasn't there, of course, but from what people said, the Coachella ripoff party was fun
We have last bell celebration
Its basicly where every student dresses formal and rides their decorated cars in convoys and constatly honks
It annoys me to no end that "é" is rendered as "ey" in English
Can't they just suppress the [j] sound at the end
[Not exactly the same, but I hope it still counts, enjoy your weekend

Yep, when someone from Žemaitija region tries to speak Lithuanian to me
i can BARELY understant something
I dont speak Russian but even I could year the heavy american accent in John Wick
I'll be honest, Garbage men have had a much more positive effect on my live than bankers (or most other "fancy" professions)
That we speak latin
Because clearly Germans are not Mongols
I mean DUH
You wish braliuk
Whaaaat
Such a big country and just now
We had it for decades now, even my grandparents had it in soviet times, no one has ever thought of changing it and if you dont obbey it - your child is not allowed in kindergardens or schools, simple as that
Of course there's always some private schools that allow it, dont check the gp records, bc they get paid well for that child and sometimes something happens, but its easily contained
In some movie the phrase „officer down“ was translated to „pareigūnas daunas“ . Daunas is a derogatory word for people with down syndrome, or just in general a insult
The movie "Kick ass" was translated to "Ateik čia arba gausi į dūdą" which basically means "come here or you will get beat up"
We also have Žalia Rūta as an insult, i can’t even imagine it being an insult in the english language
Also, the title of the movie "Cristopher Robin" was translated to "Jonukas". Jonukas is the diminutive form of Jonas, or John in english
You such a green plant, i cant believe it lol
Sounds like something out of Friends
Yes, heard it on the news
"Find you a man that looks at you like /u/gorgich looks at Astrakhan Oblast"
It was around 32°C (89,6°F) today, so it's pretty terrible
The nights are around 17°C (62,6°F), but upstairs it doesn't get that cool, even with all of the windows open
But it's still better than the day
The summers have been getting hotter throughout the years, but so have to the winters and idek what spring or autumn is any more
But thank you for asking nonetheless
Hope it's alright where you're at
I am absolutely NOT okay
The sun always gives me a headache, I sweat like a pig and sleeping with the balcony open doesn't even help because I have a bunk style bed which means that all the heat just comes up and melts me in my sleep
We are supposed to get some rain tomorrow so I cannot wait for that awesome cool and fresh air after it stops
It was hard at first, but over time I got used to it
I sleep with an open window (I live in a small town, so the air is fresh), so at least that's good
I actually kinda like these warm nights
You can sit there after coming out of the sauna, listen to birds and just enjoy nature
Yesterday there was an owl in my neighbourhood, so that was a pleasant little surprise and something for a change of listening
There's also nightingales
Their singing is just amazing
I've never heard a bird sing more beautifully than them
Yes, doing ok
It's maybe 30C there
Although it's torture being in the bus, and the nights are very hot (and we have no AC)
I am definitely looking into buying a fan now
Thanks and stay safe too :)
Wow, that's an unusual song
A really pleasant one
I have one more bird song, to really impress someone, who hasn't heard it
I believe this bird is called the bittern
The male calling is enchanting
It sounds almost unnatural
I couldn't find any good examples (most were 5 minute long clips of the bird just walking around), but from what I can describe it's a really loud, low sound, travelling just above the ground
The noise can sound like it's two metres (~6ft) behind you when in reality it's 50 metres
It's also a number one basis for dinosaur vocalizations apparently they sounded like this
You can google it, but to truly experience a bitterns song, you have to hear it yourself
One time, when you'll be wandering in a lithuanian swamp, or around a lake you won't need to think, to recognize it
Hehe, now we are having a full week of storms and cold rain
:Dd
Excellent point
Some people say "Lithuanians are born with a basketball in their hands
Elektrėnai in Lithiania imo
Its name literally comes from the word electricity and they have all of that electric stuff of the country
and also a lot of soviet flats
That it
I've heard some people call Kaunas ugly
Idk why, I've just heard people joking about it a lot, so I guess that would be it
Yeah but they filmed in Vilnius, lithuanias capital, which is cool but then you realize that not much changed since the disaster
I've been to ostrava and it was not great
Srsly
From all those cities of Lithuania you have chosen Kaunas
It's pretty ok I guess, especially now when lots of reconstruction/new projects are happening there
Which is sad, buuuuuut it opened peoples minds and  they realised thet not all of vilnius looks like that, so now major productions like stranger things are coming to vilnius
It's just what I've heard, but I'm not sure
The State of Lithuania shall be an independent democratic republic
Lithuania:
**Article 1**
The country of Lithuania is independent democratic republic
&#x200B;
Sorry for bad translation :/
Article 1
The State of Lithuania is an independent democratic republic
The Lithuanian state is an independent democratic republic
Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucija/Constitution of The Lithuanian Republic
Article 1:
Lietuvos valstybė yra nepriklausoma demokratinė respublika
/The Lithuanian state is an independent democratic republic
>Lithu
We also have a preamble:
>THE LITHUANIAN NATION
>– having created the State of Lithuania many centuries ago,
– having based its legal foundations on the Lithuanian Statutes and the Constitutions of the Republic of Lithuania,
– having for centuries staunchly defended its freedom and independence,
– having preserved its spirit, native language, writing, and customs,
– embodying  the innate right of the human being and the Nation to live and create  freely in the land of their fathers and forefathers—in the independent  State of Lithuania,
– fostering national concord in the land of Lithuania,
– striving for an open, just, and harmonious civil society and a State under the rule of law,
by the will of the citizens of the reborn State of Lithuania, adopts and proclaims this
>CONSTITUTION
You should not have attempted translating yourself:
>(c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people
Yikes
>So fuck the 30% Russians living in Latvia, I suppose
why though
I assume they have Latvian citizenship, thus they are "latvian nationals". I don't think it's talking about ethnic latvians
It is on the parliament's web site
Generated by MS Word 15 according to the meta tag :D
I guess you're right then, we have the same word with the same meaning in lithuanian
I dont really see a problem there
You can always learn latvian, but you can‘t become an ethnic latvian if you‘re born an ethnic russian
i think u just accepted cookies
Tbh the whole country except maybe for the big three cities
Edit: the big two cities
Drinking cold drinks from a cup
Parking front first also
I'm not sure if other languages have this, but we have words that can only be plural
For example, "door" is "durys" and, despite being 1 door, it's already plural
Same with glasses (akiniai)
The only language that retains similarities with ancient sanskrit and these words are being used daily so you know
I'm guessing Lithuanian has it too, but it's not really ever used
Yeah, the "Baltic chain of freedom" is cute
You Germans are awesome, look at how you bounced back from WW II, meanwhile we (Lithuania) have highest suicide and alcoholism rates in europe and depending on source in the world (say top 5 in both for sure
Edit: we had a baltic road and first to get freed from SARS (CCCP, USSR, forgot which one is English abbreviation) grips
And how do I get a flag next to my name
That's awesome, but aren't we free for just about 30 years now from Soviet Union
Or was it reference to after WW I?
Edit: Lithuanian here
Maybe, I'm not much into history and nobody really talks about independence all that often aside from USA and where it's relevant at this very moment (HK for example I think)
At least in my opinion, being under Soviet Union is not exactly a freedom, independent country per say, but that's my personal opinion
Naples
Mafia, nuff' said
Any big soviet easter european city
Guns are legal in most of Europe, you just need a permit
I know, still doesn't mean that guns are illegal in the rest of Europe, whoch was implied by op
You guys get tourists
This is why I can't think of a single tourist trap that exists here
But I've been seeing people coming here more and more, so I bet there will be some sort of a scam developed soon
That's when we'll know we've become a tourist destination
Y-yeah
Eastern
Europe
You mean like the neighborhood itself is a trap of sorts
I don't know, never really thought of it that way, I feel like the people who live there depict themselves the same way to both locals and tourists - we also all know and acknowledge that they're a self-proclaimed republic where you can be a free spirit (not in a legal way, but in a fun quirky way, because the neighborhood is full of artists and people like that)
When I was in highschool I remember that all the cool artsy kids when to Užupis gymnasium, and their parents were painters and sculptors who had lived in Užupis for a long time
I think seeing how the EU and the UN divide Europe into regions should be enough
It's completely on you though
Yes we do, just weirdos on reddit keep showing off their inferiority complex about it
I really don’t give a shit about basketball(not even when our team is playing)
I like cepelinai, kugelis and kvass, although I detest šaltibarščiai
My relatives strongly suffered from the Soviets and I'm not a Russophile, together I am fluent in 3-4 foreign languages
I celebrate Kūčios and Vėlinės like they are described in encyclopedias, and I like basketball when it's Žalgiris or Lithuanian team playing
Was baptised in Catholic church, but nobody really adhereres to religion in my family
I don't know if Lithuania has many stereotypes, because we are not known by anyone outside of eastern europe
I hate basketball
I never enjoyed it
Watching it is torture
I love basketball, am introverted, softspoken, love nature
That's about it
I'm not tall (174cm), I don't like alcohol, I don't like sour cream, I don't like šaltibarščiai
Soviet Union was another incarnation of Russia just like Russian Empire or Russian Federation
Soviet Union was another incarnation of Russia just like Russian Empire or Russian Federation
Western movies do not portray Lithuania
The only two I can think of was the one about Hanibal Lecter and the one about Jewish resistance with Daniel Craig, but none of them really focused on the Lithunia aspect of it
Lithuanian movies portray Lithuania and they are their own special kind of terrible and awful
Lol, that's hilarious, I'm surprised that no "Lithuania mentioned in movies and tv shows" youtube compilations has this, probably nobody heard of this show
In 2010 or around that time, class mate asked my physics teacher what is CERN all about
She said its the biggest scientific project atm, and it might create a black hole that will swallow the world
I think she forgot that in order to create a phenomenon with so much energy you need to put even more energy  to do it
Sounds like Half Life storyline
Polish people say Wilno nasze (Vilnius is ours) because at some points in history they occupied it
Lithuania jokes about reconquering Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and anything else standing between them and the black sea
It's covered pretty constantly
The elections and protests
I feel bad for Belarussian people, they honestly seem like they've had enough of that bald asshole
It would be nice to not have a dictator next door
I expected it to have some coverage, but actually there's a lot of it
On our most popular [news site] the article about the protests is on the front page, with over a thousand comments while other articles have up to 100
So yeah, we've heard a bit about it
in Lithuania of course it's the major news right now, we have a lot of interest to have a pro-european neighbours, also there is this nuclear power plant 50km from Vilnius in belarus that was just launched and with Lukashenko on board it is very much a big concern for us
Here it is number 1 or 2 topic on every channel and covered quite extensively
Lithuania also sent a letter demanding for fair and free election and for Belarus stop the violence against its people peaceful protest
We Lithuanians support you whole heartedly ️ and we understand what you going through
Never give up for your rights and liberties, but fight for them like your Ukrainian brother's and sisters did :)
It’s not 16 in every state
In New York you must be 18 if you don’t take a drivers education course and 17 if you do take one
Lithuania:
Driving B1 category car: 16
Joining military: 18, may be involuntary
Buy a gun: in some cases allowed at 18
Buy a beer: 20
So you could just put two prices next to each other - with and without taxes
That would solve both problems
Ethnicity, you mean
Yes, you can even ask to write your ethnicity to the passport, but in means nothing in legal sense
we can get movie tickets and a bar of chocolate
Lithuania itself hasn't been discovered by many, but within the country, Neringa curonian spit is very rarely visited by foreigners
It is most famous for its large sand dunes and colorful traditional fishing villages most famous one being [Nida] it coasts 20€ per car to enter the area, so needless to say it's not the most popular destination even among Lithuanians
It's 30 EUR now
Maybe not a week, but Nida is definitely worth a few days visit
Rest can spent in nearby Klaipėda
The f*ck is wrong with these guys
They want to make it 50
Simply too many cars entering Neringa during summer
The cost is supposed to restrict it
That's a hell of a strategy for a region that's completely dependant on tourism
The region wants tourists, not cars
They want to make it so people stay in Klaipėda then go to Neringa without their car and take a bus/bike to see the sights
Maybe they will get some electric buses like Palanga
I thought they also had a tax on bikes
Meant bicycles
Motorcycles do have a low tax too
My favourite factoid on the topic is that Spanish *mucho* and English *much* are not related
Malta
It has a nice vibe
Most likely Germany (German)
Because that's like 3 extra german speaking countries where I can live
Paradoxically, because of a relative large Polish community, you could speak only Polish
Wear something with pockets
And keep Vitamin D tablets in those pockets
Dont take my comment as snarky
Just an interesting fact about Iceland given their small population
Cause total Polish community in there is not that large
We were talking about Icelandic population though
No, they aren't.
I know them, just because I go to Spanish classes and we sometimes play with teacher
I wear my jacket below 10 if it is not raining, I wear rainproof jacket if it is 10-15 and raining
But I don't consider that cold, for me anything below -10 is cold which almost doesn't happen anymore
26+ hot
20 - 25 warm
15 - 20 normal, hoodie
9 - 15 summer jacket
0 - 8 autumn coat
\-8 - 0 autumn coat with something warm underneath
Below 0 is when it starts to feel pretty cold
\-9 and lower feels properly cold
Winter coat
\-15 (or colder) with wind/-20 (or colder) without wind is when I wanna avoid going out
&#x200B;
It depends where you are though
I lived in the Netherlands for a year and it was probably the difference in humidity or some kind of other similar factors, but the same temperatures over +20 seemed hotter in NL, and ones at around 0 seemed colder
Didn't happen in the last few years, but it might happen again and it might get colder than ever during some future winters
Climate is whack
Money, blue, foreign people walking in old town, assumed feeling freedom of having no borders, quality (with guarantee of socialy/environmentaly responsible manufacturing processes)
Mostly sights I associate with Europe (like the Eiffel Tower) and sights I associate with my home country (like the Gediminas castle)
Blanket, cocoa and and a heater
But truth be told, my biggest caffeine intakes are during dark months because I can't get up without light, so I usually: drink 3+ cups of coffee and work with all the lights on
Well you see, sure it would be nice to enjoy sunny evening, but our evenings are cold so might as well just stay at home
Otherwise just do what you like and stick with it until sun comes out again
We just kind of got used to it
It's pretty depressing though, especially when people go to work while it is still dark and return home when it's dark already (it is already pitch black by 5pm)
During this time people tend to spend free time in malls by going to restaurants and cafes
Voting is always a compromise for me, I'm much too left for any party to represent my views here
Parliament - we have like 4 major parties at the moment (parties rise and disassemble every election), so there'll always be a pick, and our system is in a way, where even if you vote for a party that barely has any support, if it still manages to get some level of votes, they'll get a seat or two, so the vote still counts
President:
Luckily not in 2019, since both of the 2nd round candidates were adequate, and the truly bad candidate imo was third
2014 - we reelected what we had - Grybauskaitė, since she was doing quite good a job
2009 - Grybauskaitė won on the first round, she got over 69% of the votes from a list of 7 candidates, so there wasn't even a 1v1 scenario
Aaand I'm too young to remember any other elections
Really common, although it's different about smoking in public places
You rarely see people smoking on the street, but when it gets dark, or they get inside, suddenly someone dissapears for a few minutes every 20 minutes and it changes
No one really cares, but people still just go by the unwritten rules
Lithuania:
Common among 35+ and lower class people, very uncommon in 20-30 age professionals (mid-upper mid class)
Perceived only slightly negatively in a professional world as its more of a distraction to everybody and a waste of work time i guess
22% in 2020 compared to 28% in 2017
So it's declining
In general it's perceived negatively
Also there are a lot of rescrictions for where you can smoke
In past few years alot of people switched from smoking to vaping, which has a slightly better reputation
Yeah I was going to say during the day not so much
After dark it seems like 60-70%
Second grade
Damn thats young af
AND skating
Can you believe the riff raff in Romania
Vilnius is polish , " Thats russia right " , communism was better (mostly said by unemployed alcoholics and 89 year old grandmas )
Oy, neighbor, wanna discuss Adomas Mickevičius/Adam Mickiewicz as well
Yup, same for all Baltic states
Also are you triggered when someone says that you are Baltic country not Scandinavian
Cause youre Baltic
Basically it was the allies, with soviet union as human shield to soak the bullets
Intelligent governments consisting of hundreds of brilliant minds had a lot more ideas how to prevent casualties and actually strategize in battles
Soviet union however was one man to rule them all, with others agreeing or risking to be executed
Also, ally soldiers were paid, well equipped and fed, while soviet union had farmers fighting with knuckles against machine guns, while being fed a palms worth of scolded grain
So again, soviet unions input in winning ww2 was tiny compared to its army size, and basically held germanys hands while allies beat it to death
I know because my great grandfather fought in the front while being a farmer (farmers were not to be drafted because they produced food, but in soviet union sheepa fly if leader says so), then was exiled to siberia with 3 children 8-14yo
Wouldnt calling it one of the American states work better
Oof, more shots fired
I wonder if brits will vote for Trump again though
Then what is eastern europe
Oh my, to me this sounds like saying 'arctic circle starts only at the northermost point of Greenland'...
We consume the 2nd largest amount of pure alcohol (12
9 litres per capita)
The only country that drinks more than us is Belarus (14
4 litres)
Never thought that Lithuania had any domestic designs of any war related vehicles until I found out about an aircraft series called ANBO
These where mid war period monoplanes
Most of the panes where designed to train pilots, but there where also scout planes and even light bombers
Hehe, can't beat us ;_;
Idk
Official statistics portal of Lithuania shows that Lithuania stabilized population-wise in 2019, so you prolly saw data before 2017-2018
Don't know about Bulgaria tho
Source:
ANBO literally means - Antanas(name) want's to be in the air
I mean, according to Wikipedia it's Belarus
Yeah I know
I found it funny :)
Depends on the beach
If it's a nudist beach it's 99%, if it's a non-nudist beach it's probably like 10-20%.
In Lithuania, highly depends on the spot
There are nudist beach part where every women for the most part is topless (mostly old ladies go there) and there are women parts of the beach where usually mothers hand around topless
Active/passive beach areas are clothed, well you know what I mean
Source: I asked my mother in the past, she loves sunbathing in the summer with grandma and/or friends in all types of beach parts
Yes we divided our beach into parts as well
What's stopping a guy from coming there
General consensus, unwritten rules, maybe life guards and you can jog through that area as long as you run across the coast, again, general consensus, nobody bats an eye about it, maybe a few, exceptions like always
Same as czech
But i have my childhood lego and bionicle stash ready for my son
Total worth is up to 2k€ i guess
Ty mom and dad
> Millennium Falcon for 780€ (The f Lego
To be fair, it will take at least half a day to construct one
I do kinda want it
Well, that's basically all the countries in europe
Although the thing about not all pagan traditions dying down is only partially true
They're remembered, yeah, but not really celebrated
There was Dziady, but it was replaced by wszystkich świętych, so to call it a pagan tradition is a stretch
I probably see it from a different point of view, becouse in Lithuania pagan traditions make up 50% of all major holidays
We still celebrate Dziady (Vėlines in Lithuanian), žolinės (Zielna), Jorė (Idk how it's called in polish, rasos šventė (morning dew holiday) and even more
I've heard about kupała in poland, but I haven't heard it's celebrated anymore
&#x200B;
Our 2012-2016 Prime Minister Butkevičius speaking English that bad that he even replaced English words for similar sounding Lithuanian with idiotic meanings
Pick an English answer or press conference from any PM in the 30 years
Should be a national law in Lithuania only the foreign minister can give interviews (or answer questions) in English
Our last president wasn’t too bad either
[Užgavėnės]
I think it is quite interesting
Also this is nationwide so not like I am the only one practising it
I mean, asides from all the celebrations that a lot of countries still do, I remember when I was a kid, bread was being sold mostly in unsliced loaves
My grandmother told me to never place the loaf of bread "facing" the door, as it might "leave the house" (you starve), which I found fascinating
If you would cut a loaf in half - te side which you just cut
I guess a Lithuanian that hates basketball or beer or black bread or cold beetroot soup
Lithuanian who doesn't like basketball
A Lithuanian who doesn’t like basketball
A Lithuanian who hasn't committed suicide
>In German it is "Die Sonne"(female,the sun) and "Der Mond"(male, the moon)
same in Lithuanian, Saulė (sun, fem
) and Mėnulis (moon, masc
In Lithuania, Saule ( the Sun) is "female". Meanwhile, Menulis (the Moon) is "male".
In Lithuanian, Saulė - (sun) is a feminine gender, while Mėnulis - (moon) is masculine
We actually do not have an 'it' neutral words, everything is gendered in the language
Lithuanian:
Sun = Saulė - female, commonly referred as "mother" or "grandmother" in folklore
Moon = Mėnulis, Mėnuo, Mėnesis - male, sometimes referred as "father" in folklore
And the stars are their daughters :)
Saulė (sun) - feminine, mėnulis (moon) - masculine
Same as in German
Saulė - Sun(female), Mėnulis - moon(male)
Lol, Lithuanian has a very similar word to kuningas and that word is kunigas, meaning priest
Traditionally: Vytautas the Great  (1392-1430) and Stephen Bathory (1576-1586) reigns and, of course, the interbellum (1918-1940)
However, actually **now** Lithuania is in its heydays
Probably when Grand Duke Gediminas ruled, although I don't think I've heard anyone describe it as a golden age
I think you can also put the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a golden age too, but Lithuania itself didn't have as much power and authority in those times, there were disagreements in politics, which basically led to The three partitions
Anyways, I'd say 1300s were a golden age because there weren't any major wars, the population was growing, new trade routes to the western countries, and because of Gediminas, skilled artisans were coming from all over Europe in order to sell and teach artisans in Lithuania
P.S. I actually have never heard of a golden age in Lithuania's history, so I don't know the details, or if this counts as a golden age
Lithuania in the XIV-XV centuries, when it covered lands streaching from the Baltic to the Black sea
Although Lithuanians were a minority in their own country, we still view those days of the Grand Dutchy of Lithuania as our golden age
During his reign the Commonwealth was in its zenith and catching up with most developed European countries
He also opened Vilnius University in 1579, the first one in Lithuania
Not really, it is not 1930s anymore
And even if you hate PLC, Stephen Batory can be remembered as just a Lithuanian grand duke
In Wales
Damn most have never heard of Lithuania, so I guess  Vilnius having the largest baroque old town in Europe should have more visitors than just a few tour groups from Asia
I would have to say Anykščiai and Nida are very good places to visit when you are in Lithuania
I went to Adršpach once and I gotta say, it was pretty cool
Anykščiai are really visited
Nida or Klaipėda or Samogitia are worth visiting
Also Panemunė
Oh really
I rarely see any tourists at Anykščiai but i think that Klaipeda is visited very often but Samogitia is pretty chill ngl
Klaipėda isn't visited very often
Most foreign people here are from International University
Anyksciai is popular, because every Lithuanian teacher goes to anyksciai, because you know, Biliūnas
I recommend Samogitia
I went with class trips nearly everywhere in Samogitia
It's big and interesting place
Go visit very high hills (200m or less), go visit stone museum, Telšē and other cool cities
Biggest Japanese garden in Europe
I forgot to add Šiauliai to this list
Šiauliai are on border of Samogitia
Šiauliai have bicycle, photography, cat museums, big malls to shop, very known boulevard and other interesting places
German, French, Russian can be quite an asset
Other than that, it can be region specific, in the baltics for example, Swedish is quite handy
Difficulty probably depends where you are from
I learnt german it school, didn’t learn much, because I didn’t have motivation back then, but trying to improve it now and it’s not difficult
While my vocabulary is weak, I can quite easily pick out words when listening to someone speaking
Russian seems like one of the easiest languages for me to start learning now, because I’m used to occasionally hearing russian in the bus and other places, also there are a lot of words similar to lithuanian
On the other hand, I tried to look into french, but I just can’t wrap my head around it
The whole sentence sounds like one word
And words are pronounced differently than they are written
I see you are from Romania and as far as I know french is from the same language family as romanian
So I assume french is much easier for you, because it is much more similar than a lot of other languages
I've been learning Russian for 5 years now
I mean I can easily hold a conversation in a restaurant, shop, talk about simple subjects in Russian, but I'm still at least 3 years away from fluency and if a subject gets even a bit more complicated - I'm lost
For comparison - it took me 5 years to learn completely fluent English, starting from nothing
In Catalonia you beat a log that shits presents
Stalin or Żeligowski
For me Vitkauskas
He was the military head in Lithuania
He refused to resist in ww2 and later joined ussr army
Both of them are hard according to my English and American friends
I can see why it would be kinda hard, but I don't think of it as THAT bad
But pronunciation, especially with letters like ą, ę, ž, č, ū, etc can be very difficult
(If you want to know something, just message me and I'll try my hardest to help )
Iceland, Denmark, Slovenia, Croatia and Latvia for being the first countries to recognize our freedom in 1991
Iceland, for recognizing our independence in 1991, the first in the West to do so
That kind act is still remembered and was very important
We want to thank the Polish for being our best friends after all the fighting that happened in the middle ages
Thanks to Iceland for being the first country to recognice our freedom ️. Ya’ll rock
Im not good at history so thank u Latvia for being our best friends :) we really love yall over here <3
I have to second that, Dutch isn't that challenging if it's slow, it also get easier if you hear it often enough
Also, [this song is a gem]
Well, with that attitude
I would say the News channel, ( LRT, TV3, LNK ) do cover US often,but mostly if there's important things like: Californian fires and Protests
Also when the american news segment comes, it is short and most often covered last
On Radio even less
But if you ask Lithuanian on the street about what is happening in US, most people would only know the big things that happened and, only in the basic way
A lot
And honestly, the moment that something about the US comes up I know they did some stupid shit again
To some extent, yes
My first trip outise of europe was to Vancouver, Canada
I didn't think thr cultural difference would so big
I guess it's not really indentity, but rather mentality that binds a lot of europeans togheter
For example: in canada, every cashier was constantly trying to start a small talk
Nowhere in europe have I encountered that
Yeah, just not in Europe
In quite a few post colonial societies, you'd find this thing called "whiteness", and that's about the only thing that actually comes close to a "European" identity
what shared culture and Ideals
Every country has different cultures, some of them widely different, ideals is even more obscure a term
Horny
What
Poland, Estonia
Latvia too but they're our brothers so we don't really rival them like that
Uhhh, Russia
Nooo, Latvia will always be our best braliukas <3
You should learn Austrian history a lot more closely ;) You know that Austro-Hungarian Empire was a major party to that clusterf\*&k, right
The trigger to WWI
It's part of your history
That part of the world is most definitely part of your history
(presuming you're Austrian)
This isn't a comparative issue, btw
It's just Austrian history leading to WWI
Same in Lithuania
Isn't that in entire world
mėsa - meat in Lithuanian
mesa - table in Spanish
Preservative (prezervatyvas) means condom in Lithuania
Also, the latin/italian/spanish curva sounds very similar to kurwa, which, like in poland, is also a very popular swearword here(albeit we do not use it nearly as creatively as the poles)
LV-LT
Melnas/Mėlynas
Black in Latvian, blue in Lithuanian
Kakis/Kakas
Cat in Latvian, shit in Lithuanian
Riga has a famous [sculpture of a black cat on one of the roofs] Every time someone mentions "Melnas kakis" on the roof, all I can think about is a big blue shit
Well, it’s not spelled exactly the same but there is almost no difference when saying the two words in Lithuanian:
LT : Pūkas     EN: Fluff     |  LV: Pukas    EN: Dragon
Was trying to teach myself some Danish on Duoligo, and just noticed that the word avis means newspaper in Danish
In Lithuanin avis is sheep
Yeah, the czech and polish ones are the best ( I know polish too)
Poruhane rypadło - CZ broken excavator, PL Fucked  excavator
Šmatička na patičku - CZ umbrella, PL a little rag on a little stick
Drevni kocur - CZ squirrel, PL tree cat
Divka - CZ girl, PL whore
Mam Napad - CZ I have an Idea, PL I have an ambush
Sralinkova ganiačka - CZ runner, PL shit chaser
Produpnik - CZ fiancée, PL professional ass
Ja sem Netoperek - CZ I am Batman, PL I am a little bat
There are also some polish - german ones
Kurwenstop - GR painkiller, PL whore stopper/fuck stopper
Dupenwazelin - GR Hemoroid cream, PL Ass vaseline
Ihate it here, no offense but this is a living hell, the wages r really not great, the people, everyone here is deppressed its just a shit hole
Climate wise, we experience heat and cold, probably not as much cold as the north and not as much heat as the south, although I’m bigger heat fan than cold, so it’s quite meh for me
We have sea but we don’t have mountains, it’s all flat
That I don’t mind cause I like looking at long and wavy fields out in the horizon, simple nature with not much exotic stuff but all that kinda feels nostalgic when you go out at the lakeside, etc
Other than that, history shows that we are unlucky
We were in the middle of two super powers  - Russia and Germany while Lithuania was just a battle field in world wars, although maybe we didn’t suffer too much, compared to Poland, but occupations hurt as a lot, especially the USSR
I both like it but also dislike it for many reasons
Thanks, sending love back :) Prague is one of my favorite European cities
I am also planing to study in Denmark (once all this worldwide situation sets in, I mean)
Do you have any tips on how to start
I would apply to Master programs in life sciences, however I am not sure which university is the best if we compare quality of studies and living expenses :/
Džiaugiuosi, kad radot namus Lietuvoje
Linkiu sėkmės ir gero gyvenimo
Well, my main concerns are living conditions and language of studies
What is your opinion about English courses (if you took them)
Also, is it possible to work and study at the same time
What qualifications are necessary to find a job
Yeah, the cost of living is one of the main reasons why I decided to stay this year and save up
Thank you for the information
Three that I know are:
-sudėt kaštona (sss-hu-dhet kash-toh-nah), which means "to put a chestnut",
-kurmis lenda (khurr-miss laen-dah), or as my dialect says kūrmis landa (koor-miss lann-dah)
It means " a mole is coming
Idk if it's a local saying, so I put the dialect version in too
And perhaps the funniest one
-Einu sėst ant sosto galvot apie gyvenimą (Aei-nuh saesst ahnt sos-toh gall-vhot apee-eh ghee-veh-nih-maah), which means "I am going to sit on the throne and think about life".
Ohhhh thats what it is
Probably [Eglė, the Queen of Serpents]
Just to give you some of the highlights
A snake slithers into her blouse(coding for rape) so she is forced into a marriage with the snake
After many years, she and her new family visit her parents, brothers and uncles
Her family interrogates Egles children and the one daughter gives out the secret on how to get in touch with the snake-daddy, who then proceeds to be murdered by the brothers and uncles
Egle is so upset she basically murders her children and kills herself, happy ending for this fairy-tale
About every folk tale
Especially original tales from pagan times
We had this story where after defeating the evil witch, our hero ties her to his horse, and let's him drag her around the world, so her bones scatter and her brain matter is splattered, and it is said that when you see the snow glistening on a cold winter day, it's the bits of the witches brain that sparkle
For real
it's the same-ish story] Suwałki Region region has a variation of it
Although, I don't know what the story was doing in a collection of slavic tales (maybe you meant polish)
Europe is generally less religious than the US so usually, no
The phrase you're looking for is not insane
Latvian is possible to figure out in text form, impossible if they speak
But even reading is hard since they have many different words
I personally find Latvian pretty easy to understand
Some words are, obviously, very different but it's otherwise easy to read
Same
But their words are out of place
Try to guess what veikals mean
Veikalas in Lithuanian is work (more like result of work), but in Latvian it's a store
True
But still, when you remember what they mean (like veikals was one of the first words I learned) you don't really have a problem reading it
Yes, and also they look funny, which is a plus
[Kibinai] i'd say is the most popular food to grab as a quick bite
Zeppelins maybe
Also šakotis, but it's more like a cake
Fried bread with cheese
Kibinas, Čeburėkas (local-ish)
But most popular is Kebabas (like döner, but in lavash)
Is it though
I consider it more like a beer snack
Where can you get it in the fast food context
Weird
I haven't seen then anywhere for more than 15 years or so
They were popular back in the day, especially at the beach
But not anymore - too greasy, spoils quicky, can only eat them fresh, and good ones are hard to make
I don't know, this is the closest to the fast food I can think of
I live in a street with 12 houses
7 (including my own) have the Lithuanian flag hanging outside their house all the time
The rest hang up a flag on Independence days and other Lithuanian holidays
Considering there is a law in the Baltics, that during national holidays there has to be a flag hoisted on every house (failure to do so can get you a fine) - no, not weird at all
Do they fly national flag or historical flag
Yeah it's pretty much everywhere
Dependence on cars even if we have pretty good public transportation system
If you don't drive one, you are seen as immature or ecofascist
Mandatory military conscription
The whole point of living in a liberal democracy is freedom, and not being forced by the government to do shit like this
And yet, here we are
I don't care that we have hostile neighbors, it's not my fucking job to protect anyone
I'm suicidal half of the time, I can barely make eye contact with anyone, let alone live with 30 guys in a single room
I can't run longer than 15 meters without gasping for air, I'm physically weaker than most girls I've met in highschool
My parents live abroad
You expect me to leave my job to sleep in the forest at -15 degrees, running around exhausted with a gun that I want to point right at my own fucking face
Fuck outta here, for real
I love Lithuania
I really do
But when it comes to mandatory military conscription, it can chortle my balls without a moment of hesitation
The only time such a thing should even be constitutional in the first place is during wartime
And no, "some other countries do it too" is not an excuse
Uolektis or Ulna  - it's the distance from your elbow to your finger tips
Valakas - 21,38 ha
Statinė(barrel) - an area of land sown with one barrel filled with grains
None of these are used anymore except for maybe sometimes Uolektis
Don't forget Sprindis
How to get length of Sprindis
Make an widest L as you can with thumb and index
The length between them is Sprindis
How much is a pebble
Or do you weight yourself in 12
2 stones or smth
35kg margin is huge and can visibly change appearance
Ahh, thanks
Another fun fact
Kölsch, Lithuanian and Potawomi languages are the only ones using the letter "ė".
i dont know how hesburger is in other countries but in lithuania its awful
Yea, McDonalds is wayyyyy better
Hesburger is "cheap" mcdonald's which isn't cheap
People go to hesburger only because mcdonald's aren't in most cities, or are in pretty inconvenient locations
I live in klaipeda and there is only 1 McDonalds while theres like 7 hesburgers
Theres always a huge line in McDonalds, thats another reason i guess
that could be a reason
but living in Vilnius and after trying hesburger once i do my best to keep out of that place
Same
I live in Klaipeda too
My former school had a hesburger very near (my school was not far away from BIG), so everybody went there
Some Hesburgers have big lines too
But they made fries a little bigger, but way less of them, so it's kinda scam
Smeltė? Mašiotas
taip
Yes, indeed we use gmailas a lot, because most people use it
Nowadays people don't use Yahoo or hotmail so much
I am actually the only person I know, who uses Yahoo
I even have Yahoo Japan account
Why I don't use Gmail
I still have and use Yahoo account from early days
It's same as calling every dish soap "Fairy" because of brand
Personaly I still use mail (paštu) or email (el
paštu) and use gmail only when I want to specify the use of my personal male rather than work/school/uni mail
I even started using my university outlook because it looks better than Gmail
This is one of the first times I see a post by another Lithuanian I feel so inexplicably happy
Yep, I started using it less when my uni changed and it used outlook instead of Gmail, but nonetheless I catch myself saying / "atsiųsiu tau gmailą" / . Especially to friends
I salute you for the fact that you had 666 at the end there
Poland
You know, the Commonwealth and all that came with it
Russia
Our enemy from ancient times
Not much to be said
Sweden
The wars with Poland-Lithuania in 1800s left their mark here
Also Vikings
I suppose Belarus
Since around 1200 until 1800 Belarus was mostly under Lithuanian rule, so much of GDL/Commonwealth's history is also a part of Belarusian history, too
Not really sure about this one either, but Latvia/Teutonic knights/Livonian Knights
The attempts to christianize Lithuanian lands were mostly unsuccessful by them
And the most famous Lithuanian battle (Battle of Grunwald) was against the knights
that battle (basically) marked the end of the attempts to christianize Lithuania by the Knights
Poland, Russia and Germany
To a lesser extent, Latvia and Estonia
Poland
Belarus
Russia
Latvia
Estonia
Poland
Russia
Germany
Belarus/Ukraine
Latvia/Estonia
I dont believe whole EU will make it to 100 years
Maybe clumps of its remnants, but definitely not whole
Saaaame
and all I could think of was this
Either Poland or Latvia
Depending on the day of the week
No joke, Latvia
We are the only countries that have any baltic languages left
The other one was prussia but they were annexed back in the 19th century
Easy
Latvia
Would lay my head down for braliukas
Hey braliukas
Ukraine is pretty well loved here
Stay strong
>but they realy hate us now
I don't think many actually do in 21st century
Some may have complexes when talking about Poland, but most have positive or neutral opinion on Poland
On Youtube videos both may argue, but I don't think many actually hate you
Tomaszewski tried to instigate hate between both, but eventually failed
And both of our countries cooperate military-wise, LitPol grid
Hell, Lithuanians living near Polish border even go shopping to Poland
So in 21st century I don't think there's a strong reason for us to dislike you
Our "brothers" position is reserved to Latvia (as we call "braliukas") because we're both the only remaining Baltic nations in the world, but culturally and religiously we are probably closer to Poland due to history
Greets from Lithuania
I kind of disagree about Poland
We don't call Poland our brother country, at least I've never ever heard it
But Latvia
Oh yes
I don't think there's a single Lithuanian who doesn't call Latvians our brothers
I, as a lithuanian, have met a few latvians
From my experience they're a little goofy compared to us sad potato sacks
I guess so
I would rearrange the colors so that it looks more reggae
I personally hate Vytis because it's hard to me to draw and it doesn't simply look good to me
But you have a point
Add some black lines and stars to the old one and instantly be recognized as the Sub-Saharan state we were meant to be ️
I don't think Vytis would work, because it's a bit to complicated, but the historical Gediminaičių stulpai flag could work
I heard something like :" If you add "as" ending to any Russian word , you will get Lithuanian language"
Thank you Iceland for being first to recognize our independence in 1991
Iceland
The awesome chaps that they are were the first ones to recognise the Baltic States as independent when we peaced out from the soviets
In Lithuania we have an event every year on June 17th (Iceland's Independence Day) which is called "Takk, Ísland" where people can get to know the Icelandic culture, language and in general their way of life a bit more
Reminds me of the [video of a football match (LIT-UKR)] where Lithuanians chanted for Ukraine and Ukrainians for Lithuania
It was neat
I and most of my family/friends live in apartment buildings, and everyone keeps theirs doors locked
I remember having automatically locking doors in the old days, but I don't think they're very common anymore and I personally don't like them at all - if you leave and forget your keys inside and close the door, you're super screwed
Happened to my parents once, once to me too
At parents i only locked for the night
At my own house i lock all the time
However, im sure here you can never lock your house and nobody will bother to check or rob you (private house at least)
Been living in an ethinically anti-national region for about 15 years in a private house, no fence and not once had my things stolen, even if my grill or bike stood in an open place for a week
So if the most anti-national folk dont bother taking my stuff, nobody else will
Džon meid hiz uei tu a tevern fruh fe dark forest, onlį tu faind aut fat hį forgot fe monei
We don't have the th sound in lithuanian, so I used what a native lithuanian without english knowlege would pronounce
I think the closest would be f. I heard Germans often substitue z instead of th
Džon maid hs vei tu a tavern fru de dark forest onli tu faind out tat hi forgot te moni
&#x200B;
Have no clue what to do with the th sound
Džon meid his vay tu a tavern trū de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat hy forgot de mony
Džon meid chis vei tu e tavern tru a dark forest, onli tu faind aut dat chi forgot de moni
Džon meid his vei tu e tevern fru de dark forest, onli tu faind aut dad hi forgot de moni
LGBT and same-sex partnership
We just (yesterday) held our parliamentary elections and the results show the new ruling coalition will include Laisvės Partija - the party that's been advocating for LGBT rights throughout all of its campaign
People thought Lithuania is not yet ready, but alas - Laisvės Partija got 11 seats
Group that with Liberalų sąjūdis' 13 seats and the election winners' TS-LDK 50 seats (both of them said to be pro LBGT), and the new ruling coalition is gonna be the most liberal we've ever had with actual changes very very possible
Side note - all 3 parties are led by women, while all 3 opposition parties are led by men, something I see to be VERY positive
I’m an lgbt Lithuanian and it makes me so happy to see a positive change
I'm not, but I have a LOT of friends who are, and they are very happy for this change as well
Wishing you the best
:DD
Nothing has changed yet
We now have a LGBT person in our parliament but it doesn't mean that  gay marriages from now on are legal in Lithuania
Maybe after 1 or 2 years that would be the case, but not now
Laisvės Partija and Liberalų Sąjūdis are both liberal and will definitely support the same sex marriages but I can't say the same about TS-LKD
It is too early to say that positive change has happened
:))) It would be funny if it weren't depressing
In all seriousness, I am so sorry for all poles for what your government's been doing, its absolutely disgusting
Thank you
Vilnius University for general studies, Kaunas technical university for engineering
That's what I was going to say haha
ISM is on par or above VU when it comes to business and economics IMO
But it is private so I don't know how comparable it is
I'm Lithuanian and I think that this country is interesting for no one
Like, really it seems so, especially when you're living in small town
> Estonia, Lithuania or Bosnia,
ITS CALLED LATVIA
From all the cities I've been to, Copenhagen seemed the closest to a utopia
Everything's clean, people are chill, prices not too bad
+Vikings were originally from denmark, not norway as many people think
Lithuania is the one with the fastest WiFi
And this is just another example of how people always confuse Lithuania and Latvia
You mock them but their mainland hills are bigger than ours
Was just joking, because people usually name all 3 :)
Founded russia
As far as I know modern russia is mostly a descend of The Kievan Rus, so modern day Ukrain
I've heard about the whole Ingria thing, but that's just a small part of Russia
Belarus is about to open a new power plant new border so we will need a backup
Thats fine, but we are still stacked as 3
Woah
That's interesting
Now that you have made it clear I can connect the dots of info collected over the years
I guess Russia was founded by the Norse, but that's where the major similiarities end as I see it
The russian mentality, the language, the folklore are so different, that I think the norse origins were tainted over the 1000 years of slavic influence and I can see why Russians wouldn't like to be called "originally norse". Doesn't change the fact that it's super cool and interesting history
I wonder what could you find out about origins of other countries if you dug deeper
Yeah, and "bad" can actually mean "good".
I guess "challenge" is another similarly untranslatable word
Less than Lithuanians squawk themselves, still more than Western European countries
Are you
Big business does have a lot of influence over German government
Yeah he “agreed” to this new government overhaul
If i had to write one, it would be:
G&G sindikatas - Muzika kuri saugo
Its native language song, written by band's leader during his school years, with lyrics so deep, moral, sincere and fitting the national narrative that it deserves to be read and sung in schools, have papers written about it
However, ill list all of the best songs i know from each genre
Classical: M. K. Čiurlionis - Miškas; Jūra
Fashion-electronic/Avantgarde: Einius & Beissoul - Kaip tu ir sakei; literally all their songs, but the taste is aquired
Be ware
Meme music: Vidas Bareikis - Pusvalanduko
Rock: Andrius Mamontovas - Geltona, žalia, raudona
Requiem - Neišeik
Rock ballad & absolute all time favorite: Hiperbole - Pamiršk mane
Hip hop/rap: G&G sindikatas - Muzika kuri saugo; Broliai šaunuoliai, Lilas & Inomine - Karina; Tu privalai skambėt; Viskas
Electronic: Sel - Užmerkiu akis, sel600, Laiškas iš Paryžiaus, Nieko verta, Bek etc
Literally all his songs after 2000s. Jazzu, Mario, Vidis - I'll be gone
Naktinės personos - Pasaulis toks yra
R&B - Donatas Montvydas - most of his songs
Pop - Monika Linkytė - Po dangum
[neturėjom dainos] - Solo Ansamblis
The song is literally called "we didn't have a song" and the band is called "Solo Group". It's so good that the first tike I heard it I listened to it five times in a row
The lyrics are beautiful and don't feel like they're fake (like in a lot of modern music), but actually very real and comming from the songwriters heart
This band is so underrated and I don't get how are they not popular around europe yet
My city is large by my standards, but not by your standards (160k inhabitants)
Living in suburbs of Vilnius
Every part of the city can be reached within 30min drive
Have 4 roads to enter the city from various sides, so traffic is quite easy to avoid
2 of those roads are arteries of the city, which allow fastest commutes imo
To reach Latvia i only need to make two turns left
I live 6km from city line, but its 11km to city centre, 12km to my job, 7/18/20km to malls and hardware stores
Im literally living in the best place of Vilnius, which is also considerably cheaper than northern suburbs, which have 0 asphalt roads, no shops and always have traffic jams
And the only difference i have from people who live in the city itself is that i always have a place to park my car, i drive car instead of public transport
As a person that lives in poland I'd say beautiful is a long stretch
There are some pretty landscapes, but the flatlands with an entire 0 hills are really unimpressive and cover most of the country
The city skylines are ruined by the shitload of square buildings, but there probably isn't a post-soviet country that doesn't have those
There are potholes everywhere and a lot of roads are really low quality
Sure, the coutry did progress over the past two decades, but it's still a long way to go, to call the country advanced, compared to other EU countries
Smetona belongs in borscht soup
Smetana is sour cream
I fail to see the problem
I don't think I've seen it too
But sour cream
Good
Pizza
Good
Sour cream and pizza
Why not
Ethnicly homogenous
Holding on to cultural and historical heritage
If you have 2-8M ethnic majority, and add immigrants - you go from Norway to Sweden, from Switzerland to Germany etc
Not saying immigrants make it worse
Its the general culture that shitfs too much from default
Well, being bilingual basically means nothing abroad, if only 3 million people speak your native tongue
You have to learn at least a couple of foreign languages
Šikšnosparsnis (bat) or the spelling I myself prefer šiknosparnis (ass wings)
Not really stupid but confusing Lithuanian versions of some animals I've remembered so far:
• žiurkėnas ( a "rat" + [nas] ) - hamster
• meškėnas ( a "bear"+ [enas]) - racoon
• jūrų kiaulytė ( a sea piggy) - guinea pig
• jūrvarnis ( a sea crow) - cormorant
• žuvėdra ( a fish eater) - seagull
• voverė or voveraitė ( sounds the same as a "girolle" funghus) - squirell
• šoklys ( jumper ) - dipodid or jerboa (  jumping rodent)
• dygliakiaulė ( a spiky pig) - porcupine
• vėplys ( "vėpti" in Lithuanian means "to hang") - walrus
• šikšnosparnis ( leather feathers or belt feathers) - bat
• briedis ( in Russian a word "bred" means "nonsense") - moose
• kiškis ( in Russian it sounds the same as a word "guts") - bunny
I guess I could point out three
Two were 9 years ago and those were Michael Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego, we called it just Nosa
The other was Lauris Reiniks' Aš bėgu
And more recently Vidas Bareikis' Ežero dugne
For some reason the first one that came to mind is "Tri Poloski", mostly because it was extremely overplayed (especially in my middle school)
Lithuania national stadium
It's been under construction as long as I remember
I checked in Wikipedia and it says that construction started in 1987
Every couple of years there will be announcment that constructions will end at year X but they never end it
this is what happens when a land of basketball tries to play football
nobody is really building it
Its just that different public figures want a proper football stadium, but can't agree how it should be built
The progress for the last ~30 years was basically 0
There is not a lot of what could be demolished at first place
[ This how it looks
Not anymore
There was certainly some of that going on after our first confirmed case but it seems to have died down
Yup, 1 case confirmed, can't find pasta in stores
In Lithuania that was the case a week ago
Now it died down
When did this start
I was in Warsaw on Wednesday and the shops seemed fine
We call it "Paukščių takas", which means the same, although it's plural, so it would translate more to "Path of the birds".
Skirmantas, probably because it's a Lithuanian slang for an upper part of the butt crack
Idk to be honest, but if I have to chose I'd say the revolut card
You can change currencies online freely, and manipulate with your money (up to 1000£ per month) in any way you like with no fees
After spending the 1000£ a small fee is applied
So I guess that
Also, we didn't invent, but make really good lasers and their parts
Probably CRISPR, admittedly not uniquely Lithuanian since it was also developed simultaneously by Americans and Israelis, but still probably the best scientific contribution from this country
Atom bomb is a very far fetch
If there is a single man(there isn’t, it was a team effort) that is deserving the name of the inventor of the atomic, it was probably Robert Oppenheimer
My mistake
They also have I believe the second highest hser base in the eu in lithiuania + favorable laws, so I thought that they started here
Vut the laser part is true tho
Fall of constantinople is also listed as one of the end points of the middle ages here
Both 'baltaraiščiai' and 'stribai' are more historical terms, although 'stribai' very rarely may be used as some
It's common to hear someone, that watches over and controlls another person a KGB-ist
It's not really a super insulting term, but it's definitely rude
Yes
I dont know about its popularity in Lithuania,  but I have seen it and loved it
I first watched s1 and s2 and felt like a part of me died when I had to wait a year for s3
But after a year, coming back to the show, I- like many people here - felt lost and thought it was a bit of a stretch
It DID explain things, but also made everything unnecessarily complicated
I would like to thank Poland, for having Kaufland
Also Latvia, for being bros
The Russians, for not attacking us during ZAPAD
Hopefully we can thank the Belarussians for not building a shitty nuclear power plant that makes half of Lithuania uninhabitable in the case of a nuclear explosion
By candy you clearly meant those three sex shops right across the border right
High quality wines happen to be cheaper in Sweden, than in many places
That is because the government manages purchasing well and gets big discounts for big orders on high quality alcohol
I can't give you an example off the top of my head, but I know a few rare wine merchants that recommended going to Systembolaget for the more expensive alcohol
Well where else
You mean standard and easily understood
Like I can buy a kitchen door and fittings in US and bring that to my house in Lithuania and fit it without worrying
Aight you're joking
No way would I go 500 km just to shop
Polish roads are nice, but there are not enough high speed motorways
Going to Poland is a pain
Still
I think the duke of Burgundy did
look how that turned out for him
You started that exceptionally late
Have seen it mentioned here but kvass, such a good and delicious drink
Especially home made
Not very popular amongst children and younger folks but drinks like Baikal and Tarchunas (don't know how it is in English), they are both left from the Soviet Union
Such a good drink tho
English
Translation is shit most of the time and normal sounding things in English sound like some wizard spell in Lithuanian
In English
I'm just used to everything in my computer being in English since anything else wasn't an option while I was growing up
And now when apps and games decide that they want to localize it to Lithuanian I end up being very confused
I disagree
There’s no longer huge divide
People from urban areas are increasingly moving out into the country and commuting
So everybody’s mixing now
As for them being backwards - it depends on how you’re judging
There’s many instances where rural people overshoot city people
Also, the Lithuanian language and culture survived thanks to the rural population
Polish farmers/villagers
Haven’t heard such a thing
Especially since historically Poles were the bureaucrats or “masters” and way too “aristocratic” to live a lowly dirt plower life
Gotcha
I hope the overall sentiment changes soon since I personally think that country living is charming and I wouldn’t change it for any city :)
Honestly, milk is the best thing ever
Although I probably am lacktose intolerant(i get some bloating after i drink milk) I don't give a fuck and still drink like 2-3 liters a week
Usually a glass for breakfast and a glass before sleep
We used to have a couple milk bars in town, they were awesome
Milk and pastries
I went to one of them on my first date eons ago and had this great milk and orange juice drink
I wish they were still there :<
EDIT: also there's this story that I keep telling everyone about how my friends decided to have a White Russian party but everyone got sick of mixing the damn things so me and my Polish friend just drank a liter of vodka with milk
7/10 would recommend
Šiknos skylėje engl
Inside the hole of a butt
Meant to describe a place in the middle of nowhere, but also that is hard to find (like a forest)
Okk soo this is not Lithuanian
but Polish
BUT im pretty sure its only used by poles living IN Vilnius
Sometimes we say "zadupieniszki". Basically translates to behind an ass(?)
I'm third year medical student, now every student of university (including interns) got 2 weeks of holidays
I think this kinda applies
Poland gets all the credit for beating Teutonic Knights, but without Lithuania and other helping countries they wouldn’t have done that
Slave Isaura confirms
It’s not the polish people I’m talking about
I’m sure they know
It’s that other countries credit only Poland’s part in the battle
In Lithuanian it's "pasiruošes ar ne, aš ateinu” or "einu ieškoti".
Showel in Lithuanian is "kastuvas", but older people use the word "lopeta". I think that came from soviets
> pizza and pasta at the same time
wait what
What do you mean at the same time
Like pasta on pizza
"Pampers" pretty much became a word for "Diaper" (I don't think I've ever seen a different brand of diapers)
Junkers
a gas heater
*ironic*
I believe it's more correct to call it a felt-tip pen or a marker, Sharpies (and *flomasters*) are meant for writing or drawing rather than highlighting printed text
We have "aitvaras", which means kite, but it derives from a lithuanian mythological being that goes by the same name
It's not a dragon though
[Here's ] the wikipedia article about it
Lithuanian:
Kite: 'Aitvaras'.
Dragon: Darkonas for a general dragon, Aitvaras for the local variety (which has been portrayed in a variety of forms but some are close to a dragon)
It makes sense
Dragon is a flying snake lizard with wings
Tourists screaming and snapping their fingers at waiters in restaurants
If those waiters hadn't spit in their food before, they definitely did after
I hate ignorant amercans
Same in Lithuanian, "provincija", I assume we got it from French
That said it's not strictly outside the capital, it's mostly used as outside the main cities
Like people wouldn't call Kaunas provincija
'Provincija' is Lithuanian word for 'province'.
based on how francophile Russia was back in the day, I assume they got it from the french too
Never had this problem
With around 3M global speakers Lithuanians can pretty much say whatever they want almost anywhere they want outside of Lithuania
Almost no chance anyone will understand
If you want to be safe safe just switch žemaičių dialect
Only like 100k people in the world speak it
It truly is a secret language
I live within a 45min drive away from the Latvian border, and Riga is about a 90 minute drive away
I'd say we go there at least once per month (when no CoVid, obviously, but even then, the LIT-LAT border is open at the moment and we did go to Latvia in July once)
We've had a few road-trips to Germany, Scotland, Switzerland, etc
Only needed to show ID to get on the ferry on the way to the UK
And don't forget - flying has no border control
You only need to have your ID so airline staff can make sure you're travelling with your ticket - that's it
And once you land, you just walk out, no customs or border checks at all
I'm not sure about other people, but going to a different country casually is a pretty common thing among the people I know
Like, I'm driving to Ventspils (Latvia) while typing this (I'm in the back seat)
It depends on the country
For example, Lithuanians don't need to carry the Personal Identity Card or the passport except for the borderland, but crossing any border requires having such document
Officially, yeah it does, but there are no stops at the border, so unofficially you don't.
But practically people get fined (and as I said, you must have the ID in the borderland/pasienio ruožas areas where border guards occasionally check the documents)
DEFINITELY Russian
Pretty much everyone above the age of 30 speaks it, and about 30-40% of younger people speak it, however the number is dropping because now we're just starting to use English instead
Isn't scandinavia flooded with poles
Like 5% of icelands population are poles
Maybe it's a goverment plan to slowly, but surely take over the world and turn it into poland, just like in the globe
Is it though
I doubt OP is talking about native languages and there are about 2 million L2 irish speakers, so Irish would be by far the second most spoken language
Labas rytas :)
They teach stuff like that in IT in poland(where I live), so I from what I see it's not bad
Also, they teach python baasics in high school, so that's a plus, although the polish education system is not the best, in fact really bad, so that kinda cancels out the positives
> Tbh as someone who's 18 I don't really understand how someone similar age to me could be so incompetent with computers as people on this thread are describing
Even though we think that everything basic on a PC is intuitive it actually is not for first time users so unless they HAD to learn it either in school of out of need to do something, most people don't know a lot about computers
I would say I am above average PC user from a broad population, but give me a mac and I will strugle with some basic tasks (I think I only used mac once in my life)
So although it might look surprising that some of your peers don't have certain skills, its perfectly normal as those skills are acquired by doing and are not natural to people (like learning how to chew food for example)
TL:DR not everyone uses computers to the same extend as you so they know less
Depends, given that kids first get to use mobile UI, it might be easier for them to understand things
It does look intuative to a degree, one good example is gaming
While a lot of people who play games (not even hard gamers) quickly understand game controls, there was a video a while back where a guy filmed his girlfriend playing games for the first time and she even had diffuctly understanding movement, even though WSDA seems like the obvious thing (or arrow keys)
Same is with MS office programs, its intuative untill its not
Sure kids might have done power point in school, but if they don't practice those skills a lot and are not computer savy, then skills will degrade over time
Or they will just learn how to make a presentation in just one way, because it worked in the past and there wasnt a need to learn more
On one hand I am computer savy, but my other skills are lacking, skills that other people would regard as basic information
Like what do the buttons do on a car dashboard, thats what I asked my parrents after +3 years of having a licence to drive because I never owned a car and rarely drive
Despite the absurdly strict weed laws, it is fairly popular and I consider it a big part of youth's culture - I often see it's influence in cultural life, for example, local music
I think last year a teenager got a few years in prison because the police found 0
06 grams of cannabis in his smoking tray
I've never heard or seen anyone use it, so either nobody uses it or they are doing a damn good job in hiding it
Happy cake day, fellow Lithuanian
That's not really true - this guy was "only" sentenced to take care of eldery or disabled people for 6 months
Weed laws in Lithuania are strict and people legally can end up in jail for smoking a joint, but this happens very rarely, because defendants in almost every case are sentenced with exceptions, which court uses in order to not destroy lives of young people
I believe, sanity is sometimes stronger than our retarded politicians
In Lithuania, each name has one spelling and one spelling only
And the name has to adhere to Lithuanian grammar rules (so X AE AII wouldn't be allowed under any circumstances)
For example - the Lithuanian name Jokūbas can be only be spelled Jokūbas; if you try and make it Jokubas for example, it wouldn't be legal
Yeah
Either give a recording or I still have no clue
Is it like ŠČY in Lithuanian pronunciation
THE ADDITION OF MORE LETTERS DOES NOT HELP WITH READABILITY
y'all slavs need to finally adopt this wonderful gang "aeuio". You can even add "ąęėįųū". And the best part, putting multiple of them in a row does not reduce readability
I prefer the British version of most of the words that have a British/American variant but "colour".
your wrong in youre assumption
There are similar effects in English, where East Asian lack of grammar is leaking into mainstream English: "Long time no see", "No can do".
Also, here's a personal story
I'm learing German, and I was was in Poland on a business trip with a German colleage
There are interesting rock formations in the Chełmy landscape park, basalt rocks that are just sticking out there in rolling hills, pretty far from any mountains
They are volcanic in origin, cores of volcanos that have completely eroded, leaving just that house-sized rock sticking out on a hill
I visited one, and told that colleage, "Ich bin heute auf Vulkan gewesen".  He corrected me: "auf einem Vulkan".  Then I realised that in English I would not make that mistake, "I've been on **a** volcano", obviously
But here, a new language, and the absence of articles in my native tongue is shining through again
I dont think anywhere in the world is better for me than my own country
Decent, growing economy, really visible improvements year by year, improving government and bureaucratic mechanisms, no mountains, no dangerous rivers, very little stormy sea, only one type of venomous snake, a lot of nature and lakes, 4 seasons, not hot, not cold
would say this isnt much different from heaven
For me at least
I left Lithuania when I was 18, to study in UK
Spent 5years there, but ultimately that island was not for me
I considered going back home or somewhere else, ended up getting another degree in Germany, where I immediately got a good job, and now after almost 5years of living here, I have a good career prospects, fiance and a first baby on the way, so I don't see myself moving back home anytime soon
I miss it of course, but visiting often (pre-covid) having close relationship with family, friends and keeping up with Lithuanian news/media really help to still feel connected
Born or grown up
Nobody would give a shit if you were born in a hospital in Vilnius or somewhere in deep Alaskan permafrost (ok second one sounds a bit cool), as long as you grew up in here, who cares
You wont recognise a baby born in here and in Spain
Now growing up would matter a lot and would depend on a country
UK or Norway where a lot of migrants live - probably fine
Russia
Big no no
But both cases assume people are ethnic Lithuanians
I don't think anybody would care
Probably Poland, because Latvia as a country didn’t exist back then, and it probably started like in 1410 or maybe even before that
Latvia
:D our bros
>Lithua
with a break in 20th century, but overall, Poland is the oldest friend
Light, self-ironic, goofy, sometimes so ridiculous it doesnt make sense
but is therefore 100 times more funny
We usually make fun of cringiest moments of everyday life
In private we joke about others, comedians joke about themselves or stereotypes of people
99% of it is making fun of women, gay people and people who aren't Lithuanian
Other 1% is actually good humor
Remember last week's lithuanian anti-gay politician who was caught with shirtless guy in his apartment
Well, last year he got a woman pregnant (not his wife), a fish seller from lithuanian sea resort town
During his interview, he broke down crying, saying "oh god why am i like this, god please help me".

Same with some musicals Lithuania too:

There is a joke from the soviet times, specifically about Chechoslovakia and USSR
Chechoslovakian parliament wrote a notice to the USSR parliament, that they are planning to open a Ministry of Maritime affairs
The Ussr's parliamant wrote them back:
\- Why do you need a Ministry of Maritime affairs
You have no access to the sea
The Chechoslovakian parliamant answered:
\- Why then do you need a Ministry of Culture
Had 18 now 20, due "alcoholism"... That alcoholism was brought by USSR and we still fight it
But we bypass it by going to Latvia or Poland
Our government is currently:
* **LVŽS** (49 seats): Rural interests; populist; green-conservatives; centre-right
* **LSDDP** (11 seats): Social democracy; pro-EU; centre-left
* **EAPL-CFA** (8 seats): Polish minority party; pro-Catholic; conservative; right-wing
The main opposition is currently:
* **TS-LKD** (36 seats): Liberal conservative; pro-EU; centre-right
* **LRLS** (10 seats): Liberal; pro-EU; centre
* **LSDP** (9 seats): Social democracy; pro-EU; centre-left/left-wing
The LSDDP and the LSDP were the same party until a couple of years ago, when some LSDP members split to form the LSDDP
I think they split when the LSDDP wanted to remain the government but the LSDP did not, but I'm not sure
I also don't really know how different they are, but I think the LSDP may be a little more left-wing than the LSDDP, which is more centre-left
The LSDP is still the larger party (17,000 members compared to 3,000 members for the LSDDP), but the party split hurt the LSDP's membership in parliament I believe; they will probably pick up more seats in the upcoming election though
Then there are some small opposition parties in parliament (8 seats or less) that range from **PTT** (right-wing nationalist), **DP** (social liberal; populist), and **LŽP** (green; pro-EU), but they do not matter as much
I hope this was good, I don't live in Lithuania anymore so my information may not be totally up to date and knowledgable
Well not really
I think closest would be "ane
" Which literally means "or no
Some say "supratau" which means "understood" I guess
Stangely identical to Lithuanian "na jo" or "nu jo"
Given name + Family name
Middle names are very rare
am I supposed to step back to my family history or just some creative writing
I had a rare autoimmune disease a few years back so I couldn't walk (I'm fine now), so I believe I'd be dead then
well In that case I'd be a musician wandering the country or Polish szlachta, disgraced and disowned for marrying a 10 years younger non-noble musician, on the plus side I still get to ship in hair dye from Denmark so that the age difference wouldn't be as obvious
Anyone who oposes communism, fasism, corruption, gopnik mentality, greed and psychopaty is my dearest friend
How does Turkish government react to the Chinese genocide/persecution of Turkic people
Our now former president made an official visit and that was in Finland so I guess the official stance of Lithuanian goverment is Lapland in Finland
[Proof]
This is basically where Santa lives according to 75% of the world
Is it
Your kids basically suffer from a domestic non goverment surveillance group that tracks children behavior with out their consent
Their motives are unclear, but all we know is that your goverment is unwilling to intervene
Everyone just seems to think (mostly Americans) that Lithuania is not a country and instead it's a part of Russia and our native language is Russian
That everything about Lithuania is relative to Russia
Lithuania here
Our former speaker of the Seimas (Lithuanian version of speaker of the house) Loreta Graužinienė once pronounced our country Lieva instead of Lietuva, and Lieva just translates to shitty or loser, it is a feminine adjective
Another embarrassing moment is when our former prime minister spoke english
Basically, instead of saying "I am certain" he said " I em satan" and instead of saying "I am very pleased" he said "I am vaflyst" and instead of saying "Shoulder to shoulder" he said "Shaude tu shaude". So yeah, our politicians can be a bigger laughing stock than Trump
But I don't want all that CO2 locally, just send it to Amazon, there is a big forest there, it will absorb it
Or where ever Microsoft holds its Azure servers
Then thats perfect
All we need to do is stop dropping co2 in the air and pump it into ocean
You need air for greenhouse effect and there is no air in the sea
Any word that has cases
Brain physics break when trying to think how to explain why one word has different endings, is used in different situations but has similar meaning
"Skanaus", it means enjoy your meal
Saying entire sentence just doesn't have that charm, feeling compared to two syllable (I hope it's the right word for it, "ska-naus") word
Para
Means 24hours or a day (not night or day specificly)
In Lithuania there is a choice between religious studies (focused on Catholisism) and Ethics
It highly depends on the teacher but both subjects are notorious for not being very serious
Edit: information regarding other religions would be incorporated into other subjects
Yes, and it's mandatory, you can't choose
They teach about Christianity and the pope
I'm an atheist, but the teacher is pretty chill, so I kinda like it
Yes, just in most (if not all, I just can't confirm that) schools the student is allowed to choose whether they'd like to study religious studies or ethics
My school doesn’t have it
But I’ve seen another comment saying they did
I do have a lesson called ancient culture and we’ve covered a little religion in that though
> Yes, and it's mandatory, you can't choose
Since when
Is it
I don’t have it
Well, since atleast I've been going to school
Articles [46
3] and [47
4] So I don't know what you're talking about
Especially Vladimir V. Putin the Great
Troškūnai, because it has a funny name, a cool coat of arms and a population under 400
800
Isn't that the whole population of Estonia-
Is the western and northern side not very fond of Latgalians
Uhh
I don't think it is to be honest lol
We're too small and irrelevant
Poland is china of europe
Quality is superior though
I have never come across that comparison, but I see where it's coming from
I have come across "poland is the mexico of europe" tho
Baltic States closely work together with the Nordic countries, so it's not surprising
We can only expect that cooperation to grow further
Hell, if not for the Nordic countries, I'm not sure how far the Baltic States would've gone
As for international companies, that's just a consequence of our economy growing and the world realizing we exist
I just don't see how we, a country of barely 2
8 million, can be relevant haha
But I don't mind that
It's nice and calm this way
Downside is that quality of healthcare is not even between regions
Old folk usually live deep inside provinces, and healthcare there isnt what it should be
Add ex-soviet doctors on top and you get a paid free healthcare
Luckily, being persistent with questions or reading up about what is going on and where you should be sent to next can make you immune from bribe-doctors
For Lithuania: general quality, waiting times and what we call "treating you as a person". When you go to private clinics, the wait times are small, the doctors are nice, you can easily get an MRI, you can go straight to a specialist without a need for referral from GP (super annoying and time consuming), you can actually get treatment for cosmestic stuff
For example my brother had a huge (like HUGE) benign mole on his cheek
It looked horrible and was really affecting his self confidence, but it's impossible to get it removed in public system, since it's not life threatening, benign and doesn't obstruct vision or something
He had to get it removed privately
Most good jobs here offer private health insurance

Honestly, that age was for the most part a shit-show
Get up at like 7, go to school at 7:50 (I live really close by, but I know some people who have to wake up at around 5:30)
School starts at 8, one school hour is 45 minutes, but our breaks are longer
The first two breaks are 10 minutes each, third and fourth are twenty and thirty minutes each
Usually we end around 1-2pm, but it can sometimes end later, because of other stuff we have to attend, for example events or additional lessons
Oh, and this year I got really lucky on Wednesdays, because we don't have the first lesson that day
So I get to sleep until 8
My case in Lithuanian gymnasium (year 9 to 12) few years ago
Starts at 08:30 (one year it was from 9 for some reason)
45 class, 10 min breaks between classes, with two mid-day breaks of 25-30 mins to eat
In last year my class had a window in the schedule, those are not common, but you end up with a free class so do whatever, some went home to eat, others ate at school, sometimes you would spend that time preparing for tests or doing homework
Year 1 to 8 looked similar, it just started at 08:00
I went to high school in the US
I'd wake up at 5:30AM, then leave my house at 6:30 to get to school by 7
School started at 7:15
Classes lasted for 40 minutes each and we had nine classes a day, with about five minutes in between classes to get to the next classroom
Overall, school lasted about 7 hours from 7:15 to 2:15PM
One of those nine classes was typically a lunch period but we weren't allowed to leave the school campus and just had to stay in the cafeteria
I didn't have a lunch until my final year of school
Some people ended up having "lunch" as their first class at 7:15, which was a bit nonsensical to me, but those people ended up just not coming in to school until the second class started around 7:50
People who had lunch as their second class (at 7:50) were the ones who really got screwed over because they couldn't just leave
All four years I took English literature, history, math, French, Italian (easy A for me), and gym; all of those were 40 minutes everyday apart from gym, which was 40 minutes every other day
I took science for the first three years, which alternated between 40 minutes one day and 80 minutes the next day, but didn't take it in my final year
I also took classes like psychology, sociology, art, graphic design, art history, politics, children's literature, countercultural studies, photography, stocks/investing, and criminal law, but those all lasted for either only a year or half a year because they were just electives not main subjects
Invaded, pillaged and destroyed Moscow several times
Pillaged so hard Duke Algirdas had a hard time carrying all the bribe gold back to Vilnius
Fathered kings and rulers of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia
Only had one king, who was assassinated shortly after receiving the crown
Mongol hordes feared OUR invasion
Imported muslims and other faith/culture people to europe
In the middle ages
*woooh*
Were once the biggest country in europe
With Poland, formed a unique unit called "Both Nation Republic"
Destroyed europe's last crusaders while avoiding the cross like vampires
After defeating teutons, we accepted the cross
Probably Joninės. I think it's called St
Jonas' festival in english
It's a pagan holiday, celebrated on the night of midsummer solstice
There's plenty of traditions, but some of them include burning giant bonfires, rolling burning wooden wheels from a hill into a lake or a river, unmarried woman making a "vainikas"(something similiar to a crown, except it's made from flowers and various plants), and floating them away on a lake, and perhaps the most notably, searching for a legendary blooming fern plant which is said to give you supernatural powers
It's always a big celebration, with music, partying and the general festival stuff
There are no “nice” or “happy” days in Lithuania
Ok besides maybe Easter or Christmas
March 11th (when we were the first socialist republic to declared independence from the USSR) lots of smiles and drinks and food on this day
Google translated it as st
Johns Wort, so I thought that's what it's called in english
I'll correct it
24th December in Lithuania
The interesting thing is that Christmas (Kalėdos) in lithuania is by some still called "Saulėgrįža", which can be translated as "The return of the sun".
Happy Saulėgrįža everyone
Christmas eve 24th, Christmas 25th thats when we exchange gifts
Lithuania :)
24th is the more important Christmas day, but 25th is also considered as Christmas
For some reason 26th as well, but no one really cares about it
su kuciom :D
>24th December in Lithuania
The interesting thing is that Christmas (Kalėdos) in lithuania is by some still called "Saulėgrįža", which can be translated as "The return of the sun".
No, it's not
I've never heard anyone use that word for Christmas
"Saulgėrįža" means "solstice". The winter solstice ("žiemos saulėgrįža") occurs a few days before Christmas and the word "saulėgrįža" refers to that
Also, it means something like "turning of the sun" because the summer solstice is also called "vasaros saulėgrįža". By the way, the Lithuanian word for Christmas is "Kalėdos".
Well I have
I know several people that call christmas Saulėgrįža, or Saulėgrįžos šventė. It's probably uncommon, but calling christmas this way still manifests itself in some communities
Eastern europe doesn't get much tourism compared to the western countries
It's a shame, becouse there's a lot to see and the prices are generally lower
People don't realise how rich these cultures are and can't see past old towns
I hope CDPR release another Witcher game soon, so that people realise what interesting stuff from east european cultures they're missing out on
True
It's a shame that most of the time if you want something, you have to sacrifice something else for
Yes
Mostly because of prevalence of using state names in movies
But don't expect many people to be able to name all of the states
Foreign geography is as alien for most Europeans, as for Americans
I heard that Lithuanian is hard to learn for foreigners, but I think that Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are the hardest European languages for Europeans to learn, because they are from a different language group
I think Finnish and Estonian are Finno and Hungarian is Ugric part of the Finno-Ugric language family
(sorry if misspelled)
Aww, thanks :)
Also, Finno and Ugric are different branches of Finno-Ugric language group
(There is a third one, but I forgot the name of it)

The Baltic states with restored independence in 1990 also legally are the same countries that were founded/restored in 1918
How good is wikipedia in your native language
How often do you use it versus the english language one
I personally never use the Lithuanian wikipedia
I find it severely lacking in most topics that i’m interested in, so I really only use it for articles relating to Lithuania itself (and even then, a lot of the times the very same article in the english language is more complete)
What about you
I use Lithuanian wiki fairly often
It lacks more specific information, but currently i don't need such information, so i am quite satisfied with lithuanian version
Sometimes i check how one or another thing is called in lithuanian
Also Lithuanian here
Topics that I'm interested in (astronomy and physics) are actually surprisingly good in Lithuanian Wikipedia, so I usually read Lithuanian wiki and if I need more details, then the English one
Of course, this doesn't work if the topic is a specific cultural, geographical or historical thing, then English wiki is way better
same here, because usually Lithuanian wikipedia has more info about local stuff than English wikipedia
Where i live, drinking tap water is not good anymore without either 1
Calling a plumber to clean the pipes or 2
Buying bottled water
Normal
We have plenty of natural underground water
Private old homes have bucket wells, new homes have pumps wells
Basically free water 4ever
Taste slightly differs as in the saying "home is where water doesnt taste weird", but its mostly due to pipes i guess
Maybe not talked enough as an issue, but I noticed that majority of new apparent buildings in Vilnius are built for rent rather than for long term family ownership
Whole apartment complexes are made of 1-2 room flats with just a minimal amount of 3-4 room flats
This is done because a lot of Lithuanians like to invest primarily to real estate, so a lot of realtors are now building projects just for them
Long term this might create issues for owners of those 3-4 room apartments as they are made for families, while other flats in a complex will be populated by renters
A family that owns their share of a building is interested in its maintenance, but renters are not
And owners of rental units will fixate on costs
This might end up creating issues and different desires in apartment community, thus might end up in people not working together
A simple building outskirts maintenance might not be agreed upon for such reasons thus creating unmaintained buildings in the long term
My suburb's main Street has a speed limit, but everyone goes much faster than limit
So many accidents and deaths occured, yet still nothing
As someone who visits the Netherlands frequently, I like to rant about this too
Some Dutch people explain this by saying that they have a non-credit card culture there
I understand and agree with that attitude
But credit cards are not the problem for a lot of (European) tourists - it's that some places (namely Albert Heijn) don't even take debit cards, if they're not Maestro
And it's hard to get a Maestro in a lot of countries
I almost always pay for things with other types of debit cards in Lithuania instead of credit, but I usually have problems whenever I visit the Netherlands with the same cards
I think credit cards are more of an American thing, the Europeans that I've encountered usually use debit, but some Dutch card readers treat all Visas and MasterCards as credit
I hear it's because with Maestro the transaction from the bank is instantaneous, while with Visa/MasterCard debit, they kind of work on a 'promise'. It's not that the payer doesn't have the money and borrows from the bank like with credit - the payer's money just gets transferred at a later time, when it is convenient for the bank
I guess I can see why it could not be fully trusted, but I feel like this is one of the rare things that NL seems to be in its own little different world than almost everyone else
Rant over, the country is great nevertheless
Edit: typo
Good
This is banned in Lithuania (or just in Vilnius) and I support it
Turns out, beggars can make more money in a week than a working family in a month
Her I was opening the link expecting London to top the list with 8 million then realising something quite upsetting
Although now Berlin has the baton and they deserve it's a great city
Murcia Spain
It seems a heard name but it's not heard too
Same, first on the list I know nothing of
Duisburg Murcia are the next ones on the list I haven't heard of
First - learn the alphabet
We have letters that English doesn't have (ą, č, ę, ė, į, etc)
You need to learn the pronunciation of those letters (which isn't that hard actually) (also "C" in Lithuanian is pronounced like "Ts")
Then after that just try and learn the words you use in your daily life
Also just a small tip for learning any language - write a diary in that language
It'll be easier to memorize words that you use often and will help learn verb conjugation
If you are learning it cause its the oldest language in europe, why
Depends on the context
If it's pubs, you guys take the cake I think, if it's Vodka, I think finish take the cake, Russia aside, I exclude it as I assume it's about EU, not the continent, but Russia and Finland would have vicious rivalry going on
If it's alcoholism, I think us Lithuanians are somewhere up there as well
edit: Some non-EU responded as well, so count Russia in
> Historically we've all been highly influenced by Christianity
Well
its kinda our thing to stress that we were the last to abandon pagan faith in Europe and pagan years are often regarded as almost the golden age
Hmm I actually have met people whom want that here
Lithuanians see it as two options, first one being leave EU and face a similar fate as Ukraine, or integrate in to the EU as much as possible, to become an inseparable part of it
Frankly, I've never even imagine going to Finland due to myself living in Lithuania for the majority of my life and travelling feels like it's a mythical beast to me
I guess that's my family, upbringing, whatever you want to call it
And say I was invited to one, it wouldn't occur to me to get a bottle of alcohol, I stopped drinking alcohol like 4-5 years ago, when I started having depressive episodes when drunk and horrible hang overs the next day (at a ripe age of 19-20 :D)
But thanks for the tip
What
For real
That's very surprising to me, or I'm simply in the "wrong" circle of friends
What we are first in, it's suicide rates in Europe and according to some stats online either 1st in the world or in the top 5 at least
Edit: different sources, different ratings, generally suicide and alcohol both in top 5, that's fucking sad
Not really
With Jesus we also went to eventually unite with Poland and that is seen as over all negative thing in history as PLC was strong only early on
Grand Dutchy formed while still being pagan and expanded to its largest extend while still being mostly pagan (+Rus orthodox in conquered lands and a bit muslim)
Heh, i am both nationalist and federalist
I want my country to be the best and it can do that while in EU
Nacionalist does not have to be aggressive towards others
And thats the only way EU can work as otherwise big countries would dominate even more
Cooperation can also be in your countries interest
For example if your country has a choice to seek independent policy to gain economic output but at the same time killing eurozone
Its in our best interest to lose out on our own policy to keep euro
All EU countries are still nationalistic and seek benefit for their own
It just turns out that it benefits me when it also benefits you
But EU is a thing only because it benefits all members for different reasons
Otherwise there is no point being in EU
Not talking about any specific issue what would be the point for lets say Czechs to live in a country where they live in an union that makes decisions that only benefit others while Czhechs just foot the bill
Leaving the union would benefit them more
Thats why everyone will want to keep the EU alive as long as it benefits them and if onece in a while they need to make a decision for the benefit of EU but as a detriment for themselves its fine because over all its still benefits them
Literally as long as helping you benefits me more than not doing anything, I will help you
Thats just how the countries work
Even with hard choices like war
NATO still benefits everyone because we dont know who will need help so it benefits me to defend you now rather than face enemies alone
Open door: "Were you born in a bus
Leaving lights on: "Is this a church
Hurt yourself: "It'll go away by the time you get married
When someone needs to wait for you
"train doesn't wait for those who shit"
Forgetting to close the doors: "Are you born in the bus
Picking nose: "won't your finger break
Were you born in a bus
In Lithuania we say "Were you born in a bus
" about the door part
Or "I speak Lithuanian to you
Bus or trolleybus here
We have it too
I don't know any Lithuanian ones, but I love the Danish one, where it's legal to hit a Swede with stick if they're waking over ice :D
Tak til Jonatan for telling me this one
not really, quite a few of our letters can make the same sound depending on the word you write
Most of the time
There can be some problems with words that have double consonants or consonant assimilation
For example: pusseserė (cousin) has 2s, but it sounds like puseserė. There also can be some problems with long vowels in the middle of words like rąstas (log) or žąsis (goose), because of the very strange grammar rules that come from obsolete forms of these words
In general, Lithuanian grammar is very difficult
Lithuanian is very phonetical language, there's no words with random pronunciations
Problem can arise from similar sounding syllables: in some words "g" and "k" or "ia" and "e" can sound similar
Also "y" and "į" are pronounced the same way, but grammar rules define in what cases which one should be written
In general grammar defines the spelling of the word when phonetically it's not clear
There's some exceptions for that where you just have to learn the spelling but not many (like 10-20 words that are commonly used)
In general Lithuanian grammar is way more structured in spelling then english
After 10th grade grammar is not even part of the curriculum and grammar tasks are not part of the exam
You need to be illiterate for not to know the spelling
"Gera vieta"  - nice place
Some call toilet seat "white horse"
We don't have names like this, but we say these as synonims to "I am going to the toilet":
"I am going to do natural things"
"Nature calls me"
White stone
Don't forget "pas nykštukus" - "at the dwarfs"
Vidur prūdo plūdur bliūdas, vidur bliūdo pluta plūdo
It basically means "In the center of a pond, a bowl floats, in the bowl, bark/crust floats".
We don't have those
We don't have hard looking words as far as I know and every word is butched by foreigners
Old man (*Seni*) from what I gathered this is more of a Vilnius thing rather than whole country, but we call each other old man, as if you used dude or bro in English
Nope, it's used in the whole country
Recently "senelyzai" has become popular too for some reason
Never heard that before lol
It's real
Cant recall any tales or legends, but theres a clear difference of christian and pagan folklore tales
In pagan tales devil is a trickster, not good nor evil, tales revolve around person's duties, adventures and contact with a wild world
General setting is nature or a small settlement
Endings can be sad, tragic or good
In christian time tales, devil is pure evil, tales revolve around social injustices, morality and daily duties
General setting is settlement (vasal) or a castle
Ending is usually good for the main character
For those who played Witcher games, there are a lot pagan style stories, similar to the old lithuanian tales
Ok this is I think second or third comment talking about Dutch eating people, is everything alright down there
At one point Lithuania (Samogitia region more specifically) was the last pagan nation in Europe
To this day the legends and some of the rituals live on
Stories of witches burying cathedrals in sand to form large hills in the landscape
During renaissance, lithuania had a fairly relaxed and not strict law compared to other countries at the time
For example, (Context: During the common wealth, poland and lithuania had joined forces and were under the same rule [lithuanian monarch married a polish one], but they were culturally speaking differnt countries) Barbora Radvilaite a queen of the commonwealth, before moving to Kraków used to go horseriding and hunting, or also was very "energetic" at banquets, so things that were considerred unladylike
Also, unlike in many other countries, sex was not strictly reserved for reproduction, but pleasure too
After moving to Kraków she had to give up some behaviours, and didn't like the city itself
The Guinness book of world records recognised geographical center of Europe is located near Vilnius, in Girija village
I wouldn't mind personally
I would even be happy
These little inconvenient coins should vanish
I hate when prices are 〇〇,99, and you get 1 cent as exchange
But I have a feeling that our greedy vendors and businessmen will round 〇〇,01 to 05
And that everything will get more expensive
This seems very complicated
It sounds super complicated
Paying different prices in cash and in card
It may be easier in self-checkouts but we have many small stores without fancy checkouts, where old cashier women would be super tired to think whether you will pay by cash or card and how to round the price
By the way if you have this thing in your country for certain time, you sure don't find this complicated, but for me, who heard this for first time
I get the idea but it would be hard to implement
Although Romans never conquered Baltic region, we still have the [Grand Coliseum of Vilnius] Interestingly enough it stands next to Acropolis mall
In all seriousness no, we don't have any Roman heritage, that's Lithuanian national football stadium that has been under construction since 1987
I can add that we have a piece of [literature] about how lithuanians were direct descendants of the romans
Yet in [reality] the baltic region is the least genetically related region to romans in Europe
Being called Russian or being asked if your Russian or being spoken to in Russian (by default) is unbelievably painful and aggravating
It’s like being lumped into your childhood rapists family tree for life
Please don’t do it
(I’m sure other ex-soviet bloc countries can relate)

You sense it
Never had a package stolen
Couriers/postmen usually deliver hands-to-hand, or to a relative if the postman is a local and knows who is who
Rarely ever packages are left by the door (private houses), but even left by the door in an open view of anyone who would take interest to look, nobody has even walked in to my house territory
I live in a very culturaly mixed part of Lithuania (Near Vilnius)
To give perspective, people are less friendly and worse behaved than anywhere else in the country
Despite all that I dont lock my car, my bike, an inflatable boat lies on the grass behind unlocked gates at my in-laws, my own house doesnt have a fence, yet i keep outdoor items outdoors
Stealing is not a thing as far as ive experienced it
Im usually careful about my stuff, but at home (my, my parents and inlaws, all of which are in thr same town) people proved themselves to be above that (and many of them are modest in living standards)
They are the norm here in Lithuania too
[Here's an example]
Basically, they are in every neighbourhood next to supermarkets
They are really handy
If you are the receiver, you get an SMS or E-mail with the PIN
You go and enter the PIN and one of the doors unlocks and opens and you can take your package out
You can also use them to send your parcel too
You enter the receivers parcel terminal address and their e-mail/phone number
Pay with your card
The terminal prints out a sticker
You stick the sticker to your parcel and put the parcel in the box
Voila
It's really handy
No need to stay at home for hours and hours, waiting for your delivery
Here's two examples of how to send and receive (unfortunately, in Lithuanian
SUrprised you don't have those in Norway
We had those for the last 10 years or so
British people, why do I see people celebrating Thatcher's death
Was she bad
B-R-A-T-I-S-L-A-V-A. It's like bad version of Czech cities mutilated by communism
Pskov or Veliky Novgorod
I mean no disrespect
That's just unfortunate
I really liked Slovakian north with the mountains and valleys carved by rivers with occasional castles here and there
That was amazing
And in Bratislava: it would be a great old town
Sadly it is ridden with brutalist commie shit
The castle is impressive, yet simple and when u leave it you see this whateverish Parliament building which should be bulldozed down the hill to not obstruct the castle (from architectural perspective, not political) . Not to mention asshole Austrians who littered the view from the castle with those windmills
It's like saying "fuck you, move away from the border".
I have just crossed these cities by bus en route to Saint Petersburg and back
However, they still remain probably ugliest my seen cities, especially their bus stations
"u" and "ų". Metu kamuolį. - I am throwing a ball
Metų kamuolį. - ...a ball of the years
Since we're in the subject, I'd also like to say how important context and accent is in lithuanian
Kasa, kasa, kasa and kasa are all different words in lithuanian
Graži tavo kasa
- Your braid is beautiful
Ant stalo stovi kasa
- The cash register is on the table
Jonas kasa duobę. - Jonas is digging a hole
Turiu problemų su kasa
- I have problems with my pancreas
Lithuania: Not free, but 100% state financed for STEM+medicine fields, and about 40% students (with best grades) get free edu in any other fields
I actually want to ask if anyone knows university prices in Vilnius
I'll be 16 this year and want to know how much money I should save up
It's only for Lithuanians, I think
At least I checked Vilnius university and it's 3000-4000€ for 2 years masters degree for foreigners
I'm not sure, but courses for Lithuanians are in Lithuanian language, so foreigners automatically can't be treated equally
Either way, OP is not from EU, so this law wouldn't work for them
If you're curious, here's university's page that I've talked about:
University (Not Counting Free Universities)
Going to Sweden in June, what should I buy
I‘ve heard that drug prices are quite similar in all of Europe
Simply because it’s in the name FREE universities, If another country had them well then it wouldn’t be considered cheaper
Unless you mean textbooks which ain’t mega expensive here either
Ah we have Tutti Frutti
I'll try the others, thanks
I'm 15
Oh lol you're right, I was mistaken
Love liquorice
I hate it
Loud noises, rain, wind
Especially the unexpected lightning
I do like some light rain in the summer tho
I'm often outside, so it can be nice to refresh for a couple of hours
And the next couple of days are a bit cooler, so that's good
But no thunderstorms
Just loud booms outside
Nothing special
Until lightning hits close to you
Then its stressful and may result in undesired pooping your pants
All jokes aside its really loud
Once we had one hit something like 30 meters from us and its like mini explosion happening close by

šikšnosparnis (tanned leather wing) - bat

Lithuanian:
Greitoji pagalba (ambulance) - the quick help

Paleistuvė (slut/promiscuous woman) - the relaser, as in 'to let go'
Labas, mano vardas yra Jonas, malonu su tavimi susipažinti
Iš kur tu
Hello, my name is John, glad to you meet
From where you
>Labas, mano vardas Jonas
Malonu susipažinti
Iš kur  esi
Hi, my name \[is\] John
\[It is\] pleasurable <neuter> to get acquainted
From where  are
Using more auxiliary words, that is not that common, but still fully legit in Lithuanian:
>Labas, mano vardas yra Jonas
Man yra malonu susipažinti
Iš kur tu esi
Hi, my name is John
For me is pleasurable to get acquainted
From where you are
Labas, mano vardas Jonas
Malonu su jumis / tavimi susipažinti
Iš kur esate / esi
Hi, my name John
Nice to you (plurar or formal) / you (singular informal) get acquainted
From where you (plurar or formal) / you (singular informal) are
EDIT: forgot plurar or formal meanings in second part
Depends on the sentence but pretty underatandable
Mama ar aš tavo vaikas
Mom (you could add "or" in here but the sentence doesnt support it) am i your child
Not very
Lithuanian is a synthetic language
So word order is a lot less important than it is in analytic languages like English
For Example, "Suo valge kate" and "Kate valge suo" both mean "Dog ate cat", but if I translate each word individually I would get
"Suo valge kate" = "Dog ate cat"
"Kate valge suo" = "Cat ate dog", in order to get this meaning in Lithuanian I would write "Kate valge suni".
your sentence would be:
Labas, mano vardas Jonas, malonu susipazinti
Is kur esi
Hello, my name John, pleasureful to acquaint
From where be
Yep, we Lithuanians are having similar problems
I still can't understand how a language can function with so little verbs and their forms
The most confusing would probably be some sentence with seperable verbs, like:
>You look very bad
I am calling the doctor
Du siehst sehr schlecht aus
Ich rufe den Artzt an
You see very bad out
I call the doctor at
Hey
I always had a question
Does "jūs" have double meaning
(In Lithuanian it's either formal way to talk to a superior or means plural people)
>  In a simulated battle our platoon of 3 tanks distroyed over 120 Leopard2 tanks in multiple waves without a single loss on our side
:D Did your simulation also had you save a princes or fend off Martian attack
In the US, the President serves as both the head of state and head of government
Systems that have both a President and a Prime Minister separate the head of state (President) and head of government (PM) into two distinct roles
The German and Austrian Chancellors are the same as a PM
* **Head of state**: Often a ceremonial role, like a Monarch
They are meant to make public appearances, unify the country, bestow honors on civilians, host foreign dignitaries, and often hold a number of *de jure* but not *de facto* powers like formally appointing cabinet secretaries or ministers (it's the PM that actually chooses them), dissolving parliament (on the request of the PM), serving as commander-in-chief of the military (they don't actually have much control over it)
The President basically fills the role of ceremonial Monarchs in European constitutional monarchies
* Some European systems are semi-presidential, where the President is more than just ceremonial, and the main power there is that they can choose who the PM is rather than parliament choosing who the PM is, but their choice must be approved by parliament
If the President's political party also controls parliament, they effectively can choose whoever they want to lead the government though, pretty much giving them all the power; this is the current case in France and Russia
* **Head of government**: The main point of a head of government is that they lead the government
In the US, this is the cabinet
While the American president serves as both the head of state (being the "face" of the nation) and head of government (leading the cabinet), in many other countries the head of government is the PM (or Chancellor)
They nominate a number of individuals to lead ministries or departments and thus craft policy
In most of these countries, it's the PM that wields a considerably larger amount of power compared to the country; while the President is the "good guy" leader of the country who's all happy and smiles, the PM is the "bad guy" so to speak who has to make the difficult policy decisions and anger people with their partisanship
Most often, parliament elects the PM after a parliamentary election by the general public; when this happens, most of the time the leader of the party who is leading the majority in parliament becomes PM, but not always
Because most often the PM is a member of parliament, they are the chief legislator of the nation
Imagine if the cabinet of the US was moved from Trump's responsibility to Nancy Pelosi's responsibility, that would essentially be making her the PM and adopting this European style parliamentary government
Only government buildings have it besides the tricolour  and the red Vytis flag
I wouldn't, since the tricolour is the Lithuanian flag
is the flag of Europe, and Turkey is member of the Council of Europe
It's made in USA, but filmed in Lithuania and about Lithuania "Tarp pilkų debesų". This film tells us about Soviet deportations
Lithuanian movie - Tadas Blinda
I haven't watched it (or I have, but loong time ago)
It's the first Lithuanian movie
I don't watch mamy Lithuanian movies
From what I've heard, there really aren't that mamy great movies made here
But there is *Trys milijonai eurų* or *Three million euro*. People said it's a decent comedy
For the Lithuania, the most iconic (my opinion) is probably "Tarp pilkų debesų"
“Tarp pilkų debesų” (between the shades of grey) there’s both, Lithuanian and English versions
I think it still count, because the movie is about the country and was filmed in the country, even though the actors are not from Lithuania
Also, “Traukinio apiplėšimas kurį įvykdė Saulius ir Paulius”
Would you recommend reading up on the historical events the film is based on before watching
"Thanks" sounds like a sneeze
("Ačiū", pronounced sort of like "achoo")
* Language is rare itself
* Free sentence word order, you can make it whatever you want it to be or to emphasise some words
* One can omit pronouns in most cases
* Past iterative tense
* De facto two locative cases: inessive and illative
* Glorious history of being nearly extinct, book smuggling and its contemporary all time high dominance in Lithuania
But unfortunately our languages aren't close enough to be mutually intelligible (we can't communicate in a meaningful manner)
We share quite a few common words that sound similar or even identical but many have totally different meaning
Pronounciation between Latvian and Lithuanian is just too different as well
Welp,
I saw a lot of negative reactions to our cold beetroot soup (cold and pink)
We have a literal blood sausages stuffed in animal intestines
Tongues of animals (haven't met anyone who's not disgusted)
Livers of animals
Stomach of animals (most popular are smoked chicken stomachs)
Hearts of animals (most popular is chicken)
Some people even cook whole head of a pig
Some people don't like appearance of Zeppelins (they are delicious tho
Scrambled eggs with animal brains (this one is common in rural areas)
We eat salted salmon (yes, not smoked, salted)
Zeppelin is basically a big ball of boiled potato with a meat filling
Usually comes with milky sauce with fried pork bits
Seems like your grandma remembered good old times of conserving food
Never heard the term, so can't answer
Some families make it like gravad lax
My family usually uses just salt
Not nordic, but we have everything nordic countries have, minus surplus money and middle eastern and african people
Few foreigners live here, and most of them are doing quite well
Very sad to know that even nordic countries have snowless winters
Ive been missing them very much
Now snow in winter seems more valuable than gold
For our hearts and mental health
Lack of snow in winter makes it feel like winter is still coming
even if its May already
It's pretty common, especially with teens and children
We spell it either "Ok", "Okay" or "Okey"
between 1919-2019
About 50 years of being fucked
It's fine now
We were occupied three times and then after fifty years we gained independence by forming a human chain of around 2 million people that spanned well above 600k km across the baltic states
Yeah, Vilnius is Lithuanian city and Poles are best allies, not enemies
Klaipėda is ours as well, and we live in a pretty successful country
Russia somehow borders us from the west, and there's a weird country called Belarus in the east
However, there are no Germany right to the west – only after \~600 km
However, 123 years under Russian rule is has not been enough and we will be fucked by the Soviets for another 5 decades
That's why you can see these ugly commieblocks and we are still catching up with the Western European economies
Since 1990s there only have been few years with no wars in Europe
>>Poles best allies
That's debatable
My vote goes to Latvia
geopolitically it's still Poland
Even the Grybauskaitė period LT/PL relations were very friendly in comparison to 1920-1938
Well neither Latvia or Estonia were last pagan countries in europe
Neither of them had crusades against them
Not a literary character, but I remember on an old F1 game (probably on PS1), with Russian language on, driver's name changed from Button to Кнопка (i.e. a button that you press)
I am feeling as if I'm losing something of my own
No matter how distant it might be, that cathedral is one of the greatest and most beautiful buildings in the world, not to mention the amount of history that this building saw
My heart is with the French
Not sure if unpopular opinion, but I've rarely thought about the church in my life and I'm not thinking much about it now
It's not even destroyed
I'd be sad if the Cologne cathedral suffered, as that one has a unique history of being spared in the largest destruction of the continent
my sense of humour changes depending on what language I'm speaking
My conversations in English tend to have quite a few puns, dad jokes
My Lithuanian and German tend to have quite dark and cynical humour
Yes
My english speaking self has not been as traumatized, and is a much better person to be around
> Oh the Lithuanian sense of humour is close to the German
Interesting
I think that sense of humour is quite common in much of continental Europe
We love Vilnius
The cities are competitive, but it's not like someone actually hates Vilnius
We do as well ahah it looks so weird to me when people hate their capital
Anyone above 30-40 years old definitely knows Russian, but probably not English
In school you have to learn English, qnd you can choose Russian, German, or French
I would say that Russian is the most common language out of the three
More or less
English is presumed for the post-soviet generation(s?)
Russian for the soviet generations
Usually people also have some 2nd or 3rd foreign language skills, either German or French or Spanish or Polish
Less common are Italian, Latvian, Estonian or the Scando-tongues
Dear me, a real life southern Estonian
I though you guys only existed in statistics
Love my baltic brother and poles and their culture, simply amazing
Russia and belarus not so much interesting
Sorry not sorry
I'm lithuanian, but I live in poland, so I'll talk for both countries
Lithuania - Saulius Skvernelis - the prime minister, poland - the fucking president
I would go so far as to say, that he's the worst president so far
>	You're not allowed to make names up
If you want to give your kid a more "exotic" name or a rare name from another language, you need to proof that it's actually a real name and not a letter combination you threw together with dart after 5 beer
But
all the names were made up once
It's just so weird to me, though
Like, every single name didn't exist at some point
They were all invented
That's exactly what I mean, names are just regular everyday words that someone decided to use
Every name was once picked and used for the first time
But somehow today you're not allowed to just pick and choose a new word from some adjective or combination of other "real" words, etc
As someone with a very common first name that often cause inconvenience when there's like 4 other girls in the room with the same name, I definitely wish rarer or unique names became more acceptable
>	By the same logic you might just make up your own language
But we do that all the time as well
Somewhere, some time, someone uses a word for the first time, inventing a new word
Then their family of friends hear it, some of them decide to pick it up and start using it as well, and that's how words are born
Just like some time someone decided to use a certain word or a combination of words as a name for the first time
I mean, what counts as "out of thin air" for you
In my country a lot of names are actually plant names (especially trees or flowers) or names of some other natural phenomenons (the sun, amber,  storm, etc)
Or even place names - one of popular girls' names in my country is actually the name of a lagoon in the Baltic Sea
My point it, there was a time when someone decided to use that name as their kid's name for the very first time
Someone would be like "ok, I love this flower so I'm gonna name my daughter after it, even though I've never heard of anyone else named after that flower". Does this count as an "experiment"? By your definition, I suppose it does, but is it really a bad thing
Most people here don't object to this type of names, on the contrary, they're considered beautiful, even if they're unique
Imagine if no one was allowed to invent new names anymore and ~20% of the male population was named some local version of John, etc
People's names are a huge part of their identity, why shouldn't we try to make them more unique
Around Christmas time suddenly conversations in Russian would start popping up I guess as a way to covertly discuss gifts
Most of the kids born after 85-86 don’t speak it unless they set out to learn it in school or have Russian parents
Yes, it happened to me as well
My family used to speak Russian, so I couldn't understand them, but they have forgotten it as most of the people I guess in Lithuania who knew Russian
Yes, it happened to me as well

My family used to speak Russian, so I couldn't understand them, but they have forgotten it as most of the people I guess in Lithuania who knew Russian
ALL Post-Soviet kids who aren't from Russia itself experienced this
The new gen kids have no reason to speak Russian if they're from a Lithuanian family, so my parents just switched to Russian since everyone in USSR learned Russian
If anyone bothers to learn even the basics in Lithuanian people are happy and impressed
It’s not expected at all
It’s a very hard language
One that even many native speakers don’t understand well and how to use it correctly
It's not annoying
Barely anyone learns or even cares about our language, so anyone who decides to learn even a bit will be praised here, since we know how difficult our language is
Annoyed, no
It will make for a difficult conversation because I am not used to dealing with broken Lithuanian like I am with say, broken English
Or Lithuanian spoken with a heavy accent I'm not familiar with
That said, Learning the language, even badly, is a great way to make a positive impression
Honestly a person trying to speak Lithuanian just warms my heart , yeah it can sound a bit funny but it still matters to me that they care about learning my language that from what I've heard is hell for people to learn
The smell of Linden tree flowers, thyme, fennel and honey
All of these were, and stil are used to brew traditional tea in lithuania
They're so good, I would choose any of these over any other tea, anytime
I really recommend it if you ever get the chance
Moss and mushrooms
Moist smell of water, fungi, earth, decomposing plants
I think it should smell the same depending on what type of forest you are in ofc
Lithuanian forest is usually inland, mixed leaf, mostly hilled or flat, which is common everywhere in the world
In Lithuania population had been decreasing for close to 3 decades
Although that's a horrible thing for an economy, it's a bit easier to find a good paying job
Yes, but population has been growing in Kaunas, Vilnius and Klaipėda because old people who mainly live in villages die and young people migrate to the big cities
Because you live in Netherlands
Go to post soviet Europe and you will see abandoned villages and towns full of retired old people
Overall economy has massively grown during these 3 decades, and since 2019, population started rising again
Aging population will take a heavy toll in the future
That is what I meant
I agreed to the first statement, which stated that Lithuania's population has been decreasing for the past 3 decades
I never said it's horrible for the economy
A lot of today’s youth here is Integrated into the cannabis business as a way to get high pr get money, and it is a real problem
It’s come to the point where entire schools go into lockdown and they still don’t find anything
Some irresponsible adults bring in meth and coke to schools for an extra buck
If we were to get a controlled system that managed the drug ring in schools it would be amazing
As a kid I believed that all beaches are sandy as that was the only thing I saw in sea side Lithuania and movies
Apparently you can also have rocky beaches
I thought this for a VERY long time since I'd heard a lot of African singers singing in French and some other reasons I can't remember
I kind of assumed all of them were mixed
> Russians are all impoverished and eat potatoes to keep alive
I mean, they do eat potatoes
And they do keep them alive
So this is somewhat correct :)
I (Lithuanian) have dated some German guys and an Australian guy
The German guys were incredibly hospitable, thoughtful and friendly
They always wanted to make sure I was comfortable, they were always respectful and gentle
If we hung out at their place, they always made food and made me feel at home
The Australian guy was very laid-back, I felt comfortable with him
Wasn't used to people being so friendly and open, so uncaring about the minuscule things Lithuanians fuss over
We have them in a sense, but not the American one
To us it's people whole lived during the USSR and people who only lived in a "free Lithuania"
it's not really a thing
Maybe among sociology majors for group analysis, but otherwise it's not really a thing like in the states
So here in Lithuania, from my experiences, no one gives af about generations, except those who are into some weird stuff or conspiracies, maybe those who also watch some Russian channels on that topic, but still, no one cares
In eastern europe not so much
My mom shortly told me that there are Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z. I didn't know the American names of these generations, so I wondered: what the fuck are baby boomers
Greatest generation
Usually only in a comedic sense
Foreigners call [the hill of crosses] creepy
I can somewhat see the eeriness
Could you imagine that thing at night when no one is around
į - to somewhere
į (in, to), o (and, however, but (has a lot of meanings, depends on context)), ė (used to get attention, like *hey
* in English)
This is not really mentioning the dialectal variations, then the list would get wild
No standard
Some people wont' tell you, some won't shut up bout it
close to 50/50
That said generally among friends
I don't know if it's rude, but it would be kinda weird to talk about your wages unless everyone is talking about jobs
Europeans learned the hard way that colonies aint loyal
Lithuania s a semi-presidential country, but our current President seems to be not wanting to use his powers
The power balance exists when the President wants so (like Grybauskaitė)
If he or she doesn't assume the full power, part of it slips to the Prime Minister
Depends on each person
We had Dalia Grybauskaite, she had ways to expose and fire corrupt or pro russian officials
She had strong opposition (PM), also parliament majority's leader
There were a lot of conflicts, but there was balance
Now we have Gitanas Nauseda, former economic analyst of SEB
We call him "tall and handsome" or "president of the underground" because his ways in politics is negotiation and non-conflict
Which usually means he gets shut down or never achieves anything because the other side doesnt want to talk
What is living in a bilingual country like
Countries such as Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Belarus, etc
, that have more than one widely spoken language
Is generally everyone capable of speaking all the widely spoken official languages
Are there people who are born and raised in the same country that fully cannot communicate with each other due to the language differences
What languages are the schools or the government in
How early do they have you start learning the other language(s)
Any other details you can think of
Wow thank you so much for this extremely detailed answer
That was exactly what I was looking for
Switzerland is a very interesting and beautiful country, one of my favorite places to visit
Would you say the average person can speak both but just prefers Russian, or does Russian completely dominate to the point where Belarusian is just more of a ceremonial language
Is it the same in all parts of the country, or is there an urban/rural or older/younger divide
Why is it that other people don't want to learn French, or at least prefer Italian
Is there any tension between the Swiss-Germans and the Romandes
>I used to have a roommate who was from a very Swedish-speaking area and couldn’t really speak much Finnish
What was the language situation like in the area where you were living
Was she able to function day-to-day in society without speaking much Finnish, or did she have to just use a lot of English
Do most people in Ukraine speak Ukrainian or Russian
Would you say there are Swedish-speakers in Finland who cannot speak Finnish at all
Or would that be very rare to find
The crazy thing is this: the word for October is different in Belarussian from Russian
So while the signs say "Кастрычніцкая вул.", everyone just says "Октябрьская".  Good luck figuring out that it's the same place even if you know Russian
Haha I'm the same, Lithuanian paternal and Italian maternal
Living in NY now
Yes I can
I learned it from immigrant family members on my mother’s side of the family first
When I was a kid I went to Italian school after my regular school to help me learn more, and then after I had forgotten some by the time I was a teenager I started taking it in high school (Italian is offered in almost all high schools in New York because most people are Italian here)
Yes I can read and write as well
No problem at all
We had no official written stuff in lithuanian untill 1547 (was ruthenian aka old rus, latin or polish up to that point)
As for spoken i assume it should be quite easy to understand
Lithuanian retains some of the most consistent and ancient indo-european features, so Lithuanians can understand pretty much everything, from the moment our tribes united, which was by the end of 13th century
Earlier, each tribe had their own language, so understanting every one of them would prove very hard
There was a tribe called Lithuanians, which gave the name to modern lithuania, and their language was the most similiar to modern lithuanian, so understanding it would be easier than, say Curonians, or Yotvingians
One of the most ridiculous calques is typical for tourism texts written by Lithuanians: [cognitive path] Which is 'educational trail' in proper English
Generally, tourism texts include a shitton of such calques
Probably 90% of non-english european language speakers have the same problem
Lithuania has the opposite feature
The consomants in most of the situations, are pronounced hard (like the sucxulent chinese meal guy saying "r" in democrrracy)
So for lithuanian it would be "Vviollinn", or "Vvikkttorry".
Same here with the 3rd person, sometimes I spot myself mixing up is/are and was/were
My friend and I were going to this bar to film as extras, she was a little bit ahead of me, and entered the building first
By the time I came in, she was talking to this tan, kind of southern european/middle eastern looking girl
This combined with the fact that they were both talking in English made me think that this girl was a foreigner of some sort
I joined in the conversation and we all talked in English for about 5 minutes, before my friend decided to tell me something in Lithuanian, and then that girl was like "wait
you guys are lithuanian too
When I asked my friend later on why she was talking with her in english when I came in, she just told me that she just instantly looked like a foreigner so she didn't even attempt to speak lithuanian with her
It's extra cringy when you know this wasn't even happening abroad
CartoonNetwork is the best teacher
We start learning English in second grade and by that time I could read well and speak a little
As time went by I got better with it by watching more cartoons and using the Internet
I was always at the top of my class with English in school compared to people who didnt watch English cartoons
School from 2nd grade and, well, I started using computer early (4-5 to)
I'm going to Erasmus in Targu Mures University for a semester of medical studies
You can spot an american in europe, by their clothing
Most wear sports clothes, while europeans are usually dressed more formally (jeans, or other formal trousers, plain clothing, or with minimalistic patterns)
If they're tall and pale, they're probably germanic, baltic or from the more northern slavic nations
The shorter people with darker hair and a bit more tan skin are probably from southern europe
A final way to confirm if someone's from europe is if they don't really show emotions with their face in public
Most people just walk around with their neutral resting face
So yes, you can get an idea of where someones from by their appearance
Some American or German tourists look like [John Bolton]
Also, a family wearing matching jackets (skiing, hiking, mountaineering): Swedish/Nordic
Generally easy to distinguish people by parts of europe or large countries they come from
For example scandinavia, eastern europe, germans, dutch, french, spanish, itallians, greeks, balkans, rus (russia, ukraine, belarus)
And the guess is only 70% accurate at most
Pinpoiting where exactly they come from is very hard
Though if you look closely, there are subtle, but key different features between russians and ukrainians, lithuanians and belarusians, latvians and estonians, estonians and suomi, italians and greeks, italians and spanish, swedes and norwegians etc
Its as if each ethnicity has its own "cliche" features that gives them out
Like baggy eyes, heart shape hairline/forehead and big teeth in brits
Lithuanian: nemįšk prieš vėją - gurkšnį gausi
English: Dont piss against wind - you will get a sip
We have a similar one but it's "Until you jump over the ditch don't say hop"
Billy-goat in Lithuanian and ram in Russian
"Daryti iš musės dramblį" in Lithuanian, "делать из мухи слона" in Russian, literally the same word for word
Yes, we have the State Commission of the Lithuanian Language, and the notorious State Language Inspection that functions like language police – e. g., fines for using wrong grammar in TV shows, etc
Lithuania  has VLKK(National committee of Lithuanian language)
They are a bunch of language Nazis who are constantly banning "irregular" words which lithuanians use in their everyday language
They also suggest new "correct" words to use instead of the wrong ones
The problem is, these suggested words are usually ridiculously awkward and just makes people laugh, (there is even a big meme group on FB to make fun of this committee)
Some examples of VLKK work includes them trying to ban using English names for computer programes like Excel/Powerpoint
Lithuanian language has these incredibly hated word accentuation rules, and VLKK are huge fans of them - they even give fines for people on TV who fail to accentuate words correctly
I remember watching news when I heard the news reporter saying PradA and Dolce & GabannA, instead of the original PrAda and Dolce & GabAnna - not only they forbid to accentuate lithuanian words incorrectly, this rule also applies on foreign words, clothing brands in this case
It's just a game of absurd and official people and workers of the national TV are forced to play it
The only good thing about this is probably that every time they are trying to change or ban something, everyone has a good laugh
Yes, it's called the *State Commission of the Lithuanian Language
That is a disgusting nazi organization
But you can have and easy way to check if a word is "usable" and win random arguments thAT HAVE NO SENSE OF PROPER LANGUAGE
Its cool
It is not a language police thing, but as in a synthetic language, Lithuanian noun cases require specific suffixes
However, they are less frequently done for females, so Hillary Clinton usually remains Hillary Clinton
As for Barack Obama - in news pages he is usually called Barackas Obama (Obama is perfectly sound feminine gender word for Lithuanian language), but in official papers (e.g. Foreign Ministry texts, in nominative he is called Barack Obama
For people who have names ending in -a (Angela Merkel), -is/as (Alexis Tsipras), etc no suffixes are added and they are treated as Lithuanian words
Feminine surnames are also commonly left intact
They also work with lexic to prevent the influence of foreign languages
No, nazism is not cool,
We have XXX supermarkets, and exported them to Latvia and Estonia
The whole coast of Neringa municipality
I think almost all of that part of Lithuania is in the UNESCO world herritage list and the beaches have the blue flag (white sand, clear waters, etc)
Lets be a bit more specific, All of the [Curonian Spit] is a magnificent beach basically
There's also some other towns that are nice, [Sventoji] & [Palanga] are probably the most popular seaside resort towns
Why would you think there's problem
Somewhat yes 3-4 dialects with different accents having 4 different accents for a country this small is weird
So Lithuania is divided into 5 regions (mažoji Lietuva, Žemaitija, Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija) and 4 out of those five (Žemaitija, Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija) have their own dialects of Lithuanian language
Doing things has no connection to your ethnicity
Bruuh
No I would not
I am just going to drop this wikipedia arcticle about the famine in anyone wants to learn about it
I bet none of you have to learn lithuanian in school
In Lithuania, I had "Ethnography " classes (not sure if that translates, but that's how they were called)
Where we learned about old local traditions, celebrations, rituals, clothing, folk art symbolism, myths etc
of Lithuania and more generally Baltic tribes
It was approached as a study of your cultural heritage
I loved it
And even though I had it in both the primary school, and in the first 4 years of middle schools I know that it's not a class you get in even school in the country
I think it's a bit niche, and I was lucky to have it in both primary and middle schools I attended
Have this in Lithuania, as well as religion or ethics lessons
However, "home economics" is mostly tied to "home maintenance" or "workshop", economics is tied to IT classes (at least it was in my school)
Home maintenance lessons are woodworking, metalworking, minor repairs, outdoors work for boys, cooking, sweing, stitching for girls
Girls and boys switch for one year in grade 8 or 9
Holy shit didnt know that
Well thats lithuanian indeed
You took the exam also right
Damn thats tough
The history of the Grand Duchy is taught differently and different aspects are accentuated between us and say Belarusians
To us, LDK was an extention of our lands
To Belarussians, we are Samogitia
Dont forget about the good old battle of Grunwald
Oh and  *Adam Mickiewicz,* the man born in Belarus, spoke in polish, lived in Poland and wrote how beautiful Lithuania is (could be wrong, just remember something like this from school)
I would say we Lithuanians have a positive view of our shared history, shared heroes and achievements, and the animosity caused by the state of affairs during the Interbellum has waned, so our shared glorious past and neighbourly present is at the forefront again
> and wrote how beautiful Lithuania is (could be wrong, just remember something like this from school)
You're not wrong but to I got something to add
[In the very start of *Pan Tadeusz*] he wrote
>Litwo, Ojczyzno moja
>Lithuania, My fatherland
I'm fine with all three nations sharing him
Lithuanians say that the GDL forces did a "false retreat manoeuvre" which they had learned from a battle with Tatars at Vorksla (which almost had Vytautas killed)
The Poles, to my knowledge, say that the reatreat wasn't fake
Seriously
I would have thought that boomers are those who were on the streets during the August Putsch and the younger generations are complacent with the TV narrative
I thought only my family does that
Yes
Sweatpants and a t-shirt which is either dirty, too big or torn somewhere
Yeah
So I don't dirty the good ones up and I don't have to wash them every time
The ones I wear at home also tend to be more comfortable (sweatpants and sweaters)
Nah man, everyone I know does this
Sitting on your sofa is not the same in jeans and sweatpants or comfy shorts

Lugano was my only visited Swiss city
But it felt filthy rich as well
(from day to day life) I have seen several trucks from Kyrgyzstan, I instantly googled how far it is, and it's far enough to be surprised to see it in Europe
How people would stop you on the street and strike up a conversation
Happened A LOT
And in weird places too, like when I went into the shop to get cat food one time
You wouldn’t really see that happening in Lithuania, people usually keep it to themselves
Edit - I had lived in London
Danes follow rules a lot
Sometimes I love it, other times I feel perplexed how many people are just unable to be dynamic about situations
I guess I was just used to our cold Lithuanians
lol but also, people seemed really straightforward and would not beat around the bush if they were trying to hit on you
Further north and east
Have a lot in common regarding not wanting to deal with strangers or cracking a fake smile
When one talks to the governmental agencies via E-boks, even if you tell them that you have not learnt enough Danish to be able to communicate fluently, they will respond to you in Danish on purpose because those are the rules
Everyone in Denmark knows English very well — even the elderly
This one is still really surprising to me, knowing how international the country is
I don't live in NL at the moment, but I visit it several times a year and I have to keep a Maestro card (and keep paying for one) just for that purpose
And Dutch people always say that it's because their machines don't like credit cards, but I don't even use one for physical payments, nor do I think many other Europeans do, it's usually Visa/Mastercard debit
But apparently that doesn't work, it has to be Maestro
Beside the costs, I hear it has something to do with transfer time too - Maestro has direct money transfer, while Visa/Mastercard debit works on the bank's 'promise' and the money can take several days to get transferred
The card machines in shops treat that as acting like a credit card
I really like Liechtenstein and its history ( i even have a great book about it )
They have interesting political system and their history is deep and awesome, how they able to keep Principality, and  i mean they survived so many wars Napoleonic Wars, Austro-Prussian War, WW1 and WW2
And so after the wars they basically were able to transform their country from backwards agrarian state to Highly Developed and Rich country
And of course the hilarious story of 80 soldiers that they sent   to the  Austro-Prussian war and were back with 81 lol
Trump again tries to solve his personal domestic issues by using tools of foreign politic

Do you think that Afghanistan is going to invade and take over Kazakhstan, uzbekistan and Turkmenistan for the sole purpose of attacking russia
Germany invaded ussr for its great farmlands
Why would afghans invade russia
Well we were just talking about most likely scenarios
I dont really see how Paskistan or India could invade russia either
Like the stolovaya in russia

Špargalkė. No idea what it means originally, cause i guess its a russian word
Another, less common word used to call cheat sheet is *Paruoštukė* which is female form of prepared sheet
We use shpargalka (špargalkė) here too
Yep
My school does anyway, I’ve been to another school that doesn’t though
When I was arround like in 1-7 grade, there where no lockers
Only starting from the 8th students finally had an option to rent a locker
I remember myself really wanting a locker during the 1-7 grade period because I seen them in every cartoon/show/film about school
The concept of having your own personal storage seemed so nice
But once there was an opportunity I was so used to carry everything in my backpack I just gave up the idea
Rent only
An independent company puts them in schools and we can rent
I also live in poland
Idk If this affects the funding or anything, but I'm a part of lithuanian ethnic minority and we do get lockers in our school
We can put anything we want in there
I guess it just depends on the school itself
Same country, school did not have any lockers, just changing rooms
Mine only has very few lockers, in the stairways, and you have to pay for them
Depends in which grade I was
For some odd reason the older I got the less books we had to carry
Usually the backpack would weight arround 5-6 kg in smaller grades and 2-3 in higher ones
But I'm not sure, I never weighted my backpacks
I made this assumption by the amount of books/textbooks we had to carry and how parents would complain about the huge weight their kids have to carry every day
10^6 Milijonas
10^9 Milijardas/Bilijonas (interchangeable)
10^12 Trilijonas
10^15 Kvadrilijonas
... (the rest follow latin prefixes)
Lithuanians did almost the same :))
10⁶ - milijonas
10⁹ - milijardas
10¹² - trilijonas
Welp, in Lithuanian we have a mashup, basically the American short scale, but with the word "milijardas" for 10^9
Suicides and fast internet
Alholism fast Internet and siucide
Ayyy
Ah yes
You just figured that out
Dont forget about vodka
Thats Russian
And we were part of Russia not too long ago
Well yeah but vodka is more of a Russian alcohol
Never really
The drivers are inside glass cabins, the engine and the traffic are loud, and almost no one ever exits the bus from the door that is next to the driver (usually only through the middle and back ones)
The driver just ends up not hearing you, so no one bothers

I can't think of a reason why someone would need an ID to delete your account when they already have 2F authentication
But I think they don't have my id in the first place
Its like reddit asking for my id to prove that I really own this account but up to this point reddit never knew who owned this account
If you did register with ID then its fine to ask for it when deleting
But if registration does not require ID, account deletion should not require it too

It’s more “woulda” now
I really hope that the new dev is not a bald guy
Its meant to be readable to all English speakers
And the whole idea is that we skip the letters we don't pronounce or we use specific letters to reflect our language rules or pronunciation
Although its extremely challenging to write in this manner
In Lithuania we say "pakratyti kojas" which is to shake your legs in English
>And the other one is:"Iti rakom zvizgat" which means: "to go whistle to crabs".
Interestingly, when you want to say that something will never happen in Russian, like "when pigs fly" in English, you say "когда рак на горе свистнет" or "kogda rak na gore svistnet" which means "when the crayfish whistles on the mountain".
I'm pretty sure no one else has 2 independence days and a day for independence defenders (January 13th - day of independence defenders, March 11th - Restoration of independence day, February 16th - Independence day)

My brother has lived in tge netherlands for a few months and said that the density of roads is awful
It's difficult to find truly wild places and that no matter where you go, a road is somewhere nearby
Yeah, maybe you can traverse the country by bike, but what's the point, if you won't see any nature
I personally wouldn't sacrifice nature for roads
Sorry
I didn't know
This is because we both declared independence from the Soviets twice, right

At the moment it would probably a song called ["Paskambink Man (Jei tau liūdna)"] or "Call me (If you're sad)" in English by Saulės Kliošas
Hear it everywhere
Vilnius is full of Polish and Russians to the point that many don't even try to learn Lithuanian
Yes it is
Well if you go into a shop in your country the least you could expect is being able to communicate in the native language
Plus the large population of Polish in Vilnius probably comes from the Polish forcefully taking over Vilnius, so you can probably see were the disliking of them by some people (not me) come from
> And the Lithuanian government discriminates against them and is trying to forcefully Lithuanise them
How so
There are plenty of Russian and Polish schools that teach mosty in those languages
You could argue that having some lessons in Lithuanian is bad, but without knowing the main language, kids are put into disadvantage for the rest of their lives
So they can preserve their native languages while also learning the most common local language
Polish people can go from kindergarten to university by speaking polish
Lithuanian is of course thought because
well it's Lithuania
No one is discriminated here, unless you get all your info from newspapers
Children can speak only Russian, but they don't do jobs where they have to communicate
Any Lithuanian pop
Believe me, it's not good
One of many examples from Lithuania: [
There is a lot of awful music, but I really don’t like this
Everything just sounds wrong in lithuanian
[Spotify link to a shitty song ]
[be warned this is lithuanian rap (YouTube link)]
Lithuania
This guy -  He is a classic meme here and even today I still can't seem to understand if his music is ironic or not
I can only guess that he was probably not ironic, knowing the fact that he is now trying to become a politician and acts weird on social media writing nonsense political messages and posting a lot of creepy pictures of himself
What have you done, after all these peaceful years this song is in my head again
Again for a few weeks probably

I used to work in one, it was indeed fun reading the standards for third-grade pasteurized sludge
I really dislike our [anthem
] Poems should not be turned in to anthems
Not only it doesn't sound that much of an Anthem, the lyrics are complex, but there are waaaay too many high notes for your average citizen - so much so, a a lot of the people just shut up on a few verses and stay quiet if they don't want to squeal
Too many rules of what a good anthem should be are broken with ours
>Some people say there are better songs
Can you link any of them
THE MEMEL
I don't think these geographical boundaries are in any way controversial, they were rightful german lands at the time of the composition of the words

We just fuck
I don't think we do, what would the use of something like this be
Only one from my class knew too
I would reverse the outcome of the Battle of Vorskla
That way (given that the Tatars lost):
1) it prevents the rise of Muscovy (which in turn saves us from endless wars)
2) Vytautas gets his crown earlier and GDL becomes the Kingdom of Lithuania
3) removes the need to give Samogitia to the Teutonic Order; battle of Tannenberg never happens
There's the term "False Knight", that describes a lonely warrior, travelling in search of adventure
Usually they're of broken heart, and in search of some form of redemption
It's a really poetical, and not really a historical term, but it can be used to describe someone that doesn't know their place in the world
A lot

Maybe some random hill that is higher than 350 meters would also be nice
Cant even flex on Dutch right now

Can I get a copy of some mountain please
Highest hill in Lithuania is 293m only
That would be a good reason to leave EU and form our own union

I don’t think it’s national, but used to have this herbal liquor called “trejos devynerios” which translates to “three nines” and it’s made from 27 different herbs
It can be quite bitter like a lot of those herb-like liquours out there
Then at some point same company made another version which got super popular, called “Žalios Devynerios” (Green Nines) and it tastes mostly like Jägermeister
> Historically it would be mead
And thus it is ours national liquor
Got it as a present few years ago as not a lot of people actually drink it
And damn it's tasty
How about fil'e ferru
Between lithuanians nowadays its considered national, just like the new line of Voruta wines
The Nines is a go to drink for younger people because its quite cheap, high in alcohol and delicious
Also now there is 4 kind of it and theres a different special edition each year
Tastes:
Original - taste of anise, pepper, ginger, muscat
Green Nines - anise, vanilla, citrus and coffee
Red Nines - oranges and other citrus fruits with cinammon (best drink ever for me personally, you can make so many cocktails out of it and its really sweet so easy to drink it on its own and its usually the only flavour I find in baltic shops abroad)
Last years edition - sea buckthorn flavour
Edit:spelling
Nah, its more just historically its supposed to be the drink of all baltic states, not just Lithuania
You cant even buy midus anywhere and its hard to find people who have tried it, I have heard its more popular in Latvia though
Honestly I learned English by accident, I just watched a bunch of YT and played a bunch of games and over time I just learned the language and all of its unique quirks
For me it was easy, because my cousin lived in Belgium and when he came back we watched tons of english channels and talked, but for lithuanians i think it's challenging
Since you have to learn 3 languages the whole school years you go
Theres Lithuanian, english and german,russian,french, but you can choose wich ones you want to learn
Most people speak english with a russian/lithuanian or polish accent so most of the time foreigners don't understand our english
Well, diaspora in Europe usually have susch rights as well
College and university means two different things in Lithuania
Colleges are lower tie tertiary schools that awards with *professional bachelor* and universities are higher tie schools that with Bachelor, Master and Doctor
* Hrodna – Gardinas
* Bialystok – Balstogė
* Kaliningrad – Karaliaučius
* Veliky Novgorod – Didysis Naugardas
* Beijing – Pekinas
* Warsaw – Varšuva
Same here – 'Pekinas'.
And you use many Greek names for Turkish cities like Konstantinopolis and Smyrna
What are other less famous
Trafi for busses is phenomenal in Lithuania, other than that, country is generally too small to require google maps
Taxi drivers for example know every single street in my city (3rd largest by population)
1 euro - Ice cream bar
10 euro - 3 packs of chips, 7 cans of beer
100 euro - 2 great quality pair of jeans, one nice quality pair of shoes

The sea itself looks menacing
Eating something that belongs to it sounds like a bad fortune
It is not weird or yucky in a sense of how it looks, tastes etc
But I don't like the idea of how clever they are and eating them makes me really sad
Now I know that it's hypocritical, because cows and pigs are probably just as clever as dogs, and I would not eat dogs for same reason as octopus
But I can't help but have those specific feelings
Lithuanians eat pig innards stuffed with potatoes, animal intestine soup and blood soup
Octopus is a the least disgusting (and least metal) food compared to these, so no
Eating octopuses is not disgusting or scary to me

In your country, do women in close circle (mom, daughter, sister, grandma etc) talk about their experience being pregnant and giving birth
Or is it too "private"?
(Lithuania) I'm (F) asking because I realized that not one woman in my family or close circles has ever spoken about their pregnancy or labor
I asked around and my friends have confirmed that women don't share these stories
I pressed my mother about it and she got worked up saying it's much too private to be discussed out loud
What's it like in your countries
I've never talked about that with my mom, but I do talk about it extensively with close female friends
Same with periods or ob/gyn appointments
However I think if I asked my mom about it, she wouldn't have much problem sharing, it's just an unusual topic
I can't really say if that reflects the mentality of the whole country though
I suppose it could, since we tend to be a little reserved
Well most people will not cook after hard day so it some hot take away/bar food like burger or various hot snacks, pizza, kebabs
I don't think there is one ultimate dish though
I go for something with lots of meat, cheese and fat
Anything that gives you diabetes, fatty liver or hearth disease
Emotional eating is really dangerous
Cheap kebabs from places that work 24/7 are the best
Yeah, but it becomes dry really fast, so if you want to make more for later, you add cream
Poland - Lenkija
Denmark - Danija
Belarus - Gudija (sometimes)
Montenegro - Juodkalnija (literally)
Finland - Suomija
Poland -> Lenkija
Germany -> Vokietija
Montenegro -> Juodkalnija
there's probably way more tho
Germany - Vokietija
Note that I've never actually heard anyone referring to Belarus as *Gudija* in conversation
I've only ever seen this name in books and even there it's pretty rare
*Baltarusija* is the common name for the country
I don't think *Danija* counts as it's pretty similar and shares the same root with *Denmark*.
Lithuania - Lietuva
Netherlands - Olandija
Switzerland - Šveicarija
Germany - Vokietija
Do these names have any discernible meaning
To be more pricese, the suffix is *-ija* and the stem is *suom*. Most country names in Lithuanian end in *-ija*.
Yep, *juodas* means "black" and *kalnas* means "mountain". So it literally means "land of the black mountains".
Georgia - Sakartvelas or Gruzija
Funny enough, one of the biggest shoe shops around in Lithuania is called Danija
With red background and white text, reminding your flag colors
Just thought it could be interesting :)
How Lithuania is in Hungarian
As Y in Yoghurt
Liettua is very close to how we call ourselves - Lietuva
Hungary - Vengrija
The Baltic Sea is the source for the name of the region around it
As far as I know, the most likely theories are that the name comes from a Germanic word for "strait" (*Belt* in German) or the Latin word for "belt" (*balteus*)
Some people do think that it's related to the Lithuanian *baltas* meaning "white", or the Slavic word for swamp (*\*bolto* in Proto-Slavic), though
Thanks
Essentially, yes
It's mostly used for countries and other geographic regions
Note that the word for "land" in Lithuanian is *žemė* and *-ija* doesn't have any meaning on its own
It's similar in all Slavic languages
Through Russian, this name made its way into Lithuanian, too
I'm not sure this counts because *Vengrija* obviously has the same root as *Hungary*.
They look and sound similar because they're cognates, meaning that they descend from a common source (in this case, Proto-Indo-European [\*dʰéǵʰōm] Since Baltic and Slavic languages probably had a common ancestor in [Proto-Balto-Slavic] these types of cognates are quite frequent
There are two that come to mind
"Anykščių šilelis" by priest Antanas Baranauskas and "Trakų pilis"by priest Maironis (Jonas Mačiulis)
These two basically sum up our entire existence: being europe's last forest people and suffering from destruction of nature
and also remembering how great of a country we were, then feeling sad about how small we've became in the end
First poem is very relevant in today's struggle with environmental crisis
It describes experience of walking through oldwood of Anykščiai, and also describes how it was "changed" (cut down) and how the nature struggles and the man (poet) feels about it
Second poem is about our ancestry (great duchy of lithuania), its castle of Trakai, about how was "now" in ruins, as "is" Lithuania as a country (occupiee by czar russia), how great we have risen and how low we have fallen
Northern food has a tendency to be very filling and to warm you up during harsh winters
Flavour wasn't ever of much importance
Of course I'd say Southern cuisine is more interesting
Southern dishes, unlike most northern dishes, have a variety of spices added to them
This gives them a much greater variety in taste, plus southern dishes look more presentable
Olive oil sucks
Butter makes everything better
Fite me
That's because spices are natural preservatives
You didn't need them since you had winter doing that for you for free
They had to use spices in the South
Spices are literally poisons meant to protect the plant from bacteria and insects, Humans are simply not affected by them because we're too big
They are preservatives, albeit you're right as they are not as potent as salt
Šventosios Romos Imperija
Totally word to word
Šventosios - Holy's, Romos - Rome's, Imperija - empire
No, it doesn't include the word "german" in any form
It's just "Romos Imperia", not even holy
Un Russian and Lithuanian it's also just Holy Roman Empire
Lithuanian - Šventoji Romos Imperija
Russian - Священная Римская Империя
Šventoji(būd.) Romos(būd)* Imperija(daiktavardis)
* It's an adjective contextually it's translated as Roman
I know
It's still called "Romos Imperia". No germany in the lithuanian name for it
Technically yeah, but in day-to-day talking, nobody calls it that
Of course the holy roman empire is a rare subject, but when it does come up, it's called simply "Romos Imperia". I've never heard it called otherwise
You've answered the question yourself
It's made clear from context :))
I am very careful around the words condone and condemn
They're just too similar for what they mean, and mixing them up is too easy for the consequences it could have
For some reason I mix up six and eight
And not only in English, I mix them up in Lithuanian, French, Korean and Japanese as well
Isn't that Canadian spelling
Pretty much no one here believes that the Earth is flat
There are a few climate change deniers, but nothing serious
The only thing here that even comes close to being serious is the whole anti-vaxxers drama
Yes, there are lots of facebook groups dedicated to these things, mostly anti-vax
Antivaxxers, homeopathy, even some climate change denial lately
Lithuania
We are friendly with Germany after they liberated us in ww1
And we still hate Russia
Lithuanian here
Both had effect with relationahip with Poland beacause they occupied Vilnius
Poland – it's weird to say that, but WW2 and 45 years of Communist oppression solved idiotic Polish-Lithuanian conflict and Vilnius issue
Germany – they're not a threat anymore
Russia – they still are keen on aggressive rhetoric towards us, we are extremely vigilant towards them
I hang out mostly on majority female subs and it's a fucking nightmare
The fakeness, forced wholesomeness and compliment sandwiches are bad enough when you're an autistic Eastern European (make a "tactless" comment and they'll rip you apart tho), but they're so deep into Teen Vogue white savior victim slay queen "feminism" bullshit these days it's sickening
Like, how about reading a fucking BOOK on feminism instead of getting all your ideology from other college girls' blogs about the Sociology 101 they just took last Monday
I think a huge part of the problem is that Americans are indeed taught to be very well spoken and structure their thoughts in ways it appears they know what they're talking about, having all the right intellectual buzzwords to expound on the empowerment of buying shitloads of makeup and whatnot, but they don't know how to read a fucking book or process it
(I still call myself feminist just not to give them that power of redefining the word)
I also remember when I was a teenager and got all my "peer interaction" from the internet I assumed all women are catcalled, flirted with and hit on wherever they go, and I'm just too ugly to harrass
I still find it hard to shake it off sometimes even though I know NO ONE DOES THAT
And yet it sounds as if being hit on is the #1 oppressive problem for all women of the world
It's more heartening sometimes to read /r/trufemcels as even that seems more realistic about the role of women
Teenage American "socialists" also need to get the fuck out of their country for at least a month and see how the world functions
I know a lot of them are being trolled and misled by malicious people, but really, I find it hard to fathom sometimes how so many people know nothing about anything outside the US system and think they're inventing something new
You don't even need that much economic theory or political theory or whatnot
just basic awareness of things besides hyper-capitalism
Like, listen to some honest experience of how a Swedish person gets through their week
What Eastern Europeans of all ages have to say about the differences of communism vs capitalism
How people see the police force in different countries
How racial divisions developed in various kinds of places
I think they would benefit greatly from making an effort to include people from around the world rather than middle class American queer POC, but of course everyone outside the bubble is racist, fascist and no speak Ingles gud enough
Is EVERY space on the internet an American feminist space though
Where do the rest of us go to not be met with hostility
And what I talked about was not feminist spaces, but "socialist" spaces which sorely need outside perspectives
I think it's actually called "Russian dressing", like officially
Many manual construction jobs like carpenteer, plumber, etc are paid as good as physicians and much better than most public white collar jobs
Lol, breaking news, illegal stuff gives you lots of money
Kaunas: Competing with Vilnius
Vilnius: Competing with Kaunas
If they are straight Polish, it is very likely that the person is from South-Eastern Lithuania
If the surname has Muslim vibes, the person can be from or has origins from the Tatar villages
There are few thousands, and my city has a Tatar mosque
From the legendary BBC phrasebooks:
* ¿Donde están los brics de sangría a un euro
* ¿Quizás un chapuzón sin ropa en el mar
Ich liebe trinkt mineralwasser

Zīrga gālva
Kurwa ja perdole

Mama mia
я не понимаю русский (ja nipanimaju paruski)
It means "I dont understand russian"
иди на ху.
not a sentence:
니가 [niga] meaning you're
in aqua scribis
Writing in water
я ем хлеб, он ест хлеб.
Unfortunately, the kids are home, too
It makes a bit more sense in English
> I said a hip hop,
> The hippie to the hippie
> The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
> To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
> To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Litai (our previous currency, 1Lt is about 0
29€)
I still have a 0
10Lt coin in my bedroom and it gives me so much nostalgia from when I was a little kid
[There's this guy] but other than that, I don't really know
I don't watch lithuanian youtube, becouse most videos are garbage
There are some exceptions, but generally most viedos are just not my taste
I agree to you
Lithuanian YouTube is garbage, indeed
Maybe DeMiko is one of the better YouTubers, but I don't watch him anyways
Bruh you moved to Latvia to be in a deadbedroom
Normally I would say something encouraging but at this point I just have to ask how much you really love her
I've personally had great feelings whenever I moved countries for a partner but those weren't necessarily supposed to be long term, end-of-my-life situations
No since Lithuania gained independence in the end of the WW1
We don't really celebrate or do something about world war one
Same with world war two, only Russian minority celebrate it
Yes, we say 'Čekija' and I never understood the point of using the full name in this context
Čekija is what it is in Lithuanian
So we've been using "Czechia" already anyway for a long time
I’m Lithuanian
We have always used the shortened version when mentioning the country, Čekija
Yeah, as long as I don't encounter idiots who pronounce it as "tchetchia".
Czechia isn't really a shortening
Czechia is to the Czech republic what Ireland is to the Republic of Ireland
Anyway, I prefer it since it's shorter
I like the Czech Republic more because Czechia sound like Чечня (Chechnya, Chechen Republic) in russian
my point is, one is a place the other the official title of a government
I think the PLC flag looks the coolest, just so many features incorporated into one flag
AHH so the Libyans copied you
In Lithuanian there is only a single word - *pavydas*. It's used in every context and so I can never remember which of the two is the correct one to use in English, as I never had a clear separation in my mind
There are many dialects
Most prominent is Samogitian
It is sometimes considered it's own language
No, it was Chechnya
Vilnius has everything new and old:
IT, finance, engineering (mainly mechanical design)
Kaunas mainly heavy industry and transportation:
Engineering (mainly mechanical manufacturing/repair)
Alytus is heavy industry:
Assembly (semi-automated or manual)
Klaipėda is sea/gas related:
Engineering (mechanical, chemical), machine operation
The media usually refers to it as the "Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine", but as far as I've encountered in daily language people usually say the "Pfizer vaccine". I've also seen governmental health institutions calling it the "Comirnaty vaccine" a few times, which is its brand name
Most people say "Thank you" in Lithuanian without even knowing it as it sounds just like a sneezing sound "ačiū" - ahchoo
English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese
lithuanian, french, english, dutch, german, spanish, latvian and estonian
If you know how to sneeze then you have Lithuanian covered too
Same sound basically
Also Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian, although in lithuanian you normally say ačiū, which means thanks, but saying ačiū tau(thank you), is not a mistake
If you want to learn in lithuanian its ačiū
Also, Spanish and Italian
No way you don't know *gracias* and *grazie*.
Not quite, *achoo* has the clear stress strictly on the second syllable, and *ãčiū* has a long, stressed first syllable
Sounds accurate
Strict weed laws
chewing gum ban and other more nefarious bans
All that comes up to me is partly cloudy skies, Sy scrapers and massive littering and gum fines
Lithuanians had quite developed trade connections with a lot of people around europe
The balts were known for the amber they collected and the jewlery they made from it
In fact, the trade went so far, that baltic amber jewlery has been found in the middle east, and middle eastern jewlery has been found in lithuania
For example: a bronze statue, from around 1000-1500 B.C.E has been found in Šernai cemetary, near Klaipėda
It's also theorised, that Romans were the ones that first introduced lithuanians to agriculture, in exchange for amber
Actually, no
Not really
The baltic tribes were quite isolated, becouse they weren't christians up until the 14th century, and they united to form a country in the 13th
Up until that point some hunter-gatherers still remained in lithuania
Even if not plant farming, the romans brought domesticated goats to lithuania, which weren't found there naturally, so animal farming was indeed brought here by various traders, including the ones from rome
Basketball without the US, Spain or Serbia
Our only hope
Poland, because Everytime you want to go to foreign country from Lithuania, you need to spend entire day in Poland just driving through
All countries are small in the Schwarzschild metric
Well yes
Road construction next to Warsaw seems like it will last forever
I had  a train ride only once in my life :/
I’d have to say Kaunas
Vilnius is too modernized and does not have that lithuanian tone that it used to have
Edit: Damn, this sparked a HUUUGE Discussion
Not really, Vilnius was apart of Poland for around 20 years if you don't count the commonwealth
Currently memes are being shared in instagram and facebook
Major topics are political and local Lithuanian extravagansa
Only sub here i know that is mainly meme based is r/demiko
Fucking terrible
Visit r/kaimashumor to see what I mean
[Holy shit this is so much more retarded than the original]
When I was 12 we went to Vilnius to see a movie since there was no cinema in my home-town
It was my first film in cinema ever
Bus driver got lost and we didn’t make it to the animated film we were supposed to go to and went to see Final Destination instead
That was some intense stuff for 12 year-old me
I almost always missed out on my school trips (intentionally and unintentionally), so the best place I went was probably Kaunas Fort IX
We have the exact same holiday "Užgavėnės". We burn a giant doll usually made out of hay to scare the winter and welcome the spring
We eat lots of pancakes too
But we also dress up as monsters with scary faces
I’m in 8th grade and I’ve never had a sex Ed lesson, all I’ve learned is from porn and memes
Really depends on the parents
Some try to talk to their kids, some shove some books and pads in their faces (tampons are
a tricky subject), others
I'm not sure what they do
I am not sure about kindergarten or grades 1-4
But from high school curriculum the start is at 6th (~12 y/o) grade where students get to learn about differences between males and females, a little bit about development of foetus
If I recall correctly there is also a page or two from section "Good to know" where authors mentioned some items for safe sex (condoms /birth control), but these types of pages are considered "off curriculum" so it's up to teacher to decide to teach or not
Some schools ask professionals from outside (public health specialists, doctors, etc) to give speech about periods and hygiene for teenagers (usually there are two groups split in between girls and boys)
Some schools asks priests to do the talk (I am not sure why)
Before internet became so accessible kids learned stuff from magazines, now they just Google stuff
Some teachers started joking, that the kids should be able to teach about this better than teachers themselves
I'm half polish, half lithuanian
I identify more with my lithuanian side, becouse I was born and raised speaking lithuanian, surrounded by lithuanians, learning about lithuania, despite living in poland
My town is known as the largest single community of lithuanians in poland (~75% lithuanian)
It was in the center of conflict between lithuania and poland during WW2, so it belongs to poland now, despite being ethnically lithuanian
When it comes to poland I have kind of love-hate relationship with it
I have lived here all my life, so there's definitely a little bit of polish in me, but if it was not for the polish national hero, and lithuanian "anti-hero" Piłsudski, the land where I live would now probably belong to the country I consider my home
Refusing the Kaliningrad Oblast as a gift in 1950s. We could've gotten some extra land, extra coastline, some more amber, some reserves of oil we wouldn't have used; but at the same time we would've gotten a huge Russian minority population
~25% to our current 4
5%. Look how well 1950s Russian gifts of land are working out for Ukraine
Sorry for the late reply
I'm no authority on the polish side of this question so take it with a grain of salt
Poland much like Lithuania has a close history with the region
In the 1800s there were significant Polish and Lithuanian minorities in the region
Taking the region in wouldn't affect Poland as drastically as Lithuania; +2
3% compared to ~25% (current day)
Maybe Poland would take the Western part of Kaliningrad Oblast and Lithuania the Eastern
Based on [historical regions]
That being said I've never seen anyone suggest Poland to take it
I've only seen that Russia should keep it, Lithuania should take it, Germany should take it back
The latter however renounced all claim to it in 1990
TL;DR: Doubt it
They're Ok
Although I generally dislike constructions that have the plural ending "ai". Have no idea why, i just dislike them for some reason
I mean, they’re all the same
Vilnius, Kaunas, Anykščiai, palanga, Kretinga, Klaipėda are all just the same
The only way I can really answer this is with out actual country name
I prefer Lietuva over Lithuania
Everyone calls Vilnius by saying the i quite hard
So like "Will knee us". You have to say i a bit softer
I agree with the ai
I used to live in Anykščiai
Not a nice name
Utena County (northeastern Lithuania)
no such place lol
Not really a "middle of nowhere", but I think that Balbieriškis would suffice
Of course, it's only like 20 minutes away from a city with like 50000 people
In your country, do people tend to move from smaller towns to the big cities, or the other way around
In Lithuania the small towns are definitely struggling because young people go to study in the bigger cities and eventually get a job, start families and generally do not return to their small towns
In Lithuania small towns are dying (though fellow Lithuanians, feel free to correct me)
Was just about to comment about the whole situation when I saw that you're from Lithuania as well
I guess no need for any explanations then .
Wish more countries had that trend
It's a vicious cycle in Lithuania - when people leave small towns, so does entertainment , and people feel bored and move to a large city, and as a result all concerts, plays, circuses etc go to the large cities
I've heard that about Belgium, hehe
I've heard a saying that Belgium is just one large suburb of Brussels lol
Sometimes I forget that rugby exists, that's how unpopular it is in Lithuania
Eggs - yes, milk - most people do, but not my family (seriously, why does my family keep milk in the fucking *basement*?)
Milk is a must to refrigerate
It's sold refrigerated too
Some stores refrigerate eggs, some don't. I always put them in the fridge
It isn't a very common practice, but it's ok to do so
My family did that rarely
I think it's normal
Why you should leave your tasty food uneaten when you can bring it home and eat it together for your dinner
It is completely acceptable, to take the remains of restaurant food
After all, you spent money on it, so leaving it to be thrown out would be a waste of money
I use qwerty but Lithuanian is with ąčęėįšųūž on the top
QWERTY but instead of the number keys along the top we have letters like ą, ę, ė, š...
This
Also I never seen someone use ĄŽERTY type
We eat pizza with ketchup in lithuania too wtf is it weird
But its good
Character should absolutely be taken into account when sentencing
Imagine two different people kill somebody with a car in the exact same manner
One has never had a driving violation and is regarded by everyone to be a responsible driver
The other is known to all hos neighbors as an extremely agressive and unsafe driver, who constantly speeds and disregards traffic rules
Yeah, the first guy should get a more lenient sentence
That's why I'm saying that neighbors, coworkers, etc opinions should be at least somewhat considered
Not everything is in the criminal record
I mean this reasoning can be extended to any witness testimony ever
"Your honor, the witness is a dick and influenced by someone with a grudge, thus he should not be believed when saying he clearly saw the defendant violantly beating the victim"
I'm sure courts have ways of dealing with witnesses
Honest question - have you ever been to a trial or read witness depositions
You're factually incorrect, there are various questions that do not just narrowly pertain to some "actual events". And in real life various circumstances that can not be factually established, and witness testimony differ even when several people saw the same event
Courts have ways of dealing with it, it doesn't just mean witnesses have no value
We wouldn't view a tan as unhealthy, if it's not overdone
Is it considered healthy though - that's up for debate
I've encountered some older ladies, especially when I was a kid (like 15-20 years ago), claiming that one must go tanning or otherwise 'be in the sun' in the summer because a tan is healthy
I haven't heard much of that lately, I guess times are changing
Except for this one older guy who came to me at the beach recently and advised me (in a friendly manner) to get a blood test because I'm probably lacking iron, since I'm so pale
Younger people don't seem to express much about the healthiness of being either pale or tan
My friends might sometimes go 'wow, your skin is so white
' and then we'd compare our arms and have a laugh, but that's about it
Absolutely normal
Žemaičių blynai
It's not an obscure dish, but a damn good one
They're potato dumplings (not cepelinai), stuffed with cheese or meat
They're crispy, soft, sweet, salty and very delicious
I'd recommend them to anyone
They're really easy to make, and are usually baked on a pan, so there's no complex preparations or long cook time, like with cepelinai
There are differently called variations in different countries
In lithuania it’s called Šašlykai
I think the word itself is loaned from german
Basically it’s just cooked meat on fire
So nothing game changing
We have 4 in Lithuania
The closes one to me is the Vilnius Old Town  its very pretty
We have 4
Vilius old town, Kuršių marios(Curonian lagoon, separated from the sea by a 94km long dune ),Kernavė archeological site(the first historical capital of lithuania), and Skurvės geodezinis lankas, which is a triangulation chain which goes from norway to the black sea, and cuts through lithuania along with 9 other countries
[Here] are the pictures
My personal favourite is Vilnius old town
It just has that unique feel
Lithuanian name would be the best - Lietuva
There was a movement to drop the H letter, that would make Lituania, which is less of a tongue twister
Lit-land would be pretty Lit too
Albania is such a cool sounding name though
No, Suomi kp31 is like the name of the country "Suomi"... Do you think they named the country after a ww2 era SMG
Mainly some English names, like Michael, for example
Naming him Michael would produce a completely different pronunciation of it, it would sound like the Spanish or Italian version of the name (Sort of similar to Miguel), and on top of that would look seriously out of place and weird
If I "Lithuanized" it, it would be "Maiklas" which sounds even more ridiculous and would probably lead to that kid commiting suicide later in life due to heavy bullying
The "normal" lithuanization of this name would be to use the slavic version of it, "Mikhail", or in this case, "Michailas" but again, it sounds completely different, no longer cool, and it sounds like an old person's name
Wait
You don't allow non-Polish letters in your names
So why do the Poles in Lithuania want to use non-Lithuanian letters
I think [your letters] have an even worse case of cancer I'm afraid
Well, of course there are lots of people that don't mind logos, but I think in general, if people are given a choice between a shirt with a logo, or the same exact shirt, just without the logo, most would choose the logo-less variant
As I said, a lot of people wear clothes with logos here, but maybe they're not as frequent as in america
On my trip to canada (which I assume is culturally somewhat similiar to america), I noticed that lots of people there, wear sports clothes on a daily basis, while in general, in europe these clothes are not as frequent
F. ex
you don't see jeans with logos, and here in europe, people tend to wear jeans more than sports pants, which you do see with logos
It's a huge generalisation, but I think if you'd go off of a statistic, your roommate would be right to an extent
Norway
In my view only snow-white albino people lived there
Also so rich they can spit on me and id be worth 3x more if i were to be sold as an item
Also bottomless fjords, temperature never rising above -10C, never ending aurora and mountains of fish
So i happened to know some people who worked there
A place like any other
The spit part wasnt dispelled though
If you lived anywhere neighbouring russia, you would have felt like this decades before 2014
Russia has deceived, bribed our politicians so many times and tried to threaten us with so many things that we can never take it seriously anymore
Most of us cannot grasp how can a country so inherently evil, being led by a band of 90s bandits can be thought of as neutral or good by western europeans
Imo anyone who thinks highly of russia either has no morals and is a psychopath or lives under a rock
Yeah
People get the craziest opinions about places theyve never been to
Ive been to greece two times
Still nostalgic about it
From my experience, the craziest thing about greece is that all bus drivers are named Yanis
Its as if your name isnt Yanis, you cant get a license
In general, greeks are the most chill people ive met
Very warm, honest and helpful
Must be living under a rock :D
Foreign affairs: supporting syrian government who user chemical weapons to kill rebels and civilians; occupation of Krym, which was a part of a "brotherly" nation, the one of three ruses; spy assassination attempt in britain; assassination attempt of opposition leader Navalny, assassination of journalist/opposition member; "accidental" nuclear weapon detonation recently
Went silent so quick people dont even know about it; since 2014 there has been +1000 nato border breaches by their planes and ships; russian submarine near sweden; nuclear weapon dislocation in koningsburg; russian government money laundering through scandinavian banks in the baltics; russian diplomat smuggling cocaine to and from europe; cyber attacks against european neighbours, usa and others; heavy, IMMENSE propaganda machine through tv and social media about justifying occiparion of Krym and showing falsified documentaries, debate shows about  events related to soviet union and russia in european neighbours; outward calling western europe and especially germany fascists; massacre of 8 unarmed lithuanian border guards after independence; russian oligarchs bribing politicians and trying to transfer control of essential parts of countries (energy, finance, politics); 2008 Sakartvelo war, when russia gave out free passports to georgians and its regional people, then came in with an army to "defend russian citizens" (similar scenario to krym)
Recently, youth paramilitary groups (remind you of anything
Secret airsoft clubs in the baltics, training for aiding russian military in case of an invasion, dismantled slowly by lithuanian military and swats
2010-2012 export blockades that caused 8 hour queue at borders of russia & belarus, making 4 hour checks per truck
Part of produce expired and had to be disposed
Meat scandals, when "independent group of experts" found parasites
And several times when a huge shipment of meat was delivered
unfair trade practices while selling gas and oil to european countries, proven guilty by court
then Azerbaijan-Armenian war in Nogorno
Russia is now a "peacekeeper". Azeries were backed by Turkey, Armenia is heavily under influence of Russia
Turkey and Russia are getting along well as well
You can imagine two powers pushing two weak pawns to fight and weaken
One gets oil, another gets to keep its military in the region
Crazy smart, but crazy evil
Now think about the Nordstream project
Russia will control vital part of germany
Guess what russia did with Ukraine before they got rid of russian gas lines
russia shut it off several times during winter as a way to pressure the ua government
This shit is illegal
I don't really know about the meaning of the male ending -ius, -is, -as(like in Valinčius, Grigutis, Kazlauskas), but what I do know is the female ending -ienė and -iūtė is changed when the woman is married(for example a married woman will be Valinčienė, but her daughter will be Valinčiūtė. When the daughter gets married and the husband will have the same surname[Valinčius] her surname will change to Valinčienė)
Original lithuanian surnames have diffrrent endings for males (sons, fathers), wife and daughter
Original, pure lithuanian surnames dating back to 1000s A.D. end with -a, e.g. Gedvila, Radvila etc
Ending of such surname does not reveal any belonging, place or affiliation
The word itself means what it means - a family name
Wife's surname ends with -ienė, which notes that the woman is a wife of a man
So Gevila's wife would be Gedvilienė literally meaning that she is the wife of Gedvila
Daughter's surname ends with -aitė, -ytė, -ūtė..., showing the gender and unmarried family status in the family
Gedvila's daughteė would be Gedvilaitė, not Gedvilytė, cause Gedvila enda wth an A.
Other, more recent surnames are borrowed or merged up from other languages, mainly polish:
Kazlauskas, literally lithuanian version of Kozlowski
Mockus, shortened, deviated version of South-Lithuanian (Dzūkų) name Macas spoken (Matas written), which is lithuanized version of polish surname Mackiewicz, which refers to male name Mateusz aka Mathew/Matt
Valančius is lithuanian equivalent of Valantson
Original lithuanian surname would be Valanta, but his sons would be called Valančiai by strangers, Valanta by friends
Thats what i believe was the case in villages not so long ago
I use it and abuse it
No, since I'm fluent in English
Nope
Some of my classmates are (since I speak English a lot with friends), but I personally don't see an issue
We have a border with Russia and a bunch of idiots that believe Russian propaganda
I don't live in Lithuania, but I'd be armed and fighting if any Russian soldier bothered to step onto Lithuanian soil
Its not the same
Russia basically considers any exercises done in Baltic states as "on the border".
Doing exercises near the border is one thing .Crossing with your exercises into other country's air territory is another
Doing defensive exercises is one thing
Doing exercises on how to attack is a very different one
So Baltic states should be demilitarized countries because what, we are small and have borders with Russia
Or thay we can't be in NATO for this same reason because this irritates Russia
Yeah
Latin America says that Russia is never far enough
A You're being intentionally obtuse
Stop pretending that you don't know what I meant
Even AI knows the meaning these days
B Cold War never ended, there was an armistice of 15 years
Please explain how things that we do INSIDE our country give the right to Russia to cross our airspace
You are talking like we, the Baltic countries, are "the border", not sovereign countries
You are suggesting that it would be safer for us to be  demilitarized countries, while it would be absolutely the oposite
Truth is - there is no safe way to be neighbours with Russia, because that's "their thing".  Even country like Belarus, who are all into pleasing Russia, has problem with them
There's a long standing dispute about the Arctic between Canada and US
It's not as simple as one might think
I know some Russian, although it's not that big of an accomplishment since probably more than half the country can speak Russian, so I would say my skills would be below average
I speak russian (which is a minority language in Lithuania)
It is quite common along side with polish in the south-east of the country (mainly in the capital city Vilnius and surrounding territories)
But when it comes to the rest of the country, it is barely spoken by anyone
What classes did you attend
We do not matter in the grand scheme of things
We had a short stint of being a regional power in the 15-17th centuries but now we're just a small nation almost at the edge of europe
We do not have any world famous artists or scientists or people in general, so the only little fame that we can get(I guess through our basketball team) we try to hold on to as much as we can, even though the fame is completely meaningless and adds nothing to the world
Honestly, no idea
Don't think Lithuanians have anything to be proud of to begin with
You think
Not much of a thing to brag about though
It's great, but it's not unique to Lithuania
You can find it in other Baltic States, Nordics and also Central Europe
Yeah, give soviets a centimeter and they take a kilometer
We already learned it the hard way by allowing them to have Soviet troops in Lithuania, after which they just straight up annexed us
No one cares about poles until you run into one
Do care about Poles though
More likely to find it in restaurants as a snack for beer
Not enough and, unfortunately, Arab conquest has pushed us apart
Remember that most mediterranean used to be "one world".
Hopefully cultures can be reconciled and we stop looking at each other like we're foreign
This schism is something that leads to too much tensions
All i know that many of you speak french and are muslim
Oh, and Albert Camus
I'm not close to it but I know a little bit
I followed a lot of the Arab Spring and the aftermath, especially in Egypt
I'm also interested in geography so I at least know the differences between the countries although I forget a lot
Looking at Google Earth maps is a trip
The Roman history of the region is surprisingly fascinating, like the Jugurtha incident
I've only met a few Moroccans (some very proud Amazigh) and Egyptians though and no one from the other countries
I know something of the history of North African Jews and how they're doing now
I've also seen the border of Egypt from inside Israel :DDD
The Japan and Kazakhstan being similiar thing is quite well said
Kazakhstan is culturally more similiar, considering it shares a soviet past along with a lot of european countries
Japan on the other hand has a similiar climate
It has snow in the winter and plenty of conifers
Their summers are probably warmer though, depending on how far south you go, and considering that Japan's next to the pacific ocean
When in the medieval times (around 1430) the Duchy was the largest state in Europe reaching from the Baltic sea to the Black sea
Nordic Crusades probably, would fit their theme as well
But they're definitely not going to do that, Ubisoft is quite Vanilla and sticks to the histories that are well-known in the Anglo-sphere, Hellenic period, British empire, Vikings
I doubt they would do anything that's not already familiar to most of their audience
Yes, most people watch the first and second parts in December or on Christmas
I was pretty mad when the station that airs it decided to stagger the movies, air the first one weeks before Christmas and then culminate with whatever the fuck the third movie is
Nooooo
At least show the second movie on Christmas, I find it super Christmassy
Marozai
They’re basically Lithuanian gopniks
[Marozai
] They are fairly [similar] to Russian gopniks, they're mostly Russians or Poles, or a mix of the two
They're all aggressive, either jobless or re-selling used cars, finished secondary school at best, they think that all cops are bastards because their licence was taken away for drunk driving
Their population has greatly reduced over the past decade as they emigrated to Western and Northern Europe
[Marozai] or [Forsai] both of which are just pretty much our equivalent of the Russian gopnik
Formally(or even presently, idk) known as forsai
I think you meant formerly
Forsai is not used these days at all
Yes, you’re right ! Also gezai IIRC
We share quite a lot of words with Latvian, but most often it's just the same root, possibly with few different leters, pronunciation is different
Often those similar words have a slightly different meaning
It's impossible to make a conversation
I personally understand almost nothing when spoken, can pick every 4th- 5th when reading text
I can also speak Russian, so I can pick some things from other slavic languages
Belarusian the best one, can undetstand it pretty well as the russian dialect in Vilnius region is quite close to it
Also can understand some ukrainian and polish
I actually understand those two much much better than I understand Latvian
Latvian, maybe like 60% when written, spoken less so
Slavs, not at all
The self-applied noose

From what I know, multilingual education is a thing in every school
We're taught English from elementary school and in middle school we choose a 3rd language (either French, Russian or German)
I think it works well for the most part
I can fluently speak English and I think my French is ok for someone who's been learning for 3 years
indas - indian person/a plate, a dish
keltas - celt person/ferry boat
kartu - together/bitter
Self esteem and Ego are both called Ego
I would love to hear someone say that sentence lol
Because they're all Germanic languages that have a lot of similarities to English
Finnish statistics are more impressive, but yet again, they also learn Swedish
Nation
I've moved a fair bit over Lithuania as a whole, I don't have any real attachment to any bit of it
I haven't lived in my "hometown" for 15 years now
Any word that has two r in close proximity
I hate words like rural or rare
I also find the letter combination  -ths (months)  impossible to pronounce
I couldn't help but notice your nickname
In a previous comment you said you're a native english speaker
Is there any particular reason you're learning lithuanian
Forgive my curiosity, It just warms my feelings, seeing someone willingly choose to learn my native language
Ohh
Well, good luck with your learning then
> maybe in Eastern Europe
I kinda doubt it, the hardest alcohol abuse here happens in private homes
Uruguay, in terms of size (both population and area) and economic development
One Lithuanian sociologist wrote a monograph that includes exploring two different scenarios of how Lithuania would have ended up if not for the Soviet occupation
The optimistic scenario is Finland and the pessimistic scenario is Uruguay (ending up the same as we are today)
I had no idea which country would work for me, after your explanation I totally agree, Ireland
I would say it's [Curonian Spit ] something magical there
Every time I go there I feel like I'm far away from home
I went there once
It's totally unexpected, since the mountains there are really smooth and not really rocky, and suddenly you see these sandstone pillars in the middle of the forest
Really cool, would recommend
They're quite cool
It's also worth mentioning about [Naglių kaimas] a village that got swallowed by the dunes overtime and is now completely buried under the sand
I study in a UK university - all the recorded lectures are not Moodle, what they didnt get to record before Easter they took from last year
Had one presentation assignment that they did on Google Hangouts and thats pretty much it
They just changed all the exams to coursework and if you have questions - you email the lecturers
My sister in Lithuanian school - has lessons from 9am to 1pm, uses Discord for this, assignments done on moodle, google drive and zoom
Depends
1-5 online classes a day
Some teachers use Moodle
Most use zoom
Our teachers will never migrate to teams lol
How can you use twitch for that
Do they stream and talk with the kids in chat
For the most part, users did not know enough about it to set proper controls, this technically allowed random people to join your conversations as conversation URL is formed from ID's so you just start changing numbers and eventually you will hit someone
Then trolls began appearing in school classes showing porn to kids and snuff videos
This could have been prevented by teachers, they just didn't know how
There were also more serious privacy concerns, like occasionally routing traffic through China (really not an issue for 5 grader class), but the main issue was unsecured conversations
Given that I still have to use zoom for work, a lot of things improved once articles started to appear on the news
So in this case the teacher could have kicked them easily
Now she is able to approve then before joining
Baisiogala - which roughly translates to "scary/horror town"
Bezdonys (which roughly translates to "Farting people")
I remember visiting Canary islands a few years back
Upon telling telling a waiter where I'm from, he started speaking Polish
Must admit, it's not the best experience
We only had like two separate days of snow actually staying on the ground this winter
And maybe a few instances of snow falling and melting instantly
The temperature is arround 5 C° at day time and 0 C° at night
Nice winter indeed
Same in Lithuania, and I honestly cannot remember there being no snow almost into February
Well not exactly the same, there were snowy days, but snow never lasted for more than 24 hours
We have Top-Shop which always advertises it's products on 10 minute long commercials
They're outrageously expensive and bad quality
I hate them personally
['Marathon in the University Street'] from 1959, by A. Sutkus
It's a photographer that most people here would probably have heard of
The photograph was bough by Elton John
It always feels a little surreal looking at it since I walk there every day
[The council of Lithuania] who signed the Act of Reinstating Independence in 1918
Probably everyone in Lithuania has seen this photo in history books at school
I would have said either [this (A.Sutkus, "Pionierius")] or [this (V. Usinavičiaus photo of January 13th events)]
Edit: [honorary mention]
Afaik, it's up to your own interpretation
The subject of the photo is a young boy who has recently joined the [Soviet pioneer organization] the title "Pioneer"), it was taken in 1964 September 1st (which is the start of a school year)
I've found interpretations suggesting it's a propagandist photo, and some suggesting it wasn't published until the 1980s because the boy is not smiling in the photo, and that's not the idealistic way government wanted Soviet people to be portrayed in
Personally, I think it shows a boy who's been put into a politicised uniform to represent something he's neither aware of nor cares about; you can see kids in the background smiling and looking on inquisitively (and I can't see the signature neck-tie of pioneers on them), but the boy in the foreground seems ambivalent; I think it's about putting your agenda onto others, some who might not be able to reject it, to give that agenda an image you desire, but that it doesn't necessarily possess
Aren't most of your beaches rocky
Also your buses were very convenient, the service was really good
[English] the variety in accents alone is breathtaking
i really enjoy languages like Japanese and Korean
I like their flow and how different tue languages are from my own
Yeah, most of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth years
My IT teacher said that January 1, 2000 was the first day of 21st century
I tried arguing but she remained certain
My Lithuanian teacher insisted that Kristijonas Donelaitis cannot be called 'kunigas' (priest; all Catholic priests are called 'kunigai'), instead she suggested to use 'pastorius' – despite that Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran church call their clergy 'kunigai' as well
My high school Lithuanian language teacher really enjoyed talking about medical things that she had no clue about
She used to tell us how homeopathic medicines are superior to real drugs (her grandma was a homeopath, so it must be true)
Or how children delivered through C-section do not have a strong personality and are not as successful later in life
On top of that, I disagreed with a lot of her interpretations of the literature that we studied, so
Yeah, her classes quickly became my least favourite
Heyy broli lietuvninke, i dont get it, can you explain please
Year zero doesn't exist, so the 1st century spans the years AD 1 to AD 100, inclusive, and so on
That means the 21st century is 2001 to 2100, inclusive
AM is indeed for early things, pre-midday is earlier than post-midday
Exactly the same in Lithuania
Call Lithuanians Russians or Slavs
Wear Communist and Nazi memorablia
Speak positively about Soviet Union, Communism or tell that 'Soviets liberated Lithuania'.
Call Lithuania nation of 'Jew killers'.
It's viewed as aplace where you can get cheap(compared to other brands), quality products
It's quite popular
IKEA kitchen is exactly the same quality as any other made from laminated MDF
They use all Blum hardware and their warranty is excellent all 25 years of it
Now they mostly do
Lithuanian constitution prohibits foreign military bases, but NATO bases are OK
I'm happy for all international (NATO/EU) soldiers here, because it works like a deterrent against a pretty imperialistic nuclear neighbour
>Cheese
You would be surprised how good Australians are at making quality cheeses
Francophone America makes some awesome unique cheeses
And Latin American artisan cheeses could rival Spanish varieties
Sorry, but other places have great cheeses as well
Yes they are
and they are boringly repetitive
Here in US - Kerrygold is literally everywhere
And it is literally the exact same butter as back in Ireland
(My husband's Irish and he just can't live without it)
My sister lives in Ardea, near Rome, and her water supply is practically mineral water
I think it's Nemi, a small town, the water from their pipe is a little carbonated and is mineral water
You can
But here, in US, it's quite literally everywhere
I've even seen in a random country store, where you could buy guns, chicks() and tractor wheels right next to an old household fridge half full of 4 different types of Kerrygold and local butter
Of course
Even apples are Polish :D
I can die for Skawa draze kokosowe
I currently live in Williamsburg neighborhood of New York City
Greenpoint is an incredibly Polish neighborhood
To the point that I can get any Polish foodstuff in any shop there
Polish is lingua Franca there
As for my home - there's little need to have Polish store in Lithuania
The difference between Lithuanian and Polish foods is not great
and the things that are only made in Poland are freely available at any supermarket
No, but the part of the country within an hour's drive or so from the the Polish border goes grocery shopping in Poland due to lower prices and lower VAT rates
Probably around 1410, when the battle of Žalgiris (Tanenberg) happened, I think it would be so interesting to see how the people lived, perhaps how they reacted to this victory
A second choice would be either a bit back, when Algirdas and Kęstutis ruled, or interwar Lithuania, because I just know so little about interwar Lithuania
These were the few times in history when our nation was truly independent - no Poland, no Russia, no Germany
Late interbellum
Maybe I would even meet my grandparents who are alive nowadays
Well, everyone who lives in spain, but otherwise you're mistaken
I haven't met anyone who knows the spanish anthem
Well, that's an unexpected plot twist
They just drive porsches
Not really an accent, but a dialect - Samogitian
Already hard enough to read, but if someone old from Samogitia starts speaking in their dialect, oh no, can't understand anything
The accent of people living in Žemaitija(Šiauliai and all around it) as a person from Aukštaitija(Vilnius and north) is REALLY hard to understand
I can ask them to repeat what they've said like 5 times and still not get it
In lithuania it snowed like 2 years ago alot
Sometimes it even went to -30 but last year it wasnt even snowing idk whats gonna happen this year
> we even get around or even above zero temperatures in mid winter
Last year was probably the only year in my life were I never wore a winter coat and only walked with spring coat that mostly protects from rain rather than cold
Odd times ahead

Our current president is Gitanas Nauseda
So among the russian speaking part of the country we have an anecdote
The belarussian president Aleksander Lukashenko (who is a president for arround 20 years) was sitting in his cabinet when sudenly a man came in and reported:
- Lithuanians have a new president Nauseda
Lukashenko replies:
- Don't worry, I'm here Navsegda too
The thing is that in russian "Navsegda" (Навсегда) means "forever" and sounds very similar to Nauseda
Basically it is a reference to how long Lukashenko is the president of Belarus and him being an everlasting president that doesn't want to leave his post
It is more of a joke about the Belarussian president, not the Lithuanian one at this point :/
We pronounce it with "Sh" and add the lithuanian "-as" at the end, so it's "Budapeštas" in lithuanian
We also put the accent on "pe". Idk if it's the correct way, but we do it
We also use "š" in "budapest". It would be "budapeštas" in lithuanian
As an engineer, it wouls be very useful to learn german, swedish and french
As for world-context language skills: english, spanish, russian
Korean, Japanese and French
I already speak a bit of Korean and Japanese and I'm kinda good at French, but I'd love to be fluent in them
Getting rid of them was one of the first things we did
They were all sent to "Grūtas park" which is a populiar tourist attraction in southern Lithuania now
Every Soviet monument to Grūtas park
And we shouldn't care what Russian government says
Read about Grutas Park in Lithuania if you want to know what happened to those statues :)
There’s nothing wrong with honouring fallen soldiers of any side
All police officers carry their Glock pistols, but I have seemed them with assault rifles only in December 2014, when all the euro banknotes were brought to the Bank of Lithuania before the euro changeover
Most policemen have pistols, among things like tazers, batons and speays
Rarely police patrols are issued assault rifles
We skipped the oceanic islands when i was in school
Oceanic wasnt a term used back then in our country
Now im sure its either Australia and Oceanic islands or Australia
Imo, oceania is an artificial region, like europe, not a continent
Australia is a contiental land mass, and oceania is thousands of islands around it and some very far away from the contient, maybe even on a different tectonic plate
i was taught jugendherberge meant children's night hostels (rough translation), does it just mean hostels
As mentioned before here, double negative
Nieko nenoriu, word by word -  " I don't want nothing " but actually means "I want nothing".
Palys palįs, palys, palis
Palys (surname) will take cover, will thin down a little bit, it will rain a little bit
"How are these berries called
It's a blueberries
So why are they red then
Because they are green
" In Lithuanian "green" has also a meaning of a "raw". While it's ok with some fruits it makes no sense with the other
We say "green meat" when we mean a raw meat as well
Of course it was a woman
Oh, wait, you never said so
Just made up another one with `senVs`:
Senas senos senės senis senės.

Off the top of my head for Lithuania:
* Mindaugas (first and only King of Lithuania)
* Gediminas (founder of Vilnius, capital of Lithuania)
* Vytautas the Great (the greatest Duke the GDL has ever had, during his rule the GDL was at its zenith of power)
* Jogaila (Jagiełło in Polish) (The ruler who started baptising lithuanians)
* Martynas Mažvydas (author of the first Lithuanian book)
* Simonas Daukantas (one of first beginners of Lithuanian National Revival)
* Jonas Basanavičius (the Chairman of the National Council, which has created the first Lithuanian state)
* Antanas Smetona (last President of Lithuania, a de facto dictator)
* Vytautas Landsbergis (the first Head of Parliament of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union)
Edit: there were a couple of great additions that I missed, so it would be prudent to include them:
Vincas Kudirka (author of the Lithuanian anthem)
Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (the most renowned Lithuanian painter and composer)
* Mindaugas
* Gediminas
* Algirdas
* Kęstutis
* Vytautas
* Jogaila
* Antanas Smetona
* Martynas Mažvydas
* Adomas Mickevičius
* Vincas Kudirka
* Maironis
* Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis
* Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas (people know them together)
* Jonas Žemaitis
• Mindaugas (our first and only king)
These are our grand dukes :
• Gediminas
• Algirdas
• Kęstutis
• Vytautas The Great
• Jogaila
19th-20th centuries famous figures :
•Vincas Kudirka (he wrote the national anthem)
•Jonas Basanavičius
• Antanas Smetona (the first president of Lithuania, who later became an authoritarian ruler )
V. Landsbergis (he's still alive but he was a really important figure during Lithuania's independence restoration in 1990-91)
I would for sure include Kęstutis and Algirdas
Vincas Kudirka, writer of national anthem
I was told in school that Stanisław August Poniatowski, Tadeusz Kościuszko, Adam Mickiewicz were lithuanians
I think he's perceived fairly well
While he did start the personal union between the two states, and that was a very big mess, we still think of him as a pretty ok dude who was largely overshadowed by Vytautas
P.S. This is just my opinion, I don't speak for every Lithuanian
I would agree with you, but imo they are not as widely known as the others
It's not that clear cut
Tbf, it's different era
Nationalities were more defined but still tricky in case of Poland-Lithuania as the best example would be Narutavičiai (Narutowicz) - one brother became Poland's first president and the other brother was signatory of Lithuania's independence
Yes, it's known that Piłsudski was born in Lithuania and that his heart is burried in Vilnius but he chose Poland
I have no idea who he is
Well there was a nice [comment in thread about May 3rd Constitution] About interwar and Piłsudski
But position of power is too aluring and damning
I'd even consider same mistake (just on smaller scale ofc) to be made in '90s-10s by Poland
> spoke, German and had a German family
Why are you applying today's standards of nationality to 500 years ago
Nah, they just get drunk and then pee everywhere
English is really easy to learn, so it's good it became a universal language, but my god, are some things you can say in one word in lithuanian, super long in english
Exaples:
-nebeprisivalgiuosiuose - inside people that haven't eaten enough,
-bėgiojančių - of people that run (Not runners
Runners - bėgikai, not bėgiojantys),
-nebeprisibėgiojusių - belonging to people that haven't ran enough
There's a lot more words, that use this format, which compiles a sentence into one word
I don't feel safe going back to school because COVID cases are going up again in Lithuania (I'm in gymnasium, which is like high school)
I actually don't even know we're going back to school in the fall, we might continue online learning (I think)
Same here
Well I don't know, but in my eyes, Romania is same, but more corrupt (no offense)
either the [Cathedral] or [Gediminas Castle] (which is only a tower now)
The Gediminas Castle, The Three Crosses, etc
Vilnius has a LOT
My city of Nemenčinė has one of the oldest churches in Lithuania (circa 1387)
Also, it rumored that it's named after Polish travelers asked *Niemna czy nie* (is this the river of Nemunas or not)
“plaktukas” in Lithuanian
Or kūjis is a sledge hammer
Kūjis sounds kinda of tough
plaktukas sounds like a baby hammer
Kūjis for big hammer sounds kind of cool(ū is oo in doom, j is y in yes, i as i in dim, so something like cooyis)
The word for small hammer doesn’t sound cool at all - plaktukas
It’s a diminutive form for the noun made from the verb “plakti” or “to whip” in english
In lithuanian it's either "plaktas", "plaktukas", or "kūjis" depending on the context
It doesn't sound very cool to lithuanians, but perhaps people of other nationalities percieve this word dofferently
In lithuanian its *Plaktukas* literally translated means Whipper / Thrasher
Not very strong sounding name for sure
"Vasara" in lithuanian means "summer" :D
In Westphalia, which direction do phaluses bend
Doesn't "plaktas" just mean "whisked"?
>plaktas
Today I learnt a new word
It does, but in my area, people also use the word as a synonim for "kūjis". It makes sense, plaktukas id a diminutive after all
Good for you
It's probably just a word from my dialect, but it is a word nontheless
Typically I assume they save not much due to still low wages for the most at that age
Also from what I see my fellow age group friends do, they do like to travel so if they save its not long term
Personally (25) I still live in my parent owned flat as they are usually not there for the most of year, but if I rented i could save about 60% or around a 1000 each month
But with no housing costs I save around 1300-1500 a month
Around 500 of savings go to investing and the rest is kept for down payment for my own place, that I plan to put into ~2% savings account every 6 months just to get some extra cash
I do earn above average though and I invest into the stock market, something that only around 2% of locals do in Lithuania
So I would consider myself to be more of an extreme case in saving and earning
Well, if you're in IT it can be 1-2k as you can make 2-3k if you get a job while studying and become senior by 25 which I know a lot of cases of
I also know medicine students that can't save anything at all
Really depends on your path
All the seniors I know do tend to be just above 25 year mark
More like 26-28
Its good for economy though if done properly
Wouldn't change :(

Old people may feel some nostalgia because they were younger back then, but of course very few people would want to live under oppressive and genocidal dictatorship with failing economy
Before 20th century
Kingdom of Lithuania was established in 1253 (later Grand Duchy of Lithuania), it was baptised in 1387, and in 1569 together with Poland it created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
The Commonwealth was partitioned by Russia, Austria and Prussia in late 18th century, majority of Lithuanian areas became part of Russian empire
Russian imperial regime closed university, banned Lithuanian language in public life and even Latin script for Lithuanian language – Lithuanian language was clearly on the brink of extinction in mid 19th century, but the National Revival reversed these trends in late 19th century, allowing for Republic of Lithuania to be established after the WW1
The school teaches quite a lot about this period, and they really shut on Russians in them
Talking about the genocide during the post war time, about partisan fights, what you could and what you couldn't do or say, the collapse of USSR
You know, the stuff that mattered to us
Including the economical problems
And about the nostalgia - older people kind of get nostalgic about their life back then, but mostly only very old people complain about how it was better in the USSR
And they mostly think that because they wouldn't need to choose their jobs, as the state chose it for them
And also because after the collapse of the USSR, the new states had a lot of problems: gangs, corrupt politicians, high crimerate, shitty police, fuel shortages
And because of that they think in the USSR this wouldn't have ever happened and they would have had a better life
I personally didn't learn much about soviet rule from history classes
History classes take history linearly
I dropped history in 11th grade, which means that I ended my "history studies" at around the early soviet union
As for soviet nostalgia
There are certain groups of people for whom it is legitimately worse now, than it was in the union
The reality of a USSR > Capitalist shift is that it's a power shift, and in power shifts you have winners and losers
And the day to day reality, say if you worked in a sausage factory, changed a lot for you
There are also people who didn't really adapt to the capitalist switch, from a mentality viewpoint
Of course taught us, it's part of our history after all (though an unpleasant one
They taught us just as you'd imagine, there was no bias from the teachers (although all of the teachers that I was taught by did say they "didn't prefer" the Soviet rule)
There are some old people here who do feel nostalgic, though I must say it's probably due to the fact they remember themselves as young back in the day
Memories twisted by nostalgia, really
The Baltics before the Soviet occupation were just like any other European countries, so there isn't too much to talk about
I remember our history teacher saying Lithuania's economy was comparable to that of Denmark
Most likely if not for the Soviet occupation, Baltics nowadays would be on par with our friends up north
Hey
Lithuanian here
They taught us that it was absolutely terrible
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Our economy was more agricultural, therefore the soviets didn't need to ship as many foreign workers to fill all the available work spots
Estonia and Latvia were more consumer goods oriented, therefore their factories could sustain more workers than their local populace could fill, so russians/belarussians/ukrainians were relocated to fill those spots
Nature
10m or so outside the path is fine
City, never
Drunk brits on a stagdos pissing on walls is kinda noteworthy enough to be put on news
I am Lithuanian and piss everywhere when I am drinking
Eat, drink, sleep, repeat
The popular vote run off system (the same as France, Poland, Brazil, etc
Many candidates can run in the first round (in 2019 elections there were 9) and if no one gets more than 50% of the votes, the top 2 candidates go into a second round of voting
If a candidate gets more than 60% (this happened in 2009), no second round needed
What is the role of the German president then
I know you have one, but the only German leader seen on the international stage is the chancellor
No pressure, only words now and then
But grandparents and sometimes parents make tiny jokes that if u dont have somebody to share a bed with, its either: youre gay if you are male; youre gonna regret not having kids earlier or be "old hag" if youre female
They dont mean it to be offensive, just reminding that "the clock is ticking and even if u plan on having kids past 30, you still need to find a suitable partner, be in a relationship for preferably years before that
So pick carefuly, but dont pospone it
Lithuanians don't really stereotype people, but people from Vilnius are like more entitled
How dare you attack Vilnius in such manner
Here are 17 reasons why we are better than the rest of the world
Damn, forgot about the mushroom pickers
But you don't have sea
No, we don't wish bad for you
(And Vilnius is pretty nice city, so also no)
It was a joke about how people from vilnius see the world
To be honest you were so exact, that I thinked it was true :D
wait, you don't need a passport or any documents
I'd say it's pretty common all around europe
Very common here (in houses that don't have a dishwasher)
But where do other countries dry their dishes then, if it's not popular everywhere
On a drying rack next to the sink probably
My parents own a meat mallet like that (although it's metal), I think it's still fairly common to have, at least among older people
I sometimes hear a sound from a neighboring apartment that I think is them using a meat mallet
I never pass the opportunity to make a lame joke that they're 'beating their meat' lol
why would you want total darkness
appropriate cycling paths (i'm looking at you, the Netherlands or Denmark)
Acceptance of other sexualities, other races
Free or at least cheaper higher education
Metro lines in Vilnius
Or at least tram services
I think rail infrastructure should be more developed here
However, our City council decided to rely only on buses and trolleybuses by creating exceptional road lines for them
The good part, most of the buses are brand new with wifi, charging sockets, etc
But meh
Metro or tram is way cooler than a fancy bus or trolleybus
And we have terrible traffic jams on-peak hours:)
I'm seriously considering just wearing my mask regardless of if/when corona is eradicated
It has the dual benefit of being health conscious and hiding my ugly face
Same here
Some homophobes are planning a "Family March" this saturday to "protect traditional families". This is in response of the new bill that will hopefully become law very soon about adding gender-neutral civil partnership
So biggots unite against progress, saying it's hurting children and "traditional" families are being attacked
when most of the participants aren't exactly model citizens nor parents
we don't have anti-LGBTQ+ spaces yet but seems like a large portion of the country isn't ready for changes that don't even concern them
Edit: typos
Agree, or at least give us back half of the price of the course of this year (on behalf, EU student in the UK)
same here, the only problem for me is hot weather
Yesterday it was around 25* and I was sweating everywhere, which can get annoying with a mask on
Well I live in a pretty old city
(Since 1300) some of the infrastructure in the city center is pretty rough but I like it this way
I would say the energy cost of heating pre WW2 buildings is pretty high here
(even with municipal heating systems) Other than that no
I think it’s all a benefit
The history and the rundown parts give the city an identity and character
Maybe another problem is lack of handicap access
If your handicap the old city is not your friend at times
Not sure if I would say describes but no doubt the most well known is [3 milijonai by Mikutavičius] A song made for [200 Sydney Olympics] And *everyone* knows this song
There's a case to be made that more people know lyrics to this song than the anthem
Also, when I was in this guy's concert of course the song was played the last one and of course everyone stood up to sing it together, as one should do
Basketball anthem - 3 milijonai by Marijonas Mikutavicius
Erika slaps hard tho
What would happen if someone in Germany heard you listen to it
My first thought was ['Ant Kalno Mūrai'] but 3 milijonai is definitely up there
In 2019 I sometimes had a proper meal in the morning and most of the time at dinner
But given the pandemic and working from home, I have more than enough time to sleep and cook during workdays
A LOT of people might disagree with me, but its probably Vilnius
Its just completely different from any other Lithuanian city
It has a lot of different cultures mixed together, which other cities lack
Vilnius had been Polish, Russian AND Lithuanian
The most typical one though is imo Šiauliai, even though i am not sure
Vilnius has many Slavic vibes and Klaipėda until 1920 was ultimately German, yet now a large Russian community
&#x200B;
Kaunas is the most Lithuanian city
Oh wait i just realised that i am completely wrong
I forgot about Visaginas, whoose population mostly speaks russian
It is sad how no one talks about the Baltic languages
We also agree on this one for you
I would say it'd be not helping Novgorod fight Muscovy
Had we helped out "the threat from the east" would not have existed
Or just anything Swedish in General
Jag alskar dig Sverige

I don't even care about the dark, because I'm used to it
I take vitamin D every day
It helps
It's just something you get used to, makes you appreciate the summer more
And thats what we do :)
Always liked Manchester United’s logo, the colors especially
Ah yes, a New FM project
[Probably this
] It's a band from Vilnius so it would be fitting
It's a calm and happy raggae song that simply has a really good vibe going on
Gdańsk is basically the inspiration for Novigrad (the witcher 3), so the music from there would probably be fitting
Huh, we say the same with "boba" but it's a rude word for women in general, "when the *woman* falls out it's lighter for the carriage" has a very different message :D
Supermamytės ( super mamas in demunitive)
I think that the name was given due to the forum 'super mama' (super momma) where bunch of helicopter mommas clicked and started various treads on child rearing / parenting /medicating naturally /etc
I once went in there for a recipe I found and wanted to try out, and somehow found myself on an anti-vax post
Yeah
It's wild
Vienas šimtas vienas, vienas šimtas du, vienas šimtas trys

Šimtas vienas, šimtas du, šimtas trys

How is it Germanized
if you would count or say numbers in German, or similar to German, that would count as Germanized
I totally forgot that you started using the Czech language properly, only recently
I would say you WERE Germanized, but got your Czech pride back
Yeah, but you speak the Slavic language
Which sounds a bit like Russian/Polish/Slovakian/Croatian/etc
It's not like when you speak everyone thinks that you Germanized Czechs
It just sounds Slavic, not germanic at
STEM, medicine
Main and highest paid professions are (lowest to highest paid:
Engineer
Doctor
IT (any field)
Freshly cooked starting wage is about 900/m, well above national average
Within 5 years ine can expect to earn 1300-1600 eur/m on average
With such wages one can afford to loan for a house, a new car and to travel at least once a year
Mathematicians (especially statistics, data) can earn as much if not more i guess
I've read an article in Lithuanian about a scholar, former editor, then managing director of a literary magazine, who left his stressful and thankless job in literature and management, and went to trade school to train as a welder
He got some practice on a low-paid internship, developed his skills,  and now has inner peace, a job he enjoys with people he likes, and easy employment prospects with good pay
The way he puts it, walk up to any construction site, find the manager, ask him if he needs welders, put down a few seams to show what you can do, and you're hired
There are many museums, but there's a lot of competition to get positions in them, and even in Germany they're not really paying a decent wage
For a senior software engineer (~8 years of experience) the average is around 3000€ per month net, but there are many opportunities to earn significantly more by working remotely
that's pretty popular here too
Nobody does
No, but again it's probably possible to buy it here
Oh God the last time I used these was in elementary school
Just that picture brings back memories
Electric boogaloo
I feel like our local type of [kebabs] is the staple drunk food here
McDonald's or Hesburger (a similar burger chain with more mayo) would be another popular choice, since not that many other places are open at night
I don't even know what I would choose, as I feel like it's been several years since I've been in this kind of situation
I guess it's a combination of the pandemic and everyone turning 30 around me and having kids, hence bar meetups switched to walks in the park
McDonald's is not a messy food
I rather go to see my old Turkish friends, as they know some kind of secret recipes to make gorgeous, tasty as heaven kebabs
God bless Turkey for its kebabs and decent barbers
Gediminas tower obviously
Even though it defines the capital more than the whole country
Otherwise it just could be the houndreds of pretty churches
Definitely Gediminas Castle
tower
Other than that, only two come in mind, the TV tower and Trakai castle (have fun, this one's an actual castle
The Gediminas Castle
It's what's left of what used to be a pretty big castle in Vilnius
For Lithuania it would be [Gedimino bokštas ]
I agree with [Gediminas tower] more so defining the capital
The one for the whole country would be [Trakai castle] for me
The first thing that I think of when remembering Riga is the [House of the Blackheads] But maybe it's not common to think of it as a defining building, I just really liked it
I have never seen a bike like a Christiana one
That seems so cool, is it difficult to steer
Now majority of Cyprus is controlled by RoC government, so it is free now as well
By my calculations the next approach of Catalan Independence should be on the 20th of July 2043 and last an entire 40
6 nanoseconds
I'd say if things start heating up towards that date, don't listen to people who tell you not to celebrate prematurely, because you might just miss it entirely
Basically the same for all three of the Baltics
~30% of Lithuania was also occupied during interbellum and we count it as free here
I don't see legit reason why occupation of Northern Cyprus makes whole Cyprus as not 'free'.
Oh, yeah, forgot about that
Bratislava

They have like breaks where they congregate for a chat and a smoke, dozens of guys dressed exactly the same way, scouting the crowd for easy marks
I ask for the cheapest and I couldn’t care what the person serving thinks
IPA classification is [ɣ] (hard) or [ɣʲ] (soft)
[ɣ] is a Velar Fricative just like [x], and both are very similar sounds
If you mean the name of the letter it's <ha> (short a), but some people say <haš>.
Geographically
Russia
Turkey
In European union sense
None
My hill is human rights and ecology thankfully countries in European union ensures that everyone is treated equally (or -ish, I know that there is knicks and hickups but we are trying) and we try to lessen our impact on the planet
Nope, not even a short mention anywhere
Brazil is occasionally mentioned, but I guess in this case New Zealand overshadowed it
Laws here sound like they are in most states in usa, but are actually enforced and there is no gun cult
Note: most gun owners and enthusiasts military and police personel, former or still active
It makes sense cause they automatically have gun permits, have to live by higher moral standards, are extremely trusted by the public
To own a gun: psychological evaluation, passed gun use training, guaranteed place to store
Only pistols and non-automatic guns are allowed
Guns must be stored in a metal or specialized safe
Guns are only allowed to be carried consealed
Displaying gun will get you arrested
You can only show your gun if you are in a dangerous situation and are willing to use it
Shooting is only legal in self defense or defense of others, OR in shooting ranges (military and police personel can use their respective facilities, there are few private ranges too)
Every gun is etched, inspected and approved by lithuanian gun foundry, a gun is registered, tied to the owner
Buying bullets is also registered i think
Procedures are the same for everyone
Self defense is logical
Threat of extreme harm or death - blast away
Shooting with intention to kill is illegal
Though if a person is shot without intention to kill but still dies as a result - its his own fault
I heard of one instance when a drunk person (mildly drunk) shot a robber
A court was held but he was justified, because person's right to self defense is above the law forbidding drunken carry and use of weapons
The self-defence laws in Lithuania differ depending whether you’re  protecting your property or yourself in public
Certain items, like clubs are legal to have on your property, but you can’t have them on you or in your car if you or your vehicle are not on your property, if caught the items will be confiscated and you will be prosecuted accordingly
All you can really have on your person in public without having a special license is pepper spray
Edit: also as far as I know, it is possible to carry a concealed weapon if you have a specific licence for that, but for example if you have the gun in your car with you, it has to be out of reach, so if you’re driving, you can’t have it in the glovebox, it should be in the boot, to reduce spontaneous use
And if you have a gun in your home it has to be in a safe etc etc
The LGF (Lietuvos Ginklų Fondas - Lithuanian Weaponry Fund) was closed/reorganized in 2020
They don't sell weapons to the public or register guns anymore, now any gun store can sell all legal firearms to the public and do the same functions
Side note, carrying while below a certain amount of promiles/BAC is still legal but its pretty low
Then once you go above that limit its a fine, and once you go further and further beyond the limit the punishments become more serious
Also this might be the court case you are thinking of:  A man shot 4 unarmed attackers while not sober, one of them died, and it was ruled justified self defense
> Pažymeta, kad neblaivus asmuo nepraranda teises gintis
and
> Teismas pažymi, kad asmuo turi teise i butinaja ginti
Šia teise jis gali igyvendinti neatsižvelgdamas i tai, ar galejo išvengti kesinimosi arba kreiptis pagalbos i kitus asmenis ar valdžios institucijas
N. M. gindamasis nuo pavojingo kesinimosi neperženge butinosios ginties ribu, todel, remianti BK 28 str
nuostatomis, jis neturi atsakyti pagal baudžiamaji istatyma
Definitely not true, the law allows you to carry a concealed firearm on your body for the purpose of self-defense
If you have the permit you may have it on your body, for example in a holster hidden from view, as you drive
You may also have it loaded and ready for self-defense while at home - depending on your living arrangements
If you live alone for example, you can your pistol in your nightstand in case of a home invasion
If you have kids or a partner then a different setup would probably be better
But you absolutely can have a firearm on you for the purpose of self defense
Here is a case I linked elsewhere on this thread:  A man shot 4 unarmed attackers while not sober, one of them died, and it was ruled justified self defense
>  Pažymeta, kad neblaivus asmuo nepraranda teises gintis
and
>  Teismas pažymi, kad asmuo turi teise i butinaja ginti
Šia teise jis gali igyvendinti neatsižvelgdamas i tai, ar galejo išvengti kesinimosi arba kreiptis pagalbos i kitus asmenis ar valdžios institucijas
N. M. gindamasis nuo pavojingo kesinimosi neperženge butinosios ginties ribu, todel, remianti BK 28 str
nuostatomis, jis neturi atsakyti pagal baudžiamaji istatyma
I didn’t state anywhere that there is no legal way to have a gun on your person now, did I.
Of course you can have a gun for self-defence, but it is limited to licence holders only, not every looney that spontaneously decides to get one in a Walmart
Having any type of weapon without a licence is highly illegal, be it a gun or a metal club
Even a metal BB gun isn’t allowed without a licence, having a kitchen knife in your pocket without good reason can too get you arrested
The only thing you can carry for self-defence without a specific license is pepper spray
Now how easy it is to get a licence, is another matter, technically, you need to undergo various tests, a medical examination, a psychiatric assessment, but from the gossip it seams pretty easy to achieve
All in all, the vast majority of people that actually have licences to have guns seem to be hunters
However, I might not be the best intel on this, as  getting attacked in public or on my property is not something I worry about
It's not hard at all in Lithuania and gun laws have been progressively relaxed since 1996/1997
Anyone with a clean record can take a class and pass it and get the permit
Usually it takes a month or two, but only a week of actually doing stuff like attending the class a few times a week, taking the test, going to your doctor, and so on
The rest is waiting as the police can take up to 30 days to issue your permit once you submit all your information
I don't think getting attacked in public or private in Lithuania is likely either, but I've seen the pictures from January 13th, 1991
For our international friends thats when Soviet soldiers and tanked murdered unarmed Lithuanian citizens
To those that think it could never happen again, look at eastern Ukraine and Crimea
Have you ever thought about what you would do if anything were to happen again
Of course I don't think a pistol is going to do much against a tank
But it's better than nothing for a civilian trying to escape a warzone, like Ukraine
Also, Lithuania has about 100k gun owners and about 30k are hunters, and 30k are self defense permit holders, the others would fall into other categories like sport shooting and so on
Here is a Lithuanian gun store's page with more info:
There is regular police and MP
Police does police stuff and MP does the same just with military/soldier related stuff
When times are tough (now), MP works as backup police force, along with volunteer military force and military guild/volunteers "šauliai"
When police need backup for patroling, etc, the Public Security Force (gendarmerie in everything, but not the name) assist them
They are located only in largest cities though, and the countryside only sees the police
Šauliai can be translated to paramilitary or militia, and volunteer military force is an equivalent of American National Guard
We just skip a bunch, we learn the medieval times where we were a superpower in Europe (~1300) and the we just jump straight to The occupational years courtesy of Russia and then back to the first spoken Lithuanian words
It’s really confusing ._.
A lot of people mated together to produce more people
You finish High-school (Abitura) when you're 18-19, and do uni afterwards
Some people have a gap year, others have to do military service since we have mandatory conscription
In Lithuania there are 12 years, if you started school at the age of 6 you finish the year you turn 18 + there is mandatory year of kindergarten before school where you learn to read
Panevėžys = pane (an archaic way of saying 'Pone' = sir) + vėžys (crayfish)
The legend goes, that a woman was washing her clothes in the river when a crayfish gripped onto her hand
She got scared, saw a man walking by and started screaming 'PANE, VĖŽYS
' and that's how the name came to be
Well at least that's the legend, the name actually just comes from the river Nevėžis which the city is situated on
I live in Punskas
The name is derived from the lake Punia in this town and Punia is derived from Pūna, which means "(that thing) is rotting".
That's such a weird one
Interesting
I always thought that the Ottomans officially called it Istanbul all along
Does anyone actually call it "Baden-Baden" in everyday speech or does everyone just use "Baden"?
Headlandheadland

Oh, I see
Makes sense, then
Mur mur
Murkti - to purr
Murklė - a synonims for cat, literally means "the one who purrs"
So, cats in Finland are beyblades
Vilnius University
'Give me a drink' in bar scenes
Who orders like that
You'll get a glass of water here if you say that
Fuel running out while driving somewhere far away
We have fuel gauges in all cars, so it doesn't happen
Also lots of petrol stations all over the place
Getting lost in a forest is somewhat understandable, we have some big forests, but then most of them have 4G reception
As it recently turned out, we had a secret CIA prison in Lithuania, right next to the capital city
The building used to be a horse riding school with a huge indoor riding arena, so nobody really suspected various cars and trucks coming and going
I've driven all the way across Czech Republic and back a couple weeks ago, I'd say your highways are pretty good
Smaller roads suck, but still not too bad
One Lithuanian truck driver has a youtube channel, posts daily videos about his work
In the last season he got to drive from Lisbon to Skarsvåg (the northernmost town in Norway) and back, several times
It was quite interesting
You actually have quite a few marching bands, they're just not as popular as in the US
I used to play in a band in Lithuania, we've traveled around Europe to various orchestra events, including a few in Poland
Obviously they're nowhere near as popular as in the US, though
He could say "kilometres" but then americans would complain :)
So it is indeed a get out of jail card for those rich enough
Someone with no money couldn't pay the bail and wait for the trial out of jail
Here we use various methods to make sure that they don't get away
Some will be kept in jail, if they have a history of running away or if their crime is particularly serious
In some cases the person's passport will be taken, a written promise to not leave could be signed
Some are placed under house arrest, so they can stay at home but can't leave
Sometimes it's just a curfew, where they must return home before 10pm or whatever and check in
In some cases they must come to the police office to check in every day
Normally a guarantor is needed, if the person wants to stay out of jail until the trial
It's usually the suspect's parent, friend or spouse
The guarantor is prosecuted if the suspect runs away
What about drug dealers, thieves and such, who have a lot of unaccounted income
Oh great, so you can go in debt too
Oh yes they would
(In my experience
) I lived in Barcelona for years
Learned castillano, spoke it daily
It wasn’t good enough for many Catalans
They would still speak to me in Catalan and refuse to speak Spanish
Not all but some
I think someone here mentioned that Latvian bottles work in Lithuania even though they don't (?) have a deposit system, lol
Makes sense if the barcodes match
IIRC Apple chooses to pay fines than rather change their chargers
Also USB-C and USB micro are different
[Potato - Meat dumplings] known as Cepleinai
It's really fatty but damn good
You can only have one and be full
Fun fact is that the name derives from the word Cepelinas(Zeppelin), becouse of their shape
Well, if a dumpling is just dough wrapped around a filling, then our “Kibinai” should be good
It’s just meat, covered by a THICC layer of dough and cooked, when you bite in, all of the meat juices come out
This is traditionally served with some kind of vegetable broth
Though you can eat it alone
Apart from cepelinai which were mentioned, we also have virtinukai (pierogi) and koldūnai (pelmeni)
Can't beat some good virtinukai with porcini mushroom and onion filling
Cepelinai - if you ever go to Lithuania, go to a traditional food restaraunt and try it
on an aesthetic level, I would
Simply because I like designs that are in unison
Otherwise, I've no idea
Since that's a lot of political implications and I'm wholeheartedly unqualified to make a judgement
I don't mind to be honest
I'm certain some nationalistic people will scream "BUT MUH IDENTITY
" when in reality no one really cares
Lithuanian one
It is much more cool to have a passport that only 3 million people have, not 513 million
Passport is a symbol of sovereignity, EU is not a country and EU citizenship is only complimentary to national one
Actually no Soviet Block countries were called 'Republic of X'.
aand Ireland is 'Republic of Ireland'.
Yeah, but there were no 'Republics of X' in the Eastern block and plenty of Western democracies like Republic of Austria, Republic of Cyprus, Republic of Finland, or Republic of Malta
Our prime minister and the whole parliament
Edit: Lithuania
The rock paper scissors game
In Lithuania instead of rock we use a well
Scissors get thrown in it and with paper you cover the well
Does your country also use other things when playing this game
Maybe you don’t even have this game
What I'm also curious about is why we Lithuanians say *vaskiči* (at least in my neighborhood) when playing the game, instead of *šulinys, popierius, žirklės* ('well, paper, scissors')
It doesn't mean anything in Lithuanian, so I always thought maybe it comes from Russian or Polish, but I'm not sure since I don't speak either
Putin once said that there are only 1 million of Lithuanians and that million is already leaving the country
He said that we're a Balkan country and we're responsible for the Yugoslavian wars
I'm sure you know who said it
Oh god that shitshow with children
Norway doesn't let people treat children like garbage
KIDNAPPERS REEEEEEEEEE
I'm ashamed
And then one day you'll check out Japanese engineering
They just don't break down, so the repair prices don't matter
No, because the country is the Lithuanian nation state
Lithuanian citizens can vote in presidential, parliamentary, EP, elections and referenda no matter where they live
By the way, 2020 Lithuanian general election even had a diaspora electoral district which was won by the leader of liberal party
All residents regardless of citizenship can vote in municipal elections and I support expanding their powers
Democracy is about representing publics voice
If one doesnt live there, why would one want to be represented in things irrelevant in ones life
Permanent residents, who are legal and adapted to culture, language and are functional members of society must be able to vote
Emigrants, if they live away for more than 1 full term of parliament, should not be able to vote
I don't know much since I didn't live in that period of time, but the one thing that stuck to me the most is the stealing and corruption
For example, if you were to steal from your job, that'd be considered normal
Also, if you wanted to get better care form doctors you had to slip them some money, it still happens sometimes
I speak 3 language (Lithuanian, English, Russian) yet as a waitress I had to resort to lots of handsigns and drawing pictures (if I am a tourist I usually just use phone to find pictures or Google translate stuff)
Especially with polish folk because their language is waaay different than Russian and not many realises that
However if all involved parties seeks understanding communication is indeed possible
Speaking only about LT/PL and LT/LV borders:
Yes, it is painless
I have never been stopped on these borders
There are some old crossings with checkpoint remnants - there are some speed limits, but overall there are no slowing down to 30 km/h.
It has been open since 2007 and I hasn't changed much, only some more cross-border roads have been reconstructed or built
Sometimes there are patrols of border officers on major road crossings, usually for ambushing some people traffickers or other criminals
It eases travelling a lot  – there's no point in having border controls inside of EU
We still have leftover border control buildings from soviet times, so you would see that you're crossing the border(differently from lets say France-Belgium, where in the middle of the city there is just a drawn line for people to know and thats it)
But those buildings now are mainly abandoned, only few are used for border police to do bigger bus and import/export checks
And it is a slowing down zone and you might get pulled over if you look suspicious

23C is warm gold ideal
Old houses that use coal or wood heaters temperature cannot be controlled very well, and house can heat up to 26C.
New houses usually run on "eco" and keep temp around 21-23C. Enough for walking in shorts, barefoot and tshirt
Nope, Moldova is the name of the region of Romania and the separate country, Moldavia is the Latinized name of said region and the former official name of said country
I live in the capital, Vilnius
It's not an easy question to answer, since my experiences might not reflect the situation objectively
But personally while I'm a woman and I feel better walking alone in daylight than nighttime by default, I've never been hurt, robbed or talked to by someone who seemed dangerous at night
Maybe a few drunks or a group of guys making me uncomfortable by asking for my number and wanting to know if I have a boyfriend, but that normally happens in daytime
My female friends have had the same experience, and I've never known anyone personally who got robbed
However, I know several men and one woman who got beaten up or with whom others wanted to start a fight, but I don't think it's related to the time of the day
All of these people I know either were metalheads, punks, or had longer hair (as guys)
Although to be fair I haven't heard of anything like that in the last 10 years
Either times are changing, or it's because my friends are turning 30 and don't look that much out of the ordinary anymore
Other groups of people that I've heard getting beaten up are black people and openly gay guys
The country is still pretty backwards when it comes to respecting those who are different than the majority
600k is a town in Germany
We have some that are very similar(basically the same) to other instruments that our neighbours have (like [kanklės] or [skudučiai] but the only instrument that is really unique to Lithuania is probably [skrabalai]
I was today years old when I found out that not only Lithuania have it considered as our national instrument
It's called kanklės
“ant” (on something)

My boyfriend is Dutch and I'm Lithuanian
There aren't any huge cultural differences, but there have been some things I noticed about the Dutch:
* They like to freeze their bread
I like nice bread so I thought I could never do this, but I admit to starting doing it while I was living in NL
Now that I'm back in LT though I don't do it anymore, I can have my favourite bread again, I can't freeze it
* They can be very direct, while we might leave some things unsaid
There was a lot to learn for the both of us while learning to communicate in the relationship due to this, but it also helped us grow
I really appreciate the directness in a lot of cases, but sometimes it might feel a little rude to someone from a more indirect/reserved culture
Just like indirectness probably feels insincere to the Dutch
Any stereotype that assumes something is universally true in the continent is highly likely to be bullshit
But that's what some/lots of Eastern Europeans say
Yes, some speak French, some speak German and some speak Java

a really nice mansion, seriously that is a shit ton of money, I was surprised to see some of the replies here
Vilnius: a 70 m^2 apartment in the very heart of the old town, or a 130 m^2 apartment in renovated or recently constructed buildings in the prestigious neighborhoods, or a 250 m^2 house on a 9 a plot in a nice neighborhood, or a 400 m^2 house in the suburbs

A roller coaster, designed to kill it's passengers, called the [Euthanasia Coaster]
Edit: it's actually a hypothetical design with a scale model but it got a lot of attention from the media for it's concept of ending lives
The euthanasia coaster
Not well known, but it's all I can think of
It is a roller coaster designed by Julionas Urbonas that is designed to kill people without damaging the roller coaster itself
There's a video about it
>fully automatic rifle
First fully automatic rifle was invented by the Italians
What you did was invent the first succesful assault rifle in StG-44 and the first succesful submachine gun in MP 18
Bro, E = mc^2 is not an invention, it's a discovery
It's like saying Newton invented apples falling from trees
[Relevant scene from the Sopranos]
I didn't say machine-gun I said sub-machine gun, which is a bit of misnomer
I like the german term maschinenpistole a lot better, which is descriptive, because a submachine gun is a gun that is capable of shooting pistol caliber bullets in full auto
The difference between a fully automatic rifle(AKA battle rifle) and an assault rifle are mainly in the caliber(assault rifles use a smaller caliber) and thus their roles in combat
Pretty much all of the most famous automatic rifles(AK, AR-15 and various others) are assault rifles
AK-47 was actually heavily influenced by the StG-44
Not necessarily
I would make the distinction that "discoveries" are something that independently exist whether their "discoverers" are there or not, i.e something that is ''natural''. Hydrogen is made of a proton and an electron independently whether something is there to ''observe'' them or to ''find'' them as such
Invention has an ''unnatural'' connotation to it, i.e it has an element of chance
Could the spoon be ''discovered'' by some aliens in a far away galaxy
Sure, but it's not a certainty
What would the chance be for a proton and attracted to an electron via the coulomb force if noone in the universe found out this relationship
100%.
What algorithm are we talking about here
If you misspoke and meant  ''formula'' then it's also false
He discovered that the inertia of an object is directly proportional to its energy content, with the proportionality factor being 1/c^2, where c is the speed of light
His genious was in discovering the relationship, not the formula(although he did that by manipulating other relationships)
Anyone at least somewhat compentent in highschool physics could write down the formula if he knew the relationship
Probably the most well known
I was referring more to the concept of the "assault weapon" using an intermediary rifle cartridge
Quotes from wikipedia: "On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR
[14] The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own,[10][11] to replace the PPSh-41 submachine guns and outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army
[15]"
and
"The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations
"Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG 44
"[21] Kalashnikov's team had access to these weapons and had no need to "reinvent the wheel"."
Could be used as both I guess
[FG-42] is also a good example
Aweful thing
Bro that was the height of german weapons engineering and miles ahead from anything everyone else had
Its downfall was that it was too expensive, too complicated and wehrmacht didn't really need it
It was only used by luftwaffe paratroopers(fallschirmjäger)
Yes, garlic sauce and (extra) ketchup is usually served alongside the pizza in most places, and many people make use of both
Mmmm garlic sauce is the best
pizza with ketchup
yes
No, there's usually tomato sauce, my mistake
Ketchup is more expensive than a tube of concentrated tomato paste and a packet of dry basil
That is literally healthier and more flavorsome than ketchup
There are also canned tomatoes with basil, that are much cheaper than ketchup
Use of ketchup is a matter of culinary ignorance
Nothing else
Brother latvian folk song:
Vilki - Tumšis bija, gaišis tapa
Song about burning russian castles and reclaiming the stolen fatherland
The fact that a lot of jewish people, that stemmed from israel, came back to israel after WW2, could also be impactful culturally
I said the jews that *stemmed* from israel came back
They might've migrated, had children, maybe even grand children and returned with their entire families
Besides, you know what I mean
Lots of jewish people returned to israel after WW2
K, dude
It doesn't change anything
A lot of jews *went to* israel if you want to cling to the exact phrasing, after WW2
Did a cultural change happen
Yes
Did they return
Did they go there
Yes
Would it affect the cultural change, if they returned, not went back, after living a few hundred years in europe
Doesn't matter, wheter they returned, or went there
Either way, a cultural change would've happened
We're not talking about how, or which culture change happened, but if it happened and the answer is yes, it did
Soviet aggression of 1991 January
We had already declared independence, but Gorbachev despised that idea and sent Soviet troops to our capital Vilnius to take over the TV tower and parliament
On the night of January 12th-13th, they started with the TV tower takeover
Thousands of unarmed civilians gathered around it and basically formed a human barricade
The Soviets didn't care and either crushed people with tanks/shot at completely unarmed people just to get through
14 deaths and a few hundred severe injuries later, they ended up taking it over
Unmarried lmao
Gal labiau unarmed
Motherfucking autocorrect :DDDD

We have these as well, but only people who thoroughly follow superstitions are russians :)

I am so confused right now
Folders, colors
what
You use folders
We don't have folders and textbooks are random colors (preferably blank colors, bought from MAXIMA)
Because all textbooks looked the same, I started writing subject names on upper textbook part, so I wouldn't have to take it all out just to read the subject name in small text
No we don't I just wrote colours that I would use if we used folders lmao
It has a bunch of dumbass politicians who keep fucking up our country
Definitely Klaipėda city, Western Lithuania in general also
I live in the capital, Vilnius
It doesn't stay that cold all winter here, but it's not unusual to get a couple of weeks of -20°C. Although even in those periods -20°C and colder is usually night or early morning time temperature, in the day it's more often a few degrees warmer
It all depends on the wind really
If it's -20°C and no wind it's not bad, but if it's windy and -13°C I just wanna stay home
If I drive somewhere from door to door I might not wear extra layers, just jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, scarf and a coat, but it's one of those long warm puffer coats, with feathers inside
If I'm walking somewhere for more than 5 minutes I'll wear thick tights under my jeans or wear two pairs of pants
I also always wear leather winter shoes with fur on the inside or mountain shoes
Hat or hood is necessary, gloves as well, unless maybe if you're gonna keep your hands in your coat pockets at all times
Stuff runs more or less normally, but school might get cancelled (before the pandemic)
At least 10+ years ago kids in elementary school were able to stay home if it's -20°C and older kids could do so if it's -25°C.
I don't know much about cars, but mine doesn't have a problem starting up
It's more so snow that I have trouble with
It's good to have an all-wheel drive car, and mine is only 2-wheel (I hope I'm using the right terminology), so I get stuck navigating apartment building parking lots sometimes and have to be pushed
Lithuania here
I work in an international company, but our lithuanian team still writes everything in english
The problem with lithuanian terms is that most of the times they sound very stupid and a lot of the terms dont even have translations
CS students especially feel this when writing their graduation papers
We also tend to "lithuanize" some words from English to make it sound legit in a Lithuanian sentence
For instance the word "Paste it" (copy/paste) in lithuanian is "įklijuok", but programmers tend to say "įpasteink" like "į-PASTE-ink", which is not a real word, but we understand its meaning (the last part might have been off topic, but i thought it was interesting :))
English
If code has both English and another language then it doesn't make sense
It's probably the most competitive in terms of price, and it's generally viewed as a better employer than other chains
Limited brands (you can't find some that you can find in other supermarkets) still it is the best option when comparing prices and the quality
I mean the quality is great
I shop almost all groceries there and only a few products that I buy elsewhere (dairy products, cleaning supplies, beer and some other)
People used to joke about it when it just came to Lithuania, but it is all over now I think
I myself didn't like Lidl at start because I could not find the groceries I am used to buying
It's cheaper and people like Lidl
Of course, though it's rarer to see that between teenagers after puberty kicks in
I myself had a lot of girl friends when I was a boy
You would just basically befriend everyone who was hanging out in the yard of your apartment block, and there were a lot of kids there
We also have a strong bond with all our classmates, don't know how it is in other countries, but we basically stay in the same class with the same people from the age of 6 to 18, so naturally, they become sort of like your family
When puberty kicks in though, it gets more complicated
You start seeing them as more than just another human being, you start getting attracted to them, or they may start getting attracted to you, and even if both sides aren't interested in each other that way, there will always be annoying pricks that start spreading gossip that you're dating this girl if you hang out with her
Things change again when the teenage years are over and you become more mature
Then it's very common to have friends of all genders and nobody bats an eye
"Alio, klausau" "Hello, (I'm) listening". Alio isn't an exact translation of the word Hello, just more of Allo (I don't know if it's ana ctual word, sorry)
Sometimes there's no "Alio", sometimes just "Alio".
the name was first mentioned in 1009
Lithuania is one of the oldest countries being first know about somewhere in 1009
Most people here are paractical and own estate cars or suv
Those can fit most large purchases
Hardware stores:
Every time you buy or order online, there is an option to have the items delivered to you
You can choose between courier company and the shop itself
If the total price of purchase is about at least 100 eur, delivery will likely be free
Furniture shops:
Delivery always included unless stated otherwise
Delivery includes getting the piece into the living space
Costs about 6 eur per 1 building level required to lift up, delivery itself is free
Assembly is often recommended, some times free
If all that doesnt suffice: you can rent a loading van, and most gas stations offer trailer rental
Or theres always that one friend of a friend who knows, does or has the stuff that you desperately need and somehow cooperate together to get it done for smth symbolic like a bottle or just a thank you
I've never had to transport anything so big that it wouldn't fit in the back of my car with the seats down, but my first choice would probably be using a carsharing service
They have some vans parked at popular DIY/furniture shops, you can use an app to open the car doors and to pay for using it
> From a cost perspective it is much cheaper to just rent a van whenever you need to transport something bulky yourself
This is entirely based on your circumstances and where you live and how you live
Really
She never said that to me :(
Home economics lessons were(still are
) Gendered in Lithuania, so it's mainly girls who learn to cook (while boys learn wood carving and other useless things)
Some schools let you choose the subject you're placed in (and that's usually followed by bullying if you choose the "wrong" class for your gender, sometimes even by the staff)
Yeah
Usually half of the class goes off to woodworking classes, the other half to cooking
When the second half of the school year comes, the groups switch places
I really liked these classes just because of how creative you can get with your projects
And, in case of the cooking classes, you can eat them afterwards
Brilliant
Are religion classes mandatory in Poland or something
Ah, so they're not really mandatory if your family isn't from the believer side
That's neat
Similar to Lithuania, here you can choose either religion (Catholicism) or ethics-psychology lessons
They have right to do so, but it would be nice for them to learn it
they should know the basics, but lithuanian is pretty damn hard, even for a native speaker so i understand them
I have yet to see such person
Hello
Nice to meet you
I prefer english language to lithuanian
Flair checks out
But i never saw you so my argument still stands
My parents are really good friends with our Russian neighbours :)
My parents have been living in their apartment building for 30 years and so have most of their neighbors, so they know each other and their names
They regularly chat with a few of them and have been on a skiing trip with one,  but I wouldn't say that they're good friends with any of the neighbors, nor do they hang out regularly
There are 20 apartments in their entrance so I think it kinda makes sense to get to know everyone at least slightly over 30 years
Me on the other hand, I've been in my building for a couple of years and I don't know anyone except my childhood friend's parents
The building has something like 80 apartments so it's hard to know everyone, but people do say 'good morning' in the elevator if they're in a good mood
There are a few very friendly neighbors who start small talk
When I lived in flats [Khrushchyovkas] I knew some neighbors just because we went trick or treating in February (a tradition, and easy, but risky way to get some money and treats)
When I moved to house, I started to know neighbors, but less than flats
Hmmmmmmmmmmm
Mayyyyyyyybe
what's a commute
15min walk or 3min on a bus
I prefer walking though
k I google searched it
I wasn't sarcastic tho
Wolfgang just sounds really cool to me
Also because Mozart is one of my favourite composers
Leyla, Athena, Cassandra, Mark, Nyx
All of them are really strong and not related to plants or hope (pretty common theme in my country
Some of the scientists says, that one of the most popular name is literally a shortened form of "bread")
I like the shortened version of the female russian name Tatjana (Tanya)
When it comes to male names I like both german Adolf and old greek Astolfo
Fun fact about the name Audra - when it's a given name, it changes inflection
It's also an old French name
You may have heard the more popular name Audrey, comes from the French Audra
Not country, but city
We (Memel) defended ourselves with throwing cheese at swedish
Grand duke of GDL also *claimed* the title of Russia (Unitors of Rus' lands)
Contemporary Republic of Lithuania was established not in 1990, but on 16th February, 1918
After the Soviet occupation in 1940, many Lithuanian embassies kept on working, but most of them were eventually closed by Nazis or after the Soviet pressure
However, embassies in the USA, UK, France and the Holly See kept working without interruptions until restoration of independence in 1990
Lithuanian guerrillas who fought against Soviets are considered legit military veterans these days
Poland-Lithuania ;)
I know Samogitian (technically a dialect, but also has a collection of people who want it to be classified as a language) and the Samogitian wiki is really oddly political sometimes, for example the entry about the falklands basically used to say that it's rightful argentinian land under British occupation, even uses the Spanish name for the island
It's really odd
Lithuanian in famous people youtube vids
Muon keista buva sužinuot kad žėmaitiu vėkėpedėjė yr tuoke

no obviously not, hot takes on wikipedia are usually edited out immediately, but due to the small number of speakers that take was there for a while
this was like half a decade ago, you've got the memory of an elephant
no, I checked the article before I commented, it was fine
My god he did change it :D, now it says that the falklands are to the east of Britain
> It was
> i rītus nū Argentėnas, prīgol Britanėjē
and it should remain that, the political comments in the article I mentioned was from years ago, not the current entry :D
> (e: I moved (renamed) it to Falklanda salas and reordered the lede)
that's more reasonable since most people would know it by it's english name
There's another slight hint of politics, it refers to the 2 main islands by their spanish names (but I can't be bothered to look up their english equivalents, or at least I'm assuming that "Soledada" and "Gran Malvėnas" aren't english)
Another issue it the sources, the first source is literally a webpage from argentinian military (it's titled as "why the Islas Malvinas should belong to Argentina")
There's probably more issues, I'd fix them I cared enough (or knew how to edit wiki pages)
dude, I only know how to read Samogitian, I don't know how to spell it
They don't teach that in school
> Malvėnū salas sosided ėš 2 dėdliū salū (Soledada ėr Gran Malvėnas) ė tepuogė da aple 700 salieliu
Falklandū salas sosided ėš 2 dėdliū salū ė tepuogė da aple 700 salieliu
you can change it to that and it'd be correct, but that's as far as my knowledge of samogitian grammar goes
Plus waiters in Bavarian-themed pubs
I've seen Lederhosen within 300 metres from the Urania clock on Alexanderplatz
Never knew this concert existed
Don't think anyone's watching it here
That's quite funny actually, how is that piece called
Ahhhhh has everyone seen the [King Edward chair] Such an amazing accomplishment
What's the context
Man, I WAS wondering why Bayern is spelled like that
Oh I still remember learning about him in school and how influential "Konrad Wallenros" was to the patriotism of Lithuanians
He was a true national treasure for both countries
That is most certainly true, but the formula *gente lithuanus, natione polonus* I think defines his identity quite well
Milk and kefir or buttermilk in bags
Apparently idea of milk in bag is crazy for rest of the west world (exept Canada)
Its a thing in Lithuania
My Dutch boyfriend recently moved in to my place in Lithuania
He brought his toilet birthday calendar among other things and that was the first thing I hung so he would feel at home
I've never seen that anywhere else
It's a useful tradition, only it's a bit weird that it's in the toilet, but I guess that's a place where you will surely notice and look at it since you have a minute to spare
In Baltics its super popular
I'm still not sure I understand how is it different, can you try to explain
Apple cheese
It's a very weird and unique form of something apple marmalade-like
The apples are covered in honey or sugar and cooked for 6-8 hours
After that additives like quince fruit, cherries, or nuts are added
Then, the apples are put into a cheesecloth, dried and pressed in about a 6 week long process
It's long and complicated, but the result is sooo worth it
It's even a part of lithuanian culinary heritage
There is an interesting story how he tried to pass up for a noble by changing his van to a von
Didn't really work well for him and I think from that point on he quite despised nobility
His family was from Flanders I think, so technically Belgian
Not as far as I know
We do have Glühwein
Inga Valinskienė. Singer, actor, businesswoman
Wife of Lithuania's biggest entertainment business shark Arunas Valinskas (almost as big, wealthy and important as any east european oligarch, but doesnt do shady stuff)
Her voice is very deep and adds much to her looks/height
She also voices S rated movies
Ramūnas Karbauskis, the head of the ruling 'Peasant' party
Yup, we call it 'karštas sumuštinis' which translates into 'hot sandwich' and we make them usually in those special kitchen appliances (and sometimes in owens or pans, depending on what crunchiness you want to achieve, but if it's in a pan we call it a Parisian hot sandwich) and put anything we like in them, although the cheese is a must, because it's not a proper hot sandwich without it
Great achievements:
First in covid
Used to be first in suicide
We, along with Poles, probably made UK to decide to leave the EU
You're welcome
Krašto apsaugos ministerija, litterally the 'Land Security Ministry'. Official English name is 'Ministry of National Defence'.
Not a fan of watching basketball games
Like playing though
I don't care about basketball
I hate basketball
I've lost interest in basketball a long time ago
I hate šaltibarščiai
I hate varškė, kefir, grietinė, yoghurt (just milk products other than milk itself, butter and cheess)
I don't hate Poles
...THAT much
[On purpose
Aw, poor guy
"Ramus, kaip belgas"
Calm like Belgian (a person from Belgium, I don't really know how you call yourself as the only Belgians I ever talked referred to themselves as Dutch
In Lithuanian we say "ramus kaip belgas" -- "calm as a Belgian".  I've heard recently, though, that this saying refers to some animal breed rather than nationality
Do you just let them sleep in the canals
The ones to find a bike and cycle out of it are deemed worthy to keep
Užgavėnės.
It's a holiday, where skinny guy - kanapinis (Cannabis) fights a fat guy - lašininis (bacon/lard)
Skinny guy wins because fat guy represents the ending of lazy and workless winter
During the holiday, some kind of a straw woman is burned and kids pretend to be Gypsies and knock on doors asking for "pancakes, cocoa or money".
It's like Lithuanian Halloween
One of our stand-up comedians even did [a bit] about how hard it is to explain Užgavėnės to foreigners
Hemp-man is said on wiki, but it's more like cannabian (made out of cannabis or hemp)
Oh wow what a great guy
To note his wonderful contribution to society I will tattoo his name
After all we should remember heroes
Not  a single shot was fired while beeing occupied by ussr
Same here
Lithuanian governement argued for accepting all the Soviet demands and not resisting in line for not to destroy economy get people repressed and killed
Actually Soviet regime made Lithuanian economy pretty stagnant (compared to capitalist Europe) and deported+killed hundreds of thousands of people
We had our anti-Soviet war too late, not like Finns
Something simillar with President Brazauskas and Latvians happened in 1990s here
Vilnius and Kaunas
You would be surprised what 5 years can do
And its been like that for at least 15 years now
Tabletop gaming, DnD, Warhammer and other geek shit
"Best way to get into D&D is just go to your local gaming or comic book store and -" nope, those don't exist
Just tiny tabletop game stores with family games
"It's real easy, just find a friend who has a D&D group and ask to join, everyone has one" - virtually nobody I've known in real life has even the concept of what a tabletop RPG is, much less actually witnessed a physical board
So I'm just painting minis by my own and only playing RPGs in video game form
here you go
I heard there are pubs/clubs that have tabletop game evenings, some might allow DnD
Would love to try it out at some point
I've dabbled with some online friends, but it feels clunky
And really, there's better games if I'm playing on a computer
I just want the actual experience I guess
There could be, but I'm not sure how to search like you said
If there are circles, I'm not adjacent to any of them
Google
You can find some forums with last posts dating years back
Facebook
I find one "club" that has opening hours of 3hr once a week with the last post being a year old about them selling off their whole stock
Where else
Can't exactly search on Discord
I'm not saying it doesn't exist at all, but it's much harder to find anything as it's very underground, in my personal experience anyway
[: \)]
You can just play the board games online, but it's not what I'm looking for
There's better games to play online, I was just talking about real life experiences
I was only just born in the early 90s, so maybe they're all playing with each other and the later generation never picked it up
Ne Vilniuj gyvenu
A club here seems to exist, but the last post was a year ago about selling their whole stock, so it's not very promising
Second biggest uni I finished a few years ago didn't have anything of the sort
I doubt my smaller town uni would
But I'm not emailing the staff to ask about a boardgame group to play in : )
There's one every year
It's a 4 hour trip and 40€ both ways
Then all the gaming happens in the evening, so I'd need to rent a place to stay, which won't be very cheap in the capital
A lot of money and hassle to play for a few hours with strangers
Hassle and money I'd put up with if maybe I was going with a friend, alone it's too much
Definitely without
I didn't see other people write it that way around me either
They do exist, but they are pretty rare though
Nope
Very rare
We get them when we're baptized, but its rare for  someone to write/say it
Only if your first name is not a name of any apostate or whatever
That is if you're a christian, otherwise there wouldn't be any second names afaik
afaik most people have them, but they are usually not mentioned whatsoever, unless it's written on official documents
Putting their life story in stickers on the back of their cars
Old German men actually wear long black socks with sandals
Raw sugar snaps as in sugar snap peas

It's worse in winter, when "zero degrees" means completely different conditions, but it's not obviously apparent which scale it is in, the way it is with summer/indoors temperatures

Jūratė and Kastytis would be a great Disney film although it has a sad ending
It think it's similar to the little mermaid but without voices and all
Also Eglė Žalčių karalienė. Sad ending too but also some animals, trees
Yes we did
Yap, I remember our history teacher organised a discussion about the war after we read about it and asked us to discuss between ourselves if it should be considered a victory for Finland or not, and contrast it with the actions of the baltic states at the time
Yep, part of the build up to WWII
How Finland bravely resisted in contrast to our own folding under pressure from the Soviets
Well we were taught that it happened and its consequences
graduated in 2012
I've no idea what the curriculum was before me or is now
just extra flavour
For me personally it’s probably Pont-du-Garde
our country rarely gets into international news media
Had a banquet a few weeks ago
Some of my friends were involved in it
So we had some drinks and we saw a basketball court
Somehow managed to find a basketball nearby and we just played 2x2 with our suits on
Later we continued drinking
Watched basketball in an arena to support the boys
People from countries with no dual citizenship, how strong is support for it
Do you want it
If you're from a country that allows it, do you like it
In Lithuania we had a referendum and the majority of participants voted in favor of dual citizenship, but referendum failed because only 37% of eligible voters turned out for this referendum
As for me, i don't support it
You can't live in two countries simultaneously
A lot of lithuanians immigrated and they won't go back, so it seems pointless that they should retain their lithuanian citizenship
But countries don't give citizenship as soon as you arrive
You have to live for some years in the country
The longer someone lives in a foreign country, the more   likely they are to stay there
People find new friends, get married and have kids
These people won't abandon their new life and go back
Very few people actually move back and forth between countries
As I've said before, you can't live in two countries simultaneously
Hahaha, that's true
I think all the Baltics are trying to run as far as possible from Russia due to historical things and hate being confused with it
We had a referendum recently where we voted for allowance of dual citizenship
However, people voted for no dual citizenship
As I heard, that is because people who have only one passport could be somehow “discriminated” by people who have dual citizenship
I think it's a more nationalistic thing
Also, people who have Lithuanian descendants can apply for a Lithuanian passport and still keep theirs, there are more exceptions like that, when you can have dual citizenship, don't remember all of them thought
Poland, except for jokes from Lithuanians
Poor african countries
Never saw a joke that makes fun of them
He's just like his ancestors
Oh, right
I forgot about slow Estonians
My family was half Lithuanian half Russian, so I had 2 nicknames one was "sese" which just means sister (I had a brother but even my parents called me that) and " Рамашka " which translates as camomile, and rhymes with my actual name
My mum calls me "kačiukas" it means (male) kitty even though I'm female
Or she calls kids and teens (including me and my brother) "lėliukas" it means little baby lol
Now because of her I call people babies too and sometimes It slips and I call them a baby in front of them
Gambling
So he cant own stocks or be a business owner
I get that he shouldnt do business while in office but your statement is confusing
And what if it also benefit others too
You could argue then that a business owner and now a politician voting on laws that make business environment better is acting on his own interests but it also helps others too
Well, we don't have many urban legend monsters, but we have some mythological beasts
There's Laumes, which are women, kinda similiar to the Ladies of the Wood from the witcher 3
They use their shining, ornamented, colorful, beautiful belts to blind poor people with greed and lure them in, for later consumption, but they can also change into young women and help (for example) lost children find a way out of the woods
We also have kaukai which are little dwarves, or creatures that help people taking care of them
They are freed, when given an article of clothing
Writing this I remembered, that I have a slavic monster bestiary and I read that, (from legends) there was a basilisk in Vilnius, that people killed, by throwing rūta plants into the basemend that it lived in, becouse allegedly they had anti-magical properties
There was also a few other basilisk legends from kraków or warsaw
There's a SHITTON of balto-slavic monsters, and not even half of them are in the witcher, although some of them are mentioned
Despite that, the witcher does quite a good take on the baltic-slavic mythology
There's even direct references to different countries, like the von Everec people
Olgierd(Algirdas), Witold(Vytautas) and Kiejstut(Kestutis) are all originally Lithuanian names and those three were dukes directly related to each other
Algirdas was Kestutis's brother and Vytautas was Kestutis's son
There's a lot more references if you look into it, so if this mythology interests anyone, here you go
In some way, maybe, but they're still a little different
They litter the house and poor ash into beer, or milk and if the owner doesn't clean up and drink the beer, the kaukai consider this as a pact
Then, when the owners house is clean and their life is happy, the kaukai demand any article of clothing as a reward, so it's more of an exchange, as opposed to HP house-elves living as slaves
In Lithuanian there are genders, but we know it instantly when we hear or see the word, cause everything ending with s is masculine and everything ending with a or e is feminine except for very few minor exceptions
There are no articles here and they are nightmare for us to understand, often we don't get the purpose of their existance
Oh yeah, I know, but you still kind of naturally know it based on stress or diminutive words
That we play basketball and it's basically our religion
I really don't know if it's popular here anymore, because I rarely see basketball courts, and people that actually play basketball on these courts are even more rare
I'd say that football is way more popular among the youth
15-20 range
Depends for how long I am to be outside
5 minute run to the shops, like 10c is fine
5 hours of little movement outside
I'd like it to be closer to like 23
well it highly depends on the season we are in
18C in Fall is cold, 18C in spring is hot
* Quick deterioration of relations with Russia
* Introduction of €.
* Re-introduction of military draft
* Doubling of military budget to catch up with the 2% of GDP pledge
* Ongoing trial of several politicians and parties
* 2016 Seimas election, LVŽS won
* Political chaos since then
* 2019 presidential election, Nausėda won
* failed dual nationality referendum due to not enough turnout
Euro in 2015
Euro - 2015
Some prices went up, some went down, but most of the wages are growing much faster than this
Except for public sector
> The Latvian lat was more expensive than the Euro, so everything seemed more expensive at the start
And for us the opposite
100LTL for a T-shirt
Thats a rip off
~30€ for a T-shirt
Well it's only 30
Yeah, pretty much
Our wages were pretty low to start with, but Euro kicked in growth for everything
Sevices got a price hike (haircut from 5,7€ to ~8€, pizza from 5,7€ to ~7,49€) And for wages, well I wasnt working back then, but even in last two years, my wage has doubled (Take into account that I started fresh and now have 2 years of experience)
Vytautas the great
During his time GDL span from one sea to another
Also he basically did an outstanding move to destroy some nasty germans during the battle of grunwald(Žalgiris)
Vytautas the great, (i think thats how it translates)
During his reign, he expanded Lithuania to the Black sea he would've become the 2nd king but he died when he fell of the horse
Well basically we know that he married a 12 year old girl to become king of Poland
And later he helped to christianize Lithuania
Also he fought with polish troops in battle of Grunwald
We don't look at him negatively, but Vytautas is far more popular here
He's just kinda forgotten
Yeah, but he's less known here
Lithuanians think the same, we just don't agree with some romatacized, maybe, not on purpose some historical pop interpratations
My parents stood in the [Baltic Way,] a 650km long human chain, connecting all three Baltic capitals
It was a protest for our independence from Soviet Russia
2nd husband of my grandma was a fighter in the anti-Soviet guerrilla war in 1940s and 1950s.
All my grandparenta and parents stood in the Baltic Way and my father left Vilnius just in the evening of 12th January, 1991
How old are you wtf
I guess that none
Only some Lithuanian Grand Dukes had claimed that they are of Roman descent
Public transport usage
> Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable
That's illegal in here, unless you are drinking in an establishment that serves alcohol
We probably have the harshest drinking laws in Europe
Well the main idea behind this law is that it helps police to deal with people drinking in the public while creating annoyance to others
For example a drunk person might be a bit to loud, but being a bit to loud is not illegal
So if police catches you drinking in public, and you are not creating any issues, then they will ask you to pack your things and just leave
So it is enforced, but not to strictly and won't cause you to much trouble if you break it
Nothing really
We do Lithuanize some English words by adding "as" in the end, but that's about it
If somebody uses a non-existant word or a grammatically incorrect phrase, you will be seen as a subpar human being and will be immediately corrected
I would argue that we have the opposite problem
The Lithuanian Language commission (yes, a thing like this actually exists) introduce these fake lithuanian words in order to "save the language" or something, but nobody really takes it seriously
I'm in Prague right now (technically not my country but w/e) and I would say what tourists need to watch out for are the Euronet ATMs, they are by far the biggest scam I've seen
They're so blatantly anti-consumer (and practically lie in the advertisements) i'm surprised they're legal
Well Afrikaans is closer to Dutch than English
There are some great takes on English cuisine
Roasted veggie medley in England is probably of the most varied that I tried (the inclusion of parsnips is uncommon elsewhere in Europe)
Yorkshire pudding with Cumberland sausage is simple and tasty
I do find the national dish(Sunday roast) to be less flavoursome, than many other smaller dishes
Someone should let Gordon Ramsay yell obscenities at a plate of Sunday roast
Probably the flag of the [Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic] Though I'm pretty sure most people born after 1990 don't even know what it looked like
It's not that they aren't "appreciated by the public" but they are just straight up illegal, together with the flag of the soviet union and nazi germany
Same for Lithuania as well
I.e. reverse Egypt ?
Spread the cheese, basically one kid would be chosen to either sit or lay down, then everyone jumped up on him to basically spread the cheese, it was a pretty dangerous game now that I think about it
same here, but instead of a yellow car we punched someone if we saw a beetle car
šešios žąsys su šešiais žąsyčiais
Become a democratic country, acknowledge the attrocitoes commited by them, become a mature and politically active nation, value honor, respect and personal liberties above brute force, influence and wealth, keep their end of a bargain, stop propaganda amd cyber warfare against its beighbours, especially in europe
I mean most ex-soviet states will agree that Russia's "peaceful inclusion" was no more than an invasion
Be they mad or not
Another Baltic here to agree
Everyone had chaos solely because of how disorganized and corrupt soviet union was
Russia didnt "give" independence, we declared ourselves independent
Russia tried to stop us, shot at civil people, drove tanks over them, shot at journalists broadcasting live translation on tv, sent soldiers to kill our unarmed border guards
Russia is spreading fake history through tv channels, seeds national hate in social media comments, frequently carries out cyber attacks against our government and business IT systems
Your attempt of democracy was actually an authoritarian oligarch taking controll by force
Then *giving* lead to putin
We, for example, had elected the very same communist party leader, who opposed our independence, to a president after independence council finished the constitution
Because people chose to
That is true democracy - reflecting the choice of people
You were betrayed by powerful criminals, yes
We all lived through that
Now all SU slaves who kept good relations with Russia stayed authoritarian, with georgia, ukraine maturing for clear democracy not too long ago, armenia still struggling to break out
Honestly, have you all tried demanding the truth and transparency, investigating the claims, and not giving in for corruption
We have had protests demanding annullment of corrupt politician-business deals (like selling away national energy monopoly to private owner), bad laws, bad reforms etc
Have you ever asked yourself why nobody protests when your country shelters a fraud-bankrupt bank owners, poisoning people in display of power, defending an autoritarian regime leader who used chemical weapons on civils multiple times, claiming to willingly ignore mutual assured destruction and use nuclear weapons if putin sees it beneficial
A country with morals would not allow its government to even think of doing that
Yet you dont show discontent, still afraid to say it out loud
Why a country with so much oil being sold is considered to be VERY poor in all types of ratings, while fairytale countries like Quatar, Kuwait exist
Where does the money go
Not to you, fellow russians
sadly
This is likely the reason why most immigrants to our country are russians
Very intelligent, very business and scirnce oriented
If your nation had any self confidence, you would mature to demand reform to fair government and live as good, if not better, than germany
Solely based on oil exports
Hope you dont get offended, didnt meant to offend
It is our mutual interest to have russians living very well and having a global-example government
Godspeed mate
Eeeh, not really "Traditional" per say, but Alias is probably the most popular one
If somebody owns a board game, more likely than not, it's going to be Alias
The second one is Uno
Austrijos-Vengrijos imperija
Austrija-Vengrija
Austro-Vengrijos imperija
Austrijos - Vengrijos imperija
I think I remember using Austro-Vengrija in school
Or am I imagining things
Well, I don't recall this usage, at least not in my school
Reason why we're happy it's because we use too many antidepressants
I don't know stereotype which is true , but PLEASE stop calling us Soviet or Russian
Same here
voverė  [ʋoʋʲɛˈɾʲeː], really not that difficult to pronounce
From Proto-Indo-European *wewer-, from *wer-. Baltic cognates include Latvian vāvere, Old Prussian weware and the Samogitian dialect's vuoverie
Other Indo-European cognates include Latin vīverra (“ferret”) and Polish wiewiórka, as well as Russian dialectal веверица (veverica), вевёрка (vevjórka), Belarusian вавё́рка (vavjórka), Ukrainian віве́рица (vivéryca), веві́рка (vevírka), ви́вірка (vývirka), Bulgarian ве́верица (véverica), Czech veverka, Old High German eihhurno, eihhorno (< *aik-wer-ną, German Eichhorn, Dutch eekhoorn, Persian وروره‎ (varvarah) and Welsh gwiwer
Vovere in Lithuanian
It's not a hard word to say for foreigners because it's written and pronounced the same way
Voverė in Lithuanian
I can see the connection deep in the roots, unless its some kind of coincidence
In Lithuanian it's voverė :)
> Orre = a big bird
does it really
looks like it could be from PIE -wer, meaning woodland animal
Operating secret US CIA torture prisons within our country
Too less hawkish on China, especially after this August diplomatic incident
'Ratas' means 'wheel' in Lithuanian lol
In my experience quite common, I personally had math tutor at middle school and then again went to the same tutor during the final 2 years to fill in the gaps I had in school, I also went to Lithuanian language tutor for about 6 months before final exam to fill in specific gaps from earlier in life (if not for that, I probably would have failed Lithuanian language exam)
Out of my final year class, I would say that about 20-30% students had private tutors for at least one subject (most often it was math), having a tutor would help with school exams, but not always
Its sad that kids often need them, but in major cities, schools are quite full so teachers can't dedicate enough attention to everyone
Also this was not necessarily a rich kid class as my school was just like any other school with all income families
Eggs are sold out in shelves/freezers (※) (depends on a supermarket chain), but we keep them in fridge, in 0°C section
Mostly people do that there too
(※) Edit - meant fridges
We keep them in the top shelf of the fridge
He means fridges, we don't have frozen eggs
Also nobody I know keeps them in a 0° zone
Mostly in the egg shelf, or just anywhere
※ I meant fridges
Sorry
We've called you *Čekija* for ages, so it's nothing unusual to Lithuanian ears
We call it *Vanta*
Train or bus inside Lithuania or when going to neighbouring countries including Estonia
Planes for all the other cases
It's not weird, he knows what he's doing
Sanders is a full on tankie, but he knows speaking about communism is politically untenable, so he just substitutes the word communism with Democratic Socialism and tries to equate his positions with that of Nordics, because his constituancy holds Nordics in high regard
It's a simple bait and switch tactic
What is this nonsense
Venesuela confiscated and nationalised more than a 1000 of various private companies, factories, everything during the last 20 years, not just 1 major oil company
They just recently started ceding the control, because they are in total shambles
> He's a democratic socialist
Yeah, that's the bait and switch part I'm reffering to
Dude literally had a hardon for Soviet Union, flew Soviet flag in his office, praised soviet block countries numerous times and is now trying to convince everyone that Nordics are socialist to get support for his policies
Wiki list of companies owned fully by the Swedish state is 20 companies
Also the word "partly" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here
They partly own SAS and Telia, neither of which they own the majority
You see a difference between a state investing into companies, buying/creating them outright and nationalising/seizing companies that belong to other people, whilst firing most of their trained staff, preventing their owners from entering the coubtry and replacing them with government agents
And the list of companies that this happened to was in the thousands, not fucking 20
70% of what's left of Venezuelan economy is privately owned you mean
Oh you watched the same Scandinavian fiction as the guy above
Any recommendations
Yes, nationalising and appropriating thousands of companies, very market economy
At 5-6 years old
We call latvians "broliukai"- little brothers
Broliukai, sesutes (to Latvia)
Just FYI: braliukai is more of a mix between latvian brāļukas and broliukai (which is the diminutive for brothers)
Don't know why we use braliukai instead (I do like how it sounds and it's always clear who we are refering to though)
Su Šventom Kalėdom, braliuks
Very Lithuanian-centred
It starts with 1939 March when Nazi Germany annexed Lithuanian Klaipėda Region after an ultimatum – that was the last pre-WW2 German annexion
Then it goes to August 1939 with Ribbentrop/Molotov pact, invasion of Poland (including Hitler's offer to invade Poland together and the acceptance of thousands of Polish refugees), 'recovery' of Vilnius and acceptance of Soviet military bases to Lithuania
Then it turns to 1940 with 06 11 Soviet ultimatum and our cowardly government that agreed to it; Sovietisation of Lithuania and beginning of Soviet genocide (the mass deportations to Siberia in 1941 06 14)
During this time France, Denmark and Norway falls
On 1941 06 22 Germany invades Soviet Union and the uprising in Lithuania starts, on 23 June the Provisional Government declare restoration of independence, but the Germans come, start the Holocaust and scatter Lithuanian government
Ghettos are created and more than 200k Litvaks are killed
During that time, Pearl Harbour occur and meanwhile, Germans begin failing in the Eastern front
When the Soviets are returning in 1944, hundreds of thousands of Lithuanian refugees retreat to the west with the German military
Lithuanian paramilitaries sided with Germans are created and then dispersed in 1944
Soviets capture Vilnius and Kaunas in the summer of 1944, Klaipėda in January 1945
The anti-Soviet pro-democratic guerrilla war starts immediately after the Soviet re-occupation
Meanwhile, Lithuanian diplomatic service around the world continues to work till today without interruptions of Soviet (1 year), Nazi (3 years) and another Soviet (45 years) occupations
Well we've played huge roleplay in holocaust because of the amount of jews that lived in Lithuania,we wanted to end up living with nazis,but instead we were communist country for 50 years and if weren't communist country we would be as rich as finland
I grew up in the Soviet Union
That's why I read a lot about WWII now, and sometimes it is a completely different story than I was taught in school
I don't know how it is now, because our education system keeps getting changed every other year, but back when I was in school, it went something like this:
We first start off with German entry into the Rheinland, then we learn about the Sudetenland crisis, the annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and then we learn about the official start of the war on the 1st of September, 1939 when Germany invades Poland, while the Soviet Union invades them shortly after as well
Then we learn about the deal with the devil that we made, when we allowed the Soviets to station some troops in our country in exchange for Vilnius
Then we learn about German victories in the west, the surrender of France, and the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union
Then we learn about the mass deportations, violence and looting done to us by the soviets in 1940, and then we learn about operation barbarossa
Then we learn about all the holocaust stuff and the return of the Soviets
Then we learn about the 1944 invasion of Normandy and the Soviet push west
Then we learn about the German surrender, the peace terms, the Nuremberg trials, and then finally there's one small page on what Japan did and about how it was nuked
That's pretty much it, after all that we move on to the cold war
In Lithuania (which was occupied by Soviets) we mostly talk about secret pact with Ribbentrop and Molotov then general things
One book page about Holocaust, another about Stalin's gulags another one in Poland invasion
What is taught about ultimatums to Baltic states, military bases in 1939, annexions in 1940 and the inception of deportations here in 1941
The reign of Vytautas the Great, 1392--1430, obvs
Then the Grand Dutchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, stretching between the Baltic and the Black seas
The time when Vytautas the Great was in charge, aside from that not much else
But that is pretty funny as the Great Duchy of Lithuania was obviously not a nation state
Interbellum and contemporary Lithuania are much more Lithuanian nation states than the GDL
Chiken is quite rare in traditional lithuanian quisine
Geese and ducks are more common
Duck is often served with cranberry jam and goose meat is often used along with pig meat in "zrazai", which are these lithuanian meatballs
Pigeons were eaten too, however they were considered the cheap, lowest class food, so they're not eaten anymore
Quail, or quail eggs are also a part of lithuanian culinary
Beje/Beja - "in addition to"
Deja/Deje - "unfortunately"
Ačiū/Ačių -"thank you"
NYC is great to visit
But
NYC has changed drastically in the last 5 years - since I moved to NYC - not to mention last 20 years
Also - please don't visit NYC any time other than April/May
Other than those 2 months it just stinks
You clearly haven't seen W4th Street
Or never confused avenue and road in Queens
And no - not all US cities adopted numbering
Have you been to Boston
Atlanta
New Orleans
&#x200B;
Numbered streets are not at all a huge benefit or a drawback
with the exception of studies, that suggest that people from places with numbered streets have poorer navigation skills
Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels were translated in Lithuania as Bark, Howl or Shoot
It's ridiculous when translated, but it sounds alright 'lok, stauk arba šauk' haha
As someone from Lithuania we have an awesome quirky song about being able to do whatever you want, when you're alone home
Mantas ir Monika - Žemė plokščia
God damn I am embarrassed to say this
Im surprised nobody mentionet this yet:
Evanescence - Bring me to life
Why wouldn't straight people listen to Verka
It's an entertainment act
and a damn funny one, at it
Ahhh
Every fifth-grader girl sings this
It just has that hook, that ear worm, that just gets in your head
Same with Russian, the words for your native country are cognate with the words "to be born" (родина) and "father" (отчизна), rather than "mother".  Purely an English thing
Pretty much every window made in the last 15 years is like that
I also have a few where you can choose how much the top part opens, so you can leave just a crack, for a little bit of ventilation at night
Very common, even in Lithuania, Latvia
Except in old old villages
I never realised those weren't common everywhere
Pretty much every building here has those, unless it's very old and unrenovated

This is really worth watching if subs are available
Į really enjoy shiey's content and he's hella famous, but almost bone of the lithuanians watch him
PauldeMiko is cool here, I really like him
DeMiko
Yeah hes cool
It's very common here, you shake your hands everytime you see a male friend
If it's a woman you say hi or hug
Always
Daily greeting if any interaction is going to happen
A nod if you're just running by
„Old Scots“? Isn‘t it just „Scots“?
Only reliant now because my new job requires me to travel all over the country with heavy gear
Before that public transport, biking or car sharing systems had me covered
I'm 20 and I don't have the licence as well
Public transportation + shared bicycles work fine for me
Some significant and beautiful artifacts from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania are in the museums
Sadly most of our historical artifacts have been destroyed or stolen during conquest
Before wide spread conquest you had pagan tribes that weren’t the best at recording their lives and activities
A small amount of the Soviet history has been preserved by choice (for education) but both the Soviets and Germans worked hard to cover up the horrific crimes they committed here in the 20th century
I pay by app
I constantly use buses to get around for university, so usually use a public transport app where you can buy tickets on your phone and activate them whenever you go in a bus
You can also use a card with a card reader in buses, or you can buy a paper ticket from the bus driver (it's also the most expensive method)
In Klaipeda:
From kiosk:
Paper ticket for one ride (they have QR codes on the back so the scanner scans them)
To card/student ID (one ticket or month/year)
From driver:
Cash only
Kaunas city (trolleybuses and buses):
* having ticket card that can be topped up with money or weekly/monthly/yearly passes online, in kiosks and supermarkets
I use my student ID with integrated ticket as there are the least hassle, I only need to buy a 55 € yearly pass online once a year
* [Žiogas app] on the smartphone
Upon boarding you need to write 3 symbols bus number and show the app to the driver
If you reach fare threshold, a continuous pass activates
* Buying from the driver
As a student I have to pay 50 ct in cash and then I get a small receipt  working as ticket
Suburban buses:
* In most cases I just pay with cash (with 50% discount as a university student) and get a ticket from the driver
* Some companies, like Kautra, allow buying suburban tickets in the same manner like intercity buses on [www
autobusubilietai
lt]
Railways:
* I usually buy them online on [www
traukiniobilietas
lt]
* It is possible to buy the tickets in the ticket offices of railway stations
* It is also possible to buy tickets in trains, but they are additionally charged if you don't board the train from a station without ticket office
Cash and card
Intercity buses:
* I usually buy the tickets on [www
autobusubilietai
lt]
* However some companies do not sell tickets online – then I have to purchase them in the ticket counters of bus stations (cash or card) or from the driver (95% of cases only cash)
Good at basketball, amazing potato dumplings and life experience that's getting better time to time
> silent fireworks
TIL that's a thing
Exactly
In Lithuania football isn't popular
We go crazy because of basketball instead
I still can't forget ~10 years ago when some club went to play in Lithuania and these polish hooligans came with swords, machetes and other insane stuff
Now every time polish clubs come to play you will hear - police forces are streghtened, polish cars might be stopped
(That one riot in Vilnius also helped)
Riots were between Vilnius Vėtra and Legia
Not sure which clubs were with swords but has to be one of the top ones as far as I remember it was some european competition qualification
at the start we'd be the star and later we'd get all of our food put on our plate by Poland
Lithuania would join braļukas
That hurt and I'm not even Estonian
I started hating most pop artists
Yes
But it gets less affordable
Yep, there are quite a few fancy camps in Lithuania
They're private, so the workers are actually qualified and well paid
Most of the camps are specialized, aimed specifically at sciences, arts, acting, sports, etc
Abolished in 1998
Last person to be punished was Dekanidze, a head of mafia called "Vilnius brigade". Sentenced and shot after killing a journalist for writing an investigation or satire about him
Recently few people say they want to start killing criminals again, but most of them are undereducated people driven by physical instincts rather than calculated thoughts
You mean Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth Constitution:)
Actually Polish-Lithuanian
Kingdom names always go before Dutchy names as the rules of titles suggest
So you Greeks have Christmas on December 25th (not like Russian Orthodox), but the Easter correspond to the Russian Easter rather than Western
I've just seen on the news that your prime minister is chilling in Vilnius and our president is chilling in Warsaw
That's the union
Cheers to you, mate
While historical discussions have that added twist of nationalism, naming rules a quite clear, the more important titles have to come first so in this case there isnt a lot to argue about
Unless ofcourse you want to argue that we should have been a kingdom if not for our stolen crown /s
> Unless ofcourse you want to argue that we should have been a kingdom if not for our stolen crown /s
We always were a kingdom but we also were a border region
To the east they were named duchies to the west - kingdoms . That's why our grand dukes wrote to the west that they were "kings" or "emperors" and no one batted an eye
To the east - grand dukes
Somehow, somewhere we chose to stick with calling ourselves grand duchy and relegated being a king as only blessed by the pope when we were a border region and mix of traditions

Šalčininkai and its region
The apendix
Called *Gaidžio koja* (transl
Roster's foot)
Another stalin's brilliant idea to incite territorial disputes, conflict (about 50km inside belarus teritory are lithuanian villages)
Majority of people living there are belarusians, polish and rusians
To enter the place you need a passport, customs sometimes check for contraband
The place is void of business, people often dont like tidying up their land so most houses and their land looks awful (why put effort to make "foreign" land look good
), generally nothing happens there
Vilnius county has 2/3 of all lithuanian minorities, and many people who live even near the city have worse looking houses, yards, fences, public property than those in the furthest, most desolate regions of lithuania
With years these matters are improving, polish and russians grow fonder of our country by the day, but with putin funded parties like polish-russian alliance fueling hatered for lithuanians changes are slow
As a lithuanian i can say we dont see nationalities, we want you to strive with us to live better, and we wish you well
Taip ir maniau, jog Šalčininkai bus paminėti
( sorry, i couldn't say it in english)
>Another stalin's brilliant idea to incite territorial disputes, conflict (about 50km inside belarus teritory are lithuanian villages)
Stalin has nothing to do with the appendix
It's a myth that when they were drawing  Lithuania's map,  Stalin's pipe was lying on what is now the appendix and nobody dared to relocate it, so they drew the map with it
I doubt whether anyone in Belarus cares about Dieveniškės ( that's appendix's official name)
It's simply useless
There are no major cities, important routes or belarussian population who would be glad to join Belarus
>Majority of people living there are belarusians, polish and rusians
Majority of people living in Šalčininkai region consider themselves to be polish
The key word here is 'consider'. Many of them don't speak polish or care for polish culture
There are very few russians and belausians
In fact, there are 2 times more lithuanians than russians
>To enter the place you need a passport, customs sometimes check for contraband
You don't need a passport to enter
They sometimes chech check for contraband when you are leaving
However, if you plan to explore Dieveniškės glorious woods you better have your passport with you
>The place is void of business, people often dont like tidying up their land so most houses and their land looks awful
Šalčininkai is indeed one of the poorest regions in Lithuania and poor people don't have beautiful houses
>why put effort to make "foreign" land look good
It's not ''foreign'' land
It's their land
The land where their parents, granparends and great-grandparents lived, worked and died
People who live in Šalčininkai are not foreigners
They lived on this land for generations
If they don't speak Lithuanian, it doesn't mean they came here during Soviet occupation
About lithuanian villages, i mean lithuania has no dispute with belarus, just that 90% of those villages have lithuanian names
About foreigners not willing to live bette on foreign land
that was said in brackets
People there dont see lithuania as anything good, they prefer russia, but call themselves polish while they in fact are belarusian/polish/russian
Rest of lithuania doesnt seem them as exclusive, better or worse
But vilnius county in general has minorities who feel like somebody owes them something so they feel angry at their government, love putin while he poses a real threat to destroy their lives
Ive lived in many places in lithuania, even the poorest people make huge effort to have their lawn cut, house exterior made clean and tidy, have fences fixed and decorete it all with plants
People in vilnius county, *especially* minorities, do not do that
Shack or a mansion, many dont give a damn how they make it look
I dont know if its a cultural thing or not wanting to make effort to make lithuania beautiful to live in one household at a time
Gotta read how its written and how its meant to be understood, not reading between the lines
Not that I'm aware of
Vilnius - around 600k people
They think they're the best and don't care about other cities
Some speculate that 90% of Vilniečiai have never been outside Vilnius
They call other cities villages :(
Kaunas - around 300k maybe
normal calm people, look like workaholics
Also most lithuanian
Klaipėda - around 150k people
THE BEST CITY EVER (biased because I'm from it) people here think they like art and jazz very much
Also they probably think that they love sea
German city
Nahhh
It's now more russian:D
Šiauliai - around 100k people
"Sun" city
Haven't been there much, but their mall is massive
Also kids here are too happy to live
Klaipėda represent
Yes
Some examples,
Elizabeth II - Elžbieta Antroji
George VI - Jurgis Šeštasis
Charlemagne - Karolis Didysis
Friedrich Wilhelm - Frydrichas Vilhelmas
Henry VIII - Enrikas Aštuntasis
Mechaninė Saulė by Juodvarnis if you're looking for metal, although I personally prefer Solo Ansamblis - Miestas ant Kalno, although they're more electro post-punkey light rock
I went to both of these bands concerts at Mėnuo Juodaragis festival last year and they were both amazing
Edit: I also read, that they should have some distinctive elements, so I recommend Žalvarinis
They have some really cool songs, one of their best is "O Kai Saulutė Tekėjo". It's literally a remixed lithuanian folk song, so you can check that out if you want
I really like the band Kælan Mikla
They're really cool and have that 80's vibe
Rotting Christ is awesome and they're also from greece
My personal favourite of theirs is "Χ Ξ Σ".
Rotting Christ are Greek tho, as far as I know
Oh my god, that song has literally been resurfacing and echoing in my head randomly for years, and I never knew what I was called until now
Thanks
Probs it's Vytautas the great
Why
Beat teutonic order /w poles, ruled lands from sea to sea, brought us kibinai :D
That's nothing insane
Only Paksas is the insanest one xD
Oh the biggest Vytautas is Vytautas Šuštauskas
He was only ruler of Kaunas, not whole Lithuania
Woah
Never would have thought that it's similar to Lithuanian thank you - Dėkui
Lil Díky
we say shule instead of school everytime
Bischen
„Quotation marks
Šlangas, šlagbaumas
Even das Handy
They're pretty common
I have long hair, and I don't get any weird faces from people in public
Maldininkas- pray saying, men
Maldininkė- pray saying, women
Mald(a)-meaning a pray
ininkas/ė- someone who is doing something (this case- prays) professionally
In lithuania it's male "maldininkas", or female "maldininkė". It means "praying man", or "praying woman", although it could be translated as "prayer", or "prayress", so person not an object
Similarly, in Lithuanian it is called “Maldininkas”
(Male who prays)
Mantė is a female lithuanian name, so interesting coincidence
It also has a male equivalent Mantas, which is my name
If we're talking classical songs like the anthem, then either *Lietuva brangi* or *Lietuviais esame mes gimę*, but definitely not famous internationally
If modern, the only one that comes to mind is *Po dangum*, purely due to its views on YouTube, and I know it attracted some international attention a few years back
We don't have anything that is *that* famous though
Being called Russia or a part of Russia
I used to work in a call centre and used to hate this often occurring interaction:
*- Where are you guys based
*- In Lithuania
*- Oh, Здравствуйте!* (customer all happy with themselves)
*- Oh haha, I actually don't speak Russian
It's not like I didn't understand them, I'm familiar with some words, but I'm from the post-Soviet generation, and never learned Russian
But I didn't want to ruin the rare happy/nice moments in a customer service call either, so I was always conflicted what to say
"Where are you from
"Lithuania
"Oh I've been there
Loved Riga
Our country didn't really exist after the war, and by the time we did come into existence, most of the collaborators were dead at that point
The majority of them either died in Soviet repressions in the following years or fled to the West, where they didn't really suffer any consequences, afaik
One, don't really care about them, I'm more of a nature guy
To be honest, way too many
Šaltiena (aspic)
It literally makes me vomit, it's like jello, but made of meat
Šaltibarščiai, the iconic Lithuanian pink soup
I just detest kefir, and sadly it is used for this soup as well
Oh good, I'm not the only one
It seems like I'm the only one in my extended family that hates it
We also do that in lithuania
Two in Vilnius, one in Panevėžys (why tho, Panevėžys is only 5th largest city)
It's super good, but franchisers rarely pick Lithuania, so we don't have Starbucks, Burger King, Domino's, etc
We got LiDL not long ago (in 2016)(and LiDL is the best thing that happened to humanity)
Also we don't have many mcdonald's. Only one Mcdonald's in Klaipėda (100k inhabitants) is an insult and the lines are always super long
Even some 20k cities in USA have 6 McDonalds
Edit: I read that we are having Burger King, first will open in Vilnius Akropolis, but it's delaying
In Lithuania we don't have any Burger Kings at all
probably Ukraine
Estonia and, to lesser extent Ukraine
Maybe Germany as well
It was a neighbour until 1945
Why not Estonia
There are no woman on that island
Hence the name
well Estonia is more neighbors with Finland and we're neighbors with latvia
Estonia is a baltic state but they seem to have more relations with the north
Estonia doesn't want to be associated with Lithuania probably
that is 100 percent true
Not a thing
And i love it
Lottery is a almost always a scam and run by shadiest people
Is where I live
Trip with classmates and trolling Latvians with Lithuanian (They answered Lithuanian questions really good, I was shocked)
Sleeping in hotel with my classmates
It was fun af
Some kids ran into parking lot at night and somebody called police on them
Eating goulash at Szeged
Camping in countryside
Mostar
Slipping on rocks and watching some guy jump off the bridge
Eating frites
Swimming next to jellyfishes and some crabs (I dunno what these were)
Disneyland
Watching cats sleep together on a bench in Croatia
It was really cute
Mountains
Watching at them
It was
awesome
Swimming in Adriatic sea
I don't know, just passed through
But Beograd was nice
Edited: a typo
Poland
that was my first trip abroad, saw the Malbork Castle
In another trip my school director paid for my lunch in Poland
Latvia
I was on debating tournament and in the evening drank some cheap Latvian vodka with some Estonian fellows – whose names I have forgotten
Later that night I went to explore Riga, it's pretty cute
Germany
I was 14 and went with my choir to Berlin
As our host family couldn't take us from the concert venue, they ordered a taxi for us
I started speaking in German with the driver and got a nice free night sightseeing trip around central Berlin while en route to Friedrichshain
Berlin is my most favourite 1M+ city
Russia
I saw the Hermitage, Kunstkamera and the white nights
During that time Russians downed the MH17 over Ukraine and it was pretty interesting to watch their propaganda on TV while checking facts in Lithuanian/English/Ukrainian websites simultaneously
Czechia
Spent a night roaming through Olomouc in 2014 and Prague in 2015
Austria
I enjoyed walking through Vienna
Estonia
AHAA in Tartu
Later the old town of Tallinn
Tallinn reminded me both Vilnius and Kaunas by its scales but has kind of Nordic feeling
Belarus
I bought a white-red-white flag and got a picture holding it near the central Lenin
As there were lots of militsiya, I thought that I can easily run into a problem, however, nothing terrible happened
France
Louvre was nice as well
Paris felt like a really global city, somewhat more elegant than Berlin
Belgium
I had a night walk with a friend through Brussels and the borough of Molenbeek
As a joke, I have written another good friend of us in Lithuania, that it was pretty bad here (it wasn't)
When we returned to the hotel and turned on the TV, it turned out that the 2016 Bastille day attack occured in Nice at the same time
Netherlands
I was sleeping in a bunk bed and fell out of it while sleeping
While not fully woken up, I said that I will never sleep on top of it again, and I went there back again
I had only 5 hours in Amsterdam, so I need to revisit it back some day
Slovakia
I was in the Northern European Cooperation for Sex Education, my first ever international event of International Federation of Medical Students Associations
I enjoyed that
Hungary
As I had free last evening in Košice (SK), I took a train to Miskolc in Hungary, as I had never been there before, took a 1 h walk in the city and then returned back to the last train to Slovakia as my flight from Košice was in the very early morning
I saw some weird Fidesz and Jobbik ads against refugees/migrants, as the Hungarian elections were held in that spring
I celebrated a birthday of my friend who studies in Cambridge, another day I walked \~20 km through London and got soaked by rain in the evening
Ukraine
I slept in Hotel Ukraina in Maidan around which dosens of people were killed in turn of 2013/2014
It was my cheapest ever visited European city (with metro ticket for 8 UAH)
I went through the Arsenalna escalator few times and I ate in an fantastic Crimean Tatar restaurant in the Maidan
I also saw the Chernobyl power plant from the plane
Finland
I have never been here before, and my only two visits were layover between planes from Vilnius to Shanghai and back
However, both times I asked for a passport stamp, so I have undeniable evidence of visiting Finland
Yeah, the old ones are basically celebrities constantly giving out interviews form jail, the unjailed ones try to pass of as legit businessmen now, and the new ones are not yet caught and know better than to become household names
Realistically: none
Theoretically: maybe Žemaitija (Samogitia), their culture and language are a tad bit different than that of the rest of Lithuania
At least around Vilnius, I don't remember there ever being a stray dog problem
We do have stray cats, but not to the level of it being a problem, there's municipal cat houses/shelters spread around the neighbourhoods
Not really, I don't think so
Most people know that there are various dialects from general knowledge
And some dialectal words can be found:
a) Traveling in that area
b) Randomly
c) Reading old books
d) Speaking with a person from that place (especially Samogitians)
Meat and cucumber
Sometimes butter, but rarely
If we're talking about toasted sandwhiches, I just stick to cheese and ketchup
US definitions of democrats and conservatives (and liberals) are severely fucked up
I am voting for the conservative party here in Lithuania, but it would be defined as borderline communist in the US
As a student, I get a 50% discount, as well as another 5% discount for the discount card (bought for \~50 ct, valid indefinitely) .
Ticket to Vilnius (100 km) from here  (Kaunas) costs 2,28 € with both my discounts applied
And the longest internal route, Vilnius-Klaipėda (\~400 km) costs 14,50 € full price and just 6,88 € for me
We moved our one ministry to Kaunas, būt that was super hard
I didn't read it yet, my father read it: Altorių šešėlyje
From my personal experience: Romeo and Julliet
Antanas Škėma "Balta Drobulė". It's a book about an after war Lithuanian emigrant in US who is  schizophrenic (book writer was also schizophrenic), and a book is written by a main protagonist perspective
It was probably of the hardest books I ever read
Whitehorn's Mill, definitely
Although I liked the actual story, there is so much to read
And it's a bit difficult to read too, since people don't really talk like they used to when this book was first written
Wait, how else do you say Ehre
"es ist meine Ehre euch kennen zu lernen"
Doesn't strike me as very right wing, at least I hope not, that like my go to phrase
> More proper would be "Es ist mir eine Ehre ..."
I was going to write that but forgot how to spell "mir", havent used any German for well over a decade
No investments here, just savings account with zero percent rate
:( But what about income, I am happy - more than half of it comes straight to saving account and I use it for big buys and vacation travels, and for what is left I live pretty comfortable
Have enough savings to live for year and a half without any income
Which translates into less money being available in capital markets and investments and then this sub cries when americans buy up all of our startups
Why
Eternally growing wealth is as unrealistic as any other utopia
We already have extremely wealthy dynasties that basically live in a different planet with different rules
The way money works in Europe where most people are living a comfortable life and most of them having the time to to the things they want is at least somewhat possible to sustain in the future
It wasn't growing all the time before, only in the recent history the progress and jump in wealth of the general population has been large
At this point our consumption is already killing the planet so it can't grow all the time
Plenty of reasons to not invest
The first one is simply not having enough money to put away for years or risk on a bet
The way we view money will need to change if we want to reduce consumption, of course I don't expect it to change
The world already is and will be burning, poor people will keep suffering like they always have been
The return on investment is tiny if you don't want to take big risks and that means that those who have more money benefit more, always
What about simple wage growth
Inflation is relevant in strong economies that don't have catching up to do
For us in the Baltics since 10 years ago wages rose more than double
So your investment 10 years ago at best would not have decreased
Sure, but since we are talking about poor people they don't usually get to have much money sitting in their bank account
To invest they would have to cut their expenses somehow reducing their quality of life and maybe or not get a return when it barely matters anymore
That's why I am saying investing isn't actually for everyone
Yes
Most of the words are for anglicized topics such as technology, business and finance
Yep, when i talk to someone i often say, "like uhm that thing, you know, right
Uhhh
It happens to me all the time, and I just end up using the english word instead, because otherwise I have a slight brain freeze and have to think for good 10 seconds until I remember that word
Lithuanian - Salieras
1st in the list and, according to national statistics, First by viewership is LNK
Private owned channel
I dislike it personally because it's shows are copied from USA, Russia
And sometimes it's bad quality
Poland – the PLC redux
Pretty good scenario as we are already in the Schengen area, EU and NATO and culturally similar
According to NUTS, you will get Wilno voivodeship and Lithuanian voivodeship
Lithuanians in Sejny area and Poles in Šalčinininkai will be happy af because of reunification with their ethnic relatives
&#x200B;
Belarus – Grand ~~Duchy~~ Republic of Lithuania 2
We will throw out Russian language, and will enforce unconditional democracy
Good for Belarusians, costly for us (but EU could help us with integration of our former neighbouring dictatorship to the EU
&#x200B;
Latvia – we're brothers
This would be an incestual marriage
However, it would be hard to deal:
* how this country should be called
* where should be the capital
* will we learn both languages
* wich religion will be predominant
* will our country be parliamentary or semi-presidential
So Polish merger is less complicated
&#x200B;
Russia – the 3rd Russian annexion
We have suffered enough during 170 years of Russian/Soviet oppression
Go f\*\*k yourselves
We would cause nuclear war as we have NATO battalions stationed here
OK, more sofisticated merger: Lithuania+Kaliningrad Oblast :)
Renaming the localities (although Google Maps already show traditional Baltic/Germanic names when used with Lithuanian language), so it will be called Prussia
Getting rid of Russian military and nuclear weapons
Teaching inhabitants Lithuanian language
Making Prussia Special Economic Zone of the EU and putting shitloads of EU financial help to re-integrate it back to the Western civilisation
Encouraging all the immigrants to settle in Prussia
&#x200B;
Latvia: Trump called us Balkans rather than Baltics before, does it count
Poland: Commonwealth is back, baby
Fire up those coal power plants
Russia: Soviet union is back, tovarisch
It's starving time
Belarus: same as Russia
> how this country should be called
Aistija, duh
>where should be the capital
Rotate between Pasvalys and Bauska
>will we learn both languages
I'm pretty sure the "everyone under 30 knows English, everyone over 30 knows Russian" rule applies to both countries, so we got the work cut out for us
>wich religion will be predominant
Baltic paganism
(Serious: irrelevant question, both countries are officially secular and we're past the point in history where religion was a major divisive question in the region)
>will our country be parliamentary or semi-presidential
Neither, both of our Presidents join together in marriage and form a royal dynasty
We're already in EU, NATO and Schengen :)
They are forbidden in Lithuanian Constitution
Well, we could give them to Germans, as the Luftwaffe is already armed with some
But you know, everyone already understands everyone via English/Russian/local languages (borderland people), there are no visas, no border control, same currency, allied miltaries
I think it's better than being under Russian oppression or idiotic incestual marriage :)
we still have our flags, the Vytis and the Three Stars, Tautiška giesmė and Dievs Svēti Latviju
Current situation is ok
(well, not for our PM)
They would be put back to European civilisation
Freedom&democracy without compromises
What would you do with Transnistria and Gagauzia
Don't forget Ė. And we will add Ų and Į near yours Ą and Ę :)
Don't worry, it would just be integration to EU
Btw, Russian is no official language of EU, so they would need to learn one
Sorry for the off-topic question: how is Russian contigent supplied if Transnistria is landlocked between mainlaind Moldova and Ukraine
What about going further and just extending our great Commonwelth over the whole EU
And alphabets :/
So ok, we can stick with your plan
I thought that Dublin was in Poland
Maybe becouse of another city - Lublin
> Lithuania is fictional
why
Vietnam is in portugal
That one got me
Not only poland
A lot of countries next to the baltic sea have something about sweden in them
There was even a country called "ingria" that was established by a swedish prince marrying a russian princess
That was a way for swedes to expand their teritorry into russia
Mainly St
Petersburg, becouse that's where the country was situated
There's even a chance for the country to break out and be independent again, although it's highly unlikely for russia to give a away St
Petersburg, since it is a source for a crapton of money
Oh, my bad
I didn't know that, but the context is still the same

Rare, cold and brief
People generally don’t speak to people they don’t know unless absolutely necessary
And when it happens it’s usually very to the point
Even when out in pubs Lithuanians are quite passive and indifferent towards strangers
German and the Slavic languages (excluding Poland, they have too many cz sz stuff)
With Russia: Stalin,
With Poland: Zeligowski
Stalin is WW2 hero for Russians and leader of aggression and genocide against Lithuanians in Lithuania
Pilsudski is one of founding fathers for Poles, but a half-Lithuanian-who-stole-our-capital guy for us
Considerably less evil than Hitler or Stalin, though
Leaders of post-WW2 resistance, especially Jonas Žemaitis and Adolfas Ramanauskas are treated as heroes in Lithuania, but as criminals in Russia
Russian propaganda tries to call them (and all anti-Soviet resistance as Nazi somehow)
While Pilsudski was the one who aspired to rebuild Poland with Commonwelth borders and was the commander of the whole Polish-Lithuanian interim war he was not the one who betrayed his own people (if you could put it that way), from this point of view Pilsudski is not the villain in my eyes
No, because the only languages that are endangered are those that have fewer than 10k speakers, have no legal status, no dedicated media and aren't used as languages of instruction in the education system
If anything, it's regional languages that are endangered, but they're getting replaced not by English but by the official languages of the countries where they're spoken
In the past, sure
Nowadays, the attitudes towards regional languages has definitely shifted in most of Europe at least, but regional languages have been irreversibly damaged already
> as a global language would just diverge into new languages after a while
That depends on interconnectivity, I think
100 years ago, when people only had access to their own local communities at any one given time
Sure, absolutely true
However, if more and more people have access to the internet and use it daily, a global language could be "held together" in a sense, with language shifts not happening in only one place, but also spreading through the entire world
In such a case, language may shift, but not necessarily diverge, even on a global scale
In Lithuania, it was [book smugglers]
>Lithuanian book smugglers or Lithuanian book carriers (Lithuanian: knygnešys, plural: knygnešiaĩ) transported Lithuanian language books printed in the Latin alphabet into Lithuanian-speaking areas of the Russian Empire, defying a ban on such materials in force from 1864 to 1904
In Lithuanian it literally means the one who carries the books
Opposing imperial Russian authorities' efforts to replace the traditional Latin orthography with Cyrillic, and transporting printed matter from as far away as the United States to do so, the book smugglers became a symbol of Lithuanians' resistance to Russification
Nah, in our case, they were smuggled from Prussia (which had a large Lithuanian population at that time)
It was the town of [Tilsit] (now Sovetsk) where books were printed
1000 years in the future, I'd get a ticket to New New York and get a job as a delivery boy
either 13
8 billion years ago to see how the big bang happened or 60-70 mil
years ago to see the dinosaurs
Either 2009 and I would become bitcoin billionaire, or 3-5 decades to the future, when Lithuania will be more developed
There's 3 in lithuania, byt there's also a huge factory in kazlu ruda, that is being heavily invested in by ikea

Wtf did the police even say
"Black people can't be selling stuff"?
Everyone would agree we're Baltic
Discussing whether we're Northern, Eastern, or Central European would be more contested
I like Northern most and I *really* hate being called Eastern
Some might say you're the westernmost eastern europeam country
It's a bit different in lithuania
Everyone agrees we're a part of baltics, but there are also people that would say the whole of baltics is northern, not nordic, not scandinavian, but northern europe
After all we're the same latitude, or even above denmark, which is considered scandinavian
Edit: Damn, I kind of started a small riot in this thread
I want to clarify I don't say baltics are scandinavia, becouse obviously they're not
Hell, we're not even nordic
All I was saying is that some might consider lithuania, latvia and obciously estonia a northern european country, becouse they all either go above or are on the same latitude, than denmark, which is considered a scandinavian, so automatically also a northern country, and if baltics are above the latitude of a northern country, they're also northern
I'd say, germany is central, but definitely leaning towards western europe
I feel like the only people who class as us central are foreigners
Erm what debate is there
Scotland is in Europe
Meh, most everybody here agrees irl we're EE, barring crybabies on the i ternet
I think it’s because of our historical association with Poland and how Poland can be either Central or Eastern European
In my experience, some say we are Central Europe because there's a claim that the geographic center of Europe is in Lithuania
Maybe single words from a sentence, but these two languages are pretty different, from listening
Yeah, that's what I said
We're not scandinavia, not nordics, but northern eruope
I know, I just feel like "those Czech and Hungarians are our brothers" is not something I would ever actually hear, or have heard (apart from a general euro thing)
I agree
We’re not really Central
Poland has something going with the rest of the Visegrád Group but that’s not us
We have a connection to Poland but nothing else in the region
I'm not angry, everyone's allowed to have an opinion
It's just that there was an other post on this sub, that clasified baltics as central europe, and many people (mostly others, not baltic people) disagreed, and said they think it was northern, so I thought it's a commond thing to think, but I guess not
It probably depends on the POV too, if you're from spain, you would probably classify lithuania as northern, other thing when you're from norway
Probably, becouse of the post-soviet state of pretty much all the european countries that are still or were bordering russia
Even though there are a lot of russians here, the anti-russian sentiment is prominent
Wellthats mostly on business side of things I guess
Tried it for the first time a few months ago, didn't get it
It's just sausage with sauce
What's so special about it
I guess it's similar to Swedish meatballs, cheap frozen mass-produced food that's easy to prepare
For me, buckwheat, salt, water, some butter is all I need to make a meal
Then I find stuff like [this] online and feel like a shit-kicker
Ah, well I’m not sure we have one
Could another Lithuanian please show me if we have one
I’d like to know now
Haha, I think I prove your hypothesis correct
Coronavirus is really the least of my worries :D best of luck to you
Maybe our [basketball anthem
[This] song is pretty much our second anthem, always played during competitive sports matches
Everyone knows the lyrics, it's very approachable, easy to listen
However, now that I think of it, its never really played anywhere but sporting matches
Hence, I would argue [this] is our true second national anthem, as you can play it at any event - be it a concert or a memorial
The first few chords are enough to make people pull out their lights and sing along
Andrius Mamontovas is our national treasure

what about [Ant Kalno Mūrai] ?
i love rabbit
deer isn't that common but we do eat it and ducks are very common to eat
Same, my Lidl recently had rabbits
My ancestors moved here from Africa
From the more common ones: Vandenilis (H), Azotas (N), Deguonis(O), fun fact about it: deguonis in lithuanian is literally "something that burns"), Auksas (Au), Sidabras (Ag), Anglis (C), Helis (He)
So from the more commonly found (culturally) ones, most don't work with the symbols, but when you go to the more uncommon ones, like Litis(Li), Wolframas(W), Manganas(Mn), Bizmutis(Bi), most work
That's really nice to hear
Basketball
I hate it and it's fucking everywhere
Front pages on the news, basketball players are giving speeches at public events, they're in ads, the city councils are donating tons of money to the teams, they're like national heroes or some shit
I think that 1/3 of kebabs usually have no onions by default
No, not common
Never heard this joke
The Grand Duke of the time slept on the hill and dreamed an Iron wolf that should protect the city
So there's that
There's a saying in lithuanian that goes "neapeina" or "neapeina man". It roughly translates to "it's not walking around", although it means "i don't care".
"Not my circus, not my monkeys", interesting, in Lithuania we have "Not my pigs, not my beans" which has the same meaning
Hmm maybe that our language is the oldest in Europe
Our country was extended to the Black Sea

r/photoshopbattles where u at
Yup, Vilnius is doing a lot to make the city centre friendlier to pedestrians
Trains
The strangest thing driving through Poland was always the amount of those ads and billboards
Every square meter of any public facing building was covered
And not some nice ads by Coca Cola or Samsung, but signs about key makers, mechanics and the like made with MS Word
Yeah, that was a bit of shocker one of the first few times I visited Poland
Billboards, advertisements - EVERYWHERE
Not exactly sure why we didn't have it so bad it here in Lithuania
Great
Now norway should stop oil drilling and earth polluting
Yeah, same experience travelling through Poland
In terms of ads in cities it's way different, mainly because our cities had anti random ads policies for a couple of decades now iirc
You can have ads in designated places in cities like Vilnius, but those places are reserved by big billboard agencies, so only bigger companies can afford to advertise on city billboards
It's different near highways, there are quite a few ugly billboards that random small companies advertise on
And in the old town of Vilnius even the store sign above your business door need to adhere to certain standards
Also small businesses are not as prevalent here as in Poland (we do have them, just less), so not as much things to advertise
Not necessary
If norway would top oildrilling the prices would increase, now oil price is only 50usd per barrel which oil community is not happy about it, they want to be more
And reduced supply would increased more to maybe 60usd per barrel and price increase would reduce demand for oil
Everyone would win
AH SHIT I SLIPE
Dangerous, but a very clever statement
they only started one, pretty shit record
2019 was soooo last decade
Shhh
Don't you dare to ruin my joke
And nowadays Facebook groups make these morons even more plentiful and stubborn
Gosh, America dun goofed this time, fellas
"Pretty good run"
Fun fact - Reich Chancellery was owned by Lithuanian nobleman family Radvilos (Radziwiłł) - very powerful and one of the wealthiest families in Europe - before being acquired by Prussia in 1869
Hitler organised to build new Chancellery and they were connected by that Fuhrerbunker
This is a deeply sad day for all Parisians and French people, and to an extension the entire world
I hope Paris can rebuild, and learn from the fire to prevent it from happening again
I send my condolences and wish that Paris and France stay strong and unified

Well, now that it's playing, I'm obliged to listen to it to its end, I don't get rick rolled much these days

Rare to see a fellow Lithuanian in hot on Reddit
There was Kęstutis Pūkas in the Lithuanian parliament
Pūkas literally translates to "fluffy". [Total Chad
] Married five times and has 9 kids
Impeached for sexual harassment
I think it's just strawberries with whipped cream
My man is celebrating in style
> Pūkas literally translates to "fluffy".
More like "fluff". It's a noun, not an adjective
As a Lithuanian, I find this very funny, thank you
In Lithuania he is in the Peasants party which is officially Peasants and Greens Party but realistically it's anything but green
Party leader is an agriculture tycoon who imports nasty Russian fertilizer and drives an Escalade
Being green is absolutely the last thing in their list of goals
"Čėdyti" is a dialectical loanword from the Slavic languages meaning "to save, protect, put aside", and it's appropriate as Virgin-ijus is the Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries

Lithuanian in a sketch:
hmm
so Lenin is Tatarian
I guess Lithuanians are known for their legendary chins
I'm developing feelings for that guy
well, nationality in this case ment exactly the same as ethnicity
It’s quite obvious they are talking about the lithuanian savant Mikalojus Tešla

I would say that Iceland here is misrepresented the most
Yea but the concert was in 1991 after [failed coup] (pro soviet people tried to overthrow pro democratic government but they failed) and in general USSR in 1991 was already was different to what it was in 1985
American movies and western books were very strictly controlled and censored in the USSR
I still have a bunch of books from those days
Western culture was usually depicted as vapid, perverted and all that
A lot of those books are from the Zenith series, it's science fiction about space travel and all that
In one of them a USSR spaceship finds an abandoned american ship
They board it and find porn magazines scattered around, porn posters on the walls, etc
Music was equally restricted, you just couldn't get most Western records, smuggling of music was a thing
We did have access, but not legally
As I said, stuff was smuggled, some people had radio receivers to listen to Radio Free Europe, it was an american-funded news station which broadcasted to all the occupied countries around Russia
USSR government tried banning receivers capable of receiving that signal, so people built their own out of spare parts
What the hell is wrong with Ireland
We lithuanians are white as our white bread, not paper
The girl be very white tho
wtf Ireland
I hope this is the end of this now
Yeah

That's cool
Yay, it's independence day

It was 10c at 6

It's stupidlly warm this winter
There's no winter here
Just 6 month long autumn
We had snow for like 4 days total
Thanks I hate this
We had snow like 3 days tops in whole "Winter".
I am genuinely afraid of mosquitoes and ticks in spring and summer

In Lithuania it started snowing in November
When I was there for Christmas it was raining most of the time and it was miserable
Ans it turns out they have no good beers to even drown the sadness
Just some cheap pisswasser
And when leaving Prague the plane was late 2h so connecting flight lost our baggage
I am into all kinds of dark beers
Stouts, Porters - intense ones
And good luck finding anything of sorts in Prague
I had a few locals guide me to some bars but maybe I am spoiled in Vilnius and Copenhagen but these were disappointing
why though

I had a great opinion about the US when Obama was in charge (too young for Bush)
Then Trump came and it went to absolute shit in a heartbeat
But democracy is democracy and if Trump is really what Americans want, we just have to deal with it

In highways they are OK but cities are each man for himself kinda deal

At least people are trying to change things in their country, ye most people know that it might be useless, but they are still trying
Least we could do is support it morally even if it adds nothing to the cause
I keep seeing the same post every goddamn protest in totalitarian government regime
Your post is on the verge "everything is useless, nothing will change and we should do nothing, because everything is useless"
damm
true
This looks like lithuanian capital Vilnius sort of too
Poland is the most Christian country in Europe, not surprising
You're Belarussian and you think that
Did you skip your history class
5 million is too low for stalin
There are estimates, that the [Holodomor] was \~4 million deaths alone
And later, after his death, there were discovered 800
000 confirmed kills just from archives alone (deaths, where the person was not deported, but just brought to a mass grave and shot, like [Kurapaty] And of course, there were \~1
7 million death in gulags
The full total is set to be around 20 million, but those are only estimates

I propose a union state with Belarus and Lithuania, and possibly huge chonks of Ukraine and Poland for good measure
Anyone in favor
Situation is a bit different, Crimea had a strategic port
Belarus does not have a strategic value at the moment
Taking even part of it has no real value for Russia
Not to mention economy of Belarus regions is even worse than that of Russia
To add to that, eventual occupation of another region would be very very expensive in terms of military expenditure and Russia for the all the appearances has real financial issues at the moment, oil, the main cash cow of Russia has dropped in price quite a lot
Overall slowed down world economy due to covid does not help either
Exactly, a buffer state, therefore it is not worth it to occupy it
If they want to put pro Russian by force, they will have to stay there to enforce, ergo occupation, ergo no buffer
The best bet is not to interfere directly
It would take decades for Belarus to get anywhere near EU and NATO on its own
They aren't. Why should they be
Neither of Koreas is occupied last time I checked
How is the flow of the war even relevant here
Why do you assume that Belarus will even lean west
Ya that is nearly not enough to mean anything of you compare it to Ukraine for example, which started from a thing called Euro Maidan
Untill we see Russian military actually acting in Belarus, those pledges are empty
In Lithuanian Venezia is Venecija, so pretty close
Paris is Paryžius, though
Yeah, we took that random ž thing for Paris to Lithuanian, too

I get that it most of the city's inhabitants didn't quite have a choice whether they want to live there under communism, but why would anyone subject themselves to life in such an utterly depressing and dangerous place these days
Identity politics is a cancer upon society
Maybe if you fucking asshats wouldn't shit on white cis males as "oppressors" all the goddamn time we wouldn't be in this fucking mess
We do not live in a patriarchal society
The Middle East does though
According to the language you use, feminism is all about power nowadays, not equality
Why don't you let people do whatever they want to do instead of attaching some sort of boogie-man of a 'patriarchy' to it
Equality of opportunity is in place in most Western countries
Show me one law where it says otherwise and I might be willing to agree with you, but the current rhetoric about this patriarchy, power structures and other identity politics nonsense that seems to demonize men just seems pulled straight out of power-hungry, bitter people's asses
I hope the violence finally ends
The former president is true enemy of the state
He should give up and let Belarus be a free country

Lithuania here, 15 euro for a stable 950 upload and download, plus a stable 1ms latency because it's all optical fiber cable
But there is also similar specs to yours for 10 euro/month from an another provider
In Lithuania this costs around 15-20 eur
Probably you should mention that you can achieve this speed only connected via wire

When and in what context was this foto taken
This gave a needed chuckle
His political views suck ass
This statement is so fucked up
Like how many nations did Red Army freed
And how many were lets say "Under new management"?
And lets point out again
It was war which they started together with Nazis by invading yours Finland and Poland :D So fuck Hemingway on this one
Mankind
Maybe to themselves
Say that to enslaved innocent civilians from Soviet countries
Wow such a dumbass view
You do realize the only reason Finland was on Nazis side is because like few years before Soviets tried to occupy Finland just like Baltic countries
Because fuck I would been killing Soviets on Nazi side for such things too
This is not about "choice". It is about some genocidal regime trying to pose themselves as freedom fighters as first comment suggests
While being just another murderous regime
Nobody in Lithuania "had a choice" at that time
They were forcefully occupied
Oh yes I can agree with that
But it is just two totalitarian regimes killing millions because of their leader ambitions
There are no "saviors' in that battle
Just two bloody regimes killing own people
Well we will never know whom I would been
But I sure I would not join today
And if Hitler was such antislav why Stalin signed Molotov-Ribentrop pact
He sure was all buddy buddy with him when he got what he wanted
Yeah man, there was no internet back then
And in 1940 only one regime had wronger Lithuanian people
So people acted accordingly
Until they realized who occupied them again
Soviets saw no problem bombing Helsinki during Winter war
So karma is a bitch
Yeah I am well aware of that
But Stalin had no problem with it
Oh he is no slav actually :D Explain a lot
I had good lough of this :D
Could someone explain who is Oswald and what did he do to be hated so much
So he got beaten just because he had an unpopular opinion

You know considering how the Soviet-occupied countries ended up like post-WW2 with deportations and repressions, I genuinely doubt Spain would be better off if it came under Stalinist influence
Many movements like labour unions existed before Marx shared out his mistake lmao
Communists merely latched onto these movements, negatively impacting them
It's called April Fool's because you have to be a total fool to buy into far left propaganda
> USSR was not communist
It was socialist
Can you even call it that
I'd call it state capitalist
But regardless of those semantics, if all known attempts to make communism happen end in authoritarianism, then can you call communism innocent
I don't think so
EDIT: Your point about democratic approaches is valid - it hasn't been done and it might be much better, but is it possible at all
I have doubts about that
It would have a place in this world of ever-increasing automation, especially if it gets to the point where it really starts to cause large amounts of unemployment, but how would it be executed
Yeah because modern day socialists are the exact same as communists of interwar period
"Lol you can't compare all communists to Stalin
Also all capitalists are exactly like slave owners"

Seriously what were the pilots thinking flying over a war zone
Edit: I lol when people think I’m trying to blame the pilots
Nice try
However, if the flight path was around the war zone those lives would be saved
I saw it posted not even an hour after it happened
Crazy stuff
Sorry for your loss
Add to it everyone else who allowed flight path over a war zone
They have their share of the blame
Well the chances of being raped walking through a park at night are higher than during the day time
Just like flying over a war zone has a higher chance of catastrophe than flying around it
Exactly why I said everyone else involved with the flight path fool
“Dolt” wow such a cool insult
Partly
No, never the persons fault for being raped, however precautions can be taken to lower the likelihood of something happening
There will always be bad people in society
Because people think I’m putting the whole blame on the pilots, which I am not

I rode my bike yesterday around noon, had a couple errands to run
Anyway, my bike computer has a thermometer and while I don't trust it 100% (bought in in Lidl for like 7€) it [heated up to 45C] in just a couple minutes of direct sunlight
Riding in the shade against the wind dropped the temperature down to a comfortable 32C.

Hey santa, I hope you are in your sandals
rip
Yes, so much yes
I wish we had a program like that here
I believe we ceded too much space to cars here, especially in the city center, some of the parking lots could be converted into public squares and green zones
Knowing how sometimes it is hard to find a parking space it is angering, but knowing how food it is for the world makes it amazing
Cars being a status symbol doesn't mean they offer you more freedom than a comprehensive public+private transport system
Carshare, micromobility and public transport, when a city has enough supply, is, I would say, even more convenient
Say I want to go downtown to have a coffee - I can walk to get some exercise, halfway there I might want to hurry up so I hop on an escooter
Say, on my way home I want to pick up a few bags of groceries that I don't want to haul to the bus - I grab the nearest car share and drive myself home
It's really not as utopian as it may sound - I have been living like this for a few years now in Vilnius (not the most well funded or innovative city by far)
Before Covid I'd estimate my budget for travel was probably in the 60€-80€ range per month
Now between parking fees, maintenance, gas, insurance and everything else, I'd say that's waaaay less than it would be to own a car
Obviously each person's lifestyle is different, but having a well put together multimodal transit system would do very well for a LOT of people
My city has started implementing this Park & Ride thing
Parking lots on the edge of the city where you park your car for cheap and then get on a bus or an electric scooter or whatever
You get a free bus ticket if you pay for parking there
Not with that attitude, it doesn't. London already has more remote towns with train lines to London considered as 'commuter' towns
If fast and accessible public transport is available to larger cities, people will live there
Urban life is not for everyone after all, and places within an hour of bigger cities, given good public transport, could be extremely attractive options
Islsmists were triggered by some old cartoons
That's all it takes, that's how fragile and on the edge they are
I've seen another pole elsewhere saying that it is allowed only during first trimester, which means a doctor needs to rule that there is a threat to the life of a mother in 12 weeks after conception, which means it is basically banned as well as it is unlikely to happen even if you try, because there is not enough time
So maybe that was mixup which mislead me, I remember him saying that rape and danger to life under the same conditions
Eitherway, if danger to life is possible to prove, good luck proving rape in 12 weeks
Nobody cares
Putin can kill as much people as he want
He has nukes and he is untouchable

Technically this is wrong as Belarus changed to their independence flag after their exit from the Soviet Union
We use the grand duchy flag as our state flag
Nah man it looks too communist
Nu uh
The lithuanian flag has been changed since
Before, it was simply the coat of arms in a red background
It looked too "communist" so we changed it
Yeah, he's right
The amount of red has really strong associations with communism and most people don't want to be reminded of the thing that weakened our country so much
It is a really good looking flag, but it's just too traumatic for people to see
Especially considering that there are 40 year olds that still remember a siege of the Vilnius TV tower
The russian goverment literally killed 13 unarmed people and injured a lot more
Yeah, but tge thing is you can't remember these times
Maybe lithuania was the strongest, but there are no people to remember it
Just like a photo doesn't show the true beauty of a place, a history book won't show you what were those times like, you know
Standing in a screaming crowd of people surrounded by tanks, seeing people lose their limbs or even lives, feeling the heat and sweat is more than enough to cause stronger feelings than a simple book, or a TV programme
Thats the thing people in lithuania associate the color red with
Besides, times change
Imagine this: you're cool, you have a lot of friends, but all of a sudden you lose them
Are you going to talk about  how you were the coolest person in your group of friends, or are you going to change and accept the fact that you're not as great as you were before
P.S
The situation I described happenned in 1991, (for refrence) just 5 years before eminem released his first album
I know that you're not familiar with a lot of the lithuanian history, I am not Familiar with the estonian history, but you calling this dumb would insult a lot of people in lithuania, so you know
Just saying
I wouldn't say that it's to far fetched
Look at the communist and our old flag
Just make the knight smaller, move it to a corner and boom
You don't even have to add anything
There are probably differences between estonian and lithuanian mentlaities that make our opinions differ
Whees the ŚÍ poster
But for real what did police in europe do to deserve this
Do they have the authority to do that
Latvian police, just like most European countries', don't choke black people for funzies, don't spray peaceful protesters with tear gas and don't injure AND murder innocent people in cold blood
While this American problem is a good opportunity to give some thought to racism, true justice and equality, there is no excuse for things like protests/hooliganism against the European police, especially in Latvia
Hell, there aren't many black people there either
There aren't many here, in Lithuania, either, so no one really bothers and racism is mostly non-existent (just like in the most part of Europe, I guess)

No surprise at all, Lithuania is the longest and most vocal, harsh critic of Kremlin Government
It should tell you a lot about state of our relationship with Russia when i say this
Our last high profile diplomatic meeting was back in 2011, when our previous President Dalia Grybauskaitė met Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
Since 2000 when Putin was first elected, we understand from the start, the danger Putin will probably pose to Lithuania
And our fears were confirmed soon enough, when we saw Russia's regression and the backsliding in terms of Democracy, Press Freedom, Freedom of Expression
What didn't help also, is long history of Russian imperialism, that Lithuania and its neighbors have suffered from
If anyone interested to know more about Lithuanian History, i recommend everyone to read this [The History of Lithuania in PDF]

I'll wear that as a badge of honour
Ah yes the second biggest threat and "unfriendly" nation to Russian Federation is the mighty Republic of Lithuania
Gotta love the Kremlin's dog brain propaganda
Thanks Russia, right back at you ;)
This is a very proud moment for lithuanians
Feeling proud

You bet your ass we’re not friendly

Yay
And also sucks

Wow ok
That's rude :(
Feel quite proud of it for some reason
Is this how mosquitos feel
Hey, that's me
I wouldn't say the Baltics have a great relationship with the big ol' russians
Especially with Lithuania and the whole past stuff
I am a bit surprised there is no France on it
I always heard people saying French do not like tourists, but I dunno if it is true so don't take my word for it
"unfriendly" well no shit based on how much pain Russia caused to some of those countries
Ah, badge of honor

Welcome to the Club :)
Glad to see it's not only us, good jo
When the live TV showed NATO fighter jets landing for the first time (symbolic, but still), I felt a weight lifting - a hidden weight I never knew I carried
Watching those poor Sakartvelians and Ukrainians getting harassed by the revolting bully still feels like that moment most of us have had at least once: stopping crossing the street a split second before a truck roars by
For my money, let's double defense spending to 4% GDP and buy a battalion of those Abrams USA still makes as a jobs program and has no use of
Or 1000 Stingers - just to make the bully remember *that other place*.
Dodged a bullet
It is sad that Russian has rolled into another cycle of authoriatrian rule
Most of the countries in the list are small and don't give a flying f*ck - just like those tiny psycho dogs which yip and bite without fear
All that doesn't sound like Finland at all :)

Uraine's biggest mistake was not walking together with Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into EU and NATO
Amen man
While Baltic countries worked hard for this, but you must admit luck was on our side
Luck which happens rarely in history
I dont think current NATO would dare to expand this close to Russia
Especially after Sakartvel and Ukraine

Interesting, though unsurprising, which one
My pop spent a decade in the Russian north and used to say that there are two countries inside Russia: the good people ('russkaja dusha') and the evil government ('rak')
Being a militant atheist, he compared that to Italy and the Vatican :)
We don't consider you our enemies too
Just *the Vatican*. And that *pope*. It's not as if you voted freely ever since the time of Yeltsin
... 1917
Right
It's been 7 years and somehow the separatists are still getting new weapons and tanks
I wonder how Russia missed tanks rolling from Russia towards Mariupol in 2014
There's a difference between placing nuclear missiles in Cuba and conducting drills
Those nukes were also in an era before ICBMs were common
But I don't expect them to be totally OK with it
What I expect is them to stop pretending that Baltic states are their territory
When did Sweden, Poland or Germany last claim the three countries to be their rightful territories
When did they ethnically cleanse them and are now defending those ethnic cleansings
Exactly
It is in same loop permanently
>and never will
Nothing lasts forever
I'm honestly surprised they're not trying harder to ensure sea access in the Danish strait, historically it's been one of the main geographic factors hindering Russia's geopolitical strength and even economic development
Sorry but NO
Fuck all Russians
No political correctness here
You have managed to have fucked up government for 100 years who occupy, kill and rape other nations
And even now this moment you have such government
At last you should take some responsibility for this
Your nation could have slipped ones or twice
But you really had something humane only for 10ish years since 1990-2000
Russia is a flat circle
Wait till many Russians demand that you be thankful for "liberating" you from Nazis in about 2½ weeks ;)
LOL
Russians are the biggest snowflakes
My narrative is one sided - because only one side is still arguing that ethnic cleansing was "acceptable" and acts like they own the whole of eastern europe
When there's a stable consensus in Russian society about the evils of mass murder and mass deportations - then you can come back with this bunkum claim
And no
I'm not going to be "thankful", just because some ignorant person on the internet told me to be
My both parents are Russian and my existence is miracle already
because the same communists already killed ¾ of my family by 1940 and exiled my family to central asia twice after that

The ridiculousness of oversaturarion in this pic takes away from its beauty
It's a super cool idea, but the cost of building this comes around at a million to few million euros, so it's a huge investment +taking into consideration that the movement on a highway is stopped for at least a few days it's a huge cost
It's a super cool idea and it's a good thing to build them, I was even lucky enough to see a highway in Alberta full of these, but what I took away from it, is that building a strech of road long enough, for these to be effective is just too costly for the near future

Haven't heard this idiom in Lithuania
Not in my surroundings at least
Some people may say something similar to "you're speaking Chinese" and Lithuanians would understand the phraseology, but it's not commonly used
What I *have* heard (and used myself) is a phase "bird language", as in "you're speaking bird language
" Personally I would use this phrase when describing a language I don't understand or the one that sounds very foreign, also when somebody's describing something in very specific or technical terms that I don't understand
Eh, bird language is more commonly used in this context than Chinese
Once again Lithuania and Latvia are missing
What is bizzare is that I never heard in Lithuania "It's like Chinese to me", so I googled, and the only usage of the phrase is in various dictionaries
So, literally no one says that in Lithuania
Just to be more interesting,
In Lithuania we also say "paukščių kalba" - bird's language
Personally I hear this idiom way more than "Chinese"
What a polished pun
and they pack bananas in plastic
Well this war helped us to break free from Russian Empire
Quite sad that German Empire didn't win this one
You concider this a victory
20 million people dead and you think this is a victory
Sure, it gave many nations independence
The second world war at least had a point
Eliminating evil
But in WW1 no-one achieved anything
Made the life of Europeans even worse
As the war gave birth to the soviet union and the nazi party
So I wouldn't consider it a victory
More of a loss to all countries
Like I mentioned, many countries gained independence with blood and hard work
Mine did too
It's just a fact, that generally speaking, the war didn't have a point
It started with a wrong guy being in the wrong place
And it's effects on the world are still seen today
Almost half of the dead were civilian casualties
The war was the cause of the Russian revolution, and the Nazis
While there were good things achieved, and they impact modern society today, they barely outweight the bad things

Tips depend on the time you spend here
But I would say, visit Vilnius and Trakai
Book something in the old town of Vilnius, its not expensive
Then visit Klaipeda and the curonian spit
Visit our UNESCO heritage dunes
Its something really
I would advise to have at least 3 days for a stay in Lithuania
It will be packed, and you wont regret it

You can pick the car up and leave it in designed spots or even other cities
Taste cepelinai and saltibarsciai
Also taste out our beers, you'll like it
We love dutch beer, but I am sure we have worthy beer also
A lot of us speak english
So approach anybody if needed, ofcourse younger people speak better
Lithuania is quite safe, so no special tips for pickpocketing, we dont have that much
Oh, and have a mini umbrella
Some clothes to withstand rain
It rains here, as in the Netherlands I suppose
And enjoy your time
If you need any help, you can write me a PM, or come to r/lithuania , we would be happy to assist you in any matter
Edit: also check this site:
As a Lithuanian expat that lives in the Netherlands, prepare to see less smily people :/
Please research cepelinai and šaltibarščiai
Don't dive head first
I had too many guests not able to stomach both of these dishes
I would rather you have a good opinion of Lithuanian cuisine, that is much broader than those two
And don't get a full portion of cepelinai without knowing what you're getting into - unless you're preparing to participate in a strongman competition
If you wish to have a great culinary experience - book Sweetroot restaurant in Vilnius well in advance
It's one of the most amazing experiences that I had
It takes about 3 hours and costs about €70 per person
Not really, they had cultural superiority but not political
Ive got plenty of guests to smash them both
Its fine, people eat fries all the time, and those are worse than cepelinai for sure
French fries are very simple in flavour
Don't contain minced pork and aren't covered in sour cream with smoked side bacon bits and onions
(I love that, but it's definitely a strong mix of flavours)
The fermented milk is typically the issue with šaltibarščiai
Let alone - those are just total cliché...

Well yeah, but looking back 20 years and you see huge progress everywhere, so there really is nothing special compared to any other european country
Draw a Lithuanian one
Why do they even care
Proving once again - tax funded media is very fallible and majority rule is simply crap
I disagree on the term colonialism used, but Polish Kingdom was definitely imperialistic - Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Russians and Belarusians
I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it has Lithuanian flag inside it

And then do it some more since she will probably die early from obesity related causes
Goddamit Lithuania, we could be cool, be no, marriage is too much
I am honestly amazed how homophobic Lithuania is
The shit they comment on a wholsome post just because it is a gay couple and if they have a kid it is always "poor kid" how is he poor
He has a loving home
Based eastern europe
Estonia did, Lithuania is "thinking" about it, a lot of soviet and religious scum are against it, some of that scum is in parliament, so outcome is not certain
Not sure about Latvia
Nah, the mentality of soviet relics is anti-gay, the mentality of religious nuts who got their freedom from soviets is also anti-gay
It'll be a long time until we see full LGBT acceptance here, which is sad
Soviet shadow still poisons our minds, also relogious nuts
I don't see anything wrong with people being religious, considering in reality religion tells them to respect everyone
It's just a lack of education on the matter mixed with a feeling of supremacy with a facade of "my religion is against this
Not many left in Lithuania parliament
It's very likely to happen soon
Hopefully our first gay parliament (Tomas Raskevičius) member with Armonaitė will change things
I've personally talked with that dude a couple years back, he's incredibly productive and loves helping people out
I'm 100% sure he'll be the first step to improve LGBT issue in our country
In the legal sense I mean, because he's already done a lot of good things for the LGBT community (especially the T part) in five years than the entire government of 20 years work
Hopefully
Well we've recently had an openly gay couple on a magazine, though idk if that LGBT propaganda,and we have had some small scale parades
Lithuania, everyone I know supports gay marriage but not the damn govmt, hence not cool
Backlash based on emotions is irrelevant and invalid anyways
Snowflakes will snowflake
> our first gay parliament (Tomas Raskevičius)
Not the first one in the Parliament, not even the first openly gay MP - there was [Rokas Žilinskas] before him
Raskevičius is definitely much more active and outspoken about the equal rights, though
Oh, completely forgot about him, you're right thank you for correcting me
Well I the younger ppl do, it's just that the more conservative parties keep getting elected, by older ppl
I love how something only concerning gay people isn't decided by gay people
Democracy failure
So they want to "seem progressive" instead of
actually being progressive

Ukraine is not a EU or NATO member, so backing them against Russia would technically be an act of aggression rather than one of defence

We lithuanians had to decomission our only nuclear powerplant - the Ignalina NPP
It used the same RBMK reactors that Chernobyl did
The decomissioning was one of the requirements to join the EU in 2004
It's mostly wood, not solar or anything
We're still burning shit
Generation losses plus transmission losses is in the same ballpark as vehicle internal combustion engine energy losses
With the current infrastructure and technology electric isn't always the cleanest option, it's just that it is easier to deal with the pollution of power plants versus various methods of pollution that is caused by individuals such as by driving personal vehicles
Some politicians in Lithuania said that the people responsible for these sham elections will be banned from entering Lithuania, and we'll work to ban them from entering EU at all
EU can't force it's member states to do so, but if the member states decided to do it on their own I don't think there is anything that could stop them
I'd like to note that obesity in Lithuania is very age-specific
Old people (and especially old grandmas) genuinely don't give a fuck and they mostly eat a carbohydrate diet (pastas, porridges, potato dishes) which makes them balloon
Obesity among the post-Soviet generation isn't widespread, it's actually fairly rare and the "Healthy at any size" movement isn't sticking
Cross refrence this with a map showing  bullying experienced by children in europe
Holy shit, and they say Eastern Europe is bad

Surely OP is referring to Dalia Grybauskaitė, a karate black belt
As a Lithuanian I can confirm that the president is much more scarier to fight than any bodyguard
She is a fucking black belt and can fire guns like a pro

The woman is the Lithuanian president

Poland is like Europe's China, they make everything

Man I remember in 00s I saw Google like: "Yeah they are big but at the same time they are doing bunch of cool and *good* things". And years before they even removed the "Don't be evil" motto it turned to "fuckers are too big and went from doing *good things* to straight up illegal shit".
EDIT: Some comments pop up, so - Yes, they didn't remove the [Don't be evil] from their code of conduct
Just trimmed the explanation and moved it slightly to [the very end as a footnote/last sentence] My mistake but either way this is a shift in culture either way

"Every kid that was sent to a GULAG and starved to death was a Nazi imperialist, who totally deserved it because America did slavery 100 years ago".
These cheap ass bots aren't even trying to look reasonable
Nobody is insane enough to escalate any conflict into nuclear exchange, not even North Korea, its an atrocity and could escalate other countries to resort to nuclear weapon usage, which has catastrophic potential to undo human development in centuries or millennia even
On other hand, joining the NATO reduces the chance of these countries becoming targets of conventional war because they have the deterrent that both Ukraine and Georgia lacked
Technically only Albania
It was in pact like for month :D Still counts as one
Regardless of where you are, if nukes get involved, it will cause a chain reaction and all of humanity is doomed

Basketball: I feel this one is obvious

Curd snack: that red square underneath the cat is a sweet snack made from curd cheese
[Specifically this one] I would call it a small cheesecake instead of a curd snack (courtesy of Wikipedia
Pink Soup: a traditional Lithuanian cold beet soup often enjoyed during the summer (but don't try and stop me)
[Almost as popular as pubs in UK
Vilnius TV Tower: one of the biggest symbols of Vilnius and whole Lithuania
A historical monument that represents freedom from USSR occupation
[see January Killings]
Necklace: not sure about this one
It could either be [dehydrated apples] or "baranka" ([Russian bublik]
Books: "Dievų miškas" (Forest of the Gods) a very dramatic memoir about concentration camps
"Balta drobulė" (White Shroud) an eclectic psychological book about life in WWII Lithuania and USA
"Altorių šešėly" (In the Shadow of Altars) dramatic take on the thoughts and doubts of a priest
[Gediminas' Tower] top shelf
The symbol of Vilnius and the only remaining part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Castle of Gediminas

Šakotis: bottom shelf
Although regarded as a German pastry, Šakotis or the tree cake is now synonymous with Lithuania
[It has a very difficult making technique] and is often brought as a gift
The book in bookshelf (top one)is Forest of god's by Balys Sruoga my favourite I have read it like million times and yes it have English version
Unrealistic
"Altorių šešėly" should be [thicker]
(Jk of course this looks great)
It looks very Lithuanian, but the TV tower is blue at night
But great job
Everything is very on point, well done
There's a basketball, šaltibarščiai, sūrelis, TV tower, mushrooms and one of my favorite Lithuanian books, Dievų Miškas (Forest of Gods)
It's a dark comedy about life in a nazi concentration camp

Baumkuchen is a bit different isn't it
It's layered and smooth, the dough is added with a paintbrush looking thing
funny thing, I took the book today from my school's library for Lithuanian class
And now I see it here lol
No they are not
Dont be misteken by the name
company is in Luksiai, Šakiu country
Šakotis is layered too, the dough is poured on it while it slowly rotates over a fire
A lot of people colloquially call šakotis "baumkuchenas" or "bankuchenas".
It's a great book
The only book I enjoyed reading from start to finish at school for Lithuanian classes
doesn't matter, had snack :)
Maybe the paper packaged ones are made in LT and plastic packaged in LV ? ... I could swear I read it's made in Latvia on one package, but no matter, HAD SNACK :)
I've had a bunch that were pretty cool: Benedikto slenksčiai was a cool book but I think it's new in the system, Faust was also very fascinating
Altorių šešėly has good reviews but it's pretty damn long
700 pages for 2 weeks of schooltime lol

Basically when all major governmental Polish figures died in Russia, in that "accidental" plane crash, Polish people should have been very careful of new election, but they failed and now a Russian puppet is in place and will have Poland leave EU and join the sphere of RU
:/ wish the best of luck to Poles, the road ahead might get bumpy for a few decades to come if not the right choices are made
That's the worst part of it, Russia is already at a point of no return
In this age of information, governments can monitor their subjects easier than ever before and in the coming decade, AI will be sophisticated enough to wade through all internet trafic flagging subjects of interest and automatically calling for a government sancioned hit on the "perpetrator".

I sure hope you are right, by this "Money was always the states pressure point and now this stronghold slowly crumbles" I assume you have in mind crypto-currencies, you might be right, but they already understood the scope of change these currencies can bring, so state initiatives to regulate them are already popping up
Well, good luck and I do actually mean that
It must be hard to live in Russia as an open minded individual
Yeah I have to strongly disagree with this statistic that shows Lithuanian media is 28th and its classified as a problematic while Uruguay had multiple incidents of journalist being hurt in recent years, but sits in 19th place
Our tv channels that we have here are not biased, but based on objective facts and not opinions, lies or propaganda and there is plenty of news and articles that are critical to gov on factual basis . And Lithuanian news sites that we have are also mostly the same: reporting factual news, stories and opinions like what experts think on certain subject
Government here basically never interfere with press freedom and there never as long as i can remember was and incident were Journalist was harassed, beaten, jailed or even killed
When i looked in there assessment of Lithuanian press freedom they wrote about quite miniscule incident ( about how main party of Lithuania tried somewhat temper with press freedom here, which is of course bad, but of course it was denounced and they simply backtracked it )
So basically we have here high standards for press freedom and i would only say that we have to improve more civil activism to protest and etc

>If you were to describe the idea of capitalism to people living under feudalism, they'd laugh you out of the room
Char 1 - the radical thinker-capitalist:
\- I have a radical new idea
How about the people that own the land or the tools keep the results of their work
Char 2 the peasant:
\- Well duh, that's how it works
\- And those people that make money pay a part of it to the local rulers to fund the military, build civic buildings like town halls, markets, roads and give alms to the poor
\- Again that's nothing new, except the church helps the poor, but I suppose that the rulers could do that too
\- And we elect our rulers
\- You mean like we elect the our elder or the guild master
\- Yeah all that and even the king and the dukes
\- Like they do in the Holy roman empire, Venice and Poland-Lithuania
\- Yeah like that
Capitalism would not really surprise a lot of medieval/feudal people, especially if they were from the merchant/tradesmen class
Pretty much the only difference is that you in most cases only lowest officials were elected, and now you pay something like 40% of your income in tax while in the middle ages you paid 10-20%.
Pretty much in every city all over Europe
Most lower officials (elders, guild masters and some other "bureaucrats") were elected and the townspeople had fairly extensive rights
Of course same does not extend in most cases to serfs
And most elements of the capitalist economic model have been going on form much longer then people give them credit just like the few that I mentioned in my shitpost:
Owner of the means of production decides what happens with the production
Wage labour was the norm for the majority of the population (farmers work the nobles fields, they pay a part of the harvest as tax and keep the rest - their wage
Free farmers were exempt from it
Taxation for public services (fewer services, more corruption and lower taxation but you get the point)
International trade with developed networks (when in the 16-th century the Brits chopped down all the yew trees used for making longbows, they started importing staves from the Baltic Hanza towns)
Beautiful buildings
Constantinople will return to Greek rule one day
Muffled bouzouki to the south and balalaika to the north
It looks like a building from the last of us
Yea
These 30 years of independence were quite good
Can we please continue
We have laser industry, time to start building a large black station with turbolaser to ensure stability and our security
Yea
seems likely looking into your piss party and our peasants
Construction stopped because it was more expensive than expected
Now it's been sitting like this for quite a while
I went there recently, locals said that it will probably never be finished
It's basically abandoned now, glass is cracked, construction is rusty, fixing everything back up would cost more than tearing it all down and starting from scratch
Well thats a very 2020ish way to end the year
Where the heck is this
Looks like it could be Rēzekne, considering how run down it looks
Can always buy a handheld torch
Minus UK
Must be nice not to border Russia
Doesn't russia really hate gays
I mean I heard that at one point putin banned teching kids that homosexuals exist
I might be wrong, but from the interviews with random people on the street in russia about this topic I've seen that most people don't like homosexuals and believe they shouldn't be allowed to kiss/hug/hold hands in the public
Any russians here who can confirm or deny
Edit: I personally don't think these things and in my opinion they are absolutely outrageous
I'm just curious as to what the russian reddit community thinks about it
Well to be fair, from my short one-week visit, Italian women seemed very resistant to aging
During this time they could have shown support to Belarus instead
What a legend
yeah fuck abortions
I can smell the rubber
Eurobeat intensifies
You can't drive semi trucks on this road
I don't have much knowledge about car engines, but in that case there would be no fuel injection only air right
so with diesel which itself provides lubrication to cylinders would driving for so long could cause damage to engine
It mostly depends on the size of the engine, bigger ones brake more
Hey chapo tankies just a friendly reminder that Stalin was a homophobe and Lenin ordered execution of sex workers
I hear the rumbling of a thousand tankies converging on this thread
While Lithuania does indeed try to show the horrors of the russian and soviet occupations, I wish someone here would do such a bold and strong move like the Estonians over here
Well done
Keep it up
"N-Not true communism
Lmao, it's funny how chapocels call this subreddit fashit cause of this post
Btw, Estonia is in the right here, if that isn't obvious
Well you are posting on reddit, which is basically a leftist sanctuary
According to them, only the Nazis committed genocide in history
They're struggling with right-populism atm, EKRE party is a real shitshow and is more than willing to suppress democratic values
Not to boast but I feel like Lithuania is doing a better job than Estonia, when it comes to preservation of democracy
Capitalism has lifted the most people out of the poverty this is a fact
I went to future once, I only found a memorial commemorating the awfulness of your takes
OK Anglo
Chapos lierally enraged rn, saying that this sub is fashist because of this post, lmao
Coming from the guy who lived in the lamest country in Yugoslavia
And what is the issue
Many Estonians fought and died on both sides of the war
USSR was a Russian imperialism project, the polled support or hostility towards USSR aligns with polled opinion towards current Russia more than anything
This is a dumb take
The percentages of people living in poverty are steadily dropping, so are stats like preventable disease deaths or child mortality - and subsistence farming in preindustrial conditions is a very fickle affair with constant famines and other misfortunes
That somehow makes me feel better about my country, and that is a very rare feeling
LITHUANIAN HERE
CAN CONFIRM
I love this architecture
So calming and in sync with nature
Lovely town
/u/FellowRedditeer/ account is only spamming the same thing about Finland's conpiracy memes for the last year
can we get him banned
Finland does not exist
exists
nice try
The test and maybe treatment idk is free in Lithuania
Dark side vs light side
Just want to note that I didnt take this picture, I found it on internet
Thank you all for rewards
These shields are common all around Eastern Europe, including my own country
Do you even know what this is
They arent that heavy tho, my country has the same
Do you even know the situation in Belarus
Its not about hating police
Its about struggle for democracy
They literally took their soviet flag and removed sickle and hammer
Hey, I didnt mean to seem rude, just asked
I think that if you fight (peacefully as long as possible) for what you believe is right and dont cause problem for the others (unlike most protests in US atm), you are a good person
Damn, really sad to see no rating for Vatican :(
Distributing pornography is illegal in Lithuania
That's probably a bigger reason
stinks
I know like 3 people who actually believe in god
I think religion is very much overestimated in Lithuania
[For the downvote]
Lol, my grandma
That's 'bout it :D
I think my culture was more influenced by kebab kiosk behind the corner than the church
Yeah I always found our year counting stupid
I would more call it a mark in history, rather than influence
If it wouldn't be counted since "death of Jesus" it would be called something else
Still has the same number of days
I don't know, but I am pretty sure we can find something better
Year 2000 sounds so wrong when you knows there is a lot more of it
Aciu visi
See you on March 11th when our next independence day is celebrated
On behalf of all Lithuanians, I thank you
Aww, thanks bro
Fun fact: because of this reason we have Iceland street in Vilnius and in other towns
You'll be invited on March 11th to celebrate our second independence day
I'm pretty sure, that the Germans were the first to recognize the 1918 February 16th declaration of independence
What about Moldova
Every Lithuanian knows this and we're beyond grateful
That's why every year we say [Takk, Ísland
Dziękuje bardzo :)
It was probably King Mindaugas Day
It's also a big nationwide celebration
free Catalonia
still cute
No, our birthday is on February 16th
Lithuania is independent for 103 years now
Now gib Suvalki
Yeah, you guys demonstred a very strong balls back then, and you deserve to be proud
We are forever grateful
We've had enough of Russia's surprises, thanks
not again
Exept if you're **Actual** commies, Not the bootleg stalinist ones, But i guess if it would be real commies, they wouldn't be invading us all the **god damn** time
Which ones
Besides the UK, they hate everyone
I said we are independent for 103 years, as a country Lithuania was first mentioned in 1009
That's good enough for me
woah, wtf, you wouldn't want any power to do that, especially usa or ussr, I'm a communist, but i hate tankies/totalitarians, and have seen the flaws they made, and it angers me to see that people paint communism as 1 ideology, Preety much as saying that all right wingers are nazis
NI wishes to reunify are at an all time high, Scotland wants independence - soon UK will only consist of England and Wales, lol
NI wishes to reunify are at an all time high, Scotland wants independence - soon UK will only consist of England and Wales, lol
Lithuania learned from Italians and shut everything off hardcore in March, as soon as a few cases started appearing
Now new cases are only a few per day, and deaths - one per week
Masks and distancing works, just like it worked here, the rest of Europe, Canada, Asia, etc
America, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
It's the same wall Witcher poster was on
Nopians sure do confuse themselves with Lithuania a lot
or just pay attention in geography class
> longest history
What
>Latvia should be Litva
Why
you means us and Latvians or just us, cuz both are accurate
I am Samogitian and spend so much time with Latvians i can unironicaly understand them so good for me lol
More people -> more internet browsing history -> more history
Problem is that Lithuania's original name is *Lietuva*, which is closer to *Litva* than *Latvija* is
Russians and Polish also call LT *Litva*/*Litwa*. Although another [false friend] between Czech and Russian would be par for the course
>and think we sound Russian
Because we have palatalized (soft) sounds (shared feature in Lithuanian, Russian and Belarusian languages)
> Spoken language is completely unintelligible
I spent about a week in Latvia once (mostly with Latvians) and after 3 or 4 days of asking about certain common words and phrases that are different and getting the hang of them, I was surprised by how much I could understand
So I'd say 'completely unintelligible' is a little too strong
Why would anyone think that living right next door to a volcano is a good idea
Not to mention that this one is known for multiple eruptions and burying an entire city
Unless housing next to the volcano is cheap enough to be close to being free, I'm pretty sure there are always some choices, especially in the 21st century when people aren't tied down to the same village for their whole lives
Also, it’s just one moment
Bride and Groom definitely had many other face expressions during the ceremony
What a sad outlook
You just sound like a very selfish person who would probably have no issues with watching his country destroyed by an invading force
People fought and died for their countries only for selfish, entitled people to say that the nation means nothing
It’s an obligation to your ancestors, family, neighbours
Whatever country you are born in
What good is in throwing it away
Cool, how about every Croat moves to Germany
How about every single Eastern European, African, Asian who have hard lives all move to Germany
People help improve the country
Just like those students who move to countries outside of Romania would be making Romania a better place if they stayed
People fleeing persecution is a completely different argument
I have some family members who escaped the Soviet advance to Germany
It’s a completely different argument to emigration
Tell me how you are suffering
If anything that is an insult to those who actually suffered persecution during wars and occupation etc
So, you personally
Not many streets in Belarus worth looking at anyway
I feel offended when baltic states are not marked
Such a clever memorial
Really shocking
Lithuanian here, there are 2 limits on our motorways
The left lane is limited to around 170kmh due to our poor quality roads, and the right lane is around 100-120kmh where all the slow cars drive
Germany looks so nice
Speeding fines are tiny and insignificant, so nobody really cares about these limits
I've been there and it's just as spectacular [from close up]
It was absolutely insane seeing this in real life a few years ago
Surreeaaaal
Americans: Sorry, I only understand guns per eagle reservoirs
Hopefully you guys won't end up like Ukraine

Bruh, never in history has lithuania had any other name for beer
I've searched for lithuanian beer synonims and these ar all that came up: Putokšlis, Miežienis, Gira, Birbalas, Birzgalas, Bizalas, Bizalakas, Pirmalakas, Pirmokas, Pirmašakis, Antralakas, Antrokas, Antrašakis
Translations to all the ones that start with "P": Foamer, Firstdrinker, First grader, First brancher
Poland trying to be russian :)
So heavily guarded
Because they have zero issues with each other unlike India and China
I would totally Czech that place out
Germany is the epicenter of the railway it seems
There is a dark joke in this somewhere
This is stunning
this photo reminds me of my dog who passed away recently
We bought him pink flowers and on that day, the sky was all pink
Now every time i see pink sky’s, it reminds me of him
He was a poodle and we always joked he was a Frenchman
This post in general just reminds me of him
Rikis, i love you <3
look at this dude
This is the best one of all
bruh
Bullshit, most of UK live in apartments
A house is when you have no wall with neighbours
What they call houses is just an apartment with entrance straight from outside
So you're saying that now is the time to go on vacation there
Lukashenko named as "Illegal president of Belarus" on Lithuanian national TV news
Literally on point with Lukashenkos position title
Nothing, literally nothing can be done otherwise
Kick out Cyprus, vote, accept it back, repeat
But for real tho why are they voting against
Actually Lithuanian language is tightly tied with sanskrit
It thought to be an oldest language in Europe
Yes
Most archaic\*
>"apsišaukėlis" (impostor, pretender)
"Self-proclaimed" is probably the best translation
Impostor/pretender is "apsimetelis".
makes sense
isnt that the same
It's more that Lithuanian language has changed least from proto-Indo-European language
Same with Sanskrit and old Greek
E.g. Ugnis (LT) vs Agnis (skrt
) or Pilis (LT) vs Polis (GR)
No, it is not the same
That's their ideology, so yes
Why
They're totalitarian dystopian shit hole that massacred and mass starved their own population
All communist states are like this
2018-02-16 is Lithuania’s Independence day 100 year anniversary
Soon you’re going to have Lithuania all over r/europe
Post it
And we're just sitting here, waiting to celebrate our 100^th anniversary for the first and the 28^th anniversary for the second declaration of independence
Thanks, but you a few months early
We have one independence celebration on February 16^th and another on March 11^th
How will the Russians try to get Lithuania in its sphere of influence
We hardly have any Russians here
They're a minority in every place in Lithuania, except for a small town called Visaginas
I'm from /r/all what are the protests about
My people should learn a thing or two from yours about standing up for themselves
Best of luck to you all
Also problem here in Lithuania somewhat
But most people aren't partisan, a lot of people call EU "socialist" and "new world order" that need to be removed
But a lot of people also don't like Russia at all, most people are neutral about it because of this facts
Why would you ask to come for dinner and not mean it
What kind of evil horrible person would do that
Burn in hell
That's and interesting new phone model
anglophone :/
Seriously
Some Brits say "You 'right
" instead of a normal "Hello" and for the first three days of uni I assumed that everyone was just very curious and caring
everyone in that room seems to be thinking 'this is so unnecessary'

Wtf, 39,4 from Lithuania
Didn't even knew we export it
I heard talks about starting to import, but didn't knew we send it to Poland
Looks beautiful
What the fuck
Ah yes, cultural heritage of having people who are deemed "superior" just because they are born into a certain family
:) Such sophistication
Naivety
Just you wait until it gets all dirty like every other metro in the world
u/RepostSleuthBot
Oh, how great an RPG would be in this setting
I can already hear angry Estonian noises far in the distance approaching very very slowly
I think that we should just start dividing stuff in to "Wine Europe", "Beer europe", "Vodka Europe" and be done with it
Baltic states, Central
so it is in central northeast
I consider Baltic states as northern Europe, but whatever
Baltic countries are not central europe
its more like northeast
How the fuck are the Baltics Central Europe
If there is a southeastern Europe, why isn’t there a northeastern Europe
(Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, northern Russia)
In my opinion, Europe can be divided into these regions based on socioeconomic and cultural factors: Eastern Europe (all former communist countries), Southern Europe (basically PIGS countries + Malta and Cyprus), Northern Europe (the same as is shown in the OP's map) and Western Europe (every country that doesn't belong to the aforementioned regions)
I know that people from former communist countries don't like being called Eeastern Europeans, but it was the Cold War and its aftermath that defined Europe as it is
And trying to label your country as Central European or Northern European is just delusional
I see that Lithuania tag lol
Yes
Yeah, I was surprised that Baltics were assigned to Central Europe
I never thought about my country that way
I can see Poland as Central Europe, but Lithuania
Geographically we're Northern Europe, culturally we're central due to heavy Catholic/Lutheran influence
The thing is that most people still use cold war stigmas on ex commie countries and that's annoying as hell
>Culturally, geographically, and socially, we are Eastern European
No we aren't.
We are northern europe, not central
As of recent years ~2016 something
That's the straightest nonsense bullshit I ever heard
Yes
Yes we are
This is cultural proxomity biased map though
Geographically we are more in North than Denmark and more in West and Finland
No, at least I always thought of Lithuania as belonging to Eastern Europe
Due to cold war stigma
[Hi fellow Orthodox brother]
How so
Mm now that you said it
Correct
hey dude, why does your location say spain, if you're actually vilnietis
Oh fuck, thank you so much for reminding me of Asterix
I loved that shit when I was a kid but completely forgot about it since
Yeah, it should say "Portugal"
ah, lithuanian girlfriend (or boyfriend), huh
well, I guess we got the finest of both genders
The fact, that China isn't even on the list, says a lot
Vilnius in 1940 vs Vilnius in 2020
that goddamn useless pipe near the river or so called art
Labai gražus miestas
Bardzo piękne miasto
If anyone wants to visit Vilnius PM me
I work in the nicest and biggest hotel in the city centre and I could organise some nice trips and sightseeings
The bottom picture is wrong
The picture on the bottom was taken probably in 2010 - 2011
Thanks I lol'ed
Vilnius resident here
Fuck that fuckin pipe
Yes, hello I'm one of them
There's a fair number of them in the suburbs, not so many in the city itself
Studentas
Never thought about it
But according to some googling
Out of 44 European capitals 12 don't have rivers flowing through them:
Monaco, Monaco
Athens, Greece
Copenhagen, Denmark
Lisbon, Portugal
Nicosia, Cyprus
San Marino, San Marino
Stockholm, Sweden
Valletta, Malta
Chisinau, Moldova
Tallinn, Estonia
Tirana, Albania
Vatican City, Vatican City State
It is kinda hard to could Stokholm or Copenhagen :D They are basically on water anyways
Probably not any time soon tho
It's "Art"
Sometimes im the summer it does get a bit dry, but in this case I think it's just a filter on these photos
you can see on the riverside in the second photo, i believe it cost city around 29k euro, and it's truly miserably looking nowadays
Yeah Russian is more common as second language in city
I would say even English is easier to go around
Polish is basically only for native poles
So maybe 1 in 5 chance you will meet one
It was supposed to be temporary installation at first, but never got taken down for many reasons, no one knows anymore
But the artist said it was supposed to make people think about and discuss the purpose and goals of art in public places, whatever that means
Most people hated it and still do
It has some but I wouldn't say "many". According to 2016 data, there were over 40k students in Lithuanian schools and just  3600 in Polish schools
Yup, people are still talking about it when they see it in some photo
Half the population hates it, other half enjoys listening to their angry ramblings, "Hurr durr, pensions are small yet they spend money on this rusty pipe".
Pretty sure overwhelming majority of people like artworks only if they look nice
This is not one of those artworks
If people hate it, it shouldn't be there
Yup, you got it
Many people don't.
why did you remove all the posts about muslims youths rioting in a church in Vienna ?
is the discussion of islamic threat only allowed when it takes lives ?
just answer the question you coward
We've got way too much potato
Not realistic
So Latvia can finally into potato
This is the most accurate representation of Europe I had ever seen
I really like this, but why am I in the potato land
Shouldn't Ireland be potatoes
us too, I guess
Haven't you ever seen a cabbage ? wait that looks more like a strawberry actually
I live in potato land so I know that this is very accurate
uh UH NO NO
WELL
better than Russia I guess
but still come on
i thought we were bros :(
That's beautifully put
if only history was teached this way, people would be way more interested
Amazing

I seriously started clapping, what a wonderful speech

That was the point of EU but that's not what it is right now sadly
Just because something originally had a great idea but changed over time isn't immune to criticism
Today was -28 in Vilnius 6 a.m
Screw mosquitos, our real problem is ticks
We need another week or so of these temps to hit them well

>Baltics, you're still Russians, right
This will get you beaten in no time
That shit is nothing to joke about here
Almost as bad as saying to a black person "Remember the times when your kind were slaves
Good times, right
As a Lithuanian living in America, I get asked this all the time
You hit it right on the head of the nail
Lithuania: WILNO NASZE
That would do the job and maybe start a war
I think calling us Russians is bad, but that's pure ignorance, at least it has a reason, soviet occupation and all that
The worse thing would be calling us Slavs
Now *that's* fucked up
If I had a euro for every time someone says that about the Baltic States
I'm from the Baltics and the sentence about us didn't annoy me at all
Nah, the only way you'd get beaten is if you said this to a skinhead or smth, otherwise people would just get annoyed and correct you
Westerners are known to make this mistake
Of course
My comment was just an exaggeration of the truth

Hell yeah, just no Soviet interruptions this time please
Poor poor Estonia ;( What can they do to change the ignorant Nordics
Well, shit, we are as bad as French
The fact that former soviet countries are more proficient in English than Mediterranean countries
Weird but understandable
I guess in Italy and Spain it’s not cool to speak English
Maybe it’s the nationalistic/ fascist past
Like how some in Eastern Europe think it’s a sense of pride to speak Russian and not English
Do you mean
Aia no speaka inglese
Poor Ireland
Wouldn't it make sense to put it on Calais and not the much wider side of 4he channel

Well, Lithuania is giving political asylum to the Tsichanovskaya, who ran for the election against lukashenko, at the moment
It wouldn't be far fetched if she got Lithuanian support in the end
Lithuania-Russia relations are nonexistant anyway
Wont change much
Unless Russia would decide to attack, but then that decision was done long before this
We cared, but it's an internal issue, how are otjer countries supposed to do anything about it
Now that Belarusian people are fighting for change, we support them - wholeheartedly
Lithuanians tend to have a really poor outlook on the Commonwealth
Although Lithuania was the bigger country when it formed, the leadership was all polish, and Lithuanian culture, including the language, was seen as untasteful, and everyone sought to speak polish
In general it's taught here that in the commonwealth, Lithuanians were treated very poorly by the Polish
This subreddit seems to fetishize the commonwealth, but I think most Lithuanians really don't like that point in history and would not accept any sort of coming back to it
If any Lithuanians feel differently, feel free to chime in, I'd love to hear why
In general Lithuanians mostly meme about going back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was the biggest country in Europe at the time, stretching from the baltic to the black seas
I'd rather see the Grand Duchy
Well, since there are 141 members in Seimas and there were 122 attendees, this means  a total of 19 members did not attend, those three among them
No need to single them out
Of course, then there is this Jedzinski guy - [
Kinda shitty of him to use the protests in Belarus for cheap shots against his political opponents
Afaik the European Council will hold an extraordinary meeting on Belarus tomorrow
To add to that Commonwealth was really not a successful country
It lasted that long purely because Poland and Lithuania before commonwealth were quite powerful countries on their own
This
The Commonwealth here isn't looked upon as some sort of "glory days", unlike Poles
Not yet, atleast not officially, but I really hope it's the second step we take
Don't know what you are actually talking about Ukraine
It was long time puppet of Russia
Now it's starting to stand on it's feet, of course it's hard at first- when you drop the shackles of former oppressor and go to war with him, but Ukraine is one of the fastest currently growing economies in Europe and predictions looking nothing but bright
The same could follow for Belarus or better depends how this all goes down
And the EU part, from my understanding Belarusian people don't currently have a wish for it, that's why we don't see Russian tanks running around Minsk already
It partly is becouse of it
Some of us are kinda insulted by you guys calling Piłsudski a national hero, becouse to us he was an enemy
That's how they get you
That's why Lithuania bought/rented(kinda stupid decision but whatever) a LNG Carrier "Independance" to literally say fuck you to Russian as in "You won't pull us on that string anymore
Belgium isn't that big after all
"your mother was a hamster"?
This is how all renovations of older buildings in Europe should look like
"No-go zones" is the one thing Trumps administration was as actually right about
In a number of places in west EU
Of course Americans tend to generalize Europe as this one and same place, so they have a bad time with geography
You got Lithuania wrong
We have the best from our neighbors
The blet and kurva are goin strong
"Keikti
" in Lithuanian is just "To swear
", the most common national one I can think of is "Po venių!"
Shit map
Source: Lithuania
For Lithuania "keikti
" means "to swear
". Such a meta nonsense
Go to swear yourself
The Lithuanian one is not even a swear word, it's just a verb meaning 'to swear'.
This is why I hate maps like these
People who make them often have no expertise on the subject and just rely on the first results on Google, apparently
Lithuanian is very wrong
It's "Kurva
" or "Blet
We in Lithuania don't even use our swear words
Keikti in lithuanian is literally "to curse". We don't really have a lot of vulgar swearwords
We have "šūdas" which means "shit", but other than that, not a lot
We sometimes say blemba, but it's not really a swearword
In lithuanian keikti just means swearing
... keikti
Keikti
Lithuania: Keikti means swear(as in insult swear) fuck is Pisti
This map sucks
Lithuania is wrong
Wtf is "keikti" I've never heard a lithuanian say that, like never, We say "BLET" or "KURVA" or "BYBYS"
Keikti
This litterally means "to swear" lol
Yeah, this map on Lithuania literally says "to swear", not "fuck".
How did people make this map

Hey we have a native one
"Bybys
" AFAIK, it's the one and true Lithuanian curse word
Plenty of colorful variations too
Neither does Lithuania
Noone swears in Lithuanian, we all use loaned swear words from Russia or Poland
*Also keikti makes absolutely no sense, it's not even a swear word, it just says „to swear“*
Just "velnias".
They googled "How to swear in Lithuanian". Google thought he wanted to know what is "to swear" in Lithuanian from that query
Extremely poor research for this post, OP
Nah, "Kad tave šikantį sutrauktų" (loose translation - "I hope you get cramps while you are shitting") is the king
Ką?
Šitas irgi dažnas, bet truputį nuobodesnis žodis
Nooo, you're wayy off, "Kad į tavo subinę elnio ragai Įstrigtų" Is the best, Translation: "May the deer's horns get stuck in your arse
Never heard that one to be honest
it's a Dzūkijos thing

my all time top comment is now a racial slur

Finally
I don't think it was called anything else than Čekija in Lithuanian, but I thought it was disrespectful or something to call it Czechia in English too
why tho
Guys im dying ovh in lithuania
idk how people survive in France etc

GET OUT OF MY BOG
I like that Georgia is there too
Interesting *coughs in 2008*
Ok, we need to climb the ranking
I won't be satisfied at no
Russia should definitely be on the list
Even the ones down under got on the list
First - Eurovision, now here
Good job Aussies
Unfienwy countwies
Well if a country is in that list, it's gotta be doing something right
As a Lithuanian, I am honoured to be "unfriendly country" to Russia
Bulgaria, welcome to the children sandbox disputes
The competition is tough
They should make groups in the future, if the list grows bigger
Australia too
Damn, welcome to the club, i guess
As if we would participate in that
Hello friend
**One of us
One of us
One of us
Austria is one of the more pro russia countries in EU
There's no way there are making the list
that's how it should be
Because there are so many Europeans in Australia
wish i had these mountains here
How’s it’s going there
There was some dumb bitch running around sick, spreading corona in the bars
I dodged a bullet, I came back from there two weeks ago
Hope this stuff is gonna blow over soon and responsible will get what’s coming to them
Looks like it could be a Nazi sculpture as well
can you provide names for uhmmm investigative purposes
Poor Icelanders
No jokes in Czechia this time looks like
It's so much more difficult to release a minister in Lithuania it seems
When they gets hold of that post
Oh man they will hang on
Not that bad
Few weeks ago our parliament declined a law that would've established civil unions only because it would also let same-sex couples to register partnership, so you know
Blitzkrieg
Looks like Lithuanians just won't feel comfortable in general
what the fuck, Lithuania
I'm disappointed in my own country
Goddammit Lithuania
Checks out
For 3 out of 4 i'm a very big no
"Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with a person
20-29% comfortable
Feels uncomfortable man
> colour
No thank you
You are disappointed because not everyone is a sheep thinking like they're told to
People have their own opinions
Yes, that includes race mixing
What's disappointing about that
Ah yes, the classic 'only my opinion is valid, everyone else is sheep' comment
Don't see a lot of those around the shops, so you'd be owning a monopoly
Well not really
I think both sides of people are right because everyone has free will
We're no longer communist
This isn't about letting or not letting, this is about liking it or not liking it
People can do whatever they want as long as its their own free will that led them to the choice
But that doesn't mean that they are entitled to being liked
as everyone has the right to be disappointed, too, so what are you doing trying to undermine my disappointment
you don't make sense
I didn't think about that
Good point
that took guts
And the dunce next to him mixed up Baltics with Balkans
I bet our presidents were really happy to hear that they were responsible for the Yugoslav wars from Mister Trumpet
Wouldn't be america if they didn't mess up European names
Shit man, I really hated that show as a kid, fast foward some 10 years i realized its pretty good and should not be taken as serious as I took it, plus all these Number One memes made me actually reconsider myself and start loving it, shit I'm so sad right now , the man looked so happy and enjoyed what he did
RIP
Oh god no, I watched one of his videos just yesterday :(
Rest in peace, Stefan, you will be missed by me and so many others
It was an honor to live on the same planet with a man as talented as you
Amazing, I really like it
I'm tempted to do one about Lithuania
Those are some stupid high costs you got there
[Telia's] most expensive plan in Lithuania costs the same as the cheapest one in the page you linked, while offering the same calls&SMS and way more data
By the way, it might seem like there's not a lot of data on any of the plans, but since Telia merged with Teo Group ( largest telecom, internet and cable provider in Lithuania), with each plan you get unlimited Wi-Fi access covering most of the capital anyways
Is there a higher resolution version out there
This would make a great wallpaper
Now both irl and in minecraft ill have to go far away to find pretty landscapes :( Lithuania looks FLAT
Look at us, geting all big and mighty, then disappearing, then popping back into existence (in min-sized), then disappearing, then finally reappearing (min-sized+)
Lithuania :((((((
Well, first there were those christian orders that were quite a force, then there was Russia, then Sweden, then more Russia, and then more Sweden, then we got split by Prussia, Russia and Austria
More or less, we tried, but fighting strong countries (sometimes against both Sweden and Russia), and being in between a few countries isn't easy
But without the lousy politicians
I think I read that the veto was overused, so caused some serious problems to the country
We were one of the biggest ones at one point
2nd largest
The map also shows how hard it was to have lands towards west europe, but easier going towards the black sea

Fuck the whole system, TOR and VPNs it is then
They can continue to live in their illusionary world
Yall are idiots
How are they going to enforce this
They can't. I'm just gonna post links and memes all over the place and they won't be able to do anything about it
Actually I checked my Lithuania
Would be same as Latvia
So at least in Lithuania issue is domestic violence
Which is connected to high alcohol consumption and people in social risk families
Drunk people killing each other
Huge problem we try to reduce
But with upcoming crisis and increased unemployment will probably just worsen

2008 a beer in a bar in Lithuania/Vilnius was 1 euro, 2021 its 3
It's the same ethnic group as Finland, so in a way
I know it's a joke, but LT/Poland border to Tallinn is 655 KM by the straightest road possible
That's pretty much the same distance as crossing Germany from west to east from BeNeLux
My road trips through the Baltics were usually about a weak long and I'm usually just doing Latvia/Estonia
I think they were talking about Luxembourg there
real tears start at 1€ vodkas
Yeah, our suicidal tendencies are very obvious on the road too
Fun (not) fact
Out of my school year of 120 people 3 guys died in three separate car crashes, all before they got 20 years old
And all the accidents were their fault
Settle in Romania
The 20% in Lithuania are old people
that's a nice theory you got but considering you're yet to do that not even during the crisis, I would assume you'll never break the peg
Good thing I live in Lithuania
Thank f*ck I live in the Baltics
Good luck to the rest of you
Are the baltics colder than scandinavia
That's some black magick fuckery right here
Lithuania:
winters have no fucking snow or ice
summer is half rain half wearing sweater with a couple of days 20°C+
Baltics: Y'all feel something
Let it stay that way
This summer has already been too hot
Latvia looks cozy sandwiched between Lithuania and Estonia
What's up with Kaliningrad
Not part of Russia anymore
Pokemon Go is cancelled

TIL most of Europe is Lone-lands (minus Amon Sûl)
> Oh yeah, and forests
We have one of the most forested countries and
not even a bush
Latvia is the most forested in Europe
North Germany is usually always included in the Northern European plain
Sometimes even the Netherlands
Doesn't surprise me, after their foreign ministry posted an infographic about Forest Brothers in the Baltic countries being terrorists and murderers
Here's a [short summary] of that

Eh, I still mostly use youtube when I'm at home but some artists can be really aggressive about taking down their music from yt, even if you click through to the "xyz - topic" videos rather than random uploads from other people

I don't really like the choice of shades here, especially with the majority being black and dark
I just can't tell the difference between the dark ones
The reason is that those few extra countries are places like Tonga or Solomon Islands
You probably won't go there, ever, so it makes sense to portray the passports as pretty much equal
Meh, Android also has overpriced manufacturers like Samsung, and at least Apple has better software
At the end who cares what people enjoy owning
World is too big to be bothered by little things like what phones people buy

That's probably true, yet that page currently is quite nice
Lots of country flags, lots of little hearts among them, cartoon characters, Mona Lisa is still there, the Darth Plagueis has been untouched for quite a while now, etc
I highly recommend this video (and the whole channel tbh) to everyone
In our family (Lithuania) every Christmas Eve we watch "Merry Christmas Mr Bean". It's hilarious every year
and I thought you watch "Sagan om Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton"
Home Alone and Harry Potter are staple movie franchises for Christmas
> If the whole planet is connected within 6 degrees of separation, I think that means literally half the planet is likely also equally connected to the owners of that house
I don't think it is the case, no
Each person knows some amount of other people, let's mark the average amount of people known as K, whatever the number might be
Then that means, on average, the amount of people that are separated by 3 degrees from you will be K^(3), while 6 degrees would be K^(6)
K would have to be ridiculously low for what you said to be true
Oh god

Dunno from where they taking these numbers
Here (in Lithuania) we usually have classes of 25-32 people, 4-8 classes per grade (depends to the size of the school)
Never seen smaller ones
This number is much lower in rapidly aging/ emptying rural areas, but there number residents/ schools is much lower than in cities
I would like to see their analysis methodology
Quite old data
Also, the low average class size is indicative of a problem
As much as 18% of the state budget is spent on education, but still last November school teachers went on strike over pay reform
Movies and cartoons of them were on TV here

It's just the old folks
Don't mind them
They're not dangerous, but can definitely be rude
But don't smile or make eye contact with people who are wearing full Adidas with chains and shit
Those can be more dangerous sometimes
Nah, but seriously we're just kind of a bit grumpy, so please stay happy and bring the happiness here, and don't let anyone to suck it out :)
Just subtract everyone who emigrated and we'll be #1
Lithuanians tend to keep to themselves, so things like depression usually eat the person up from inside, as they don't go reaching out for help
We are small and we have no money
Also it's cold and mental illness is stigmatized
Stigmatized mental health issues, lack of access to mental healthcare, alcoholism, sexism (boys are often shamed for not being "manly enough"), low wages, poverty, lack of accessibility for disabled folk, homophobia, transphobia, minority marginalization, catholic church and that sweet sweet soviet spirit that still finds ways to poison our ethics and interactions with others
There's probably way more but it's all that i could come up with atm
As a fellow lithuanian i can vouch for this as well
Most of the suicides arent breing brought to light here in lithuania, but if you look at the data the truth is there
Also suicides have been romanized in our culture for ages
Lithuanians used to massively burn themselves when Crusades took castles
Partizans against USSR occupation used to massively blow themselves up their faces with grenades too so they wouldn't be recognized
So we Lithuanians got that "better dead than X" mentality
> lack of access to mental healthcare
Is it
You can get 3 months of free weekly sessions with a psychologist per year, on top of that you can go to group therapy and group "life skill improvement seminars". Basically you can get 6-9 months of psychological help for free
Now it's not ideal and it gets worse the smaller the city you live in, but I wouldn't really say there's a lack of help available
Yeah, i was only talking about Lithuania
Asking for help is frowned upon
Most of us can't tell our family members that we need help
And when the person is underage, it gets really complicated
I personally couldn't ask my doctor to get me to see a psychologist because I lived in a small town where everyone knew everyone
One of my best friends had a terrible experience with a public psychologist and now years after she still avoids seeking help
Moreover, when she was trying to get a driving license, she was asked why she went to a psychologist at the age of 10
If you seek public help, the records will follow you your whole life
And when it comes to adults, people with really serious issues are ashamed to seek for help because "that's what crazy people do".
Lithuania doesn't support transitioning
This is why I believe that if we're discussing Lithuania, it's the gender that was assigned at birth
Oh I'm not arguing about the stigma surrounding seeking help, just saying that people underestimate the help that's available
Have no idea where else to ask, but is [this] okay
Offering something for free to accept everything

It's the Alps, temperature varies wildly depending on elevation
I've been to the Austrian ones recently, it was over 30 C at the base, around 0 C at the top
It's usually very safe to assume that any story that came from a guide is bullshit
I want to believe though
Warmongering Lithuania looks at Russia with suspicion
Belarus is like Switzerland except not rich, ruled by a dictator and has no clocks, knives, chocolates or cheese to boast with but at least makes good games
surprisingly good guy belarus
Maybe it has to do with traditional dishes
We also eat a lot of tomatoes in Lithuania, it's one of our main vegetables along with cucumbers
But I can't think of a single local traditional food that comes with tomatoes
However they all do involve potatoes
[Cepelinai] - a huge 'dumpling' where dough is basically potatoes, [kugelis] - a potato oven dish, [vėdarai] - sausage filled with potatoes, [bulviniai blynai] - potato pancakes
Even our traditional [cold beet soup] which is supposed to refresh you on a hot summer day, comes with hot potatoes on the side cause we can't live without them
I'd play the rythm on it

Climate Change in Lithuania is all on EU because our ruling "Peasants and Greens" party turned out to be not green at all
The leader owns a massive corporation that imports nasty chemicals and fertilizers from Russia and he drives an Escalade
Well we do trust the EU more cause our government is shit
Right wing is usually pro bussiness, cheap labour is good for bussiness, but the right wing voters usually are against immigration
Right wing parties want to get reelected, so they will say one thing, but at the same time they want to help their bussiness friends, so they'll do another thing
He's nice at first

Could anyone explain Turkey
Why's it almost all red with a few blue patches
24 degrees today in Vilnius
I am SCARED of summer, most people here dont have AC since
well we never needed it
so yea
Holy shit this looks ugly
I wish all the best for the Belarusian people, but at the same time I can't help but feel like their goal is unachievable unless Russia somehow decides to look the other way, which I just don't see happening, since they've already lost Ukraine from their sphere of influence
The only way this can succeed is if Russia has it's own mass protests and instability to not be able to focus outwards
Belarus and Lithuania have hundreds of years of shared history
There was a time when Belarusians called themselves "Litvins" - Lithuanians, before the modern 19th century concept of nationality and Tsarist Russification changed that
Pretty sure it is Pagonia
3 quarters of the island atleast

What 8 €/month gets you in Lithuania
Also, if you need slightly more, [you can get 300mbit for ~12
5€/month]
EDIT: Also forgot to mention, a gigabit for ~20€, but come on, who needs that much
I don't. The prices can go even lower in major cities with different providers but I am outside of those so
I also live in Lithuania
My friend got 300Mbps for 20€, but he called the customer support and asked if they could make it cheaper
They activated some kind of "deal plan" and it costs 10€ now
Speeds are the same
I don't know what's the catch
I have the same plan :)
[Your bitch ass stealing my wifi]
You can even get a 300up/300down connection at a similar price if you manage to get a promotional offer
I pay like 15 for 300mbps in Lithuania
but fr 20 € for 300 mbits
and if you pay double that you can get 1gbit
I fucking wish
Rookie numbers
300/279
Maybe you are using a wifi
Which provider is this
Cause me and my family have Mezon and we pay 17
90 Euros per month and we get 25 Mbps give or take, granted we do have to use a signal booster
Most discounts are tied to the minimum length of service (usually 2 years)
Telia, but it's optic fiber so I don't think it is available everywhere
Ah okay, yeah
I think we might be able to get it in the house we live in currently, but due to how much we move, it might be a bad idea

I don't know what to think after this
I read a fair bit of smaller (local) American news sites and i've noticed that the recent EU internet privacy law (GDPR) has made more than half of smaller sites completely banned and inaccessible
I think we should let them back in and kick them out right after that
You can also see, that if you're wearing the mask under your nose, you have a small dick
Fun fact, we have started calling people wearing their masks wrong like this „bybianosiai“, which roughly translates to 'dicknose'. This is where this campaign seems to stem from [\(link to lithuanian satire wiki\)]
If you get headaches from wearing a mask you might have some really serious issues, visit your doctor

Please google where Vilnius is located
Then check which language is spoken in that country
First time in my life I'm hearing of Coptic
According to internet searches it is Egyptian language, a northern Afro-Asiatic language
That is completely unrelated to Lithuanian
I don't understand what you are talking about
In Lithuania we speak Lithuanian, which is a Baltic language, coming from a family of Indo-European languages
It would sound funny in Lithuanian because "nebe" means "no more". It would be no more lux (good/luxurious)

*The Lithuanian press ban (Lithuanian: spaudos draudimas) was a ban on all Lithuanian language publications printed in the Latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the Russian Empire, which controlled Lithuania at the time
Lithuanian-language publications that used Cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged
*The concept arose after the failed January Uprising of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 24 April 1904
The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities
Why is Estonia so high up compered to the rest of Russian empire
Like that
Except the bucket is much larger on the military helicopters because they can lift more

We're even below Sweden, sooo why not
I'm at a festival in Denmark rn and all of these bikes aren't locked up
Welp, free real estate I guess :D
Not saying it was right (because as you mentioned it affected a lot of innocent people), but Germany's goal was to expand and unify all the German lands (where there were Germans)
Removal of Germans was done to compensate Poland for the territory lost in the East and Germans were removed from other countries (and Königsberg) to prevent Germany from having a justification for starting another war like this again in the future

Hard to believe Lithuania is better-off than Portugal
Or Greece
I've been to Greece, we're not fucking better off than Greece
almost makes you want to get off your chair and sing the ''tautiška giesmė'', don't you think
It might blow your mind, but I didn't miss the second most talked about European kerfufle in a decade
Turns out it's "kerfu**ff**le"
I don't know where I learned it, probably reddit
> if you think that they are better off than Lithuania
I don't think random shit, I see, and what I see is a higher living standard in Greece than in Lithuania
> No, what you’ve seen is tourist areas in a warm country with wealthy foreigners buying property
Oh, I see you somehow got hold of my travel itinerary
> Also, anecdotes aren’t exactly a strong comeback to facts and figures
Like the very submission we're commenting under that shows Greek average salary to be almost 30% higher than Lithuania's?
> Again, which millionaires are moving to Lithuania
What
> Greece’s economy is thoroughly fucked all throughout the whole country
Their government is on the verge of a collapse
Greeces economy is recovering for some time now
> There’s plenty of high skilled workers fleeing the country because of jobs disappearing
Do I really need to start sharing emigration figures

Nice flair
Lithuania often ranks among the top countries by suicide rates
It's like ~1/4000 lithunians is gonna kill themselves
We have the highest overall and male suicide rate in the world
That Lithuania most of the time tops the first place by the suicide rate in the whole World, not just Europe, which is extremely sad and depressing
Lithuania has the highest murder and alcoholism rate in the EU
Yeah I wanted to write this
The only anti record that came into my mind :)
In the town where I live (~1000 people, ~750 lithuanian) at least one person commits suicide over the course of three years
The record was 1 person per year, three years in a row
We’re number one or two in per capita alcohol consumption annually too
Many people might see that as some kind of badge of honor though
Tbh I'm not sure, entire studies are happening right now to find out why
I think it's the blend of our horrible past, history where killing yourself was more prideful then losing
And today's stigma about suicide, still stigma even tho it's hurting our home sooo badly
But correct me if I am wrong, those concentration camps were not made to purposefully kill people, just group them up and lock them up
Something like what USA did to local Asians during WW2, rather than extermination camps of Nazis
I need Russia to join EU
Badly
Poland
It is just too big, to drive through, I would prefer a boat
I know that they are not in EU but Ukraine and Belarus
We do that and Lithiania once again extends from Baltic sea to the Black sea
Kaliningrad
Because it's most densely military area in Europe

That's it, nothing more

Getting in a union with Poland and then losing half of the territory to them
When we were occupied by the Russians, after ww1 getting independence, then being occupied by soviets, nazis and then soviets again
Or maybe during Lithuanian - Polish commonwealth when Austria, Prussia and Russia just slowly ate up the country
Truly bruh moments
We had something similar with Lithuanian President Brazauskas and Latvian PM in 1990s.
Wouldnt it be 21 years
Well actually the HoC has been slowing down progress this whole time with regards to Brexit
There have been many instances where party line was more important than the actual interest of the country
Lithuanians wouldn't put it that way
Yea
But you said litteraly
Looks about the same here in Lithuania
Except the at least half decently skilled or a little motivated people can manage to improve a lot by doing well at their jobs
However, children are usually cared for, and even growing in the most severe poverty can be escaped with enough determination to seek education
Personally witnessed at least 5 such cases where children from poor alcoholic families made it out to be upper mid class
Why is this place like that
It's the mentality of that group that breeds this type of behavior
They have taken over that neighborhood mostly illegally and turned it into a place no one else would even think of moving to
But since it's not actually theirs they do not take care of it and just trash the place
We had a similar thing in Vilnius
He'd probably die in a mysterious way it he did it too publicly, though
All the time
I use English *way* more than Lithuanian, so I usually start forgetting words in Lithuanian and only know the English (and sometimes French) translation

I'm a language lover in general and sometimes go out of my way to speak Lithuanian and respect the grammar as much as possible
If I didn't pay as much attention I would definitely be getting worse, because English is SO prevalent
I lived in the US for many years and spoke my native tongue only an hour or two a week when I called my family
It was all mainly a catch-up, no deep discussions
I moved back home over a month ago and there’s an obvious struggle to retrieve some words
Usually I can say it in English first and then trace it back to Lithuanian but I noticed that sometimes in the middle of the sentence I can’t retrieve any of the words even though I know what I want to say
I suspect it will go away when Lithuanian becomes dominant out of sheer use
Just like how it was when I first moved to the US
I look at languages as different codes and, well, it’s downright confusing to operate in 2 different codes at the same time so one of them has to take a back seat
At least in my experience
I study in Ireland so I have to speak English
After returning home I realised that I am replacing some words with English ones
Kinda reminds of some Russian songs with additional English words which make a song a bit incomprehensible
Also it affected my accent a bit- my speech has become more slurred and fast
Many English words have become slang and are often used in my own language
You do this more with younger people and talking about very modern/technological topics, but yes
Often times it's easier to express something in English
I lived in the US for 11 years and everyone that noticed my accent and chose to acknowledge it thought it was the coolest thing
That really helped me with “owning” it
My accent is basically RP + Estuary English (Not as strong as Adele or anything)
That's fine by me
In general though, I have no idea what a general Lithuanian accent is since most people I know have very different accents, so I don't really have an opinion on that
Do I like it
Well, it's barely existent
I don't even know what sort of accent I have
Consuming so much British and American media has made my accent into one that my parents don't even understand
They understand someone with a heavy accent better, because there's is heavier too
But do I like the lithuanian one
Mehh, not really
Sounds like a lighter version of Russian, so onfe again, meh
I lowkey feel ashamed of the Lithuanian-English Accent
It just sounds so bad
I don't think I have a big accent compared to others, because I speak english a lot so for me, if there is an accent, I don't even care about it
I think german accent is easy to understand for other europeans
It's good, I'm not bothered by it
I study in the US and people only say it's a cool accent after they find out that I am not Russian lol
Lithuanian here living in UK, please understand that some of us try to lose it for the sake of clarity, sometimes it's really hard to understand what others are trying to say due to their accent
Besides, I find it satisfying pronouncing things properly, especially smooth R instead of rolled one
I don't think sounds are part of the accent, but due to lack of training/learning the other language
And for the life of me I can't pronounce thirty three without making it sound so bad I can't understand what I'm saying myself
I can read pronounciations, I know each and every sound in English language, I have no problems with them individually at all, but the combination th and r (three) just kills it for me :D
American accent is acquired from us, non english speakers, watching movies and YouTube in English
At least I was told I have somewhat American accent and I spoke English about
A month worth of time in my entire life aside from school before coming to UK
Be proud of American accent as I think it's the most clear and easy to understand one, at least for us, non-native English speakers who basically learnt English through movies, YouTube, internet
I live in UK for almost a year and I still have hard time understanding one of my coworkers accent, just a thick british one, muffled and fast paced mannerism of speach
Living in UK for a year, I've been asked if I'm Polish far more often than if I'm Russian and probably only once or twice it was nailed down to Lithuanian, by other Lithuanians that is
We sound Slavic due to similar sounds consisting in our Language I assume, same rolled R and some other that are surprisingly difficult to notice and get rid off I think
From my experience (Lithuanian here), I can easily tell Russian-English accent apart from ours
But I have hard time seperating British and Lithuanian accents due to being so used to hearing both
My biggest problem with my accent is lack of clarity, I've learnt to speak slower than usual just to sound clearer and not to skip so many words
In Lithuanian you can very often skip I, you and similar words, because context usually is very clear what you are talking about, different grammar rules help with that
Eg: person A: have you vacuumed the living room
Person B: (I've) vacuumed (it) already
Words in parentheses are skipped
Poor example, but first thing that came to mind and showcases 3 out of 5 words in that sentence being skipped
And a little bit of direct translation, vacuumed should be changed to done to make more stylistic sense I believe
I don't know if that accent in the video is a stereotypical Lithuanian accent, just as an example one of the most prominent features in the Lithuanian language is devoicing (making the last few sounds of  words softer/quieter), this doesn't happen in the video
This is also a feature in RP, albeit it's less pronounced than in Lithuanian
So if you meet a Lithuanian with an RP accent, you can usually tell because they devoice too much
Then again, IDK if devoicing is a thing in russian, so maybe
Besides, most of the people I met think foreign accents are sexy
Exotic, fun and interesting would be more precise description, so there's that
Have a nice day :)
1st
Appreciate the color
What does it mean
2nd
Just watched the video
That's so thick and cringy, they sound so incredibly monotonous and not a single English sound in place, I couldn't understand half of them personally, especially politician reading notes
With girlfriend we joked about how he wrote down a text in Lithuanian letters and just read it without knowing what he's talking about
At the end, our former president, Dalia Grybauskaitė talking with Obama, a better example of our accent, or mine at least, but very monotonous and for that reason alone I do my best to make highs and lows in a sentence just to sound like a human instead of robot
This level of monotonousness (is that even a word
) sounds like a robot speaking, google translate text to speach
Most of the clipps forgot about R and Th sounds, which are not present here, so I guess it's a bit difficult to learn them
Mostly because their screens don't crack as much (at least from what I know)
I love how you mentioned the edl but not the real issue
Or you could just be specific and say that it’s home to sharia zones
At my school popular is
"Electricity went out in my house, so domophone doesn't work, therefore I cannot get out"
[image of domophone]
There will be two teams:
Labor staff (cleaning, fixing various stuff, growing food)
Nerd staff (IT devs, laser geeks, scientists)
Both of the groups will be known as people who knows what they do, however they also like to indulge in alcohol / energy drinks or both
By indulge I mean these drinks are their food
And you hope that you don't find them in the middle of the binge
2 weeks here
Wait, you have to work somewhere for an extra 5 months after you tell them you want to leave
Is that how it actually works in practice
Or do both sides "come to an agreement" 99% of the time
Yup
Fun fact, people tend to use words that are used in their languages, for example elevator/lift
In Lithuanian language it's "liftas" so it was easier to learn and use "lift", however as american influence grew, people shifted to "elevator".
Oh yes
If I need to decide which word to use - I use the one which is easier
I spell in British, like coloUr instead of color
yeah first time i read about that i genuinely thought i was reading the onion
Oh I saw article about this in Lithuania
This is fucking crazy
The first thing that came to mind is Gundė. It's a female name from a book I read (the book was originally published in 1911 in America, and then in 1913 in Lithuania)
Jorė (f), Visvaldas (m)
Male:
Jogaila ( powerful rider)
Aidas ( echo)
Gintaras ( amber)
Kestutis ( patient)
Radvila ( finding hope)
Female:
Jūrate ( sea goddess)
Jadvyga ( defender)
Skaiste ( pure, virgin)
Kūnigunda ( belligerent)
Sanita ( sunpuddle)
Ona (grace)
Svajone ( dream)
I also know a guy from my hometown named Svetogor (sublime)
I'd say for women it's Ona (or Onutė) is a more relatable name for the older generation and not popular among young people
For men it's something like Algis (or Algimantas)
Isn't Jorė a pretty hipsterish contemporary Baltic name
I wouldn't call Skaidra an outdated name here in Lithuania
Also Bronė, Petronė, Vanda
Bronius, anything-slovas (Stanislovas, Boleslovas)
True, true
I imagine a grandma when I hear this name
The new hip thing to do with names nowadays is ripping them off other obscure languages
I know Kaan who is a son of physicians
Well, somehow I imagine a baby of young eco-friendly parents
haha I can see that
I don't get these shortened names in Slavic languages
Just how do you get those names into excistense when they're sooo different from the original xD
Oh yeah, I get that, we're all just lazy really
But what I don't understand is how you get such different shortened versions from their original names
The English ones are all pretty similar to the original
In 2050 there will be groups denying fossil fuel damage, like there are antivaxers now
Yeah
For some reason when I hear Lithuanian music on the radio at first I have to take a second to understand what language it is, before realizing that I'm a complete moron
Half my friends speak Lithuanian with English words in between, so mo, not really
Lol, idek how to say turnout in Lithuanian :D
Lithuanian is one of the oldest indo-european languages
It hasn't changed for ~2000 years
Lithuania was the last country in europe to be baptised
Kryžių Kalnas "The Hill of crosses" is believed to contain the highest concentration of crosses in the world
Not only are ther crosses on crosses on crosses, but there are also crosses underground, becouse the hill kept getting buldozered in the soviet times, but people were constantly rebuilding it
In Lithunian folklore there are multiple pagan holidays, that are still celebrated to this day
On one of them, only one plant of fern is believed to bloom and the one who picks it will gain supernatural powers
It's celebrated on the shortest night of summer
Pagans in Lithuania used to domesticate snakes
They were supposed to protect the house from evil spirits in exchange for food and warmth
Number 2 was actually colonies held by the Curonians, although it could be argued they were a vassal of Lithuania so the PLC indirectly did have colonies
The Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth held Moscow for 2 years not just Poland
It really frustrated me that PLC is rarely mentioned in European history but then I guess 'History is written by the victors'.
Nr 1 is absolute nonsense
The language has most certainly, notably changed in the last 2000 years
Hell, 2000 years ago the Lithuanian language didn't even exist as a distinct entity
I'm assuming you meant to say that Lithuanian is one of the more archaic languages in the Indo-European family
This impression rests largely on the high degree of faithfulness with which it has preserved the aspects of PIE phonology and nominal morphology
Calling it the “oldest” IE language is a misnomer, its conservatives in these areas cannot be gainsaid, and probably does exceed that of all the other contemporary IE languages (although such things are not easily quantified)
It should be remembered, however, that the language has not been equally conservative in all domains

Don't think, if this would be difficult, because Lithuanian language's sentence's structure is very flexible
Well we can try, even don't think that here something very different would be, quite good should work out, close to what would be with English structure
Recently, ours street, building was happening
Laying new asphalt and new sidewalk building
Builders quite quickly with it took care
New street looks good and is very more comfortable
Well in Lithuania there is this instance, the houses speaker claiming to be good at English
It sound like as if she is re doing her English speaking exam again
Cancelling basketball tournaments/events
I'm also used to staying at home all day but started getting stir crazy yesterday after all weekend
Going out for food and seeing the empty streets was even worse
This is freaking me out
Spent 2 weeks there last Summer (a week sightseeing + a weeklong 100km hike through the mountains)
After that, I will NEVER forget Iceland - MAH GAHD is it stunning
I rarely see my country posts
Like there’s snow in Africa and they need winter clothes :Dd
Wait what
I just realized that its written like this, I though it was kinder + garden
I feel like it's the case for anyone older than 20, or maybe even now
When I was a kid, it was completely normal to call black people "negrai(negroes)" or "negriukai(little negroes)", it's just how everyone called them, my parents, my grandparents, even my middle school teacher, when she wanted us to perform a scene from an old russian cartoon "[Chunga Changa] she told me and some of my classmates that we will be playing the little negroes, so we even did blackface for it, smh
I'm actually cringing writing this right now
Only when I had access to the internet, and learned english, years later, did I understand that this word is offensive
You're not alone
Last year I went to London Christmas fair and they were selling fake packaged snow there
I understand it doesnt snow in UK and they really have warm winters lately, where its just rain, but cmon
Come to Lithuania
We still have random                - 30C for at least a whole month in winter with so much snow you can barely walk or drive somewhere
If everywhere else its just rain - we still have winters and summers, but those are becoming extreme (meaning we used to never have +40 in the summer or - 40 in the winter)
No, but for some reason some people here are really hostile against Polish people
Can someone explain why
Definitely not against current Germany, but certainly in a historic sence
Nowadays we consider Germany to be advanced and peaceful, but in WW2, a quarter-million were killed here by Nazis (8% of the population), so to say that everybody's forgotten about those times, especially when the descendants of those victims are still alive, would be a total lie
Basically - people still remember the horrors, but realise they don't have to define modern day Germany
Not so much
I remember my dad mentioning that when he was in the USSR army, the sentiment was that everybody hated them
Now we’re more focused on being Russophobic
I worked for a German family in Alaska for a few years and I could pick up some scent of superiority maybe from the old members of the family
However, at one point there was a young Germany grown guy and he actually said out loud that though unfortunately Germany didn’t succeed taking Europe by force, it’s pretty much owning it through money now, so the goal was achieved
I was LIVID
Good thing I was on my way out to lunch
So, personally, it’s not that I have particularly negative feelings toward German people
I’m afraid that they still have negative feelings toward the rest of us
Nah, not really
We have a kinda neutral relationship with germans
It's more of an anti-russian sentiment here, becouse after all, more harm in lithuania was caused by russians than germans
Lithuanian here:
While its true that germany through history was oppressive and expansive, its nothing compared to russia
Germany bothered us since 1200ad, devoured and germanized fellow tribe Prussia, then took the name for themselves
During ww2 killed as much as 70% of most cities population (cause of jews, about 100k were killed in total)
Now the relations are great
Look on germany is positive, as we strive to achieve german quality level
In many cases we succeed, even surpass you, but due to lessee level of automation our prices cant compete (and also trust in our quality)
Russian invasion not only took the freedom, but took away our right to thoughts, language, culture, faith
Destruction of these things took place before ww1, then came back after ww2 with stalin
If we say germans in lithuania commited a genocide against jews with 100k casualties, then we say russia commited genocide against lithuanians with 150k casualties
This does not include exiles who returned
So no
No offensive feelings towards germany, even though it was arch- enemy for 300 years
Well, some of that
Though I think the main reason a lot of Lithuanians dislike Poles, are the Poles still living in Lithuania
Especially around Vilnius
I don't even think you can even count them as poles
They only consume propaganda filled Russian Media
Often speak a mix of Russian and Polish
Are especially anti-europe, conservative and most importantly - Pro Putin
It's ridiculous
For some reason I always thought Porsche was italian
Probably because of the way it’s pronounced in Lithuanian, it doesn’t really sound like a german surname
It's way more "Italian", than it is "French" or "German".
Rockstar isn't British
Rockstar North is based in Edinburgh, that studio has been making GTA before it was bought by Rockstar
Also -
Rockstar Games, Inc
is an American video game publisher based in New York City
(It would surprise me that they're not, considering I routinely ride out with their cycling team here in NYC
Or Smirnoff, for that matter
In many places Stolichnaya and Stoli are actually Latvian
It's literally the worst imitation
It looks like a poor attempt at being Swiss, more than anything Scandinavian
I'm pretty sure that there's a Scottish slang phrase for that
Montreal is kind of French ;)
Did I step on that British nationalism
Maggi is huge in Europe
Have you been to the instant soups and sauces aisles in Tesco or Sainsburys
Yeah
Right
That's why my comment on where Rockstar is from, you reacted like that
Tap water for sure, all of it is directly from springs
Tap water only
Unless traveling
Though we sometimes bottle tap water as well
Talking about soviet union in a positive manner
(Probanly only ok in Russia anyways) and/or any russian propaganda really
Though it is not really a BIG no no, just big cringe
Soviet/nazi symbols are banned from public, CCCP tshirt would get you in trouble in the same way "holocoust is fake" would get you in trouble in Israel
Other than that, nothing like that exist really
You can say or do wtf you want to anyone as long as its not against the law
Putting on a fake smile
Instantly writes off a person as untrustworthy or weird
Messing with historical facts
Example: we joined cccp willingly; belarus is the real lithuania; vilnius belongs to poland
Say these and any lithuanian will leave without saying a word or a heated argument could start
Its ok to have an opinion, even if its wrong
but saying these things literally spits on our recently dead relatives who took us where we are today
Bad behavior in sauna and that Lithuania is somehow related to russia is the same here
Saying lithuanians are russians is a thing that can honestly earn you a well deserved punch in the face from some people
In Lithuanian, among other languages, words Olandija and Niderlandai are synonymous and both are used when reffering to the Netherlands, so don't get too angry at foreigners :))
In Vilnius we have ticket inspectors in some stops for public buses
One time the bus I was in as a child got stopped and at that point we only had paper tickets
I was sitting and had my ticket in my pants pocket
When the inspector came to inspect my ticked I had to stand up from my seat to pull out my ticket
Fucking old granny rushed to take my seat right out of my ass as soon as I stood up
I didnt even have the time to pull out my ticket before my seat was gone
From that point, old people can take a walk, because I will never give my seat away, unless they ask first
As a person who lives in Poland, old town Kraków is definitely worth seeing
We were supposed to go to Auschwitz too, but the lockdown was so sudden we didn't.
I'm not there anymore, however I visited Wieliczka while I was
Out of all of the places I've been to in that region Ojcowski park narodowy was my favourite
The caves there are really impressive
Lithuania placed last in its first year of competing in Eurovision
Ovidijus Vyšniauskas made a beautiful song but the judges had the audacity to place him dead last
(1994)
I'm pretty sure that Lithuania placed last in our first Eurovision
I'm not sure though
Lithuania is the same from my experience, we are kind to non-white people, but behind their backs we talk a lot, mostly because they are so exotic there and when we joke around some jokes are borderline racist, but from my personal experience it was never with ill-intent
Imagine one of those african kids pictures when they met Asian person for the first time and all 15 children squint their eyes with said Asian person in photo
No ill intent, just something exciting I guess
Coming from a person on whose languages mainly consists of o,u,I only
On a serious note I guess it is because Denmark is a really flat nation and snow I guess is not the same as 'up norf'?
Possibly the same name origin, my Godparents son's name is Ovidijus as well, purebred Lithuanian for the last generation or two at least
Some times it does, but rarely
When discussing history with russian friends, some times we argue till we go home
But in general we try to avoid such subjects or refrain from commenting their opinion in a serious way, cause we cant get to a conclusion
With polish friends - not so much
Likely because you still live in what you call history
We do the opposite
We dwell on the bitterness of history, we constantly compare today with what was, trying to run as far away from it while it is still possible
We feed on that biterness to create something sweet
It drives us
Not really, all we have is 100 days
Basically, a 100 days before the exams, the graduates come and throw some fun
thing
For example, one time they just drove their cars around the school stadium
Other times, it isn't as creative
This year they justblasted music at the school entrance and ripped off Coachella
I wasn't there, of course, but from what people said, the Coachella ripoff party was fun
We have last bell celebration
Its basicly where every student dresses formal and rides their decorated cars in convoys and constatly honks
It annoys me to no end that "é" is rendered as "ey" in English
Can't they just suppress the [j] sound at the end
[Not exactly the same, but I hope it still counts, enjoy your weekend

Yep, when someone from Žemaitija region tries to speak Lithuanian to me
i can BARELY understant something
I dont speak Russian but even I could year the heavy american accent in John Wick
I'll be honest, Garbage men have had a much more positive effect on my live than bankers (or most other "fancy" professions)
That we speak latin
Because clearly Germans are not Mongols
I mean DUH
You wish braliuk
Whaaaat
Such a big country and just now
We had it for decades now, even my grandparents had it in soviet times, no one has ever thought of changing it and if you dont obbey it - your child is not allowed in kindergardens or schools, simple as that
Of course there's always some private schools that allow it, dont check the gp records, bc they get paid well for that child and sometimes something happens, but its easily contained
In some movie the phrase „officer down“ was translated to „pareigūnas daunas“ . Daunas is a derogatory word for people with down syndrome, or just in general a insult
The movie "Kick ass" was translated to "Ateik čia arba gausi į dūdą" which basically means "come here or you will get beat up"
We also have Žalia Rūta as an insult, i can’t even imagine it being an insult in the english language
Also, the title of the movie "Cristopher Robin" was translated to "Jonukas". Jonukas is the diminutive form of Jonas, or John in english
You such a green plant, i cant believe it lol
Sounds like something out of Friends
Yes, heard it on the news
"Find you a man that looks at you like /u/gorgich looks at Astrakhan Oblast"
It was around 32°C (89,6°F) today, so it's pretty terrible
The nights are around 17°C (62,6°F), but upstairs it doesn't get that cool, even with all of the windows open
But it's still better than the day
The summers have been getting hotter throughout the years, but so have to the winters and idek what spring or autumn is any more
But thank you for asking nonetheless
Hope it's alright where you're at
I am absolutely NOT okay
The sun always gives me a headache, I sweat like a pig and sleeping with the balcony open doesn't even help because I have a bunk style bed which means that all the heat just comes up and melts me in my sleep
We are supposed to get some rain tomorrow so I cannot wait for that awesome cool and fresh air after it stops
It was hard at first, but over time I got used to it
I sleep with an open window (I live in a small town, so the air is fresh), so at least that's good
I actually kinda like these warm nights
You can sit there after coming out of the sauna, listen to birds and just enjoy nature
Yesterday there was an owl in my neighbourhood, so that was a pleasant little surprise and something for a change of listening
There's also nightingales
Their singing is just amazing
I've never heard a bird sing more beautifully than them
Yes, doing ok
It's maybe 30C there
Although it's torture being in the bus, and the nights are very hot (and we have no AC)
I am definitely looking into buying a fan now
Thanks and stay safe too :)
Wow, that's an unusual song
A really pleasant one
I have one more bird song, to really impress someone, who hasn't heard it
I believe this bird is called the bittern
The male calling is enchanting
It sounds almost unnatural
I couldn't find any good examples (most were 5 minute long clips of the bird just walking around), but from what I can describe it's a really loud, low sound, travelling just above the ground
The noise can sound like it's two metres (~6ft) behind you when in reality it's 50 metres
It's also a number one basis for dinosaur vocalizations apparently they sounded like this
You can google it, but to truly experience a bitterns song, you have to hear it yourself
One time, when you'll be wandering in a lithuanian swamp, or around a lake you won't need to think, to recognize it
Hehe, now we are having a full week of storms and cold rain
:Dd
Excellent point
Some people say "Lithuanians are born with a basketball in their hands
Elektrėnai in Lithiania imo
Its name literally comes from the word electricity and they have all of that electric stuff of the country
and also a lot of soviet flats
That it
I've heard some people call Kaunas ugly
Idk why, I've just heard people joking about it a lot, so I guess that would be it
Yeah but they filmed in Vilnius, lithuanias capital, which is cool but then you realize that not much changed since the disaster
I've been to ostrava and it was not great
Srsly
From all those cities of Lithuania you have chosen Kaunas
It's pretty ok I guess, especially now when lots of reconstruction/new projects are happening there
Which is sad, buuuuuut it opened peoples minds and  they realised thet not all of vilnius looks like that, so now major productions like stranger things are coming to vilnius
It's just what I've heard, but I'm not sure
The State of Lithuania shall be an independent democratic republic
Lithuania:
**Article 1**
The country of Lithuania is independent democratic republic
&#x200B;
Sorry for bad translation :/
Article 1
The State of Lithuania is an independent democratic republic
The Lithuanian state is an independent democratic republic
Lietuvos Respublikos Konstitucija/Constitution of The Lithuanian Republic
Article 1:
Lietuvos valstybė yra nepriklausoma demokratinė respublika
/The Lithuanian state is an independent democratic republic
>Lithu
We also have a preamble:
>THE LITHUANIAN NATION
>– having created the State of Lithuania many centuries ago,
– having based its legal foundations on the Lithuanian Statutes and the Constitutions of the Republic of Lithuania,
– having for centuries staunchly defended its freedom and independence,
– having preserved its spirit, native language, writing, and customs,
– embodying  the innate right of the human being and the Nation to live and create  freely in the land of their fathers and forefathers—in the independent  State of Lithuania,
– fostering national concord in the land of Lithuania,
– striving for an open, just, and harmonious civil society and a State under the rule of law,
by the will of the citizens of the reborn State of Lithuania, adopts and proclaims this
>CONSTITUTION
You should not have attempted translating yourself:
>(c) The right to exercise national self-determination in the State of Israel is unique to the Jewish people
Yikes
>So fuck the 30% Russians living in Latvia, I suppose
why though
I assume they have Latvian citizenship, thus they are "latvian nationals". I don't think it's talking about ethnic latvians
It is on the parliament's web site
Generated by MS Word 15 according to the meta tag :D
I guess you're right then, we have the same word with the same meaning in lithuanian
I dont really see a problem there
You can always learn latvian, but you can‘t become an ethnic latvian if you‘re born an ethnic russian
i think u just accepted cookies
Tbh the whole country except maybe for the big three cities
Edit: the big two cities
Drinking cold drinks from a cup
Parking front first also
I'm not sure if other languages have this, but we have words that can only be plural
For example, "door" is "durys" and, despite being 1 door, it's already plural
Same with glasses (akiniai)
The only language that retains similarities with ancient sanskrit and these words are being used daily so you know
I'm guessing Lithuanian has it too, but it's not really ever used
Yeah, the "Baltic chain of freedom" is cute
You Germans are awesome, look at how you bounced back from WW II, meanwhile we (Lithuania) have highest suicide and alcoholism rates in europe and depending on source in the world (say top 5 in both for sure
Edit: we had a baltic road and first to get freed from SARS (CCCP, USSR, forgot which one is English abbreviation) grips
And how do I get a flag next to my name
That's awesome, but aren't we free for just about 30 years now from Soviet Union
Or was it reference to after WW I?
Edit: Lithuanian here
Maybe, I'm not much into history and nobody really talks about independence all that often aside from USA and where it's relevant at this very moment (HK for example I think)
At least in my opinion, being under Soviet Union is not exactly a freedom, independent country per say, but that's my personal opinion

I know, still doesn't mean that guns are illegal in the rest of Europe, whoch was implied by op
You guys get tourists
This is why I can't think of a single tourist trap that exists here
But I've been seeing people coming here more and more, so I bet there will be some sort of a scam developed soon
That's when we'll know we've become a tourist destination
Y-yeah
Eastern
Europe
You mean like the neighborhood itself is a trap of sorts
I don't know, never really thought of it that way, I feel like the people who live there depict themselves the same way to both locals and tourists - we also all know and acknowledge that they're a self-proclaimed republic where you can be a free spirit (not in a legal way, but in a fun quirky way, because the neighborhood is full of artists and people like that)
When I was in highschool I remember that all the cool artsy kids when to Užupis gymnasium, and their parents were painters and sculptors who had lived in Užupis for a long time
I think seeing how the EU and the UN divide Europe into regions should be enough
It's completely on you though
Yes we do, just weirdos on reddit keep showing off their inferiority complex about it
I really don’t give a shit about basketball(not even when our team is playing)
I like cepelinai, kugelis and kvass, although I detest šaltibarščiai
My relatives strongly suffered from the Soviets and I'm not a Russophile, together I am fluent in 3-4 foreign languages
I celebrate Kūčios and Vėlinės like they are described in encyclopedias, and I like basketball when it's Žalgiris or Lithuanian team playing
Was baptised in Catholic church, but nobody really adhereres to religion in my family
I don't know if Lithuania has many stereotypes, because we are not known by anyone outside of eastern europe
I hate basketball
I never enjoyed it
Watching it is torture
I love basketball, am introverted, softspoken, love nature
That's about it
I'm not tall (174cm), I don't like alcohol, I don't like sour cream, I don't like šaltibarščiai
Soviet Union was another incarnation of Russia just like Russian Empire or Russian Federation
Soviet Union was another incarnation of Russia just like Russian Empire or Russian Federation
Western movies do not portray Lithuania
The only two I can think of was the one about Hanibal Lecter and the one about Jewish resistance with Daniel Craig, but none of them really focused on the Lithunia aspect of it
Lithuanian movies portray Lithuania and they are their own special kind of terrible and awful
Lol, that's hilarious, I'm surprised that no "Lithuania mentioned in movies and tv shows" youtube compilations has this, probably nobody heard of this show
In 2010 or around that time, class mate asked my physics teacher what is CERN all about
She said its the biggest scientific project atm, and it might create a black hole that will swallow the world
I think she forgot that in order to create a phenomenon with so much energy you need to put even more energy  to do it
Sounds like Half Life storyline
Polish people say Wilno nasze (Vilnius is ours) because at some points in history they occupied it
Lithuania jokes about reconquering Latvia, Belarus, Ukraine, Russia and anything else standing between them and the black sea
It's covered pretty constantly
The elections and protests
I feel bad for Belarussian people, they honestly seem like they've had enough of that bald asshole
It would be nice to not have a dictator next door
I expected it to have some coverage, but actually there's a lot of it
On our most popular [news site] the article about the protests is on the front page, with over a thousand comments while other articles have up to 100
So yeah, we've heard a bit about it
in Lithuania of course it's the major news right now, we have a lot of interest to have a pro-european neighbours, also there is this nuclear power plant 50km from Vilnius in belarus that was just launched and with Lukashenko on board it is very much a big concern for us
Here it is number 1 or 2 topic on every channel and covered quite extensively
Lithuania also sent a letter demanding for fair and free election and for Belarus stop the violence against its people peaceful protest
We Lithuanians support you whole heartedly ️ and we understand what you going through
Never give up for your rights and liberties, but fight for them like your Ukrainian brother's and sisters did :)
It’s not 16 in every state
In New York you must be 18 if you don’t take a drivers education course and 17 if you do take one
Lithuania:
Driving B1 category car: 16
Joining military: 18, may be involuntary
Buy a gun: in some cases allowed at 18
Buy a beer: 20
So you could just put two prices next to each other - with and without taxes
That would solve both problems
Ethnicity, you mean
Yes, you can even ask to write your ethnicity to the passport, but in means nothing in legal sense
we can get movie tickets and a bar of chocolate
Lithuania itself hasn't been discovered by many, but within the country, Neringa curonian spit is very rarely visited by foreigners
It is most famous for its large sand dunes and colorful traditional fishing villages most famous one being [Nida] it coasts 20€ per car to enter the area, so needless to say it's not the most popular destination even among Lithuanians
It's 30 EUR now
Maybe not a week, but Nida is definitely worth a few days visit
Rest can spent in nearby Klaipėda
The f*ck is wrong with these guys
They want to make it 50
Simply too many cars entering Neringa during summer
The cost is supposed to restrict it
That's a hell of a strategy for a region that's completely dependant on tourism
The region wants tourists, not cars
They want to make it so people stay in Klaipėda then go to Neringa without their car and take a bus/bike to see the sights
Maybe they will get some electric buses like Palanga
I thought they also had a tax on bikes
Meant bicycles
Motorcycles do have a low tax too
My favourite factoid on the topic is that Spanish *mucho* and English *much* are not related
Malta
It has a nice vibe
Most likely Germany (German)
Because that's like 3 extra german speaking countries where I can live
Paradoxically, because of a relative large Polish community, you could speak only Polish
Wear something with pockets
And keep Vitamin D tablets in those pockets
Dont take my comment as snarky
Just an interesting fact about Iceland given their small population
Cause total Polish community in there is not that large
We were talking about Icelandic population though
No, they aren't.
I know them, just because I go to Spanish classes and we sometimes play with teacher
I wear my jacket below 10 if it is not raining, I wear rainproof jacket if it is 10-15 and raining
But I don't consider that cold, for me anything below -10 is cold which almost doesn't happen anymore
26+ hot
20 - 25 warm
15 - 20 normal, hoodie
9 - 15 summer jacket
0 - 8 autumn coat
\-8 - 0 autumn coat with something warm underneath
Below 0 is when it starts to feel pretty cold
\-9 and lower feels properly cold
Winter coat
\-15 (or colder) with wind/-20 (or colder) without wind is when I wanna avoid going out
&#x200B;
It depends where you are though
I lived in the Netherlands for a year and it was probably the difference in humidity or some kind of other similar factors, but the same temperatures over +20 seemed hotter in NL, and ones at around 0 seemed colder
Didn't happen in the last few years, but it might happen again and it might get colder than ever during some future winters
Climate is whack
Money, blue, foreign people walking in old town, assumed feeling freedom of having no borders, quality (with guarantee of socialy/environmentaly responsible manufacturing processes)
Mostly sights I associate with Europe (like the Eiffel Tower) and sights I associate with my home country (like the Gediminas castle)
Blanket, cocoa and and a heater
But truth be told, my biggest caffeine intakes are during dark months because I can't get up without light, so I usually: drink 3+ cups of coffee and work with all the lights on
Well you see, sure it would be nice to enjoy sunny evening, but our evenings are cold so might as well just stay at home
Otherwise just do what you like and stick with it until sun comes out again
We just kind of got used to it
It's pretty depressing though, especially when people go to work while it is still dark and return home when it's dark already (it is already pitch black by 5pm)
During this time people tend to spend free time in malls by going to restaurants and cafes
Voting is always a compromise for me, I'm much too left for any party to represent my views here
Parliament - we have like 4 major parties at the moment (parties rise and disassemble every election), so there'll always be a pick, and our system is in a way, where even if you vote for a party that barely has any support, if it still manages to get some level of votes, they'll get a seat or two, so the vote still counts
President:
Luckily not in 2019, since both of the 2nd round candidates were adequate, and the truly bad candidate imo was third
2014 - we reelected what we had - Grybauskaitė, since she was doing quite good a job
2009 - Grybauskaitė won on the first round, she got over 69% of the votes from a list of 7 candidates, so there wasn't even a 1v1 scenario
Aaand I'm too young to remember any other elections
Really common, although it's different about smoking in public places
You rarely see people smoking on the street, but when it gets dark, or they get inside, suddenly someone dissapears for a few minutes every 20 minutes and it changes
No one really cares, but people still just go by the unwritten rules
Lithuania:
Common among 35+ and lower class people, very uncommon in 20-30 age professionals (mid-upper mid class)
Perceived only slightly negatively in a professional world as its more of a distraction to everybody and a waste of work time i guess
22% in 2020 compared to 28% in 2017
So it's declining
In general it's perceived negatively
Also there are a lot of rescrictions for where you can smoke
In past few years alot of people switched from smoking to vaping, which has a slightly better reputation
Yeah I was going to say during the day not so much
After dark it seems like 60-70%
Second grade
Damn thats young af
AND skating
Can you believe the riff raff in Romania
Vilnius is polish , " Thats russia right " , communism was better (mostly said by unemployed alcoholics and 89 year old grandmas )
Oy, neighbor, wanna discuss Adomas Mickevičius/Adam Mickiewicz as well
Yup, same for all Baltic states
Also are you triggered when someone says that you are Baltic country not Scandinavian
Cause youre Baltic
Basically it was the allies, with soviet union as human shield to soak the bullets
Intelligent governments consisting of hundreds of brilliant minds had a lot more ideas how to prevent casualties and actually strategize in battles
Soviet union however was one man to rule them all, with others agreeing or risking to be executed
Also, ally soldiers were paid, well equipped and fed, while soviet union had farmers fighting with knuckles against machine guns, while being fed a palms worth of scolded grain
So again, soviet unions input in winning ww2 was tiny compared to its army size, and basically held germanys hands while allies beat it to death
I know because my great grandfather fought in the front while being a farmer (farmers were not to be drafted because they produced food, but in soviet union sheepa fly if leader says so), then was exiled to siberia with 3 children 8-14yo
Wouldnt calling it one of the American states work better
Oof, more shots fired
I wonder if brits will vote for Trump again though
Then what is eastern europe
Oh my, to me this sounds like saying 'arctic circle starts only at the northermost point of Greenland'...
We consume the 2nd largest amount of pure alcohol (12
9 litres per capita)
The only country that drinks more than us is Belarus (14
4 litres)
Never thought that Lithuania had any domestic designs of any war related vehicles until I found out about an aircraft series called ANBO
These where mid war period monoplanes
Most of the panes where designed to train pilots, but there where also scout planes and even light bombers
Hehe, can't beat us ;_;
Idk
Official statistics portal of Lithuania shows that Lithuania stabilized population-wise in 2019, so you prolly saw data before 2017-2018
Don't know about Bulgaria tho
Source:
ANBO literally means - Antanas(name) want's to be in the air
I mean, according to Wikipedia it's Belarus
Yeah I know
I found it funny :)
Depends on the beach
If it's a nudist beach it's 99%, if it's a non-nudist beach it's probably like 10-20%.
In Lithuania, highly depends on the spot
There are nudist beach part where every women for the most part is topless (mostly old ladies go there) and there are women parts of the beach where usually mothers hand around topless
Active/passive beach areas are clothed, well you know what I mean
Source: I asked my mother in the past, she loves sunbathing in the summer with grandma and/or friends in all types of beach parts
Yes we divided our beach into parts as well
What's stopping a guy from coming there
General consensus, unwritten rules, maybe life guards and you can jog through that area as long as you run across the coast, again, general consensus, nobody bats an eye about it, maybe a few, exceptions like always
Same as czech
But i have my childhood lego and bionicle stash ready for my son
Total worth is up to 2k€ i guess
Ty mom and dad
> Millennium Falcon for 780€ (The f Lego
To be fair, it will take at least half a day to construct one
I do kinda want it
Well, that's basically all the countries in europe
Although the thing about not all pagan traditions dying down is only partially true
They're remembered, yeah, but not really celebrated
There was Dziady, but it was replaced by wszystkich świętych, so to call it a pagan tradition is a stretch
I probably see it from a different point of view, becouse in Lithuania pagan traditions make up 50% of all major holidays
We still celebrate Dziady (Vėlines in Lithuanian), žolinės (Zielna), Jorė (Idk how it's called in polish, rasos šventė (morning dew holiday) and even more
I've heard about kupała in poland, but I haven't heard it's celebrated anymore
&#x200B;
Our 2012-2016 Prime Minister Butkevičius speaking English that bad that he even replaced English words for similar sounding Lithuanian with idiotic meanings
Pick an English answer or press conference from any PM in the 30 years
Should be a national law in Lithuania only the foreign minister can give interviews (or answer questions) in English
Our last president wasn’t too bad either
[Užgavėnės]
I think it is quite interesting
Also this is nationwide so not like I am the only one practising it
I mean, asides from all the celebrations that a lot of countries still do, I remember when I was a kid, bread was being sold mostly in unsliced loaves
My grandmother told me to never place the loaf of bread "facing" the door, as it might "leave the house" (you starve), which I found fascinating
If you would cut a loaf in half - te side which you just cut
I guess a Lithuanian that hates basketball or beer or black bread or cold beetroot soup
Lithuanian who doesn't like basketball
A Lithuanian who doesn’t like basketball
A Lithuanian who hasn't committed suicide
>In German it is "Die Sonne"(female,the sun) and "Der Mond"(male, the moon)
same in Lithuanian, Saulė (sun, fem
) and Mėnulis (moon, masc
In Lithuania, Saule ( the Sun) is "female". Meanwhile, Menulis (the Moon) is "male".
In Lithuanian, Saulė - (sun) is a feminine gender, while Mėnulis - (moon) is masculine
We actually do not have an 'it' neutral words, everything is gendered in the language
Lithuanian:
Sun = Saulė - female, commonly referred as "mother" or "grandmother" in folklore
Moon = Mėnulis, Mėnuo, Mėnesis - male, sometimes referred as "father" in folklore
And the stars are their daughters :)
Saulė (sun) - feminine, mėnulis (moon) - masculine
Same as in German
Saulė - Sun(female), Mėnulis - moon(male)
Lol, Lithuanian has a very similar word to kuningas and that word is kunigas, meaning priest
Traditionally: Vytautas the Great  (1392-1430) and Stephen Bathory (1576-1586) reigns and, of course, the interbellum (1918-1940)
However, actually **now** Lithuania is in its heydays
Probably when Grand Duke Gediminas ruled, although I don't think I've heard anyone describe it as a golden age
I think you can also put the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as a golden age too, but Lithuania itself didn't have as much power and authority in those times, there were disagreements in politics, which basically led to The three partitions
Anyways, I'd say 1300s were a golden age because there weren't any major wars, the population was growing, new trade routes to the western countries, and because of Gediminas, skilled artisans were coming from all over Europe in order to sell and teach artisans in Lithuania
P.S. I actually have never heard of a golden age in Lithuania's history, so I don't know the details, or if this counts as a golden age
Lithuania in the XIV-XV centuries, when it covered lands streaching from the Baltic to the Black sea
Although Lithuanians were a minority in their own country, we still view those days of the Grand Dutchy of Lithuania as our golden age
During his reign the Commonwealth was in its zenith and catching up with most developed European countries
He also opened Vilnius University in 1579, the first one in Lithuania
Not really, it is not 1930s anymore
And even if you hate PLC, Stephen Batory can be remembered as just a Lithuanian grand duke
In Wales
Damn most have never heard of Lithuania, so I guess  Vilnius having the largest baroque old town in Europe should have more visitors than just a few tour groups from Asia
I would have to say Anykščiai and Nida are very good places to visit when you are in Lithuania
I went to Adršpach once and I gotta say, it was pretty cool
Anykščiai are really visited
Nida or Klaipėda or Samogitia are worth visiting
Also Panemunė
Oh really
I rarely see any tourists at Anykščiai but i think that Klaipeda is visited very often but Samogitia is pretty chill ngl
Klaipėda isn't visited very often
Most foreign people here are from International University
Anyksciai is popular, because every Lithuanian teacher goes to anyksciai, because you know, Biliūnas
I recommend Samogitia
I went with class trips nearly everywhere in Samogitia
It's big and interesting place
Go visit very high hills (200m or less), go visit stone museum, Telšē and other cool cities
Biggest Japanese garden in Europe
I forgot to add Šiauliai to this list
Šiauliai are on border of Samogitia
Šiauliai have bicycle, photography, cat museums, big malls to shop, very known boulevard and other interesting places
German, French, Russian can be quite an asset
Other than that, it can be region specific, in the baltics for example, Swedish is quite handy
Difficulty probably depends where you are from
I learnt german it school, didn’t learn much, because I didn’t have motivation back then, but trying to improve it now and it’s not difficult
While my vocabulary is weak, I can quite easily pick out words when listening to someone speaking
Russian seems like one of the easiest languages for me to start learning now, because I’m used to occasionally hearing russian in the bus and other places, also there are a lot of words similar to lithuanian
On the other hand, I tried to look into french, but I just can’t wrap my head around it
The whole sentence sounds like one word
And words are pronounced differently than they are written
I see you are from Romania and as far as I know french is from the same language family as romanian
So I assume french is much easier for you, because it is much more similar than a lot of other languages
I've been learning Russian for 5 years now
I mean I can easily hold a conversation in a restaurant, shop, talk about simple subjects in Russian, but I'm still at least 3 years away from fluency and if a subject gets even a bit more complicated - I'm lost
For comparison - it took me 5 years to learn completely fluent English, starting from nothing
In Catalonia you beat a log that shits presents
Stalin or Żeligowski
For me Vitkauskas
He was the military head in Lithuania
He refused to resist in ww2 and later joined ussr army
Both of them are hard according to my English and American friends
I can see why it would be kinda hard, but I don't think of it as THAT bad
But pronunciation, especially with letters like ą, ę, ž, č, ū, etc can be very difficult
(If you want to know something, just message me and I'll try my hardest to help )
Iceland, Denmark, Slovenia, Croatia and Latvia for being the first countries to recognize our freedom in 1991
Iceland, for recognizing our independence in 1991, the first in the West to do so
That kind act is still remembered and was very important
We want to thank the Polish for being our best friends after all the fighting that happened in the middle ages
Thanks to Iceland for being the first country to recognice our freedom ️. Ya’ll rock
Im not good at history so thank u Latvia for being our best friends :) we really love yall over here <3
I have to second that, Dutch isn't that challenging if it's slow, it also get easier if you hear it often enough
Also, [this song is a gem]
Well, with that attitude
I would say the News channel, ( LRT, TV3, LNK ) do cover US often,but mostly if there's important things like: Californian fires and Protests
Also when the american news segment comes, it is short and most often covered last
On Radio even less
But if you ask Lithuanian on the street about what is happening in US, most people would only know the big things that happened and, only in the basic way
A lot
And honestly, the moment that something about the US comes up I know they did some stupid shit again
To some extent, yes
My first trip outise of europe was to Vancouver, Canada
I didn't think thr cultural difference would so big
I guess it's not really indentity, but rather mentality that binds a lot of europeans togheter
For example: in canada, every cashier was constantly trying to start a small talk
Nowhere in europe have I encountered that
Yeah, just not in Europe
In quite a few post colonial societies, you'd find this thing called "whiteness", and that's about the only thing that actually comes close to a "European" identity
what shared culture and Ideals
Every country has different cultures, some of them widely different, ideals is even more obscure a term
Horny
What
Poland, Estonia
Latvia too but they're our brothers so we don't really rival them like that
Uhhh, Russia
Nooo, Latvia will always be our best braliukas <3
You should learn Austrian history a lot more closely ;) You know that Austro-Hungarian Empire was a major party to that clusterf\*&k, right
The trigger to WWI
It's part of your history
That part of the world is most definitely part of your history
(presuming you're Austrian)
This isn't a comparative issue, btw
It's just Austrian history leading to WWI
Same in Lithuania
Isn't that in entire world
mėsa - meat in Lithuanian
mesa - table in Spanish
Preservative (prezervatyvas) means condom in Lithuania
Also, the latin/italian/spanish curva sounds very similar to kurwa, which, like in poland, is also a very popular swearword here(albeit we do not use it nearly as creatively as the poles)
LV-LT
Melnas/Mėlynas
Black in Latvian, blue in Lithuanian
Kakis/Kakas
Cat in Latvian, shit in Lithuanian
Riga has a famous [sculpture of a black cat on one of the roofs] Every time someone mentions "Melnas kakis" on the roof, all I can think about is a big blue shit
Well, it’s not spelled exactly the same but there is almost no difference when saying the two words in Lithuanian:
LT : Pūkas     EN: Fluff     |  LV: Pukas    EN: Dragon
Was trying to teach myself some Danish on Duoligo, and just noticed that the word avis means newspaper in Danish
In Lithuanin avis is sheep
Yeah, the czech and polish ones are the best ( I know polish too)
Poruhane rypadło - CZ broken excavator, PL Fucked  excavator
Šmatička na patičku - CZ umbrella, PL a little rag on a little stick
Drevni kocur - CZ squirrel, PL tree cat
Divka - CZ girl, PL whore
Mam Napad - CZ I have an Idea, PL I have an ambush
Sralinkova ganiačka - CZ runner, PL shit chaser
Produpnik - CZ fiancée, PL professional ass
Ja sem Netoperek - CZ I am Batman, PL I am a little bat
There are also some polish - german ones
Kurwenstop - GR painkiller, PL whore stopper/fuck stopper
Dupenwazelin - GR Hemoroid cream, PL Ass vaseline
Ihate it here, no offense but this is a living hell, the wages r really not great, the people, everyone here is deppressed its just a shit hole
Climate wise, we experience heat and cold, probably not as much cold as the north and not as much heat as the south, although I’m bigger heat fan than cold, so it’s quite meh for me
We have sea but we don’t have mountains, it’s all flat
That I don’t mind cause I like looking at long and wavy fields out in the horizon, simple nature with not much exotic stuff but all that kinda feels nostalgic when you go out at the lakeside, etc
Other than that, history shows that we are unlucky
We were in the middle of two super powers  - Russia and Germany while Lithuania was just a battle field in world wars, although maybe we didn’t suffer too much, compared to Poland, but occupations hurt as a lot, especially the USSR
I both like it but also dislike it for many reasons
Thanks, sending love back :) Prague is one of my favorite European cities
I am also planing to study in Denmark (once all this worldwide situation sets in, I mean)
Do you have any tips on how to start
I would apply to Master programs in life sciences, however I am not sure which university is the best if we compare quality of studies and living expenses :/
Džiaugiuosi, kad radot namus Lietuvoje
Linkiu sėkmės ir gero gyvenimo
Well, my main concerns are living conditions and language of studies
What is your opinion about English courses (if you took them)
Also, is it possible to work and study at the same time
What qualifications are necessary to find a job
Yeah, the cost of living is one of the main reasons why I decided to stay this year and save up
Thank you for the information
Three that I know are:
-sudėt kaštona (sss-hu-dhet kash-toh-nah), which means "to put a chestnut",
-kurmis lenda (khurr-miss laen-dah), or as my dialect says kūrmis landa (koor-miss lann-dah)
It means " a mole is coming
Idk if it's a local saying, so I put the dialect version in too
And perhaps the funniest one
-Einu sėst ant sosto galvot apie gyvenimą (Aei-nuh saesst ahnt sos-toh gall-vhot apee-eh ghee-veh-nih-maah), which means "I am going to sit on the throne and think about life".
Ohhhh thats what it is
Probably [Eglė, the Queen of Serpents]
Just to give you some of the highlights
A snake slithers into her blouse(coding for rape) so she is forced into a marriage with the snake
After many years, she and her new family visit her parents, brothers and uncles
Her family interrogates Egles children and the one daughter gives out the secret on how to get in touch with the snake-daddy, who then proceeds to be murdered by the brothers and uncles
Egle is so upset she basically murders her children and kills herself, happy ending for this fairy-tale
About every folk tale
Especially original tales from pagan times
We had this story where after defeating the evil witch, our hero ties her to his horse, and let's him drag her around the world, so her bones scatter and her brain matter is splattered, and it is said that when you see the snow glistening on a cold winter day, it's the bits of the witches brain that sparkle
For real
it's the same-ish story] Suwałki Region region has a variation of it
Although, I don't know what the story was doing in a collection of slavic tales (maybe you meant polish)
Europe is generally less religious than the US so usually, no
The phrase you're looking for is not insane
Latvian is possible to figure out in text form, impossible if they speak
But even reading is hard since they have many different words
I personally find Latvian pretty easy to understand
Some words are, obviously, very different but it's otherwise easy to read
Same
But their words are out of place
Try to guess what veikals mean
Veikalas in Lithuanian is work (more like result of work), but in Latvian it's a store
True
But still, when you remember what they mean (like veikals was one of the first words I learned) you don't really have a problem reading it
Yes, and also they look funny, which is a plus
[Kibinai] i'd say is the most popular food to grab as a quick bite
Zeppelins maybe
Also šakotis, but it's more like a cake
Fried bread with cheese
Kibinas, Čeburėkas (local-ish)
But most popular is Kebabas (like döner, but in lavash)
Is it though
I consider it more like a beer snack
Where can you get it in the fast food context
Weird
I haven't seen then anywhere for more than 15 years or so
They were popular back in the day, especially at the beach
But not anymore - too greasy, spoils quicky, can only eat them fresh, and good ones are hard to make
I don't know, this is the closest to the fast food I can think of
I live in a street with 12 houses
7 (including my own) have the Lithuanian flag hanging outside their house all the time
The rest hang up a flag on Independence days and other Lithuanian holidays
Considering there is a law in the Baltics, that during national holidays there has to be a flag hoisted on every house (failure to do so can get you a fine) - no, not weird at all
Do they fly national flag or historical flag
Yeah it's pretty much everywhere
Dependence on cars even if we have pretty good public transportation system
If you don't drive one, you are seen as immature or ecofascist
Mandatory military conscription
The whole point of living in a liberal democracy is freedom, and not being forced by the government to do shit like this
And yet, here we are
I don't care that we have hostile neighbors, it's not my fucking job to protect anyone
I'm suicidal half of the time, I can barely make eye contact with anyone, let alone live with 30 guys in a single room
I can't run longer than 15 meters without gasping for air, I'm physically weaker than most girls I've met in highschool
My parents live abroad
You expect me to leave my job to sleep in the forest at -15 degrees, running around exhausted with a gun that I want to point right at my own fucking face
Fuck outta here, for real
I love Lithuania
I really do
But when it comes to mandatory military conscription, it can chortle my balls without a moment of hesitation
The only time such a thing should even be constitutional in the first place is during wartime
And no, "some other countries do it too" is not an excuse
Uolektis or Ulna  - it's the distance from your elbow to your finger tips
Valakas - 21,38 ha
Statinė(barrel) - an area of land sown with one barrel filled with grains
None of these are used anymore except for maybe sometimes Uolektis
Don't forget Sprindis
How to get length of Sprindis
Make an widest L as you can with thumb and index
The length between them is Sprindis
How much is a pebble
Or do you weight yourself in 12
2 stones or smth
35kg margin is huge and can visibly change appearance
Ahh, thanks
Another fun fact
Kölsch, Lithuanian and Potawomi languages are the only ones using the letter "ė".
i dont know how hesburger is in other countries but in lithuania its awful
Yea, McDonalds is wayyyyy better
Hesburger is "cheap" mcdonald's which isn't cheap
People go to hesburger only because mcdonald's aren't in most cities, or are in pretty inconvenient locations
I live in klaipeda and there is only 1 McDonalds while theres like 7 hesburgers
Theres always a huge line in McDonalds, thats another reason i guess
that could be a reason
but living in Vilnius and after trying hesburger once i do my best to keep out of that place
Same
I live in Klaipeda too
My former school had a hesburger very near (my school was not far away from BIG), so everybody went there
Some Hesburgers have big lines too
But they made fries a little bigger, but way less of them, so it's kinda scam
Smeltė? Mašiotas
taip
Yes, indeed we use gmailas a lot, because most people use it
Nowadays people don't use Yahoo or hotmail so much
I am actually the only person I know, who uses Yahoo
I even have Yahoo Japan account
Why I don't use Gmail
I still have and use Yahoo account from early days
It's same as calling every dish soap "Fairy" because of brand
Personaly I still use mail (paštu) or email (el
paštu) and use gmail only when I want to specify the use of my personal male rather than work/school/uni mail
I even started using my university outlook because it looks better than Gmail
This is one of the first times I see a post by another Lithuanian I feel so inexplicably happy
Yep, I started using it less when my uni changed and it used outlook instead of Gmail, but nonetheless I catch myself saying / "atsiųsiu tau gmailą" / . Especially to friends
I salute you for the fact that you had 666 at the end there
Poland
You know, the Commonwealth and all that came with it
Russia
Our enemy from ancient times
Not much to be said
Sweden
The wars with Poland-Lithuania in 1800s left their mark here
Also Vikings
I suppose Belarus
Since around 1200 until 1800 Belarus was mostly under Lithuanian rule, so much of GDL/Commonwealth's history is also a part of Belarusian history, too
Not really sure about this one either, but Latvia/Teutonic knights/Livonian Knights
The attempts to christianize Lithuanian lands were mostly unsuccessful by them
And the most famous Lithuanian battle (Battle of Grunwald) was against the knights
that battle (basically) marked the end of the attempts to christianize Lithuania by the Knights
Poland, Russia and Germany
To a lesser extent, Latvia and Estonia
Poland
Belarus
Russia
Latvia
Estonia
Poland
Russia
Germany
Belarus/Ukraine
Latvia/Estonia
I dont believe whole EU will make it to 100 years
Maybe clumps of its remnants, but definitely not whole
Saaaame
and all I could think of was this
Either Poland or Latvia
Depending on the day of the week
No joke, Latvia
We are the only countries that have any baltic languages left
The other one was prussia but they were annexed back in the 19th century
Easy
Latvia
Would lay my head down for braliukas
Hey braliukas
Ukraine is pretty well loved here
Stay strong
>but they realy hate us now
I don't think many actually do in 21st century
Some may have complexes when talking about Poland, but most have positive or neutral opinion on Poland
On Youtube videos both may argue, but I don't think many actually hate you
Tomaszewski tried to instigate hate between both, but eventually failed
And both of our countries cooperate military-wise, LitPol grid
Hell, Lithuanians living near Polish border even go shopping to Poland
So in 21st century I don't think there's a strong reason for us to dislike you
Our "brothers" position is reserved to Latvia (as we call "braliukas") because we're both the only remaining Baltic nations in the world, but culturally and religiously we are probably closer to Poland due to history
Greets from Lithuania
I kind of disagree about Poland
We don't call Poland our brother country, at least I've never ever heard it
But Latvia
Oh yes
I don't think there's a single Lithuanian who doesn't call Latvians our brothers
I, as a lithuanian, have met a few latvians
From my experience they're a little goofy compared to us sad potato sacks
I guess so
I would rearrange the colors so that it looks more reggae
I personally hate Vytis because it's hard to me to draw and it doesn't simply look good to me
But you have a point
Add some black lines and stars to the old one and instantly be recognized as the Sub-Saharan state we were meant to be ️
I don't think Vytis would work, because it's a bit to complicated, but the historical Gediminaičių stulpai flag could work
I heard something like :" If you add "as" ending to any Russian word , you will get Lithuanian language"
Thank you Iceland for being first to recognize our independence in 1991
Iceland
The awesome chaps that they are were the first ones to recognise the Baltic States as independent when we peaced out from the soviets
In Lithuania we have an event every year on June 17th (Iceland's Independence Day) which is called "Takk, Ísland" where people can get to know the Icelandic culture, language and in general their way of life a bit more
Reminds me of the [video of a football match (LIT-UKR)] where Lithuanians chanted for Ukraine and Ukrainians for Lithuania
It was neat
I and most of my family/friends live in apartment buildings, and everyone keeps theirs doors locked
I remember having automatically locking doors in the old days, but I don't think they're very common anymore and I personally don't like them at all - if you leave and forget your keys inside and close the door, you're super screwed
Happened to my parents once, once to me too
At parents i only locked for the night
At my own house i lock all the time
However, im sure here you can never lock your house and nobody will bother to check or rob you (private house at least)
Been living in an ethinically anti-national region for about 15 years in a private house, no fence and not once had my things stolen, even if my grill or bike stood in an open place for a week
So if the most anti-national folk dont bother taking my stuff, nobody else will
Džon meid hiz uei tu a tevern fruh fe dark forest, onlį tu faind aut fat hį forgot fe monei
We don't have the th sound in lithuanian, so I used what a native lithuanian without english knowlege would pronounce
I think the closest would be f. I heard Germans often substitue z instead of th
Džon maid hs vei tu a tavern fru de dark forest onli tu faind out tat hi forgot te moni
&#x200B;
Have no clue what to do with the th sound
Džon meid his vay tu a tavern trū de dark forest, only tu faind aut dat hy forgot de mony
Džon meid chis vei tu e tavern tru a dark forest, onli tu faind aut dat chi forgot de moni

LGBT and same-sex partnership
We just (yesterday) held our parliamentary elections and the results show the new ruling coalition will include Laisvės Partija - the party that's been advocating for LGBT rights throughout all of its campaign
People thought Lithuania is not yet ready, but alas - Laisvės Partija got 11 seats
Group that with Liberalų sąjūdis' 13 seats and the election winners' TS-LDK 50 seats (both of them said to be pro LBGT), and the new ruling coalition is gonna be the most liberal we've ever had with actual changes very very possible
Side note - all 3 parties are led by women, while all 3 opposition parties are led by men, something I see to be VERY positive
I’m an lgbt Lithuanian and it makes me so happy to see a positive change
I'm not, but I have a LOT of friends who are, and they are very happy for this change as well
Wishing you the best
:DD
Nothing has changed yet
We now have a LGBT person in our parliament but it doesn't mean that  gay marriages from now on are legal in Lithuania
Maybe after 1 or 2 years that would be the case, but not now
Laisvės Partija and Liberalų Sąjūdis are both liberal and will definitely support the same sex marriages but I can't say the same about TS-LKD
It is too early to say that positive change has happened
:))) It would be funny if it weren't depressing
In all seriousness, I am so sorry for all poles for what your government's been doing, its absolutely disgusting
Thank you
Vilnius University for general studies, Kaunas technical university for engineering
That's what I was going to say haha
ISM is on par or above VU when it comes to business and economics IMO
But it is private so I don't know how comparable it is
I'm Lithuanian and I think that this country is interesting for no one
Like, really it seems so, especially when you're living in small town
> Estonia, Lithuania or Bosnia,
ITS CALLED LATVIA
From all the cities I've been to, Copenhagen seemed the closest to a utopia
Everything's clean, people are chill, prices not too bad
+Vikings were originally from denmark, not norway as many people think
Lithuania is the one with the fastest WiFi
And this is just another example of how people always confuse Lithuania and Latvia
You mock them but their mainland hills are bigger than ours
Was just joking, because people usually name all 3 :)
Founded russia
As far as I know modern russia is mostly a descend of The Kievan Rus, so modern day Ukrain
I've heard about the whole Ingria thing, but that's just a small part of Russia
Belarus is about to open a new power plant new border so we will need a backup
Thats fine, but we are still stacked as 3
Woah
That's interesting
Now that you have made it clear I can connect the dots of info collected over the years
I guess Russia was founded by the Norse, but that's where the major similiarities end as I see it
The russian mentality, the language, the folklore are so different, that I think the norse origins were tainted over the 1000 years of slavic influence and I can see why Russians wouldn't like to be called "originally norse". Doesn't change the fact that it's super cool and interesting history
I wonder what could you find out about origins of other countries if you dug deeper
Yeah, and "bad" can actually mean "good".
I guess "challenge" is another similarly untranslatable word
Less than Lithuanians squawk themselves, still more than Western European countries
Are you
Big business does have a lot of influence over German government
Yeah he “agreed” to this new government overhaul
If i had to write one, it would be:
G&G sindikatas - Muzika kuri saugo
Its native language song, written by band's leader during his school years, with lyrics so deep, moral, sincere and fitting the national narrative that it deserves to be read and sung in schools, have papers written about it
However, ill list all of the best songs i know from each genre
Classical: M. K. Čiurlionis - Miškas; Jūra
Fashion-electronic/Avantgarde: Einius & Beissoul - Kaip tu ir sakei; literally all their songs, but the taste is aquired
Be ware
Meme music: Vidas Bareikis - Pusvalanduko
Rock: Andrius Mamontovas - Geltona, žalia, raudona
Requiem - Neišeik
Rock ballad & absolute all time favorite: Hiperbole - Pamiršk mane
Hip hop/rap: G&G sindikatas - Muzika kuri saugo; Broliai šaunuoliai, Lilas & Inomine - Karina; Tu privalai skambėt; Viskas
Electronic: Sel - Užmerkiu akis, sel600, Laiškas iš Paryžiaus, Nieko verta, Bek etc
Literally all his songs after 2000s. Jazzu, Mario, Vidis - I'll be gone
Naktinės personos - Pasaulis toks yra
R&B - Donatas Montvydas - most of his songs
Pop - Monika Linkytė - Po dangum
[neturėjom dainos] - Solo Ansamblis
The song is literally called "we didn't have a song" and the band is called "Solo Group". It's so good that the first tike I heard it I listened to it five times in a row
The lyrics are beautiful and don't feel like they're fake (like in a lot of modern music), but actually very real and comming from the songwriters heart
This band is so underrated and I don't get how are they not popular around europe yet
My city is large by my standards, but not by your standards (160k inhabitants)
Living in suburbs of Vilnius
Every part of the city can be reached within 30min drive
Have 4 roads to enter the city from various sides, so traffic is quite easy to avoid
2 of those roads are arteries of the city, which allow fastest commutes imo
To reach Latvia i only need to make two turns left
I live 6km from city line, but its 11km to city centre, 12km to my job, 7/18/20km to malls and hardware stores
Im literally living in the best place of Vilnius, which is also considerably cheaper than northern suburbs, which have 0 asphalt roads, no shops and always have traffic jams
And the only difference i have from people who live in the city itself is that i always have a place to park my car, i drive car instead of public transport
As a person that lives in poland I'd say beautiful is a long stretch
There are some pretty landscapes, but the flatlands with an entire 0 hills are really unimpressive and cover most of the country
The city skylines are ruined by the shitload of square buildings, but there probably isn't a post-soviet country that doesn't have those
There are potholes everywhere and a lot of roads are really low quality
Sure, the coutry did progress over the past two decades, but it's still a long way to go, to call the country advanced, compared to other EU countries
Smetona belongs in borscht soup
Smetana is sour cream
I fail to see the problem
I don't think I've seen it too
But sour cream
Good
Pizza
Good
Sour cream and pizza
Why not
Ethnicly homogenous
Holding on to cultural and historical heritage
If you have 2-8M ethnic majority, and add immigrants - you go from Norway to Sweden, from Switzerland to Germany etc
Not saying immigrants make it worse
Its the general culture that shitfs too much from default
Well, being bilingual basically means nothing abroad, if only 3 million people speak your native tongue
You have to learn at least a couple of foreign languages
Šikšnosparsnis (bat) or the spelling I myself prefer šiknosparnis (ass wings)
Not really stupid but confusing Lithuanian versions of some animals I've remembered so far:
• žiurkėnas ( a "rat" + [nas] ) - hamster
• meškėnas ( a "bear"+ [enas]) - racoon
• jūrų kiaulytė ( a sea piggy) - guinea pig
• jūrvarnis ( a sea crow) - cormorant
• žuvėdra ( a fish eater) - seagull
• voverė or voveraitė ( sounds the same as a "girolle" funghus) - squirell
• šoklys ( jumper ) - dipodid or jerboa (  jumping rodent)
• dygliakiaulė ( a spiky pig) - porcupine
• vėplys ( "vėpti" in Lithuanian means "to hang") - walrus
• šikšnosparnis ( leather feathers or belt feathers) - bat
• briedis ( in Russian a word "bred" means "nonsense") - moose
• kiškis ( in Russian it sounds the same as a word "guts") - bunny
I guess I could point out three
Two were 9 years ago and those were Michael Teló's Ai Se Eu Te Pego, we called it just Nosa
The other was Lauris Reiniks' Aš bėgu
And more recently Vidas Bareikis' Ežero dugne
For some reason the first one that came to mind is "Tri Poloski", mostly because it was extremely overplayed (especially in my middle school)
Lithuania national stadium
It's been under construction as long as I remember
I checked in Wikipedia and it says that construction started in 1987
Every couple of years there will be announcment that constructions will end at year X but they never end it
this is what happens when a land of basketball tries to play football
nobody is really building it
Its just that different public figures want a proper football stadium, but can't agree how it should be built
The progress for the last ~30 years was basically 0
There is not a lot of what could be demolished at first place
[ This how it looks
Not anymore
There was certainly some of that going on after our first confirmed case but it seems to have died down
Yup, 1 case confirmed, can't find pasta in stores
In Lithuania that was the case a week ago
Now it died down
When did this start
I was in Warsaw on Wednesday and the shops seemed fine
We call it "Paukščių takas", which means the same, although it's plural, so it would translate more to "Path of the birds".
Skirmantas, probably because it's a Lithuanian slang for an upper part of the butt crack
Idk to be honest, but if I have to chose I'd say the revolut card
You can change currencies online freely, and manipulate with your money (up to 1000£ per month) in any way you like with no fees
After spending the 1000£ a small fee is applied
So I guess that
Also, we didn't invent, but make really good lasers and their parts
Probably CRISPR, admittedly not uniquely Lithuanian since it was also developed simultaneously by Americans and Israelis, but still probably the best scientific contribution from this country
Atom bomb is a very far fetch
If there is a single man(there isn’t, it was a team effort) that is deserving the name of the inventor of the atomic, it was probably Robert Oppenheimer
My mistake
They also have I believe the second highest hser base in the eu in lithiuania + favorable laws, so I thought that they started here
Vut the laser part is true tho
Fall of constantinople is also listed as one of the end points of the middle ages here
Both 'baltaraiščiai' and 'stribai' are more historical terms, although 'stribai' very rarely may be used as some
It's common to hear someone, that watches over and controlls another person a KGB-ist
It's not really a super insulting term, but it's definitely rude
Yes
I dont know about its popularity in Lithuania,  but I have seen it and loved it
I first watched s1 and s2 and felt like a part of me died when I had to wait a year for s3
But after a year, coming back to the show, I- like many people here - felt lost and thought it was a bit of a stretch
It DID explain things, but also made everything unnecessarily complicated
I would like to thank Poland, for having Kaufland
Also Latvia, for being bros
The Russians, for not attacking us during ZAPAD
Hopefully we can thank the Belarussians for not building a shitty nuclear power plant that makes half of Lithuania uninhabitable in the case of a nuclear explosion
By candy you clearly meant those three sex shops right across the border right
High quality wines happen to be cheaper in Sweden, than in many places
That is because the government manages purchasing well and gets big discounts for big orders on high quality alcohol
I can't give you an example off the top of my head, but I know a few rare wine merchants that recommended going to Systembolaget for the more expensive alcohol
Well where else
You mean standard and easily understood
Like I can buy a kitchen door and fittings in US and bring that to my house in Lithuania and fit it without worrying
Aight you're joking
No way would I go 500 km just to shop
Polish roads are nice, but there are not enough high speed motorways
Going to Poland is a pain
Still
I think the duke of Burgundy did
look how that turned out for him
You started that exceptionally late
Have seen it mentioned here but kvass, such a good and delicious drink
Especially home made
Not very popular amongst children and younger folks but drinks like Baikal and Tarchunas (don't know how it is in English), they are both left from the Soviet Union
Such a good drink tho
English
Translation is shit most of the time and normal sounding things in English sound like some wizard spell in Lithuanian
In English
I'm just used to everything in my computer being in English since anything else wasn't an option while I was growing up
And now when apps and games decide that they want to localize it to Lithuanian I end up being very confused
I disagree
There’s no longer huge divide
People from urban areas are increasingly moving out into the country and commuting
So everybody’s mixing now
As for them being backwards - it depends on how you’re judging
There’s many instances where rural people overshoot city people
Also, the Lithuanian language and culture survived thanks to the rural population
Polish farmers/villagers
Haven’t heard such a thing
Especially since historically Poles were the bureaucrats or “masters” and way too “aristocratic” to live a lowly dirt plower life
Gotcha
I hope the overall sentiment changes soon since I personally think that country living is charming and I wouldn’t change it for any city :)
Honestly, milk is the best thing ever
Although I probably am lacktose intolerant(i get some bloating after i drink milk) I don't give a fuck and still drink like 2-3 liters a week
Usually a glass for breakfast and a glass before sleep
We used to have a couple milk bars in town, they were awesome
Milk and pastries
I went to one of them on my first date eons ago and had this great milk and orange juice drink
I wish they were still there :<
EDIT: also there's this story that I keep telling everyone about how my friends decided to have a White Russian party but everyone got sick of mixing the damn things so me and my Polish friend just drank a liter of vodka with milk
7/10 would recommend
Šiknos skylėje engl
Inside the hole of a butt
Meant to describe a place in the middle of nowhere, but also that is hard to find (like a forest)
Okk soo this is not Lithuanian
but Polish
BUT im pretty sure its only used by poles living IN Vilnius
Sometimes we say "zadupieniszki". Basically translates to behind an ass(?)
I'm third year medical student, now every student of university (including interns) got 2 weeks of holidays
I think this kinda applies
Poland gets all the credit for beating Teutonic Knights, but without Lithuania and other helping countries they wouldn’t have done that
Slave Isaura confirms
It’s not the polish people I’m talking about
I’m sure they know
It’s that other countries credit only Poland’s part in the battle
In Lithuanian it's "pasiruošes ar ne, aš ateinu” or "einu ieškoti".
Showel in Lithuanian is "kastuvas", but older people use the word "lopeta". I think that came from soviets
> pizza and pasta at the same time
wait what
What do you mean at the same time
Like pasta on pizza
"Pampers" pretty much became a word for "Diaper" (I don't think I've ever seen a different brand of diapers)
Junkers
a gas heater
*ironic*
I believe it's more correct to call it a felt-tip pen or a marker, Sharpies (and *flomasters*) are meant for writing or drawing rather than highlighting printed text
We have "aitvaras", which means kite, but it derives from a lithuanian mythological being that goes by the same name
It's not a dragon though
[Here's ] the wikipedia article about it
Lithuanian:
Kite: 'Aitvaras'.
Dragon: Darkonas for a general dragon, Aitvaras for the local variety (which has been portrayed in a variety of forms but some are close to a dragon)
It makes sense
Dragon is a flying snake lizard with wings
Tourists screaming and snapping their fingers at waiters in restaurants
If those waiters hadn't spit in their food before, they definitely did after
I hate ignorant amercans
Same in Lithuanian, "provincija", I assume we got it from French
That said it's not strictly outside the capital, it's mostly used as outside the main cities
Like people wouldn't call Kaunas provincija
'Provincija' is Lithuanian word for 'province'.
based on how francophile Russia was back in the day, I assume they got it from the french too
Never had this problem
With around 3M global speakers Lithuanians can pretty much say whatever they want almost anywhere they want outside of Lithuania
Almost no chance anyone will understand
If you want to be safe safe just switch žemaičių dialect
Only like 100k people in the world speak it
It truly is a secret language
I live within a 45min drive away from the Latvian border, and Riga is about a 90 minute drive away
I'd say we go there at least once per month (when no CoVid, obviously, but even then, the LIT-LAT border is open at the moment and we did go to Latvia in July once)
We've had a few road-trips to Germany, Scotland, Switzerland, etc
Only needed to show ID to get on the ferry on the way to the UK
And don't forget - flying has no border control
You only need to have your ID so airline staff can make sure you're travelling with your ticket - that's it
And once you land, you just walk out, no customs or border checks at all
I'm not sure about other people, but going to a different country casually is a pretty common thing among the people I know
Like, I'm driving to Ventspils (Latvia) while typing this (I'm in the back seat)
It depends on the country
For example, Lithuanians don't need to carry the Personal Identity Card or the passport except for the borderland, but crossing any border requires having such document
Officially, yeah it does, but there are no stops at the border, so unofficially you don't.
But practically people get fined (and as I said, you must have the ID in the borderland/pasienio ruožas areas where border guards occasionally check the documents)
DEFINITELY Russian
Pretty much everyone above the age of 30 speaks it, and about 30-40% of younger people speak it, however the number is dropping because now we're just starting to use English instead
Isn't scandinavia flooded with poles
Like 5% of icelands population are poles
Maybe it's a goverment plan to slowly, but surely take over the world and turn it into poland, just like in the globe
Is it though
I doubt OP is talking about native languages and there are about 2 million L2 irish speakers, so Irish would be by far the second most spoken language
Labas rytas :)
They teach stuff like that in IT in poland(where I live), so I from what I see it's not bad
Also, they teach python baasics in high school, so that's a plus, although the polish education system is not the best, in fact really bad, so that kinda cancels out the positives
> Tbh as someone who's 18 I don't really understand how someone similar age to me could be so incompetent with computers as people on this thread are describing
Even though we think that everything basic on a PC is intuitive it actually is not for first time users so unless they HAD to learn it either in school of out of need to do something, most people don't know a lot about computers
I would say I am above average PC user from a broad population, but give me a mac and I will strugle with some basic tasks (I think I only used mac once in my life)
So although it might look surprising that some of your peers don't have certain skills, its perfectly normal as those skills are acquired by doing and are not natural to people (like learning how to chew food for example)
TL:DR not everyone uses computers to the same extend as you so they know less
Depends, given that kids first get to use mobile UI, it might be easier for them to understand things
It does look intuative to a degree, one good example is gaming
While a lot of people who play games (not even hard gamers) quickly understand game controls, there was a video a while back where a guy filmed his girlfriend playing games for the first time and she even had diffuctly understanding movement, even though WSDA seems like the obvious thing (or arrow keys)
Same is with MS office programs, its intuative untill its not
Sure kids might have done power point in school, but if they don't practice those skills a lot and are not computer savy, then skills will degrade over time
Or they will just learn how to make a presentation in just one way, because it worked in the past and there wasnt a need to learn more
On one hand I am computer savy, but my other skills are lacking, skills that other people would regard as basic information
Like what do the buttons do on a car dashboard, thats what I asked my parrents after +3 years of having a licence to drive because I never owned a car and rarely drive
Despite the absurdly strict weed laws, it is fairly popular and I consider it a big part of youth's culture - I often see it's influence in cultural life, for example, local music
I think last year a teenager got a few years in prison because the police found 0
06 grams of cannabis in his smoking tray
I've never heard or seen anyone use it, so either nobody uses it or they are doing a damn good job in hiding it
Happy cake day, fellow Lithuanian
That's not really true - this guy was "only" sentenced to take care of eldery or disabled people for 6 months
Weed laws in Lithuania are strict and people legally can end up in jail for smoking a joint, but this happens very rarely, because defendants in almost every case are sentenced with exceptions, which court uses in order to not destroy lives of young people
I believe, sanity is sometimes stronger than our retarded politicians
In Lithuania, each name has one spelling and one spelling only
And the name has to adhere to Lithuanian grammar rules (so X AE AII wouldn't be allowed under any circumstances)
For example - the Lithuanian name Jokūbas can be only be spelled Jokūbas; if you try and make it Jokubas for example, it wouldn't be legal
Yeah
Either give a recording or I still have no clue
Is it like ŠČY in Lithuanian pronunciation
THE ADDITION OF MORE LETTERS DOES NOT HELP WITH READABILITY
y'all slavs need to finally adopt this wonderful gang "aeuio". You can even add "ąęėįųū". And the best part, putting multiple of them in a row does not reduce readability
I prefer the British version of most of the words that have a British/American variant but "colour".
your wrong in youre assumption
There are similar effects in English, where East Asian lack of grammar is leaking into mainstream English: "Long time no see", "No can do".
Also, here's a personal story
I'm learing German, and I was was in Poland on a business trip with a German colleage
There are interesting rock formations in the Chełmy landscape park, basalt rocks that are just sticking out there in rolling hills, pretty far from any mountains
They are volcanic in origin, cores of volcanos that have completely eroded, leaving just that house-sized rock sticking out on a hill
I visited one, and told that colleage, "Ich bin heute auf Vulkan gewesen".  He corrected me: "auf einem Vulkan".  Then I realised that in English I would not make that mistake, "I've been on **a** volcano", obviously
But here, a new language, and the absence of articles in my native tongue is shining through again
I dont think anywhere in the world is better for me than my own country
Decent, growing economy, really visible improvements year by year, improving government and bureaucratic mechanisms, no mountains, no dangerous rivers, very little stormy sea, only one type of venomous snake, a lot of nature and lakes, 4 seasons, not hot, not cold
would say this isnt much different from heaven
For me at least
I left Lithuania when I was 18, to study in UK
Spent 5years there, but ultimately that island was not for me
I considered going back home or somewhere else, ended up getting another degree in Germany, where I immediately got a good job, and now after almost 5years of living here, I have a good career prospects, fiance and a first baby on the way, so I don't see myself moving back home anytime soon
I miss it of course, but visiting often (pre-covid) having close relationship with family, friends and keeping up with Lithuanian news/media really help to still feel connected
Born or grown up
Nobody would give a shit if you were born in a hospital in Vilnius or somewhere in deep Alaskan permafrost (ok second one sounds a bit cool), as long as you grew up in here, who cares
You wont recognise a baby born in here and in Spain
Now growing up would matter a lot and would depend on a country
UK or Norway where a lot of migrants live - probably fine
Russia
Big no no
But both cases assume people are ethnic Lithuanians
I don't think anybody would care
Probably Poland, because Latvia as a country didn’t exist back then, and it probably started like in 1410 or maybe even before that
Latvia
:D our bros
>Lithua
with a break in 20th century, but overall, Poland is the oldest friend
Light, self-ironic, goofy, sometimes so ridiculous it doesnt make sense
but is therefore 100 times more funny
We usually make fun of cringiest moments of everyday life
In private we joke about others, comedians joke about themselves or stereotypes of people
99% of it is making fun of women, gay people and people who aren't Lithuanian
Other 1% is actually good humor
Remember last week's lithuanian anti-gay politician who was caught with shirtless guy in his apartment
Well, last year he got a woman pregnant (not his wife), a fish seller from lithuanian sea resort town
During his interview, he broke down crying, saying "oh god why am i like this, god please help me".

Same with some musicals Lithuania too:
"Jūratė ir Kastytis" (about a legend)
"Barbora Radvilaitė" (about a duchess
Every year is the last time to see this show
There is a joke from the soviet times, specifically about Chechoslovakia and USSR
Chechoslovakian parliament wrote a notice to the USSR parliament, that they are planning to open a Ministry of Maritime affairs
The Ussr's parliamant wrote them back:
\- Why do you need a Ministry of Maritime affairs
You have no access to the sea
The Chechoslovakian parliamant answered:
\- Why then do you need a Ministry of Culture
Had 18 now 20, due "alcoholism"... That alcoholism was brought by USSR and we still fight it
But we bypass it by going to Latvia or Poland
Our government is currently:
* **LVŽS** (49 seats): Rural interests; populist; green-conservatives; centre-right
* **LSDDP** (11 seats): Social democracy; pro-EU; centre-left
* **EAPL-CFA** (8 seats): Polish minority party; pro-Catholic; conservative; right-wing
The main opposition is currently:
* **TS-LKD** (36 seats): Liberal conservative; pro-EU; centre-right
* **LRLS** (10 seats): Liberal; pro-EU; centre
* **LSDP** (9 seats): Social democracy; pro-EU; centre-left/left-wing
The LSDDP and the LSDP were the same party until a couple of years ago, when some LSDP members split to form the LSDDP
I think they split when the LSDDP wanted to remain the government but the LSDP did not, but I'm not sure
I also don't really know how different they are, but I think the LSDP may be a little more left-wing than the LSDDP, which is more centre-left
The LSDP is still the larger party (17,000 members compared to 3,000 members for the LSDDP), but the party split hurt the LSDP's membership in parliament I believe; they will probably pick up more seats in the upcoming election though
Then there are some small opposition parties in parliament (8 seats or less) that range from **PTT** (right-wing nationalist), **DP** (social liberal; populist), and **LŽP** (green; pro-EU), but they do not matter as much
I hope this was good, I don't live in Lithuania anymore so my information may not be totally up to date and knowledgable
Well not really
I think closest would be "ane
" Which literally means "or no
Some say "supratau" which means "understood" I guess
Stangely identical to Lithuanian "na jo" or "nu jo"
Given name + Family name
Middle names are very rare
am I supposed to step back to my family history or just some creative writing
I had a rare autoimmune disease a few years back so I couldn't walk (I'm fine now), so I believe I'd be dead then
well In that case I'd be a musician wandering the country or Polish szlachta, disgraced and disowned for marrying a 10 years younger non-noble musician, on the plus side I still get to ship in hair dye from Denmark so that the age difference wouldn't be as obvious
Anyone who oposes communism, fasism, corruption, gopnik mentality, greed and psychopaty is my dearest friend
How does Turkish government react to the Chinese genocide/persecution of Turkic people
Our now former president made an official visit and that was in Finland so I guess the official stance of Lithuanian goverment is Lapland in Finland
[Proof]
This is basically where Santa lives according to 75% of the world
Is it
Your kids basically suffer from a domestic non goverment surveillance group that tracks children behavior with out their consent
Their motives are unclear, but all we know is that your goverment is unwilling to intervene
Everyone just seems to think (mostly Americans) that Lithuania is not a country and instead it's a part of Russia and our native language is Russian
That everything about Lithuania is relative to Russia
Lithuania here
Our former speaker of the Seimas (Lithuanian version of speaker of the house) Loreta Graužinienė once pronounced our country Lieva instead of Lietuva, and Lieva just translates to shitty or loser, it is a feminine adjective
Another embarrassing moment is when our former prime minister spoke english
Basically, instead of saying "I am certain" he said " I em satan" and instead of saying "I am very pleased" he said "I am vaflyst" and instead of saying "Shoulder to shoulder" he said "Shaude tu shaude". So yeah, our politicians can be a bigger laughing stock than Trump
But I don't want all that CO2 locally, just send it to Amazon, there is a big forest there, it will absorb it
Or where ever Microsoft holds its Azure servers
Then thats perfect
All we need to do is stop dropping co2 in the air and pump it into ocean
You need air for greenhouse effect and there is no air in the sea
Any word that has cases
Brain physics break when trying to think how to explain why one word has different endings, is used in different situations but has similar meaning
"Skanaus", it means enjoy your meal
Saying entire sentence just doesn't have that charm, feeling compared to two syllable (I hope it's the right word for it, "ska-naus") word
Para
Means 24hours or a day (not night or day specificly)
In Lithuania there is a choice between religious studies (focused on Catholisism) and Ethics
It highly depends on the teacher but both subjects are notorious for not being very serious
Edit: information regarding other religions would be incorporated into other subjects
Yes, and it's mandatory, you can't choose
They teach about Christianity and the pope
I'm an atheist, but the teacher is pretty chill, so I kinda like it
Yes, just in most (if not all, I just can't confirm that) schools the student is allowed to choose whether they'd like to study religious studies or ethics
My school doesn’t have it
But I’ve seen another comment saying they did
I do have a lesson called ancient culture and we’ve covered a little religion in that though
> Yes, and it's mandatory, you can't choose
Since when
Is it
I don’t have it
Well, since atleast I've been going to school
Articles [46
3] and [47
4] So I don't know what you're talking about
Especially Vladimir V. Putin the Great
Troškūnai, because it has a funny name, a cool coat of arms and a population under 400
800
Isn't that the whole population of Estonia-
Is the western and northern side not very fond of Latgalians
Uhh
I don't think it is to be honest lol
We're too small and irrelevant
Poland is china of europe
Quality is superior though
I have never come across that comparison, but I see where it's coming from
I have come across "poland is the mexico of europe" tho
Baltic States closely work together with the Nordic countries, so it's not surprising
We can only expect that cooperation to grow further
Hell, if not for the Nordic countries, I'm not sure how far the Baltic States would've gone
As for international companies, that's just a consequence of our economy growing and the world realizing we exist
I just don't see how we, a country of barely 2
8 million, can be relevant haha
But I don't mind that
It's nice and calm this way
Downside is that quality of healthcare is not even between regions
Old folk usually live deep inside provinces, and healthcare there isnt what it should be
Add ex-soviet doctors on top and you get a paid free healthcare
Luckily, being persistent with questions or reading up about what is going on and where you should be sent to next can make you immune from bribe-doctors
For Lithuania: general quality, waiting times and what we call "treating you as a person". When you go to private clinics, the wait times are small, the doctors are nice, you can easily get an MRI, you can go straight to a specialist without a need for referral from GP (super annoying and time consuming), you can actually get treatment for cosmestic stuff
For example my brother had a huge (like HUGE) benign mole on his cheek
It looked horrible and was really affecting his self confidence, but it's impossible to get it removed in public system, since it's not life threatening, benign and doesn't obstruct vision or something
He had to get it removed privately
Most good jobs here offer private health insurance

Most people say 'Eastern Europe' in general, but not anything specific
Honestly, that age was for the most part a shit-show
Get up at like 7, go to school at 7:50 (I live really close by, but I know some people who have to wake up at around 5:30)
School starts at 8, one school hour is 45 minutes, but our breaks are longer
The first two breaks are 10 minutes each, third and fourth are twenty and thirty minutes each
Usually we end around 1-2pm, but it can sometimes end later, because of other stuff we have to attend, for example events or additional lessons
Oh, and this year I got really lucky on Wednesdays, because we don't have the first lesson that day
So I get to sleep until 8
My case in Lithuanian gymnasium (year 9 to 12) few years ago
Starts at 08:30 (one year it was from 9 for some reason)
45 class, 10 min breaks between classes, with two mid-day breaks of 25-30 mins to eat
In last year my class had a window in the schedule, those are not common, but you end up with a free class so do whatever, some went home to eat, others ate at school, sometimes you would spend that time preparing for tests or doing homework
Year 1 to 8 looked similar, it just started at 08:00
I went to high school in the US
I'd wake up at 5:30AM, then leave my house at 6:30 to get to school by 7
School started at 7:15
Classes lasted for 40 minutes each and we had nine classes a day, with about five minutes in between classes to get to the next classroom
Overall, school lasted about 7 hours from 7:15 to 2:15PM
One of those nine classes was typically a lunch period but we weren't allowed to leave the school campus and just had to stay in the cafeteria
I didn't have a lunch until my final year of school
Some people ended up having "lunch" as their first class at 7:15, which was a bit nonsensical to me, but those people ended up just not coming in to school until the second class started around 7:50
People who had lunch as their second class (at 7:50) were the ones who really got screwed over because they couldn't just leave
All four years I took English literature, history, math, French, Italian (easy A for me), and gym; all of those were 40 minutes everyday apart from gym, which was 40 minutes every other day
I took science for the first three years, which alternated between 40 minutes one day and 80 minutes the next day, but didn't take it in my final year
I also took classes like psychology, sociology, art, graphic design, art history, politics, children's literature, countercultural studies, photography, stocks/investing, and criminal law, but those all lasted for either only a year or half a year because they were just electives not main subjects
Invaded, pillaged and destroyed Moscow several times
Pillaged so hard Duke Algirdas had a hard time carrying all the bribe gold back to Vilnius
Fathered kings and rulers of Poland, Belarus, Ukraine and Russia
Only had one king, who was assassinated shortly after receiving the crown
Mongol hordes feared OUR invasion
Imported muslims and other faith/culture people to europe
In the middle ages
*woooh*
Were once the biggest country in europe
With Poland, formed a unique unit called "Both Nation Republic"
Destroyed europe's last crusaders while avoiding the cross like vampires
After defeating teutons, we accepted the cross
Probably Joninės. I think it's called St
Jonas' festival in english
It's a pagan holiday, celebrated on the night of midsummer solstice
There's plenty of traditions, but some of them include burning giant bonfires, rolling burning wooden wheels from a hill into a lake or a river, unmarried woman making a "vainikas"(something similiar to a crown, except it's made from flowers and various plants), and floating them away on a lake, and perhaps the most notably, searching for a legendary blooming fern plant which is said to give you supernatural powers
It's always a big celebration, with music, partying and the general festival stuff
There are no “nice” or “happy” days in Lithuania
Ok besides maybe Easter or Christmas
March 11th (when we were the first socialist republic to declared independence from the USSR) lots of smiles and drinks and food on this day
Google translated it as st
Johns Wort, so I thought that's what it's called in english
I'll correct it
24th December in Lithuania
The interesting thing is that Christmas (Kalėdos) in lithuania is by some still called "Saulėgrįža", which can be translated as "The return of the sun".
Happy Saulėgrįža everyone
Christmas eve 24th, Christmas 25th thats when we exchange gifts
Lithuania :)
24th is the more important Christmas day, but 25th is also considered as Christmas
For some reason 26th as well, but no one really cares about it
su kuciom :D
>24th December in Lithuania
The interesting thing is that Christmas (Kalėdos) in lithuania is by some still called "Saulėgrįža", which can be translated as "The return of the sun".
No, it's not
I've never heard anyone use that word for Christmas
"Saulgėrįža" means "solstice". The winter solstice ("žiemos saulėgrįža") occurs a few days before Christmas and the word "saulėgrįža" refers to that
Also, it means something like "turning of the sun" because the summer solstice is also called "vasaros saulėgrįža". By the way, the Lithuanian word for Christmas is "Kalėdos".
Well I have
I know several people that call christmas Saulėgrįža, or Saulėgrįžos šventė. It's probably uncommon, but calling christmas this way still manifests itself in some communities
Eastern europe doesn't get much tourism compared to the western countries
It's a shame, becouse there's a lot to see and the prices are generally lower
People don't realise how rich these cultures are and can't see past old towns
I hope CDPR release another Witcher game soon, so that people realise what interesting stuff from east european cultures they're missing out on
True
It's a shame that most of the time if you want something, you have to sacrifice something else for
Yes
Mostly because of prevalence of using state names in movies
But don't expect many people to be able to name all of the states
Foreign geography is as alien for most Europeans, as for Americans
I heard that Lithuanian is hard to learn for foreigners, but I think that Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are the hardest European languages for Europeans to learn, because they are from a different language group
I think Finnish and Estonian are Finno and Hungarian is Ugric part of the Finno-Ugric language family
(sorry if misspelled)
Aww, thanks :)
Also, Finno and Ugric are different branches of Finno-Ugric language group
(There is a third one, but I forgot the name of it)

Nice
The Baltic states with restored independence in 1990 also legally are the same countries that were founded/restored in 1918
How good is wikipedia in your native language
How often do you use it versus the english language one
I personally never use the Lithuanian wikipedia
I find it severely lacking in most topics that i’m interested in, so I really only use it for articles relating to Lithuania itself (and even then, a lot of the times the very same article in the english language is more complete)
What about you
I use Lithuanian wiki fairly often
It lacks more specific information, but currently i don't need such information, so i am quite satisfied with lithuanian version
Sometimes i check how one or another thing is called in lithuanian
Also Lithuanian here
Topics that I'm interested in (astronomy and physics) are actually surprisingly good in Lithuanian Wikipedia, so I usually read Lithuanian wiki and if I need more details, then the English one
Of course, this doesn't work if the topic is a specific cultural, geographical or historical thing, then English wiki is way better
same here, because usually Lithuanian wikipedia has more info about local stuff than English wikipedia
Where i live, drinking tap water is not good anymore without either 1
Calling a plumber to clean the pipes or 2
Buying bottled water
Normal
We have plenty of natural underground water
Private old homes have bucket wells, new homes have pumps wells
Basically free water 4ever
Taste slightly differs as in the saying "home is where water doesnt taste weird", but its mostly due to pipes i guess
Maybe not talked enough as an issue, but I noticed that majority of new apparent buildings in Vilnius are built for rent rather than for long term family ownership
Whole apartment complexes are made of 1-2 room flats with just a minimal amount of 3-4 room flats
This is done because a lot of Lithuanians like to invest primarily to real estate, so a lot of realtors are now building projects just for them
Long term this might create issues for owners of those 3-4 room apartments as they are made for families, while other flats in a complex will be populated by renters
A family that owns their share of a building is interested in its maintenance, but renters are not
And owners of rental units will fixate on costs
This might end up creating issues and different desires in apartment community, thus might end up in people not working together
A simple building outskirts maintenance might not be agreed upon for such reasons thus creating unmaintained buildings in the long term
My suburb's main Street has a speed limit, but everyone goes much faster than limit
So many accidents and deaths occured, yet still nothing
As someone who visits the Netherlands frequently, I like to rant about this too
Some Dutch people explain this by saying that they have a non-credit card culture there
I understand and agree with that attitude
But credit cards are not the problem for a lot of (European) tourists - it's that some places (namely Albert Heijn) don't even take debit cards, if they're not Maestro
And it's hard to get a Maestro in a lot of countries
I almost always pay for things with other types of debit cards in Lithuania instead of credit, but I usually have problems whenever I visit the Netherlands with the same cards
I think credit cards are more of an American thing, the Europeans that I've encountered usually use debit, but some Dutch card readers treat all Visas and MasterCards as credit
I hear it's because with Maestro the transaction from the bank is instantaneous, while with Visa/MasterCard debit, they kind of work on a 'promise'. It's not that the payer doesn't have the money and borrows from the bank like with credit - the payer's money just gets transferred at a later time, when it is convenient for the bank
I guess I can see why it could not be fully trusted, but I feel like this is one of the rare things that NL seems to be in its own little different world than almost everyone else
Rant over, the country is great nevertheless
Edit: typo
Good
This is banned in Lithuania (or just in Vilnius) and I support it
Turns out, beggars can make more money in a week than a working family in a month
Her I was opening the link expecting London to top the list with 8 million then realising something quite upsetting
Although now Berlin has the baton and they deserve it's a great city
Murcia Spain
It seems a heard name but it's not heard too
Same, first on the list I know nothing of
Duisburg Murcia are the next ones on the list I haven't heard of
First - learn the alphabet
We have letters that English doesn't have (ą, č, ę, ė, į, etc)
You need to learn the pronunciation of those letters (which isn't that hard actually) (also "C" in Lithuanian is pronounced like "Ts")
Then after that just try and learn the words you use in your daily life
Also just a small tip for learning any language - write a diary in that language
It'll be easier to memorize words that you use often and will help learn verb conjugation
If you are learning it cause its the oldest language in europe, why
Depends on the context
If it's pubs, you guys take the cake I think, if it's Vodka, I think finish take the cake, Russia aside, I exclude it as I assume it's about EU, not the continent, but Russia and Finland would have vicious rivalry going on
If it's alcoholism, I think us Lithuanians are somewhere up there as well
edit: Some non-EU responded as well, so count Russia in
> Historically we've all been highly influenced by Christianity
Well
its kinda our thing to stress that we were the last to abandon pagan faith in Europe and pagan years are often regarded as almost the golden age
Hmm I actually have met people whom want that here
Lithuanians see it as two options, first one being leave EU and face a similar fate as Ukraine, or integrate in to the EU as much as possible, to become an inseparable part of it
Frankly, I've never even imagine going to Finland due to myself living in Lithuania for the majority of my life and travelling feels like it's a mythical beast to me
I guess that's my family, upbringing, whatever you want to call it
And say I was invited to one, it wouldn't occur to me to get a bottle of alcohol, I stopped drinking alcohol like 4-5 years ago, when I started having depressive episodes when drunk and horrible hang overs the next day (at a ripe age of 19-20 :D)
But thanks for the tip
What
For real
That's very surprising to me, or I'm simply in the "wrong" circle of friends
What we are first in, it's suicide rates in Europe and according to some stats online either 1st in the world or in the top 5 at least
Edit: different sources, different ratings, generally suicide and alcohol both in top 5, that's fucking sad
Not really
With Jesus we also went to eventually unite with Poland and that is seen as over all negative thing in history as PLC was strong only early on
Grand Dutchy formed while still being pagan and expanded to its largest extend while still being mostly pagan (+Rus orthodox in conquered lands and a bit muslim)
Heh, i am both nationalist and federalist
I want my country to be the best and it can do that while in EU
Nacionalist does not have to be aggressive towards others
And thats the only way EU can work as otherwise big countries would dominate even more
Cooperation can also be in your countries interest
For example if your country has a choice to seek independent policy to gain economic output but at the same time killing eurozone
Its in our best interest to lose out on our own policy to keep euro
All EU countries are still nationalistic and seek benefit for their own
It just turns out that it benefits me when it also benefits you
But EU is a thing only because it benefits all members for different reasons
Otherwise there is no point being in EU
Not talking about any specific issue what would be the point for lets say Czechs to live in a country where they live in an union that makes decisions that only benefit others while Czhechs just foot the bill
Leaving the union would benefit them more
Thats why everyone will want to keep the EU alive as long as it benefits them and if onece in a while they need to make a decision for the benefit of EU but as a detriment for themselves its fine because over all its still benefits them
Literally as long as helping you benefits me more than not doing anything, I will help you
Thats just how the countries work
Even with hard choices like war
NATO still benefits everyone because we dont know who will need help so it benefits me to defend you now rather than face enemies alone
Open door: "Were you born in a bus
Leaving lights on: "Is this a church
Hurt yourself: "It'll go away by the time you get married
When someone needs to wait for you
"train doesn't wait for those who shit"
Forgetting to close the doors: "Are you born in the bus
Picking nose: "won't your finger break
Were you born in a bus
In Lithuania we say "Were you born in a bus
" about the door part
Or "I speak Lithuanian to you
Bus or trolleybus here
We have it too
I don't know any Lithuanian ones, but I love the Danish one, where it's legal to hit a Swede with stick if they're waking over ice :D
Tak til Jonatan for telling me this one
not really, quite a few of our letters can make the same sound depending on the word you write
Most of the time
There can be some problems with words that have double consonants or consonant assimilation
For example: pusseserė (cousin) has 2s, but it sounds like puseserė. There also can be some problems with long vowels in the middle of words like rąstas (log) or žąsis (goose), because of the very strange grammar rules that come from obsolete forms of these words
In general, Lithuanian grammar is very difficult
Lithuanian is very phonetical language, there's no words with random pronunciations
Problem can arise from similar sounding syllables: in some words "g" and "k" or "ia" and "e" can sound similar
Also "y" and "į" are pronounced the same way, but grammar rules define in what cases which one should be written
In general grammar defines the spelling of the word when phonetically it's not clear
There's some exceptions for that where you just have to learn the spelling but not many (like 10-20 words that are commonly used)
In general Lithuanian grammar is way more structured in spelling then english
After 10th grade grammar is not even part of the curriculum and grammar tasks are not part of the exam
You need to be illiterate for not to know the spelling
"Gera vieta"  - nice place
Some call toilet seat "white horse"
We don't have names like this, but we say these as synonims to "I am going to the toilet":
"I am going to do natural things"
"Nature calls me"
White stone
Don't forget "pas nykštukus" - "at the dwarfs"
Vidur prūdo plūdur bliūdas, vidur bliūdo pluta plūdo
It basically means "In the center of a pond, a bowl floats, in the bowl, bark/crust floats".
We don't have those
We don't have hard looking words as far as I know and every word is butched by foreigners
Old man (*Seni*) from what I gathered this is more of a Vilnius thing rather than whole country, but we call each other old man, as if you used dude or bro in English
Nope, it's used in the whole country
Recently "senelyzai" has become popular too for some reason
Never heard that before lol
It's real
Cant recall any tales or legends, but theres a clear difference of christian and pagan folklore tales
In pagan tales devil is a trickster, not good nor evil, tales revolve around person's duties, adventures and contact with a wild world
General setting is nature or a small settlement
Endings can be sad, tragic or good
In christian time tales, devil is pure evil, tales revolve around social injustices, morality and daily duties
General setting is settlement (vasal) or a castle
Ending is usually good for the main character
For those who played Witcher games, there are a lot pagan style stories, similar to the old lithuanian tales
Ok this is I think second or third comment talking about Dutch eating people, is everything alright down there
At one point Lithuania (Samogitia region more specifically) was the last pagan nation in Europe
To this day the legends and some of the rituals live on
Stories of witches burying cathedrals in sand to form large hills in the landscape
During renaissance, lithuania had a fairly relaxed and not strict law compared to other countries at the time
For example, (Context: During the common wealth, poland and lithuania had joined forces and were under the same rule [lithuanian monarch married a polish one], but they were culturally speaking differnt countries) Barbora Radvilaite a queen of the commonwealth, before moving to Kraków used to go horseriding and hunting, or also was very "energetic" at banquets, so things that were considerred unladylike
Also, unlike in many other countries, sex was not strictly reserved for reproduction, but pleasure too
After moving to Kraków she had to give up some behaviours, and didn't like the city itself
The Guinness book of world records recognised geographical center of Europe is located near Vilnius, in Girija village
I wouldn't mind personally
I would even be happy
These little inconvenient coins should vanish
I hate when prices are 〇〇,99, and you get 1 cent as exchange
But I have a feeling that our greedy vendors and businessmen will round 〇〇,01 to 05
And that everything will get more expensive
This seems very complicated
It sounds super complicated
Paying different prices in cash and in card
It may be easier in self-checkouts but we have many small stores without fancy checkouts, where old cashier women would be super tired to think whether you will pay by cash or card and how to round the price
By the way if you have this thing in your country for certain time, you sure don't find this complicated, but for me, who heard this for first time
I get the idea but it would be hard to implement
Although Romans never conquered Baltic region, we still have the [Grand Coliseum of Vilnius] Interestingly enough it stands next to Acropolis mall
In all seriousness no, we don't have any Roman heritage, that's Lithuanian national football stadium that has been under construction since 1987
I can add that we have a piece of [literature] about how lithuanians were direct descendants of the romans
Yet in [reality] the baltic region is the least genetically related region to romans in Europe
Being called Russian or being asked if your Russian or being spoken to in Russian (by default) is unbelievably painful and aggravating
It’s like being lumped into your childhood rapists family tree for life
Please don’t do it

You sense it
Never had a package stolen
Couriers/postmen usually deliver hands-to-hand, or to a relative if the postman is a local and knows who is who
Rarely ever packages are left by the door (private houses), but even left by the door in an open view of anyone who would take interest to look, nobody has even walked in to my house territory
I live in a very culturaly mixed part of Lithuania (Near Vilnius)
To give perspective, people are less friendly and worse behaved than anywhere else in the country
Despite all that I dont lock my car, my bike, an inflatable boat lies on the grass behind unlocked gates at my in-laws, my own house doesnt have a fence, yet i keep outdoor items outdoors
Stealing is not a thing as far as ive experienced it
Im usually careful about my stuff, but at home (my, my parents and inlaws, all of which are in thr same town) people proved themselves to be above that (and many of them are modest in living standards)
They are the norm here in Lithuania too
[Here's an example]
Basically, they are in every neighbourhood next to supermarkets
They are really handy
If you are the receiver, you get an SMS or E-mail with the PIN
You go and enter the PIN and one of the doors unlocks and opens and you can take your package out
You can also use them to send your parcel too
You enter the receivers parcel terminal address and their e-mail/phone number
Pay with your card
The terminal prints out a sticker
You stick the sticker to your parcel and put the parcel in the box
Voila
It's really handy
No need to stay at home for hours and hours, waiting for your delivery
Here's two examples of how to send and receive (unfortunately, in Lithuanian
SUrprised you don't have those in Norway

And in Bratislava: it would be a great old town
Sadly it is ridden with brutalist commie shit
The castle is impressive, yet simple and when u leave it you see this whateverish Parliament building which should be bulldozed down the hill to not obstruct the castle (from architectural perspective, not political) . Not to mention asshole Austrians who littered the view from the castle with those windmills
It's like saying "fuck you, move away from the border".
I have just crossed these cities by bus en route to Saint Petersburg and back
However, they still remain probably ugliest my seen cities, especially their bus stations
"u" and "ų". Metu kamuolį. - I am throwing a ball
Metų kamuolį. - ...a ball of the years
Since we're in the subject, I'd also like to say how important context and accent is in lithuanian
Kasa, kasa, kasa and kasa are all different words in lithuanian
Graži tavo kasa
- Your braid is beautiful
Ant stalo stovi kasa
- The cash register is on the table
Jonas kasa duobę. - Jonas is digging a hole
Turiu problemų su kasa
- I have problems with my pancreas
Lithuania: Not free, but 100% state financed for STEM+medicine fields, and about 40% students (with best grades) get free edu in any other fields
I actually want to ask if anyone knows university prices in Vilnius
I'll be 16 this year and want to know how much money I should save up
It's only for Lithuanians, I think
At least I checked Vilnius university and it's 3000-4000€ for 2 years masters degree for foreigners
I'm not sure, but courses for Lithuanians are in Lithuanian language, so foreigners automatically can't be treated equally
Either way, OP is not from EU, so this law wouldn't work for them
If you're curious, here's university's page that I've talked about:
University (Not Counting Free Universities)
Going to Sweden in June, what should I buy
I‘ve heard that drug prices are quite similar in all of Europe
Simply because it’s in the name FREE universities, If another country had them well then it wouldn’t be considered cheaper
Unless you mean textbooks which ain’t mega expensive here either
Ah we have Tutti Frutti
I'll try the others, thanks
I'm 15
Oh lol you're right, I was mistaken
Love liquorice
I hate it
Loud noises, rain, wind
Especially the unexpected lightning
I do like some light rain in the summer tho
I'm often outside, so it can be nice to refresh for a couple of hours
And the next couple of days are a bit cooler, so that's good
But no thunderstorms
Just loud booms outside
Nothing special
Until lightning hits close to you
Then its stressful and may result in undesired pooping your pants
All jokes aside its really loud
Once we had one hit something like 30 meters from us and its like mini explosion happening close by
Sveikinu su "torto diena" ⊂(・﹏・⊂)
Thanks
Will get some cake
šikšnosparnis (tanned leather wing) - bat
raganosis (horn nose) - rhinoceros
Lithuanian:
Greitoji pagalba (ambulance) - the quick help
Sausainis (cookie) - the dry one
Sumuštinis (sandwich) - the beaten one
Paleistuvė (slut/promiscuous woman) - the relaser, as in 'to let go'
Labas, mano vardas yra Jonas, malonu su tavimi susipažinti
Iš kur tu
Hello, my name is John, glad to you meet
From where you
>Labas, mano vardas Jonas
Malonu susipažinti
Iš kur  esi
Hi, my name \[is\] John
\[It is\] pleasurable <neuter> to get acquainted
From where  are
Using more auxiliary words, that is not that common, but still fully legit in Lithuanian:
>Labas, mano vardas yra Jonas
Man yra malonu susipažinti
Iš kur tu esi
Hi, my name is John
For me is pleasurable to get acquainted
From where you are
Labas, mano vardas Jonas
Malonu su jumis / tavimi susipažinti
Iš kur esate / esi
Hi, my name John
Nice to you (plurar or formal) / you (singular informal) get acquainted
From where you (plurar or formal) / you (singular informal) are
EDIT: forgot plurar or formal meanings in second part
Depends on the sentence but pretty underatandable
Mama ar aš tavo vaikas
Mom (you could add "or" in here but the sentence doesnt support it) am i your child
Not very
Lithuanian is a synthetic language
So word order is a lot less important than it is in analytic languages like English
For Example, "Suo valge kate" and "Kate valge suo" both mean "Dog ate cat", but if I translate each word individually I would get
"Suo valge kate" = "Dog ate cat"
"Kate valge suo" = "Cat ate dog", in order to get this meaning in Lithuanian I would write "Kate valge suni".
your sentence would be:
Labas, mano vardas Jonas, malonu susipazinti
Is kur esi
Hello, my name John, pleasureful to acquaint
From where be
Yep, we Lithuanians are having similar problems
I still can't understand how a language can function with so little verbs and their forms
The most confusing would probably be some sentence with seperable verbs, like:
>You look very bad
I am calling the doctor
Du siehst sehr schlecht aus
Ich rufe den Artzt an
You see very bad out
I call the doctor at
Hey
I always had a question
Does "jūs" have double meaning
(In Lithuanian it's either formal way to talk to a superior or means plural people)
>  In a simulated battle our platoon of 3 tanks distroyed over 120 Leopard2 tanks in multiple waves without a single loss on our side
:D Did your simulation also had you save a princes or fend off Martian attack
In the US, the President serves as both the head of state and head of government
Systems that have both a President and a Prime Minister separate the head of state (President) and head of government (PM) into two distinct roles
The German and Austrian Chancellors are the same as a PM
* **Head of state**: Often a ceremonial role, like a Monarch
They are meant to make public appearances, unify the country, bestow honors on civilians, host foreign dignitaries, and often hold a number of *de jure* but not *de facto* powers like formally appointing cabinet secretaries or ministers (it's the PM that actually chooses them), dissolving parliament (on the request of the PM), serving as commander-in-chief of the military (they don't actually have much control over it)
The President basically fills the role of ceremonial Monarchs in European constitutional monarchies
* Some European systems are semi-presidential, where the President is more than just ceremonial, and the main power there is that they can choose who the PM is rather than parliament choosing who the PM is, but their choice must be approved by parliament
If the President's political party also controls parliament, they effectively can choose whoever they want to lead the government though, pretty much giving them all the power; this is the current case in France and Russia
* **Head of government**: The main point of a head of government is that they lead the government
In the US, this is the cabinet
While the American president serves as both the head of state (being the "face" of the nation) and head of government (leading the cabinet), in many other countries the head of government is the PM (or Chancellor)
They nominate a number of individuals to lead ministries or departments and thus craft policy
In most of these countries, it's the PM that wields a considerably larger amount of power compared to the country; while the President is the "good guy" leader of the country who's all happy and smiles, the PM is the "bad guy" so to speak who has to make the difficult policy decisions and anger people with their partisanship
Most often, parliament elects the PM after a parliamentary election by the general public; when this happens, most of the time the leader of the party who is leading the majority in parliament becomes PM, but not always
Because most often the PM is a member of parliament, they are the chief legislator of the nation
Imagine if the cabinet of the US was moved from Trump's responsibility to Nancy Pelosi's responsibility, that would essentially be making her the PM and adopting this European style parliamentary government
Only government buildings have it besides the tricolour  and the red Vytis flag
I wouldn't, since the tricolour is the Lithuanian flag
is the flag of Europe, and Turkey is member of the Council of Europe
It's made in USA, but filmed in Lithuania and about Lithuania "Tarp pilkų debesų". This film tells us about Soviet deportations
Lithuanian movie - Tadas Blinda
I haven't watched it (or I have, but loong time ago)
It's the first Lithuanian movie
I don't watch mamy Lithuanian movies
From what I've heard, there really aren't that mamy great movies made here
But there is *Trys milijonai eurų* or *Three million euro*. People said it's a decent comedy
For the Lithuania, the most iconic (my opinion) is probably "Tarp pilkų debesų"
“Tarp pilkų debesų” (between the shades of grey) there’s both, Lithuanian and English versions
I think it still count, because the movie is about the country and was filmed in the country, even though the actors are not from Lithuania
Also, “Traukinio apiplėšimas kurį įvykdė Saulius ir Paulius”
Would you recommend reading up on the historical events the film is based on before watching
"Thanks" sounds like a sneeze
("Ačiū", pronounced sort of like "achoo")
* Language is rare itself
* Free sentence word order, you can make it whatever you want it to be or to emphasise some words
* One can omit pronouns in most cases
* Past iterative tense
* De facto two locative cases: inessive and illative
* Glorious history of being nearly extinct, book smuggling and its contemporary all time high dominance in Lithuania
But unfortunately our languages aren't close enough to be mutually intelligible (we can't communicate in a meaningful manner)
We share quite a few common words that sound similar or even identical but many have totally different meaning
Pronounciation between Latvian and Lithuanian is just too different as well
Welp,
I saw a lot of negative reactions to our cold beetroot soup (cold and pink)
We have a literal blood sausages stuffed in animal intestines
Tongues of animals (haven't met anyone who's not disgusted)
Livers of animals
Stomach of animals (most popular are smoked chicken stomachs)
Hearts of animals (most popular is chicken)
Some people even cook whole head of a pig
Some people don't like appearance of Zeppelins (they are delicious tho
Scrambled eggs with animal brains (this one is common in rural areas)
We eat salted salmon (yes, not smoked, salted)
Zeppelin is basically a big ball of boiled potato with a meat filling
Usually comes with milky sauce with fried pork bits
Seems like your grandma remembered good old times of conserving food
Never heard the term, so can't answer
Some families make it like gravad lax
My family usually uses just salt
Not nordic, but we have everything nordic countries have, minus surplus money and middle eastern and african people
Few foreigners live here, and most of them are doing quite well
Very sad to know that even nordic countries have snowless winters
Ive been missing them very much
Now snow in winter seems more valuable than gold
For our hearts and mental health
Lack of snow in winter makes it feel like winter is still coming
even if its May already
It's pretty common, especially with teens and children
We spell it either "Ok", "Okay" or "Okey"
between 1919-2019
About 50 years of being fucked
It's fine now
We were occupied three times and then after fifty years we gained independence by forming a human chain of around 2 million people that spanned well above 600k km across the baltic states
Yeah, Vilnius is Lithuanian city and Poles are best allies, not enemies
Klaipėda is ours as well, and we live in a pretty successful country
Russia somehow borders us from the west, and there's a weird country called Belarus in the east
However, there are no Germany right to the west – only after \~600 km
However, 123 years under Russian rule is has not been enough and we will be fucked by the Soviets for another 5 decades
That's why you can see these ugly commieblocks and we are still catching up with the Western European economies
Since 1990s there only have been few years with no wars in Europe
>>Poles best allies
That's debatable
My vote goes to Latvia
geopolitically it's still Poland
Even the Grybauskaitė period LT/PL relations were very friendly in comparison to 1920-1938
Well neither Latvia or Estonia were last pagan countries in europe
Neither of them had crusades against them
Not a literary character, but I remember on an old F1 game (probably on PS1), with Russian language on, driver's name changed from Button to Кнопка (i.e. a button that you press)
I am feeling as if I'm losing something of my own
No matter how distant it might be, that cathedral is one of the greatest and most beautiful buildings in the world, not to mention the amount of history that this building saw
My heart is with the French
Not sure if unpopular opinion, but I've rarely thought about the church in my life and I'm not thinking much about it now
It's not even destroyed
I'd be sad if the Cologne cathedral suffered, as that one has a unique history of being spared in the largest destruction of the continent
my sense of humour changes depending on what language I'm speaking
My conversations in English tend to have quite a few puns, dad jokes
My Lithuanian and German tend to have quite dark and cynical humour
Yes
My english speaking self has not been as traumatized, and is a much better person to be around
> Oh the Lithuanian sense of humour is close to the German
Interesting
I think that sense of humour is quite common in much of continental Europe
We love Vilnius
The cities are competitive, but it's not like someone actually hates Vilnius
We do as well ahah it looks so weird to me when people hate their capital
Anyone above 30-40 years old definitely knows Russian, but probably not English
In school you have to learn English, qnd you can choose Russian, German, or French
I would say that Russian is the most common language out of the three
More or less
English is presumed for the post-soviet generation(s?)
Russian for the soviet generations
Usually people also have some 2nd or 3rd foreign language skills, either German or French or Spanish or Polish
Less common are Italian, Latvian, Estonian or the Scando-tongues
Dear me, a real life southern Estonian
I though you guys only existed in statistics
Love my baltic brother and poles and their culture, simply amazing
Russia and belarus not so much interesting
Sorry not sorry
I'm lithuanian, but I live in poland, so I'll talk for both countries
Lithuania - Saulius Skvernelis - the prime minister, poland - the fucking president
I would go so far as to say, that he's the worst president so far
>	You're not allowed to make names up
If you want to give your kid a more "exotic" name or a rare name from another language, you need to proof that it's actually a real name and not a letter combination you threw together with dart after 5 beer
But
all the names were made up once
It's just so weird to me, though
Like, every single name didn't exist at some point
They were all invented
That's exactly what I mean, names are just regular everyday words that someone decided to use
Every name was once picked and used for the first time
But somehow today you're not allowed to just pick and choose a new word from some adjective or combination of other "real" words, etc
As someone with a very common first name that often cause inconvenience when there's like 4 other girls in the room with the same name, I definitely wish rarer or unique names became more acceptable
>	By the same logic you might just make up your own language
But we do that all the time as well
Somewhere, some time, someone uses a word for the first time, inventing a new word
Then their family of friends hear it, some of them decide to pick it up and start using it as well, and that's how words are born
Just like some time someone decided to use a certain word or a combination of words as a name for the first time
I mean, what counts as "out of thin air" for you
In my country a lot of names are actually plant names (especially trees or flowers) or names of some other natural phenomenons (the sun, amber,  storm, etc)
Or even place names - one of popular girls' names in my country is actually the name of a lagoon in the Baltic Sea
My point it, there was a time when someone decided to use that name as their kid's name for the very first time
Someone would be like "ok, I love this flower so I'm gonna name my daughter after it, even though I've never heard of anyone else named after that flower". Does this count as an "experiment"? By your definition, I suppose it does, but is it really a bad thing
Most people here don't object to this type of names, on the contrary, they're considered beautiful, even if they're unique
Imagine if no one was allowed to invent new names anymore and ~20% of the male population was named some local version of John, etc
People's names are a huge part of their identity, why shouldn't we try to make them more unique
Around Christmas time suddenly conversations in Russian would start popping up I guess as a way to covertly discuss gifts
Most of the kids born after 85-86 don’t speak it unless they set out to learn it in school or have Russian parents
Yes, it happened to me as well
My family used to speak Russian, so I couldn't understand them, but they have forgotten it as most of the people I guess in Lithuania who knew Russian
Yes, it happened to me as well

My family used to speak Russian, so I couldn't understand them, but they have forgotten it as most of the people I guess in Lithuania who knew Russian
ALL Post-Soviet kids who aren't from Russia itself experienced this
The new gen kids have no reason to speak Russian if they're from a Lithuanian family, so my parents just switched to Russian since everyone in USSR learned Russian
If anyone bothers to learn even the basics in Lithuanian people are happy and impressed
It’s not expected at all
It’s a very hard language
One that even many native speakers don’t understand well and how to use it correctly
It's not annoying
Barely anyone learns or even cares about our language, so anyone who decides to learn even a bit will be praised here, since we know how difficult our language is
Annoyed, no
It will make for a difficult conversation because I am not used to dealing with broken Lithuanian like I am with say, broken English
Or Lithuanian spoken with a heavy accent I'm not familiar with
That said, Learning the language, even badly, is a great way to make a positive impression
Honestly a person trying to speak Lithuanian just warms my heart , yeah it can sound a bit funny but it still matters to me that they care about learning my language that from what I've heard is hell for people to learn
The smell of Linden tree flowers, thyme, fennel and honey
All of these were, and stil are used to brew traditional tea in lithuania
They're so good, I would choose any of these over any other tea, anytime
I really recommend it if you ever get the chance
Moss and mushrooms
Moist smell of water, fungi, earth, decomposing plants
I think it should smell the same depending on what type of forest you are in ofc
Lithuanian forest is usually inland, mixed leaf, mostly hilled or flat, which is common everywhere in the world
In Lithuania population had been decreasing for close to 3 decades
Although that's a horrible thing for an economy, it's a bit easier to find a good paying job
Yes, but population has been growing in Kaunas, Vilnius and Klaipėda because old people who mainly live in villages die and young people migrate to the big cities
Because you live in Netherlands
Go to post soviet Europe and you will see abandoned villages and towns full of retired old people
Overall economy has massively grown during these 3 decades, and since 2019, population started rising again
Aging population will take a heavy toll in the future
That is what I meant
I agreed to the first statement, which stated that Lithuania's population has been decreasing for the past 3 decades
I never said it's horrible for the economy
A lot of today’s youth here is Integrated into the cannabis business as a way to get high pr get money, and it is a real problem
It’s come to the point where entire schools go into lockdown and they still don’t find anything
Some irresponsible adults bring in meth and coke to schools for an extra buck
If we were to get a controlled system that managed the drug ring in schools it would be amazing
As a kid I believed that all beaches are sandy as that was the only thing I saw in sea side Lithuania and movies
Apparently you can also have rocky beaches
I thought this for a VERY long time since I'd heard a lot of African singers singing in French and some other reasons I can't remember
I kind of assumed all of them were mixed
> Russians are all impoverished and eat potatoes to keep alive
I mean, they do eat potatoes
And they do keep them alive
So this is somewhat correct :)
I (Lithuanian) have dated some German guys and an Australian guy
The German guys were incredibly hospitable, thoughtful and friendly
They always wanted to make sure I was comfortable, they were always respectful and gentle
If we hung out at their place, they always made food and made me feel at home
The Australian guy was very laid-back, I felt comfortable with him
Wasn't used to people being so friendly and open, so uncaring about the minuscule things Lithuanians fuss over
We have them in a sense, but not the American one
To us it's people whole lived during the USSR and people who only lived in a "free Lithuania"
it's not really a thing
Maybe among sociology majors for group analysis, but otherwise it's not really a thing like in the states
So here in Lithuania, from my experiences, no one gives af about generations, except those who are into some weird stuff or conspiracies, maybe those who also watch some Russian channels on that topic, but still, no one cares
In eastern europe not so much
My mom shortly told me that there are Gen X, Gen Y and Gen Z. I didn't know the American names of these generations, so I wondered: what the fuck are baby boomers
Greatest generation
Usually only in a comedic sense
Foreigners call [the hill of crosses] creepy
I can somewhat see the eeriness
Could you imagine that thing at night when no one is around
į - to somewhere
į (in, to), o (and, however, but (has a lot of meanings, depends on context)), ė (used to get attention, like *hey
* in English)
This is not really mentioning the dialectal variations, then the list would get wild
No standard
Some people wont' tell you, some won't shut up bout it
close to 50/50
That said generally among friends
I don't know if it's rude, but it would be kinda weird to talk about your wages unless everyone is talking about jobs
Europeans learned the hard way that colonies aint loyal
Lithuania s a semi-presidential country, but our current President seems to be not wanting to use his powers
The power balance exists when the President wants so (like Grybauskaitė)
If he or she doesn't assume the full power, part of it slips to the Prime Minister
Depends on each person
We had Dalia Grybauskaite, she had ways to expose and fire corrupt or pro russian officials
She had strong opposition (PM), also parliament majority's leader
There were a lot of conflicts, but there was balance
Now we have Gitanas Nauseda, former economic analyst of SEB
We call him "tall and handsome" or "president of the underground" because his ways in politics is negotiation and non-conflict
Which usually means he gets shut down or never achieves anything because the other side doesnt want to talk
What is living in a bilingual country like
Countries such as Belgium, Finland, Switzerland, Belarus, etc
, that have more than one widely spoken language
Is generally everyone capable of speaking all the widely spoken official languages
Are there people who are born and raised in the same country that fully cannot communicate with each other due to the language differences
What languages are the schools or the government in
How early do they have you start learning the other language(s)
Any other details you can think of
Wow thank you so much for this extremely detailed answer
That was exactly what I was looking for
Switzerland is a very interesting and beautiful country, one of my favorite places to visit
Would you say the average person can speak both but just prefers Russian, or does Russian completely dominate to the point where Belarusian is just more of a ceremonial language
Is it the same in all parts of the country, or is there an urban/rural or older/younger divide
Why is it that other people don't want to learn French, or at least prefer Italian
Is there any tension between the Swiss-Germans and the Romandes
>I used to have a roommate who was from a very Swedish-speaking area and couldn’t really speak much Finnish
What was the language situation like in the area where you were living
Was she able to function day-to-day in society without speaking much Finnish, or did she have to just use a lot of English
Do most people in Ukraine speak Ukrainian or Russian
Would you say there are Swedish-speakers in Finland who cannot speak Finnish at all
Or would that be very rare to find
The crazy thing is this: the word for October is different in Belarussian from Russian
So while the signs say "Кастрычніцкая вул.", everyone just says "Октябрьская".  Good luck figuring out that it's the same place even if you know Russian
Haha I'm the same, Lithuanian paternal and Italian maternal
Living in NY now
Yes I can
I learned it from immigrant family members on my mother’s side of the family first
When I was a kid I went to Italian school after my regular school to help me learn more, and then after I had forgotten some by the time I was a teenager I started taking it in high school (Italian is offered in almost all high schools in New York because most people are Italian here)
Yes I can read and write as well
No problem at all
We had no official written stuff in lithuanian untill 1547 (was ruthenian aka old rus, latin or polish up to that point)
As for spoken i assume it should be quite easy to understand
Lithuanian retains some of the most consistent and ancient indo-european features, so Lithuanians can understand pretty much everything, from the moment our tribes united, which was by the end of 13th century
Earlier, each tribe had their own language, so understanting every one of them would prove very hard
There was a tribe called Lithuanians, which gave the name to modern lithuania, and their language was the most similiar to modern lithuanian, so understanding it would be easier than, say Curonians, or Yotvingians
One of the most ridiculous calques is typical for tourism texts written by Lithuanians: [cognitive path] Which is 'educational trail' in proper English
Generally, tourism texts include a shitton of such calques
Probably 90% of non-english european language speakers have the same problem
Lithuania has the opposite feature
The consomants in most of the situations, are pronounced hard (like the sucxulent chinese meal guy saying "r" in democrrracy)
So for lithuanian it would be "Vviollinn", or "Vvikkttorry".
Same here with the 3rd person, sometimes I spot myself mixing up is/are and was/were
My friend and I were going to this bar to film as extras, she was a little bit ahead of me, and entered the building first
By the time I came in, she was talking to this tan, kind of southern european/middle eastern looking girl
This combined with the fact that they were both talking in English made me think that this girl was a foreigner of some sort
I joined in the conversation and we all talked in English for about 5 minutes, before my friend decided to tell me something in Lithuanian, and then that girl was like "wait
you guys are lithuanian too
When I asked my friend later on why she was talking with her in english when I came in, she just told me that she just instantly looked like a foreigner so she didn't even attempt to speak lithuanian with her
It's extra cringy when you know this wasn't even happening abroad
CartoonNetwork is the best teacher
We start learning English in second grade and by that time I could read well and speak a little
As time went by I got better with it by watching more cartoons and using the Internet
I was always at the top of my class with English in school compared to people who didnt watch English cartoons
School from 2nd grade and, well, I started using computer early (4-5 to)
I'm going to Erasmus in Targu Mures University for a semester of medical studies
You can spot an american in europe, by their clothing
Most wear sports clothes, while europeans are usually dressed more formally (jeans, or other formal trousers, plain clothing, or with minimalistic patterns)
If they're tall and pale, they're probably germanic, baltic or from the more northern slavic nations
The shorter people with darker hair and a bit more tan skin are probably from southern europe
A final way to confirm if someone's from europe is if they don't really show emotions with their face in public
Most people just walk around with their neutral resting face
So yes, you can get an idea of where someones from by their appearance
Some American or German tourists look like [John Bolton]
Also, a family wearing matching jackets (skiing, hiking, mountaineering): Swedish/Nordic
Generally easy to distinguish people by parts of europe or large countries they come from
For example scandinavia, eastern europe, germans, dutch, french, spanish, itallians, greeks, balkans, rus (russia, ukraine, belarus)
And the guess is only 70% accurate at most
Pinpoiting where exactly they come from is very hard
Though if you look closely, there are subtle, but key different features between russians and ukrainians, lithuanians and belarusians, latvians and estonians, estonians and suomi, italians and greeks, italians and spanish, swedes and norwegians etc
Its as if each ethnicity has its own "cliche" features that gives them out
Like baggy eyes, heart shape hairline/forehead and big teeth in brits
Lithuanian: nemįšk prieš vėją - gurkšnį gausi
English: Dont piss against wind - you will get a sip
We have a similar one but it's "Until you jump over the ditch don't say hop"
Billy-goat in Lithuanian and ram in Russian
"Daryti iš musės dramblį" in Lithuanian, "делать из мухи слона" in Russian, literally the same word for word
Yes, we have the State Commission of the Lithuanian Language, and the notorious State Language Inspection that functions like language police – e. g., fines for using wrong grammar in TV shows, etc
Lithuania  has VLKK(National committee of Lithuanian language)
They are a bunch of language Nazis who are constantly banning "irregular" words which lithuanians use in their everyday language
They also suggest new "correct" words to use instead of the wrong ones
The problem is, these suggested words are usually ridiculously awkward and just makes people laugh, (there is even a big meme group on FB to make fun of this committee)
Some examples of VLKK work includes them trying to ban using English names for computer programes like Excel/Powerpoint
Lithuanian language has these incredibly hated word accentuation rules, and VLKK are huge fans of them - they even give fines for people on TV who fail to accentuate words correctly
I remember watching news when I heard the news reporter saying PradA and Dolce & GabannA, instead of the original PrAda and Dolce & GabAnna - not only they forbid to accentuate lithuanian words incorrectly, this rule also applies on foreign words, clothing brands in this case
It's just a game of absurd and official people and workers of the national TV are forced to play it
The only good thing about this is probably that every time they are trying to change or ban something, everyone has a good laugh
Yes, it's called the *State Commission of the Lithuanian Language
That is a disgusting nazi organization
But you can have and easy way to check if a word is "usable" and win random arguments thAT HAVE NO SENSE OF PROPER LANGUAGE
Its cool
It is not a language police thing, but as in a synthetic language, Lithuanian noun cases require specific suffixes
However, they are less frequently done for females, so Hillary Clinton usually remains Hillary Clinton
As for Barack Obama - in news pages he is usually called Barackas Obama (Obama is perfectly sound feminine gender word for Lithuanian language), but in official papers (e.g. Foreign Ministry texts, in nominative he is called Barack Obama
For people who have names ending in -a (Angela Merkel), -is/as (Alexis Tsipras), etc no suffixes are added and they are treated as Lithuanian words
Feminine surnames are also commonly left intact
They also work with lexic to prevent the influence of foreign languages
No, nazism is not cool,
We have XXX supermarkets, and exported them to Latvia and Estonia
The whole coast of Neringa municipality
I think almost all of that part of Lithuania is in the UNESCO world herritage list and the beaches have the blue flag (white sand, clear waters, etc)
Lets be a bit more specific, All of the [Curonian Spit] is a magnificent beach basically
There's also some other towns that are nice, [Sventoji] & [Palanga] are probably the most popular seaside resort towns
Why would you think there's problem
Somewhat yes 3-4 dialects with different accents having 4 different accents for a country this small is weird
So Lithuania is divided into 5 regions (mažoji Lietuva, Žemaitija, Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija) and 4 out of those five (Žemaitija, Aukštaitija, Suvalkija, Dzūkija) have their own dialects of Lithuanian language
Doing things has no connection to your ethnicity
Bruuh
No I would not
I am just going to drop this wikipedia arcticle about the famine in anyone wants to learn about it
I bet none of you have to learn lithuanian in school
In Lithuania, I had "Ethnography " classes (not sure if that translates, but that's how they were called)
Where we learned about old local traditions, celebrations, rituals, clothing, folk art symbolism, myths etc
of Lithuania and more generally Baltic tribes
It was approached as a study of your cultural heritage
I loved it
And even though I had it in both the primary school, and in the first 4 years of middle schools I know that it's not a class you get in even school in the country
I think it's a bit niche, and I was lucky to have it in both primary and middle schools I attended
Have this in Lithuania, as well as religion or ethics lessons
However, "home economics" is mostly tied to "home maintenance" or "workshop", economics is tied to IT classes (at least it was in my school)
Home maintenance lessons are woodworking, metalworking, minor repairs, outdoors work for boys, cooking, sweing, stitching for girls
Girls and boys switch for one year in grade 8 or 9
Holy shit didnt know that
Well thats lithuanian indeed
You took the exam also right
Damn thats tough
The history of the Grand Duchy is taught differently and different aspects are accentuated between us and say Belarusians
To us, LDK was an extention of our lands
To Belarussians, we are Samogitia
Dont forget about the good old battle of Grunwald
Oh and  *Adam Mickiewicz,* the man born in Belarus, spoke in polish, lived in Poland and wrote how beautiful Lithuania is (could be wrong, just remember something like this from school)
I would say we Lithuanians have a positive view of our shared history, shared heroes and achievements, and the animosity caused by the state of affairs during the Interbellum has waned, so our shared glorious past and neighbourly present is at the forefront again
> and wrote how beautiful Lithuania is (could be wrong, just remember something like this from school)
You're not wrong but to I got something to add
[In the very start of *Pan Tadeusz*] he wrote
>Litwo, Ojczyzno moja
>Lithuania, My fatherland
I'm fine with all three nations sharing him
Lithuanians say that the GDL forces did a "false retreat manoeuvre" which they had learned from a battle with Tatars at Vorksla (which almost had Vytautas killed)
The Poles, to my knowledge, say that the reatreat wasn't fake
Seriously
I would have thought that boomers are those who were on the streets during the August Putsch and the younger generations are complacent with the TV narrative
I thought only my family does that
Yes
Sweatpants and a t-shirt which is either dirty, too big or torn somewhere
Yeah
So I don't dirty the good ones up and I don't have to wash them every time
The ones I wear at home also tend to be more comfortable (sweatpants and sweaters)
Nah man, everyone I know does this
Sitting on your sofa is not the same in jeans and sweatpants or comfy shorts

Lugano was my only visited Swiss city
But it felt filthy rich as well
(from day to day life) I have seen several trucks from Kyrgyzstan, I instantly googled how far it is, and it's far enough to be surprised to see it in Europe
How people would stop you on the street and strike up a conversation
Happened A LOT
And in weird places too, like when I went into the shop to get cat food one time
You wouldn’t really see that happening in Lithuania, people usually keep it to themselves
Edit - I had lived in London
Danes follow rules a lot
Sometimes I love it, other times I feel perplexed how many people are just unable to be dynamic about situations
I guess I was just used to our cold Lithuanians
lol but also, people seemed really straightforward and would not beat around the bush if they were trying to hit on you
Further north and east
Have a lot in common regarding not wanting to deal with strangers or cracking a fake smile
When one talks to the governmental agencies via E-boks, even if you tell them that you have not learnt enough Danish to be able to communicate fluently, they will respond to you in Danish on purpose because those are the rules
Everyone in Denmark knows English very well — even the elderly
This one is still really surprising to me, knowing how international the country is
I don't live in NL at the moment, but I visit it several times a year and I have to keep a Maestro card (and keep paying for one) just for that purpose
And Dutch people always say that it's because their machines don't like credit cards, but I don't even use one for physical payments, nor do I think many other Europeans do, it's usually Visa/Mastercard debit
But apparently that doesn't work, it has to be Maestro
Beside the costs, I hear it has something to do with transfer time too - Maestro has direct money transfer, while Visa/Mastercard debit works on the bank's 'promise' and the money can take several days to get transferred
The card machines in shops treat that as acting like a credit card
I really like Liechtenstein and its history ( i even have a great book about it )
They have interesting political system and their history is deep and awesome, how they able to keep Principality, and  i mean they survived so many wars Napoleonic Wars, Austro-Prussian War, WW1 and WW2
And so after the wars they basically were able to transform their country from backwards agrarian state to Highly Developed and Rich country
And of course the hilarious story of 80 soldiers that they sent   to the  Austro-Prussian war and were back with 81 lol

Well we were just talking about most likely scenarios
I dont really see how Paskistan or India could invade russia either

Špargalkė. No idea what it means originally, cause i guess its a russian word
Another, less common word used to call cheat sheet is *Paruoštukė* which is female form of prepared sheet
We use shpargalka (špargalkė) here too
Yep
My school does anyway, I’ve been to another school that doesn’t though
When I was arround like in 1-7 grade, there where no lockers
Only starting from the 8th students finally had an option to rent a locker
I remember myself really wanting a locker during the 1-7 grade period because I seen them in every cartoon/show/film about school
The concept of having your own personal storage seemed so nice
But once there was an opportunity I was so used to carry everything in my backpack I just gave up the idea
Rent only
An independent company puts them in schools and we can rent
I also live in poland
Idk If this affects the funding or anything, but I'm a part of lithuanian ethnic minority and we do get lockers in our school
We can put anything we want in there
I guess it just depends on the school itself
Same country, school did not have any lockers, just changing rooms
Mine only has very few lockers, in the stairways, and you have to pay for them
Depends in which grade I was
For some odd reason the older I got the less books we had to carry
Usually the backpack would weight arround 5-6 kg in smaller grades and 2-3 in higher ones
But I'm not sure, I never weighted my backpacks
I made this assumption by the amount of books/textbooks we had to carry and how parents would complain about the huge weight their kids have to carry every day
10^6 Milijonas
10^9 Milijardas/Bilijonas (interchangeable)
10^12 Trilijonas
10^15 Kvadrilijonas
... (the rest follow latin prefixes)
Lithuanians did almost the same :))
10⁶ - milijonas
10⁹ - milijardas
10¹² - trilijonas
Welp, in Lithuanian we have a mashup, basically the American short scale, but with the word "milijardas" for 10^9
Suicides and fast internet

Ah yes
You just figured that out

Well yeah but vodka is more of a Russian alcohol

I can't think of a reason why someone would need an ID to delete your account when they already have 2F authentication
But I think they don't have my id in the first place
Its like reddit asking for my id to prove that I really own this account but up to this point reddit never knew who owned this account
If you did register with ID then its fine to ask for it when deleting
But if registration does not require ID, account deletion should not require it too

Although its extremely challenging to write in this manner
In Lithuania we say "pakratyti kojas" which is to shake your legs in English
>And the other one is:"Iti rakom zvizgat" which means: "to go whistle to crabs".
Interestingly, when you want to say that something will never happen in Russian, like "when pigs fly" in English, you say "когда рак на горе свистнет" or "kogda rak na gore svistnet" which means "when the crayfish whistles on the mountain".

It's difficult to find truly wild places and that no matter where you go, a road is somewhere nearby
Yeah, maybe you can traverse the country by bike, but what's the point, if you won't see any nature
I personally wouldn't sacrifice nature for roads
Sorry
I didn't know

At the moment it would probably a song called ["Paskambink Man (Jei tau liūdna)"] or "Call me (If you're sad)" in English by Saulės Kliošas
Hear it everywhere
Vilnius is full of Polish and Russians to the point that many don't even try to learn Lithuanian
Yes it is
Well if you go into a shop in your country the least you could expect is being able to communicate in the native language
Plus the large population of Polish in Vilnius probably comes from the Polish forcefully taking over Vilnius, so you can probably see were the disliking of them by some people (not me) come from
> And the Lithuanian government discriminates against them and is trying to forcefully Lithuanise them
How so
There are plenty of Russian and Polish schools that teach mosty in those languages
You could argue that having some lessons in Lithuanian is bad, but without knowing the main language, kids are put into disadvantage for the rest of their lives
So they can preserve their native languages while also learning the most common local language
Polish people can go from kindergarten to university by speaking polish
Lithuanian is of course thought because
well it's Lithuania
No one is discriminated here, unless you get all your info from newspapers
Children can speak only Russian, but they don't do jobs where they have to communicate
Any Lithuanian pop
Believe me, it's not good
One of many examples from Lithuania: [
There is a lot of awful music, but I really don’t like this
Everything just sounds wrong in lithuanian
[Spotify link to a shitty song ]
[be warned this is lithuanian rap (YouTube link)]
Lithuania
This guy -  He is a classic meme here and even today I still can't seem to understand if his music is ironic or not
I can only guess that he was probably not ironic, knowing the fact that he is now trying to become a politician and acts weird on social media writing nonsense political messages and posting a lot of creepy pictures of himself
What have you done, after all these peaceful years this song is in my head again
Again for a few weeks probably

I used to work in one, it was indeed fun reading the standards for third-grade pasteurized sludge
I really dislike our [anthem
] Poems should not be turned in to anthems
Not only it doesn't sound that much of an Anthem, the lyrics are complex, but there are waaaay too many high notes for your average citizen - so much so, a a lot of the people just shut up on a few verses and stay quiet if they don't want to squeal
Too many rules of what a good anthem should be are broken with ours
>Some people say there are better songs
Can you link any of them

I don't think these geographical boundaries are in any way controversial, they were rightful german lands at the time of the composition of the words

I don't think we do, what would the use of something like this be
Only one from my class knew too
I would reverse the outcome of the Battle of Vorskla
That way (given that the Tatars lost):
1) it prevents the rise of Muscovy (which in turn saves us from endless wars)
2) Vytautas gets his crown earlier and GDL becomes the Kingdom of Lithuania
3) removes the need to give Samogitia to the Teutonic Order; battle of Tannenberg never happens
There's the term "False Knight", that describes a lonely warrior, travelling in search of adventure
Usually they're of broken heart, and in search of some form of redemption
It's a really poetical, and not really a historical term, but it can be used to describe someone that doesn't know their place in the world

That would be a good reason to leave EU and form our own union

I don’t think it’s national, but used to have this herbal liquor called “trejos devynerios” which translates to “three nines” and it’s made from 27 different herbs
It can be quite bitter like a lot of those herb-like liquours out there
Then at some point same company made another version which got super popular, called “Žalios Devynerios” (Green Nines) and it tastes mostly like Jägermeister
> Historically it would be mead
And thus it is ours national liquor
Got it as a present few years ago as not a lot of people actually drink it
And damn it's tasty
How about fil'e ferru
Between lithuanians nowadays its considered national, just like the new line of Voruta wines
The Nines is a go to drink for younger people because its quite cheap, high in alcohol and delicious
Also now there is 4 kind of it and theres a different special edition each year
Tastes:
Original - taste of anise, pepper, ginger, muscat
Green Nines - anise, vanilla, citrus and coffee
Red Nines - oranges and other citrus fruits with cinammon (best drink ever for me personally, you can make so many cocktails out of it and its really sweet so easy to drink it on its own and its usually the only flavour I find in baltic shops abroad)
Last years edition - sea buckthorn flavour
Edit:spelling
Nah, its more just historically its supposed to be the drink of all baltic states, not just Lithuania
You cant even buy midus anywhere and its hard to find people who have tried it, I have heard its more popular in Latvia though
Honestly I learned English by accident, I just watched a bunch of YT and played a bunch of games and over time I just learned the language and all of its unique quirks
For me it was easy, because my cousin lived in Belgium and when he came back we watched tons of english channels and talked, but for lithuanians i think it's challenging
Since you have to learn 3 languages the whole school years you go
Theres Lithuanian, english and german,russian,french, but you can choose wich ones you want to learn
Most people speak english with a russian/lithuanian or polish accent so most of the time foreigners don't understand our english
Well, diaspora in Europe usually have susch rights as well
College and university means two different things in Lithuania
Colleges are lower tie tertiary schools that awards with *professional bachelor* and universities are higher tie schools that with Bachelor, Master and Doctor
* Hrodna – Gardinas
* Bialystok – Balstogė
* Kaliningrad – Karaliaučius
* Veliky Novgorod – Didysis Naugardas
* Beijing – Pekinas
* Warsaw – Varšuva
Same here – 'Pekinas'.
And you use many Greek names for Turkish cities like Konstantinopolis and Smyrna
What are other less famous
Trafi for busses is phenomenal in Lithuania, other than that, country is generally too small to require google maps
Taxi drivers for example know every single street in my city (3rd largest by population)
1 euro - Ice cream bar
10 euro - 3 packs of chips, 7 cans of beer
100 euro - 2 great quality pair of jeans, one nice quality pair of shoes

The sea itself looks menacing
Eating something that belongs to it sounds like a bad fortune
It is not weird or yucky in a sense of how it looks, tastes etc
But I don't like the idea of how clever they are and eating them makes me really sad
Now I know that it's hypocritical, because cows and pigs are probably just as clever as dogs, and I would not eat dogs for same reason as octopus
But I can't help but have those specific feelings
Lithuanians eat pig innards stuffed with potatoes, animal intestine soup and blood soup
Octopus is a the least disgusting (and least metal) food compared to these, so no
Eating octopuses is not disgusting or scary to me

In your country, do women in close circle (mom, daughter, sister, grandma etc) talk about their experience being pregnant and giving birth
Or is it too "private"?
(Lithuania) I'm (F) asking because I realized that not one woman in my family or close circles has ever spoken about their pregnancy or labor
I asked around and my friends have confirmed that women don't share these stories
I pressed my mother about it and she got worked up saying it's much too private to be discussed out loud
What's it like in your countries
I've never talked about that with my mom, but I do talk about it extensively with close female friends
Same with periods or ob/gyn appointments
However I think if I asked my mom about it, she wouldn't have much problem sharing, it's just an unusual topic
I can't really say if that reflects the mentality of the whole country though
I suppose it could, since we tend to be a little reserved
Well most people will not cook after hard day so it some hot take away/bar food like burger or various hot snacks, pizza, kebabs
I don't think there is one ultimate dish though
I go for something with lots of meat, cheese and fat
Anything that gives you diabetes, fatty liver or hearth disease
Emotional eating is really dangerous
Cheap kebabs from places that work 24/7 are the best
Yeah, but it becomes dry really fast, so if you want to make more for later, you add cream
Poland - Lenkija
Denmark - Danija
Belarus - Gudija (sometimes)
Montenegro - Juodkalnija (literally)
Finland - Suomija
Poland -> Lenkija
Germany -> Vokietija
Montenegro -> Juodkalnija
there's probably way more tho
Germany - Vokietija
Note that I've never actually heard anyone referring to Belarus as *Gudija* in conversation
I've only ever seen this name in books and even there it's pretty rare
*Baltarusija* is the common name for the country
I don't think *Danija* counts as it's pretty similar and shares the same root with *Denmark*.
Lithuania - Lietuva
Netherlands - Olandija
Switzerland - Šveicarija
Germany - Vokietija
Do these names have any discernible meaning
To be more pricese, the suffix is *-ija* and the stem is *suom*. Most country names in Lithuanian end in *-ija*.
Yep, *juodas* means "black" and *kalnas* means "mountain". So it literally means "land of the black mountains".
Georgia - Sakartvelas or Gruzija
Funny enough, one of the biggest shoe shops around in Lithuania is called Danija
With red background and white text, reminding your flag colors
Just thought it could be interesting :)
How Lithuania is in Hungarian
As Y in Yoghurt
Liettua is very close to how we call ourselves - Lietuva
Hungary - Vengrija
The Baltic Sea is the source for the name of the region around it
As far as I know, the most likely theories are that the name comes from a Germanic word for "strait" (*Belt* in German) or the Latin word for "belt" (*balteus*)
Some people do think that it's related to the Lithuanian *baltas* meaning "white", or the Slavic word for swamp (*\*bolto* in Proto-Slavic), though
Thanks
Essentially, yes
It's mostly used for countries and other geographic regions
Note that the word for "land" in Lithuanian is *žemė* and *-ija* doesn't have any meaning on its own
It's similar in all Slavic languages
Through Russian, this name made its way into Lithuanian, too
I'm not sure this counts because *Vengrija* obviously has the same root as *Hungary*.
They look and sound similar because they're cognates, meaning that they descend from a common source (in this case, Proto-Indo-European [\*dʰéǵʰōm] Since Baltic and Slavic languages probably had a common ancestor in [Proto-Balto-Slavic] these types of cognates are quite frequent
There are two that come to mind
"Anykščių šilelis" by priest Antanas Baranauskas and "Trakų pilis"by priest Maironis (Jonas Mačiulis)
These two basically sum up our entire existence: being europe's last forest people and suffering from destruction of nature
and also remembering how great of a country we were, then feeling sad about how small we've became in the end
First poem is very relevant in today's struggle with environmental crisis
It describes experience of walking through oldwood of Anykščiai, and also describes how it was "changed" (cut down) and how the nature struggles and the man (poet) feels about it
Second poem is about our ancestry (great duchy of lithuania), its castle of Trakai, about how was "now" in ruins, as "is" Lithuania as a country (occupiee by czar russia), how great we have risen and how low we have fallen
Northern food has a tendency to be very filling and to warm you up during harsh winters
Flavour wasn't ever of much importance
Of course I'd say Southern cuisine is more interesting
Southern dishes, unlike most northern dishes, have a variety of spices added to them
This gives them a much greater variety in taste, plus southern dishes look more presentable
Olive oil sucks
Butter makes everything better
Fite me
That's because spices are natural preservatives
You didn't need them since you had winter doing that for you for free
They had to use spices in the South
Spices are literally poisons meant to protect the plant from bacteria and insects, Humans are simply not affected by them because we're too big
They are preservatives, albeit you're right as they are not as potent as salt
Šventosios Romos Imperija
Totally word to word
Šventosios - Holy's, Romos - Rome's, Imperija - empire
No, it doesn't include the word "german" in any form
It's just "Romos Imperia", not even holy
Un Russian and Lithuanian it's also just Holy Roman Empire
Lithuanian - Šventoji Romos Imperija
Russian - Священная Римская Империя
Šventoji(būd.) Romos(būd)* Imperija(daiktavardis)
* It's an adjective contextually it's translated as Roman
I know
It's still called "Romos Imperia". No germany in the lithuanian name for it
Technically yeah, but in day-to-day talking, nobody calls it that
Of course the holy roman empire is a rare subject, but when it does come up, it's called simply "Romos Imperia". I've never heard it called otherwise
You've answered the question yourself
It's made clear from context :))
I am very careful around the words condone and condemn
They're just too similar for what they mean, and mixing them up is too easy for the consequences it could have
For some reason I mix up six and eight
And not only in English, I mix them up in Lithuanian, French, Korean and Japanese as well
Isn't that Canadian spelling
Pretty much no one here believes that the Earth is flat
There are a few climate change deniers, but nothing serious
The only thing here that even comes close to being serious is the whole anti-vaxxers drama
Yes, there are lots of facebook groups dedicated to these things, mostly anti-vax
Antivaxxers, homeopathy, even some climate change denial lately
Lithuania
We are friendly with Germany after they liberated us in ww1
And we still hate Russia
Lithuanian here
Both had effect with relationahip with Poland beacause they occupied Vilnius
Poland – it's weird to say that, but WW2 and 45 years of Communist oppression solved idiotic Polish-Lithuanian conflict and Vilnius issue
Germany – they're not a threat anymore
Russia – they still are keen on aggressive rhetoric towards us, we are extremely vigilant towards them
I hang out mostly on majority female subs and it's a fucking nightmare
The fakeness, forced wholesomeness and compliment sandwiches are bad enough when you're an autistic Eastern European (make a "tactless" comment and they'll rip you apart tho), but they're so deep into Teen Vogue white savior victim slay queen "feminism" bullshit these days it's sickening
Like, how about reading a fucking BOOK on feminism instead of getting all your ideology from other college girls' blogs about the Sociology 101 they just took last Monday
I think a huge part of the problem is that Americans are indeed taught to be very well spoken and structure their thoughts in ways it appears they know what they're talking about, having all the right intellectual buzzwords to expound on the empowerment of buying shitloads of makeup and whatnot, but they don't know how to read a fucking book or process it
(I still call myself feminist just not to give them that power of redefining the word)
I also remember when I was a teenager and got all my "peer interaction" from the internet I assumed all women are catcalled, flirted with and hit on wherever they go, and I'm just too ugly to harrass
I still find it hard to shake it off sometimes even though I know NO ONE DOES THAT
And yet it sounds as if being hit on is the #1 oppressive problem for all women of the world
It's more heartening sometimes to read /r/trufemcels as even that seems more realistic about the role of women
Teenage American "socialists" also need to get the fuck out of their country for at least a month and see how the world functions
I know a lot of them are being trolled and misled by malicious people, but really, I find it hard to fathom sometimes how so many people know nothing about anything outside the US system and think they're inventing something new
You don't even need that much economic theory or political theory or whatnot
just basic awareness of things besides hyper-capitalism
Like, listen to some honest experience of how a Swedish person gets through their week
What Eastern Europeans of all ages have to say about the differences of communism vs capitalism
How people see the police force in different countries
How racial divisions developed in various kinds of places
I think they would benefit greatly from making an effort to include people from around the world rather than middle class American queer POC, but of course everyone outside the bubble is racist, fascist and no speak Ingles gud enough
Is EVERY space on the internet an American feminist space though
Where do the rest of us go to not be met with hostility
And what I talked about was not feminist spaces, but "socialist" spaces which sorely need outside perspectives
I think it's actually called "Russian dressing", like officially
Many manual construction jobs like carpenteer, plumber, etc are paid as good as physicians and much better than most public white collar jobs

If they are straight Polish, it is very likely that the person is from South-Eastern Lithuania
If the surname has Muslim vibes, the person can be from or has origins from the Tatar villages
There are few thousands, and my city has a Tatar mosque
From the legendary BBC phrasebooks:
* ¿Donde están los brics de sangría a un euro
* ¿Quizás un chapuzón sin ropa en el mar
Ich liebe trinkt mineralwasser
Sous ma bitte
Zīrga gālva
Kurwa ja perdole
Que pasa amigo
Mama mia
я не понимаю русский (ja nipanimaju paruski)
It means "I dont understand russian"
иди на ху.
not a sentence:
니가 [niga] meaning you're
in aqua scribis
Writing in water
я ем хлеб, он ест хлеб.
Unfortunately, the kids are home, too
It makes a bit more sense in English
> I said a hip hop,
> The hippie to the hippie
> The hip hip a hop, and you don't stop, a rock it
> To the bang bang boogie, say up jump the boogie,
> To the rhythm of the boogie, the beat
Litai (our previous currency, 1Lt is about 0
29€)
I still have a 0
10Lt coin in my bedroom and it gives me so much nostalgia from when I was a little kid
[There's this guy] but other than that, I don't really know
I don't watch lithuanian youtube, becouse most videos are garbage
There are some exceptions, but generally most viedos are just not my taste
I agree to you
Lithuanian YouTube is garbage, indeed
Maybe DeMiko is one of the better YouTubers, but I don't watch him anyways
Bruh you moved to Latvia to be in a deadbedroom
Normally I would say something encouraging but at this point I just have to ask how much you really love her
I've personally had great feelings whenever I moved countries for a partner but those weren't necessarily supposed to be long term, end-of-my-life situations
No since Lithuania gained independence in the end of the WW1
We don't really celebrate or do something about world war one
Same with world war two, only Russian minority celebrate it
Yes, we say 'Čekija' and I never understood the point of using the full name in this context
Čekija is what it is in Lithuanian
So we've been using "Czechia" already anyway for a long time
I’m Lithuanian
We have always used the shortened version when mentioning the country, Čekija
Yeah, as long as I don't encounter idiots who pronounce it as "tchetchia".
Czechia isn't really a shortening
Czechia is to the Czech republic what Ireland is to the Republic of Ireland
Anyway, I prefer it since it's shorter
I like the Czech Republic more because Czechia sound like Чечня (Chechnya, Chechen Republic) in russian
my point is, one is a place the other the official title of a government
I think the PLC flag looks the coolest, just so many features incorporated into one flag
AHH so the Libyans copied you
In Lithuanian there is only a single word - *pavydas*. It's used in every context and so I can never remember which of the two is the correct one to use in English, as I never had a clear separation in my mind
There are many dialects
Most prominent is Samogitian
It is sometimes considered it's own language
No, it was Chechnya
Vilnius has everything new and old:
IT, finance, engineering (mainly mechanical design)
Kaunas mainly heavy industry and transportation:
Engineering (mainly mechanical manufacturing/repair)
Alytus is heavy industry:
Assembly (semi-automated or manual)
Klaipėda is sea/gas related:
Engineering (mechanical, chemical), machine operation
The media usually refers to it as the "Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine", but as far as I've encountered in daily language people usually say the "Pfizer vaccine". I've also seen governmental health institutions calling it the "Comirnaty vaccine" a few times, which is its brand name
Most people say "Thank you" in Lithuanian without even knowing it as it sounds just like a sneezing sound "ačiū" - ahchoo
English, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Lithuanian, Polish, Russian, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese
lithuanian, french, english, dutch, german, spanish, latvian and estonian
If you know how to sneeze then you have Lithuanian covered too
Same sound basically
Also Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian, although in lithuanian you normally say ačiū, which means thanks, but saying ačiū tau(thank you), is not a mistake
If you want to learn in lithuanian its ačiū
Also, Spanish and Italian
No way you don't know *gracias* and *grazie*.
Not quite, *achoo* has the clear stress strictly on the second syllable, and *ãčiū* has a long, stressed first syllable
Sounds accurate
Strict weed laws
chewing gum ban and other more nefarious bans
All that comes up to me is partly cloudy skies, Sy scrapers and massive littering and gum fines
Lithuanians had quite developed trade connections with a lot of people around europe
The balts were known for the amber they collected and the jewlery they made from it
In fact, the trade went so far, that baltic amber jewlery has been found in the middle east, and middle eastern jewlery has been found in lithuania
For example: a bronze statue, from around 1000-1500 B.C.E has been found in Šernai cemetary, near Klaipėda
It's also theorised, that Romans were the ones that first introduced lithuanians to agriculture, in exchange for amber
Actually, no
Not really
The baltic tribes were quite isolated, becouse they weren't christians up until the 14th century, and they united to form a country in the 13th
Up until that point some hunter-gatherers still remained in lithuania
Even if not plant farming, the romans brought domesticated goats to lithuania, which weren't found there naturally, so animal farming was indeed brought here by various traders, including the ones from rome
Basketball without the US, Spain or Serbia
Our only hope
Poland, because Everytime you want to go to foreign country from Lithuania, you need to spend entire day in Poland just driving through
All countries are small in the Schwarzschild metric
Well yes
Road construction next to Warsaw seems like it will last forever
I had  a train ride only once in my life :/
I’d have to say Kaunas
Vilnius is too modernized and does not have that lithuanian tone that it used to have
Edit: Damn, this sparked a HUUUGE Discussion
Not really, Vilnius was apart of Poland for around 20 years if you don't count the commonwealth
Currently memes are being shared in instagram and facebook
Major topics are political and local Lithuanian extravagansa
Only sub here i know that is mainly meme based is r/demiko
Fucking terrible
Visit r/kaimashumor to see what I mean
[Holy shit this is so much more retarded than the original]
When I was 12 we went to Vilnius to see a movie since there was no cinema in my home-town
It was my first film in cinema ever
Bus driver got lost and we didn’t make it to the animated film we were supposed to go to and went to see Final Destination instead
That was some intense stuff for 12 year-old me
I almost always missed out on my school trips (intentionally and unintentionally), so the best place I went was probably Kaunas Fort IX
We have the exact same holiday "Užgavėnės". We burn a giant doll usually made out of hay to scare the winter and welcome the spring
We eat lots of pancakes too
But we also dress up as monsters with scary faces
I’m in 8th grade and I’ve never had a sex Ed lesson, all I’ve learned is from porn and memes
Really depends on the parents
Some try to talk to their kids, some shove some books and pads in their faces (tampons are
a tricky subject), others
I'm not sure what they do
I am not sure about kindergarten or grades 1-4
But from high school curriculum the start is at 6th (~12 y/o) grade where students get to learn about differences between males and females, a little bit about development of foetus
If I recall correctly there is also a page or two from section "Good to know" where authors mentioned some items for safe sex (condoms /birth control), but these types of pages are considered "off curriculum" so it's up to teacher to decide to teach or not
Some schools ask professionals from outside (public health specialists, doctors, etc) to give speech about periods and hygiene for teenagers (usually there are two groups split in between girls and boys)
Some schools asks priests to do the talk (I am not sure why)
Before internet became so accessible kids learned stuff from magazines, now they just Google stuff
Some teachers started joking, that the kids should be able to teach about this better than teachers themselves
I'm half polish, half lithuanian
I identify more with my lithuanian side, becouse I was born and raised speaking lithuanian, surrounded by lithuanians, learning about lithuania, despite living in poland
My town is known as the largest single community of lithuanians in poland (~75% lithuanian)
It was in the center of conflict between lithuania and poland during WW2, so it belongs to poland now, despite being ethnically lithuanian
When it comes to poland I have kind of love-hate relationship with it
I have lived here all my life, so there's definitely a little bit of polish in me, but if it was not for the polish national hero, and lithuanian "anti-hero" Piłsudski, the land where I live would now probably belong to the country I consider my home
Refusing the Kaliningrad Oblast as a gift in 1950s. We could've gotten some extra land, extra coastline, some more amber, some reserves of oil we wouldn't have used; but at the same time we would've gotten a huge Russian minority population
~25% to our current 4
5%. Look how well 1950s Russian gifts of land are working out for Ukraine
Sorry for the late reply
I'm no authority on the polish side of this question so take it with a grain of salt
Poland much like Lithuania has a close history with the region
In the 1800s there were significant Polish and Lithuanian minorities in the region
Taking the region in wouldn't affect Poland as drastically as Lithuania; +2
3% compared to ~25% (current day)
Maybe Poland would take the Western part of Kaliningrad Oblast and Lithuania the Eastern
Based on [historical regions]
That being said I've never seen anyone suggest Poland to take it
I've only seen that Russia should keep it, Lithuania should take it, Germany should take it back
The latter however renounced all claim to it in 1990
TL;DR: Doubt it
They're Ok
Although I generally dislike constructions that have the plural ending "ai". Have no idea why, i just dislike them for some reason
I mean, they’re all the same
Vilnius, Kaunas, Anykščiai, palanga, Kretinga, Klaipėda are all just the same
The only way I can really answer this is with out actual country name
I prefer Lietuva over Lithuania
Everyone calls Vilnius by saying the i quite hard
So like "Will knee us". You have to say i a bit softer
I agree with the ai
I used to live in Anykščiai
Not a nice name
Utena County (northeastern Lithuania)
no such place lol
Not really a "middle of nowhere", but I think that Balbieriškis would suffice
Of course, it's only like 20 minutes away from a city with like 50000 people
In your country, do people tend to move from smaller towns to the big cities, or the other way around
In Lithuania the small towns are definitely struggling because young people go to study in the bigger cities and eventually get a job, start families and generally do not return to their small towns
In Lithuania small towns are dying (though fellow Lithuanians, feel free to correct me)
Was just about to comment about the whole situation when I saw that you're from Lithuania as well
I guess no need for any explanations then .
Wish more countries had that trend
It's a vicious cycle in Lithuania - when people leave small towns, so does entertainment , and people feel bored and move to a large city, and as a result all concerts, plays, circuses etc go to the large cities
I've heard that about Belgium, hehe
I've heard a saying that Belgium is just one large suburb of Brussels lol
Sometimes I forget that rugby exists, that's how unpopular it is in Lithuania
Eggs - yes, milk - most people do, but not my family (seriously, why does my family keep milk in the fucking *basement*?)
Milk is a must to refrigerate
It's sold refrigerated too
Some stores refrigerate eggs, some don't. I always put them in the fridge
It isn't a very common practice, but it's ok to do so
My family did that rarely
I think it's normal
Why you should leave your tasty food uneaten when you can bring it home and eat it together for your dinner
It is completely acceptable, to take the remains of restaurant food
After all, you spent money on it, so leaving it to be thrown out would be a waste of money
I use qwerty but Lithuanian is with ąčęėįšųūž on the top
QWERTY but instead of the number keys along the top we have letters like ą, ę, ė, š...
This
Also I never seen someone use ĄŽERTY type
We eat pizza with ketchup in lithuania too wtf is it weird
But its good
Character should absolutely be taken into account when sentencing
Imagine two different people kill somebody with a car in the exact same manner
One has never had a driving violation and is regarded by everyone to be a responsible driver
The other is known to all hos neighbors as an extremely agressive and unsafe driver, who constantly speeds and disregards traffic rules
Yeah, the first guy should get a more lenient sentence
That's why I'm saying that neighbors, coworkers, etc opinions should be at least somewhat considered
Not everything is in the criminal record
I mean this reasoning can be extended to any witness testimony ever
"Your honor, the witness is a dick and influenced by someone with a grudge, thus he should not be believed when saying he clearly saw the defendant violantly beating the victim"
I'm sure courts have ways of dealing with witnesses
Honest question - have you ever been to a trial or read witness depositions
You're factually incorrect, there are various questions that do not just narrowly pertain to some "actual events". And in real life various circumstances that can not be factually established, and witness testimony differ even when several people saw the same event
Courts have ways of dealing with it, it doesn't just mean witnesses have no value
We wouldn't view a tan as unhealthy, if it's not overdone
Is it considered healthy though - that's up for debate
I've encountered some older ladies, especially when I was a kid (like 15-20 years ago), claiming that one must go tanning or otherwise 'be in the sun' in the summer because a tan is healthy
I haven't heard much of that lately, I guess times are changing
Except for this one older guy who came to me at the beach recently and advised me (in a friendly manner) to get a blood test because I'm probably lacking iron, since I'm so pale
Younger people don't seem to express much about the healthiness of being either pale or tan
My friends might sometimes go 'wow, your skin is so white
' and then we'd compare our arms and have a laugh, but that's about it
Absolutely normal
Žemaičių blynai
It's not an obscure dish, but a damn good one
They're potato dumplings (not cepelinai), stuffed with cheese or meat
They're crispy, soft, sweet, salty and very delicious
I'd recommend them to anyone
They're really easy to make, and are usually baked on a pan, so there's no complex preparations or long cook time, like with cepelinai
There are differently called variations in different countries
In lithuania it’s called Šašlykai
I think the word itself is loaned from german
Basically it’s just cooked meat on fire
So nothing game changing
We have 4 in Lithuania
The closes one to me is the Vilnius Old Town  its very pretty
We have 4
Vilius old town, Kuršių marios(Curonian lagoon, separated from the sea by a 94km long dune ),Kernavė archeological site(the first historical capital of lithuania), and Skurvės geodezinis lankas, which is a triangulation chain which goes from norway to the black sea, and cuts through lithuania along with 9 other countries
[Here] are the pictures
My personal favourite is Vilnius old town
It just has that unique feel
Lithuanian name would be the best - Lietuva
There was a movement to drop the H letter, that would make Lituania, which is less of a tongue twister
Lit-land would be pretty Lit too
Albania is such a cool sounding name though
No, Suomi kp31 is like the name of the country "Suomi"... Do you think they named the country after a ww2 era SMG
Mainly some English names, like Michael, for example
Naming him Michael would produce a completely different pronunciation of it, it would sound like the Spanish or Italian version of the name (Sort of similar to Miguel), and on top of that would look seriously out of place and weird
If I "Lithuanized" it, it would be "Maiklas" which sounds even more ridiculous and would probably lead to that kid commiting suicide later in life due to heavy bullying
The "normal" lithuanization of this name would be to use the slavic version of it, "Mikhail", or in this case, "Michailas" but again, it sounds completely different, no longer cool, and it sounds like an old person's name
Wait
You don't allow non-Polish letters in your names
So why do the Poles in Lithuania want to use non-Lithuanian letters
I think [your letters] have an even worse case of cancer I'm afraid
Well, of course there are lots of people that don't mind logos, but I think in general, if people are given a choice between a shirt with a logo, or the same exact shirt, just without the logo, most would choose the logo-less variant
As I said, a lot of people wear clothes with logos here, but maybe they're not as frequent as in america
On my trip to canada (which I assume is culturally somewhat similiar to america), I noticed that lots of people there, wear sports clothes on a daily basis, while in general, in europe these clothes are not as frequent
F. ex
you don't see jeans with logos, and here in europe, people tend to wear jeans more than sports pants, which you do see with logos
It's a huge generalisation, but I think if you'd go off of a statistic, your roommate would be right to an extent
Norway
In my view only snow-white albino people lived there
Also so rich they can spit on me and id be worth 3x more if i were to be sold as an item
Also bottomless fjords, temperature never rising above -10C, never ending aurora and mountains of fish
So i happened to know some people who worked there
A place like any other
The spit part wasnt dispelled though
If you lived anywhere neighbouring russia, you would have felt like this decades before 2014
Russia has deceived, bribed our politicians so many times and tried to threaten us with so many things that we can never take it seriously anymore
Most of us cannot grasp how can a country so inherently evil, being led by a band of 90s bandits can be thought of as neutral or good by western europeans
Imo anyone who thinks highly of russia either has no morals and is a psychopath or lives under a rock
Yeah
People get the craziest opinions about places theyve never been to
Ive been to greece two times
Still nostalgic about it
From my experience, the craziest thing about greece is that all bus drivers are named Yanis
Its as if your name isnt Yanis, you cant get a license
In general, greeks are the most chill people ive met
Very warm, honest and helpful
Must be living under a rock :D
Foreign affairs: supporting syrian government who user chemical weapons to kill rebels and civilians; occupation of Krym, which was a part of a "brotherly" nation, the one of three ruses; spy assassination attempt in britain; assassination attempt of opposition leader Navalny, assassination of journalist/opposition member; "accidental" nuclear weapon detonation recently
Went silent so quick people dont even know about it; since 2014 there has been +1000 nato border breaches by their planes and ships; russian submarine near sweden; nuclear weapon dislocation in koningsburg; russian government money laundering through scandinavian banks in the baltics; russian diplomat smuggling cocaine to and from europe; cyber attacks against european neighbours, usa and others; heavy, IMMENSE propaganda machine through tv and social media about justifying occiparion of Krym and showing falsified documentaries, debate shows about  events related to soviet union and russia in european neighbours; outward calling western europe and especially germany fascists; massacre of 8 unarmed lithuanian border guards after independence; russian oligarchs bribing politicians and trying to transfer control of essential parts of countries (energy, finance, politics); 2008 Sakartvelo war, when russia gave out free passports to georgians and its regional people, then came in with an army to "defend russian citizens" (similar scenario to krym)
Recently, youth paramilitary groups (remind you of anything
Secret airsoft clubs in the baltics, training for aiding russian military in case of an invasion, dismantled slowly by lithuanian military and swats
2010-2012 export blockades that caused 8 hour queue at borders of russia & belarus, making 4 hour checks per truck
Part of produce expired and had to be disposed
Meat scandals, when "independent group of experts" found parasites
And several times when a huge shipment of meat was delivered
unfair trade practices while selling gas and oil to european countries, proven guilty by court
then Azerbaijan-Armenian war in Nogorno
Russia is now a "peacekeeper". Azeries were backed by Turkey, Armenia is heavily under influence of Russia
Turkey and Russia are getting along well as well
You can imagine two powers pushing two weak pawns to fight and weaken
One gets oil, another gets to keep its military in the region
Crazy smart, but crazy evil
Now think about the Nordstream project
Russia will control vital part of germany
Guess what russia did with Ukraine before they got rid of russian gas lines
russia shut it off several times during winter as a way to pressure the ua government
This shit is illegal
I don't really know about the meaning of the male ending -ius, -is, -as(like in Valinčius, Grigutis, Kazlauskas), but what I do know is the female ending -ienė and -iūtė is changed when the woman is married(for example a married woman will be Valinčienė, but her daughter will be Valinčiūtė. When the daughter gets married and the husband will have the same surname[Valinčius] her surname will change to Valinčienė)
Original lithuanian surnames have diffrrent endings for males (sons, fathers), wife and daughter
Original, pure lithuanian surnames dating back to 1000s A.D. end with -a, e.g. Gedvila, Radvila etc
Ending of such surname does not reveal any belonging, place or affiliation
The word itself means what it means - a family name
Wife's surname ends with -ienė, which notes that the woman is a wife of a man
So Gevila's wife would be Gedvilienė literally meaning that she is the wife of Gedvila
Daughter's surname ends with -aitė, -ytė, -ūtė..., showing the gender and unmarried family status in the family
Gedvila's daughteė would be Gedvilaitė, not Gedvilytė, cause Gedvila enda wth an A.
Other, more recent surnames are borrowed or merged up from other languages, mainly polish:
Kazlauskas, literally lithuanian version of Kozlowski
Mockus, shortened, deviated version of South-Lithuanian (Dzūkų) name Macas spoken (Matas written), which is lithuanized version of polish surname Mackiewicz, which refers to male name Mateusz aka Mathew/Matt
Valančius is lithuanian equivalent of Valantson
Original lithuanian surname would be Valanta, but his sons would be called Valančiai by strangers, Valanta by friends
Thats what i believe was the case in villages not so long ago
I use it and abuse it
No, since I'm fluent in English
Nope
Some of my classmates are (since I speak English a lot with friends), but I personally don't see an issue
We have a border with Russia and a bunch of idiots that believe Russian propaganda
I don't live in Lithuania, but I'd be armed and fighting if any Russian soldier bothered to step onto Lithuanian soil
Its not the same
Russia basically considers any exercises done in Baltic states as "on the border".
Doing exercises near the border is one thing .Crossing with your exercises into other country's air territory is another
Doing defensive exercises is one thing
Doing exercises on how to attack is a very different one
So Baltic states should be demilitarized countries because what, we are small and have borders with Russia
Or thay we can't be in NATO for this same reason because this irritates Russia
Yeah
Latin America says that Russia is never far enough
A You're being intentionally obtuse
Stop pretending that you don't know what I meant
Even AI knows the meaning these days
B Cold War never ended, there was an armistice of 15 years
Please explain how things that we do INSIDE our country give the right to Russia to cross our airspace
You are talking like we, the Baltic countries, are "the border", not sovereign countries
You are suggesting that it would be safer for us to be  demilitarized countries, while it would be absolutely the oposite
Truth is - there is no safe way to be neighbours with Russia, because that's "their thing".  Even country like Belarus, who are all into pleasing Russia, has problem with them
There's a long standing dispute about the Arctic between Canada and US
It's not as simple as one might think
I know some Russian, although it's not that big of an accomplishment since probably more than half the country can speak Russian, so I would say my skills would be below average
I speak russian (which is a minority language in Lithuania)
It is quite common along side with polish in the south-east of the country (mainly in the capital city Vilnius and surrounding territories)
But when it comes to the rest of the country, it is barely spoken by anyone
What classes did you attend
We do not matter in the grand scheme of things
We had a short stint of being a regional power in the 15-17th centuries but now we're just a small nation almost at the edge of europe
We do not have any world famous artists or scientists or people in general, so the only little fame that we can get(I guess through our basketball team) we try to hold on to as much as we can, even though the fame is completely meaningless and adds nothing to the world
Honestly, no idea
Don't think Lithuanians have anything to be proud of to begin with
You think
Not much of a thing to brag about though
It's great, but it's not unique to Lithuania
You can find it in other Baltic States, Nordics and also Central Europe
Yeah, give soviets a centimeter and they take a kilometer
We already learned it the hard way by allowing them to have Soviet troops in Lithuania, after which they just straight up annexed us
No one cares about poles until you run into one
Do care about Poles though
More likely to find it in restaurants as a snack for beer
Not enough and, unfortunately, Arab conquest has pushed us apart
Remember that most mediterranean used to be "one world".
Hopefully cultures can be reconciled and we stop looking at each other like we're foreign
This schism is something that leads to too much tensions
All i know that many of you speak french and are muslim
Oh, and Albert Camus
I'm not close to it but I know a little bit
I followed a lot of the Arab Spring and the aftermath, especially in Egypt
I'm also interested in geography so I at least know the differences between the countries although I forget a lot
Looking at Google Earth maps is a trip
The Roman history of the region is surprisingly fascinating, like the Jugurtha incident
I've only met a few Moroccans (some very proud Amazigh) and Egyptians though and no one from the other countries
I know something of the history of North African Jews and how they're doing now
I've also seen the border of Egypt from inside Israel :DDD
The Japan and Kazakhstan being similiar thing is quite well said
Kazakhstan is culturally more similiar, considering it shares a soviet past along with a lot of european countries
Japan on the other hand has a similiar climate
It has snow in the winter and plenty of conifers
Their summers are probably warmer though, depending on how far south you go, and considering that Japan's next to the pacific ocean
When in the medieval times (around 1430) the Duchy was the largest state in Europe reaching from the Baltic sea to the Black sea
Nordic Crusades probably, would fit their theme as well
But they're definitely not going to do that, Ubisoft is quite Vanilla and sticks to the histories that are well-known in the Anglo-sphere, Hellenic period, British empire, Vikings
I doubt they would do anything that's not already familiar to most of their audience
Yes, most people watch the first and second parts in December or on Christmas
I was pretty mad when the station that airs it decided to stagger the movies, air the first one weeks before Christmas and then culminate with whatever the fuck the third movie is
Nooooo
At least show the second movie on Christmas, I find it super Christmassy
Marozai
They’re basically Lithuanian gopniks
[Marozai
] They are fairly [similar] to Russian gopniks, they're mostly Russians or Poles, or a mix of the two
They're all aggressive, either jobless or re-selling used cars, finished secondary school at best, they think that all cops are bastards because their licence was taken away for drunk driving
Their population has greatly reduced over the past decade as they emigrated to Western and Northern Europe
[Marozai] or [Forsai] both of which are just pretty much our equivalent of the Russian gopnik
Formally(or even presently, idk) known as forsai
I think you meant formerly
Forsai is not used these days at all
Yes, you’re right ! Also gezai IIRC
We share quite a lot of words with Latvian, but most often it's just the same root, possibly with few different leters, pronunciation is different
Often those similar words have a slightly different meaning
It's impossible to make a conversation
I personally understand almost nothing when spoken, can pick every 4th- 5th when reading text
I can also speak Russian, so I can pick some things from other slavic languages
Belarusian the best one, can undetstand it pretty well as the russian dialect in Vilnius region is quite close to it
Also can understand some ukrainian and polish
I actually understand those two much much better than I understand Latvian
Latvian, maybe like 60% when written, spoken less so
Slavs, not at all
The self-applied noose
Suicide
Das gay
From what I know, multilingual education is a thing in every school
We're taught English from elementary school and in middle school we choose a 3rd language (either French, Russian or German)
I think it works well for the most part
I can fluently speak English and I think my French is ok for someone who's been learning for 3 years
indas - indian person/a plate, a dish
keltas - celt person/ferry boat
kartu - together/bitter
Self esteem and Ego are both called Ego
I would love to hear someone say that sentence lol
Because they're all Germanic languages that have a lot of similarities to English
Finnish statistics are more impressive, but yet again, they also learn Swedish
Nation
I've moved a fair bit over Lithuania as a whole, I don't have any real attachment to any bit of it
I haven't lived in my "hometown" for 15 years now
Any word that has two r in close proximity
I hate words like rural or rare
I also find the letter combination  -ths (months)  impossible to pronounce
I couldn't help but notice your nickname
In a previous comment you said you're a native english speaker
Is there any particular reason you're learning lithuanian
Forgive my curiosity, It just warms my feelings, seeing someone willingly choose to learn my native language
Ohh
Well, good luck with your learning then
> maybe in Eastern Europe
I kinda doubt it, the hardest alcohol abuse here happens in private homes
Uruguay, in terms of size (both population and area) and economic development
One Lithuanian sociologist wrote a monograph that includes exploring two different scenarios of how Lithuania would have ended up if not for the Soviet occupation
The optimistic scenario is Finland and the pessimistic scenario is Uruguay (ending up the same as we are today)
I had no idea which country would work for me, after your explanation I totally agree, Ireland
I would say it's [Curonian Spit ] something magical there
Every time I go there I feel like I'm far away from home
I went there once
It's totally unexpected, since the mountains there are really smooth and not really rocky, and suddenly you see these sandstone pillars in the middle of the forest
Really cool, would recommend
They're quite cool
It's also worth mentioning about [Naglių kaimas] a village that got swallowed by the dunes overtime and is now completely buried under the sand
I study in a UK university - all the recorded lectures are not Moodle, what they didnt get to record before Easter they took from last year
Had one presentation assignment that they did on Google Hangouts and thats pretty much it
They just changed all the exams to coursework and if you have questions - you email the lecturers
My sister in Lithuanian school - has lessons from 9am to 1pm, uses Discord for this, assignments done on moodle, google drive and zoom
Depends
1-5 online classes a day
Some teachers use Moodle
Most use zoom
Our teachers will never migrate to teams lol
How can you use twitch for that
Do they stream and talk with the kids in chat
For the most part, users did not know enough about it to set proper controls, this technically allowed random people to join your conversations as conversation URL is formed from ID's so you just start changing numbers and eventually you will hit someone
Then trolls began appearing in school classes showing porn to kids and snuff videos
This could have been prevented by teachers, they just didn't know how
There were also more serious privacy concerns, like occasionally routing traffic through China (really not an issue for 5 grader class), but the main issue was unsecured conversations
Given that I still have to use zoom for work, a lot of things improved once articles started to appear on the news
So in this case the teacher could have kicked them easily
Now she is able to approve then before joining
Baisiogala - which roughly translates to "scary/horror town"
Bezdonys (which roughly translates to "Farting people")
I remember visiting Canary islands a few years back
Upon telling telling a waiter where I'm from, he started speaking Polish
Must admit, it's not the best experience
We only had like two separate days of snow actually staying on the ground this winter
And maybe a few instances of snow falling and melting instantly
The temperature is arround 5 C° at day time and 0 C° at night
Nice winter indeed
Same in Lithuania, and I honestly cannot remember there being no snow almost into February
Well not exactly the same, there were snowy days, but snow never lasted for more than 24 hours
We have Top-Shop which always advertises it's products on 10 minute long commercials
They're outrageously expensive and bad quality
I hate them personally
['Marathon in the University Street'] from 1959, by A. Sutkus
It's a photographer that most people here would probably have heard of
The photograph was bough by Elton John
It always feels a little surreal looking at it since I walk there every day
[The council of Lithuania] who signed the Act of Reinstating Independence in 1918
Probably everyone in Lithuania has seen this photo in history books at school
I would have said either [this (A.Sutkus, "Pionierius")] or [this (V. Usinavičiaus photo of January 13th events)]
Edit: [honorary mention]
Afaik, it's up to your own interpretation
The subject of the photo is a young boy who has recently joined the [Soviet pioneer organization] the title "Pioneer"), it was taken in 1964 September 1st (which is the start of a school year)
I've found interpretations suggesting it's a propagandist photo, and some suggesting it wasn't published until the 1980s because the boy is not smiling in the photo, and that's not the idealistic way government wanted Soviet people to be portrayed in
Personally, I think it shows a boy who's been put into a politicised uniform to represent something he's neither aware of nor cares about; you can see kids in the background smiling and looking on inquisitively (and I can't see the signature neck-tie of pioneers on them), but the boy in the foreground seems ambivalent; I think it's about putting your agenda onto others, some who might not be able to reject it, to give that agenda an image you desire, but that it doesn't necessarily possess
Aren't most of your beaches rocky
Also your buses were very convenient, the service was really good
[English] the variety in accents alone is breathtaking
i really enjoy languages like Japanese and Korean
I like their flow and how different tue languages are from my own
Yeah, most of the Polish Lithuanian Commonwealth years
My IT teacher said that January 1, 2000 was the first day of 21st century
I tried arguing but she remained certain
My Lithuanian teacher insisted that Kristijonas Donelaitis cannot be called 'kunigas' (priest; all Catholic priests are called 'kunigai'), instead she suggested to use 'pastorius' – despite that Lithuanian Evangelical Lutheran church call their clergy 'kunigai' as well
My high school Lithuanian language teacher really enjoyed talking about medical things that she had no clue about
She used to tell us how homeopathic medicines are superior to real drugs (her grandma was a homeopath, so it must be true)
Or how children delivered through C-section do not have a strong personality and are not as successful later in life
On top of that, I disagreed with a lot of her interpretations of the literature that we studied, so
Yeah, her classes quickly became my least favourite
Heyy broli lietuvninke, i dont get it, can you explain please
Year zero doesn't exist, so the 1st century spans the years AD 1 to AD 100, inclusive, and so on
That means the 21st century is 2001 to 2100, inclusive
AM is indeed for early things, pre-midday is earlier than post-midday
Exactly the same in Lithuania
Call Lithuanians Russians or Slavs
Wear Communist and Nazi memorablia
Speak positively about Soviet Union, Communism or tell that 'Soviets liberated Lithuania'.
Call Lithuania nation of 'Jew killers'.
It's viewed as aplace where you can get cheap(compared to other brands), quality products
It's quite popular
IKEA kitchen is exactly the same quality as any other made from laminated MDF
They use all Blum hardware and their warranty is excellent all 25 years of it
Now they mostly do
Lithuanian constitution prohibits foreign military bases, but NATO bases are OK
I'm happy for all international (NATO/EU) soldiers here, because it works like a deterrent against a pretty imperialistic nuclear neighbour
>Cheese
You would be surprised how good Australians are at making quality cheeses
Francophone America makes some awesome unique cheeses
And Latin American artisan cheeses could rival Spanish varieties
Sorry, but other places have great cheeses as well
Yes they are
and they are boringly repetitive
Here in US - Kerrygold is literally everywhere
And it is literally the exact same butter as back in Ireland
(My husband's Irish and he just can't live without it)
My sister lives in Ardea, near Rome, and her water supply is practically mineral water
I think it's Nemi, a small town, the water from their pipe is a little carbonated and is mineral water
You can
But here, in US, it's quite literally everywhere
I've even seen in a random country store, where you could buy guns, chicks() and tractor wheels right next to an old household fridge half full of 4 different types of Kerrygold and local butter
Of course
Even apples are Polish :D
I can die for Skawa draze kokosowe
I currently live in Williamsburg neighborhood of New York City
Greenpoint is an incredibly Polish neighborhood
To the point that I can get any Polish foodstuff in any shop there
Polish is lingua Franca there
As for my home - there's little need to have Polish store in Lithuania
The difference between Lithuanian and Polish foods is not great
and the things that are only made in Poland are freely available at any supermarket
No, but the part of the country within an hour's drive or so from the the Polish border goes grocery shopping in Poland due to lower prices and lower VAT rates
Probably around 1410, when the battle of Žalgiris (Tanenberg) happened, I think it would be so interesting to see how the people lived, perhaps how they reacted to this victory
A second choice would be either a bit back, when Algirdas and Kęstutis ruled, or interwar Lithuania, because I just know so little about interwar Lithuania
These were the few times in history when our nation was truly independent - no Poland, no Russia, no Germany
Late interbellum
Maybe I would even meet my grandparents who are alive nowadays
Well, everyone who lives in spain, but otherwise you're mistaken
I haven't met anyone who knows the spanish anthem
Well, that's an unexpected plot twist
They just drive porsches
Not really an accent, but a dialect - Samogitian
Already hard enough to read, but if someone old from Samogitia starts speaking in their dialect, oh no, can't understand anything
The accent of people living in Žemaitija(Šiauliai and all around it) as a person from Aukštaitija(Vilnius and north) is REALLY hard to understand
I can ask them to repeat what they've said like 5 times and still not get it
In lithuania it snowed like 2 years ago alot
Sometimes it even went to -30 but last year it wasnt even snowing idk whats gonna happen this year
> we even get around or even above zero temperatures in mid winter
Last year was probably the only year in my life were I never wore a winter coat and only walked with spring coat that mostly protects from rain rather than cold
Odd times ahead
Comma for decimal, point for thousands: 2

Our current president is Gitanas Nauseda
So among the russian speaking part of the country we have an anecdote
The belarussian president Aleksander Lukashenko (who is a president for arround 20 years) was sitting in his cabinet when sudenly a man came in and reported:
- Lithuanians have a new president Nauseda
Lukashenko replies:
- Don't worry, I'm here Navsegda too
The thing is that in russian "Navsegda" (Навсегда) means "forever" and sounds very similar to Nauseda
Basically it is a reference to how long Lukashenko is the president of Belarus and him being an everlasting president that doesn't want to leave his post
It is more of a joke about the Belarussian president, not the Lithuanian one at this point :/
We pronounce it with "Sh" and add the lithuanian "-as" at the end, so it's "Budapeštas" in lithuanian
We also put the accent on "pe". Idk if it's the correct way, but we do it
We also use "š" in "budapest". It would be "budapeštas" in lithuanian
As an engineer, it wouls be very useful to learn german, swedish and french
As for world-context language skills: english, spanish, russian
Korean, Japanese and French
I already speak a bit of Korean and Japanese and I'm kinda good at French, but I'd love to be fluent in them
Getting rid of them was one of the first things we did
They were all sent to "Grūtas park" which is a populiar tourist attraction in southern Lithuania now
Every Soviet monument to Grūtas park
And we shouldn't care what Russian government says
Read about Grutas Park in Lithuania if you want to know what happened to those statues :)
There’s nothing wrong with honouring fallen soldiers of any side
All police officers carry their Glock pistols, but I have seemed them with assault rifles only in December 2014, when all the euro banknotes were brought to the Bank of Lithuania before the euro changeover
Most policemen have pistols, among things like tazers, batons and speays
Rarely police patrols are issued assault rifles
We skipped the oceanic islands when i was in school
Oceanic wasnt a term used back then in our country
Now im sure its either Australia and Oceanic islands or Australia
Imo, oceania is an artificial region, like europe, not a continent
Australia is a contiental land mass, and oceania is thousands of islands around it and some very far away from the contient, maybe even on a different tectonic plate
i was taught jugendherberge meant children's night hostels (rough translation), does it just mean hostels
As mentioned before here, double negative
Nieko nenoriu, word by word -  " I don't want nothing " but actually means "I want nothing".
Palys palįs, palys, palis
Palys (surname) will take cover, will thin down a little bit, it will rain a little bit
"How are these berries called
It's a blueberries
So why are they red then
Because they are green
" In Lithuanian "green" has also a meaning of a "raw". While it's ok with some fruits it makes no sense with the other
We say "green meat" when we mean a raw meat as well
Of course it was a woman
Oh, wait, you never said so
Just made up another one with `senVs`:
Senas senos senės senis senės.
Adj   adj   noun  noun  verb

Off the top of my head for Lithuania:
* Mindaugas (first and only King of Lithuania)
* Gediminas (founder of Vilnius, capital of Lithuania)
* Vytautas the Great (the greatest Duke the GDL has ever had, during his rule the GDL was at its zenith of power)
* Jogaila (Jagiełło in Polish) (The ruler who started baptising lithuanians)
* Martynas Mažvydas (author of the first Lithuanian book)
* Simonas Daukantas (one of first beginners of Lithuanian National Revival)
* Jonas Basanavičius (the Chairman of the National Council, which has created the first Lithuanian state)
* Antanas Smetona (last President of Lithuania, a de facto dictator)
* Vytautas Landsbergis (the first Head of Parliament of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union)
Edit: there were a couple of great additions that I missed, so it would be prudent to include them:
Vincas Kudirka (author of the Lithuanian anthem)
Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis (the most renowned Lithuanian painter and composer)
* Mindaugas
* Gediminas
* Algirdas
* Kęstutis
* Vytautas
* Jogaila
* Antanas Smetona
* Martynas Mažvydas
* Adomas Mickevičius
* Vincas Kudirka
* Maironis
* Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis
* Steponas Darius and Stasys Girėnas (people know them together)
* Jonas Žemaitis
• Mindaugas (our first and only king)
These are our grand dukes :
• Gediminas
• Algirdas
• Kęstutis
• Vytautas The Great
• Jogaila
19th-20th centuries famous figures :
•Vincas Kudirka (he wrote the national anthem)
•Jonas Basanavičius
• Antanas Smetona (the first president of Lithuania, who later became an authoritarian ruler )
V. Landsbergis (he's still alive but he was a really important figure during Lithuania's independence restoration in 1990-91)
I would for sure include Kęstutis and Algirdas
Vincas Kudirka, writer of national anthem
I was told in school that Stanisław August Poniatowski, Tadeusz Kościuszko, Adam Mickiewicz were lithuanians
I think he's perceived fairly well
While he did start the personal union between the two states, and that was a very big mess, we still think of him as a pretty ok dude who was largely overshadowed by Vytautas
P.S. This is just my opinion, I don't speak for every Lithuanian
I would agree with you, but imo they are not as widely known as the others
It's not that clear cut
Tbf, it's different era
Nationalities were more defined but still tricky in case of Poland-Lithuania as the best example would be Narutavičiai (Narutowicz) - one brother became Poland's first president and the other brother was signatory of Lithuania's independence
Yes, it's known that Piłsudski was born in Lithuania and that his heart is burried in Vilnius but he chose Poland
I have no idea who he is
Well there was a nice [comment in thread about May 3rd Constitution] About interwar and Piłsudski
But position of power is too aluring and damning
I'd even consider same mistake (just on smaller scale ofc) to be made in '90s-10s by Poland
> spoke, German and had a German family
Why are you applying today's standards of nationality to 500 years ago
Nah, they just get drunk and then pee everywhere
English is really easy to learn, so it's good it became a universal language, but my god, are some things you can say in one word in lithuanian, super long in english
Exaples:
-nebeprisivalgiuosiuose - inside people that haven't eaten enough,
-bėgiojančių - of people that run (Not runners
Runners - bėgikai, not bėgiojantys),
-nebeprisibėgiojusių - belonging to people that haven't ran enough
There's a lot more words, that use this format, which compiles a sentence into one word
I don't feel safe going back to school because COVID cases are going up again in Lithuania (I'm in gymnasium, which is like high school)
I actually don't even know we're going back to school in the fall, we might continue online learning (I think)
Same here
Well I don't know, but in my eyes, Romania is same, but more corrupt (no offense)
either the [Cathedral] or [Gediminas Castle] (which is only a tower now)
The Gediminas Castle, The Three Crosses, etc
Vilnius has a LOT
My city of Nemenčinė has one of the oldest churches in Lithuania (circa 1387)
Also, it rumored that it's named after Polish travelers asked *Niemna czy nie* (is this the river of Nemunas or not)
“plaktukas” in Lithuanian
Or kūjis is a sledge hammer
Kūjis sounds kinda of tough
plaktukas sounds like a baby hammer
Kūjis for big hammer sounds kind of cool(ū is oo in doom, j is y in yes, i as i in dim, so something like cooyis)
The word for small hammer doesn’t sound cool at all - plaktukas
It’s a diminutive form for the noun made from the verb “plakti” or “to whip” in english
In lithuanian it's either "plaktas", "plaktukas", or "kūjis" depending on the context
It doesn't sound very cool to lithuanians, but perhaps people of other nationalities percieve this word dofferently
In lithuanian its *Plaktukas* literally translated means Whipper / Thrasher
Not very strong sounding name for sure
"Vasara" in lithuanian means "summer" :D
In Westphalia, which direction do phaluses bend
Doesn't "plaktas" just mean "whisked"?
>plaktas
Today I learnt a new word
It does, but in my area, people also use the word as a synonim for "kūjis". It makes sense, plaktukas id a diminutive after all
Good for you
It's probably just a word from my dialect, but it is a word nontheless
Typically I assume they save not much due to still low wages for the most at that age
Also from what I see my fellow age group friends do, they do like to travel so if they save its not long term
Personally (25) I still live in my parent owned flat as they are usually not there for the most of year, but if I rented i could save about 60% or around a 1000 each month
But with no housing costs I save around 1300-1500 a month
Around 500 of savings go to investing and the rest is kept for down payment for my own place, that I plan to put into ~2% savings account every 6 months just to get some extra cash
I do earn above average though and I invest into the stock market, something that only around 2% of locals do in Lithuania
So I would consider myself to be more of an extreme case in saving and earning
Well, if you're in IT it can be 1-2k as you can make 2-3k if you get a job while studying and become senior by 25 which I know a lot of cases of
I also know medicine students that can't save anything at all
Really depends on your path
All the seniors I know do tend to be just above 25 year mark
More like 26-28
Its good for economy though if done properly
Wouldn't change :(

Old people may feel some nostalgia because they were younger back then, but of course very few people would want to live under oppressive and genocidal dictatorship with failing economy
Before 20th century
Kingdom of Lithuania was established in 1253 (later Grand Duchy of Lithuania), it was baptised in 1387, and in 1569 together with Poland it created the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth
The Commonwealth was partitioned by Russia, Austria and Prussia in late 18th century, majority of Lithuanian areas became part of Russian empire
Russian imperial regime closed university, banned Lithuanian language in public life and even Latin script for Lithuanian language – Lithuanian language was clearly on the brink of extinction in mid 19th century, but the National Revival reversed these trends in late 19th century, allowing for Republic of Lithuania to be established after the WW1
The school teaches quite a lot about this period, and they really shut on Russians in them
Talking about the genocide during the post war time, about partisan fights, what you could and what you couldn't do or say, the collapse of USSR
You know, the stuff that mattered to us
Including the economical problems
And about the nostalgia - older people kind of get nostalgic about their life back then, but mostly only very old people complain about how it was better in the USSR
And they mostly think that because they wouldn't need to choose their jobs, as the state chose it for them
And also because after the collapse of the USSR, the new states had a lot of problems: gangs, corrupt politicians, high crimerate, shitty police, fuel shortages
And because of that they think in the USSR this wouldn't have ever happened and they would have had a better life
I personally didn't learn much about soviet rule from history classes
History classes take history linearly
I dropped history in 11th grade, which means that I ended my "history studies" at around the early soviet union
As for soviet nostalgia
There are certain groups of people for whom it is legitimately worse now, than it was in the union
The reality of a USSR > Capitalist shift is that it's a power shift, and in power shifts you have winners and losers
And the day to day reality, say if you worked in a sausage factory, changed a lot for you
There are also people who didn't really adapt to the capitalist switch, from a mentality viewpoint
Of course taught us, it's part of our history after all (though an unpleasant one
They taught us just as you'd imagine, there was no bias from the teachers (although all of the teachers that I was taught by did say they "didn't prefer" the Soviet rule)
There are some old people here who do feel nostalgic, though I must say it's probably due to the fact they remember themselves as young back in the day
Memories twisted by nostalgia, really
The Baltics before the Soviet occupation were just like any other European countries, so there isn't too much to talk about
I remember our history teacher saying Lithuania's economy was comparable to that of Denmark
Most likely if not for the Soviet occupation, Baltics nowadays would be on par with our friends up north
Hey
Lithuanian here
They taught us that it was absolutely terrible
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Oh, yeah, Russian media keeps on screaming that January Events were Lithuanian inside job and that Nazi collaborators were behind Lithuanian nationalist movement
Our economy was more agricultural, therefore the soviets didn't need to ship as many foreign workers to fill all the available work spots
Estonia and Latvia were more consumer goods oriented, therefore their factories could sustain more workers than their local populace could fill, so russians/belarussians/ukrainians were relocated to fill those spots
Nature
10m or so outside the path is fine
City, never
Drunk brits on a stagdos pissing on walls is kinda noteworthy enough to be put on news
I am Lithuanian and piss everywhere when I am drinking
Eat, drink, sleep, repeat
The popular vote run off system (the same as France, Poland, Brazil, etc
Many candidates can run in the first round (in 2019 elections there were 9) and if no one gets more than 50% of the votes, the top 2 candidates go into a second round of voting
If a candidate gets more than 60% (this happened in 2009), no second round needed
What is the role of the German president then
I know you have one, but the only German leader seen on the international stage is the chancellor
No pressure, only words now and then
But grandparents and sometimes parents make tiny jokes that if u dont have somebody to share a bed with, its either: youre gay if you are male; youre gonna regret not having kids earlier or be "old hag" if youre female
They dont mean it to be offensive, just reminding that "the clock is ticking and even if u plan on having kids past 30, you still need to find a suitable partner, be in a relationship for preferably years before that
So pick carefuly, but dont pospone it
Lithuanians don't really stereotype people, but people from Vilnius are like more entitled
How dare you attack Vilnius in such manner
Here are 17 reasons why we are better than the rest of the world
Damn, forgot about the mushroom pickers
But you don't have sea
No, we don't wish bad for you
(And Vilnius is pretty nice city, so also no)
It was a joke about how people from vilnius see the world
To be honest you were so exact, that I thinked it was true :D
wait, you don't need a passport or any documents
I'd say it's pretty common all around europe
Very common here (in houses that don't have a dishwasher)
But where do other countries dry their dishes then, if it's not popular everywhere
On a drying rack next to the sink probably
My parents own a meat mallet like that (although it's metal), I think it's still fairly common to have, at least among older people
I sometimes hear a sound from a neighboring apartment that I think is them using a meat mallet
I never pass the opportunity to make a lame joke that they're 'beating their meat' lol
why would you want total darkness
appropriate cycling paths (i'm looking at you, the Netherlands or Denmark)
Acceptance of other sexualities, other races
Free or at least cheaper higher education
Metro lines in Vilnius
Or at least tram services
I think rail infrastructure should be more developed here
However, our City council decided to rely only on buses and trolleybuses by creating exceptional road lines for them
The good part, most of the buses are brand new with wifi, charging sockets, etc
But meh
Metro or tram is way cooler than a fancy bus or trolleybus
And we have terrible traffic jams on-peak hours:)
I'm seriously considering just wearing my mask regardless of if/when corona is eradicated
It has the dual benefit of being health conscious and hiding my ugly face
Same here
Some homophobes are planning a "Family March" this saturday to "protect traditional families". This is in response of the new bill that will hopefully become law very soon about adding gender-neutral civil partnership
So biggots unite against progress, saying it's hurting children and "traditional" families are being attacked
when most of the participants aren't exactly model citizens nor parents
we don't have anti-LGBTQ+ spaces yet but seems like a large portion of the country isn't ready for changes that don't even concern them
Edit: typos
Agree, or at least give us back half of the price of the course of this year (on behalf, EU student in the UK)
same here, the only problem for me is hot weather
Yesterday it was around 25* and I was sweating everywhere, which can get annoying with a mask on
Well I live in a pretty old city
(Since 1300) some of the infrastructure in the city center is pretty rough but I like it this way
I would say the energy cost of heating pre WW2 buildings is pretty high here
(even with municipal heating systems) Other than that no
I think it’s all a benefit
The history and the rundown parts give the city an identity and character
Maybe another problem is lack of handicap access
If your handicap the old city is not your friend at times
Not sure if I would say describes but no doubt the most well known is [3 milijonai by Mikutavičius] A song made for [200 Sydney Olympics] And *everyone* knows this song
There's a case to be made that more people know lyrics to this song than the anthem
Also, when I was in this guy's concert of course the song was played the last one and of course everyone stood up to sing it together, as one should do
Basketball anthem - 3 milijonai by Marijonas Mikutavicius
Erika slaps hard tho
What would happen if someone in Germany heard you listen to it
My first thought was ['Ant Kalno Mūrai'] but 3 milijonai is definitely up there
In 2019 I sometimes had a proper meal in the morning and most of the time at dinner
But given the pandemic and working from home, I have more than enough time to sleep and cook during workdays
A LOT of people might disagree with me, but its probably Vilnius
Its just completely different from any other Lithuanian city
It has a lot of different cultures mixed together, which other cities lack
Vilnius had been Polish, Russian AND Lithuanian
The most typical one though is imo Šiauliai, even though i am not sure
Vilnius has many Slavic vibes and Klaipėda until 1920 was ultimately German, yet now a large Russian community
&#x200B;
Kaunas is the most Lithuanian city
Oh wait i just realised that i am completely wrong
I forgot about Visaginas, whoose population mostly speaks russian
It is sad how no one talks about the Baltic languages
We also agree on this one for you
I would say it'd be not helping Novgorod fight Muscovy
Had we helped out "the threat from the east" would not have existed
Or just anything Swedish in General
Jag alskar dig Sverige

I don't even care about the dark, because I'm used to it
I take vitamin D every day
It helps
It's just something you get used to, makes you appreciate the summer more
And thats what we do :)
Always liked Manchester United’s logo, the colors especially
Ah yes, a New FM project
[Probably this
] It's a band from Vilnius so it would be fitting
It's a calm and happy raggae song that simply has a really good vibe going on
Gdańsk is basically the inspiration for Novigrad (the witcher 3), so the music from there would probably be fitting
Huh, we say the same with "boba" but it's a rude word for women in general, "when the *woman* falls out it's lighter for the carriage" has a very different message :D
Supermamytės ( super mamas in demunitive)
I think that the name was given due to the forum 'super mama' (super momma) where bunch of helicopter mommas clicked and started various treads on child rearing / parenting /medicating naturally /etc

Yeah
It's wild
Vienas šimtas vienas, vienas šimtas du, vienas šimtas trys

How is it Germanized
if you would count or say numbers in German, or similar to German, that would count as Germanized
I totally forgot that you started using the Czech language properly, only recently
I would say you WERE Germanized, but got your Czech pride back
Yeah, but you speak the Slavic language
Which sounds a bit like Russian/Polish/Slovakian/Croatian/etc
It's not like when you speak everyone thinks that you Germanized Czechs
It just sounds Slavic, not germanic at
STEM, medicine
Main and highest paid professions are (lowest to highest paid:
Engineer
Doctor
IT (any field)
Freshly cooked starting wage is about 900/m, well above national average
Within 5 years ine can expect to earn 1300-1600 eur/m on average
With such wages one can afford to loan for a house, a new car and to travel at least once a year
Mathematicians (especially statistics, data) can earn as much if not more i guess
I've read an article in Lithuanian about a scholar, former editor, then managing director of a literary magazine, who left his stressful and thankless job in literature and management, and went to trade school to train as a welder
He got some practice on a low-paid internship, developed his skills,  and now has inner peace, a job he enjoys with people he likes, and easy employment prospects with good pay
The way he puts it, walk up to any construction site, find the manager, ask him if he needs welders, put down a few seams to show what you can do, and you're hired
There are many museums, but there's a lot of competition to get positions in them, and even in Germany they're not really paying a decent wage
For a senior software engineer (~8 years of experience) the average is around 3000€ per month net, but there are many opportunities to earn significantly more by working remotely
that's pretty popular here too
Nobody does
No, but again it's probably possible to buy it here
Oh God the last time I used these was in elementary school
Just that picture brings back memories
Electric boogaloo
I feel like our local type of [kebabs] is the staple drunk food here
McDonald's or Hesburger (a similar burger chain with more mayo) would be another popular choice, since not that many other places are open at night
I don't even know what I would choose, as I feel like it's been several years since I've been in this kind of situation
I guess it's a combination of the pandemic and everyone turning 30 around me and having kids, hence bar meetups switched to walks in the park
McDonald's is not a messy food
I rather go to see my old Turkish friends, as they know some kind of secret recipes to make gorgeous, tasty as heaven kebabs
God bless Turkey for its kebabs and decent barbers
Gediminas tower obviously
Even though it defines the capital more than the whole country
Otherwise it just could be the houndreds of pretty churches
Definitely Gediminas Castle
tower
Other than that, only two come in mind, the TV tower and Trakai castle (have fun, this one's an actual castle
The Gediminas Castle
It's what's left of what used to be a pretty big castle in Vilnius
For Lithuania it would be [Gedimino bokštas ]
I agree with [Gediminas tower] more so defining the capital
The one for the whole country would be [Trakai castle] for me
The first thing that I think of when remembering Riga is the [House of the Blackheads] But maybe it's not common to think of it as a defining building, I just really liked it
I have never seen a bike like a Christiana one

Now majority of Cyprus is controlled by RoC government, so it is free now as well

6 nanoseconds
I'd say if things start heating up towards that date, don't listen to people who tell you not to celebrate prematurely, because you might just miss it entirely
Basically the same for all three of the Baltics
~30% of Lithuania was also occupied during interbellum and we count it as free here
I don't see legit reason why occupation of Northern Cyprus makes whole Cyprus as not 'free'.
Oh, yeah, forgot about that

None
My hill is human rights and ecology thankfully countries in European union ensures that everyone is treated equally (or -ish, I know that there is knicks and hickups but we are trying) and we try to lessen our impact on the planet
Nope, not even a short mention anywhere
Brazil is occasionally mentioned, but I guess in this case New Zealand overshadowed it
Laws here sound like they are in most states in usa, but are actually enforced and there is no gun cult
Note: most gun owners and enthusiasts military and police personel, former or still active
It makes sense cause they automatically have gun permits, have to live by higher moral standards, are extremely trusted by the public
To own a gun: psychological evaluation, passed gun use training, guaranteed place to store
Only pistols and non-automatic guns are allowed
Guns must be stored in a metal or specialized safe
Guns are only allowed to be carried consealed
Displaying gun will get you arrested
You can only show your gun if you are in a dangerous situation and are willing to use it
Shooting is only legal in self defense or defense of others, OR in shooting ranges (military and police personel can use their respective facilities, there are few private ranges too)
Every gun is etched, inspected and approved by lithuanian gun foundry, a gun is registered, tied to the owner
Buying bullets is also registered i think
Procedures are the same for everyone
Self defense is logical
Threat of extreme harm or death - blast away
Shooting with intention to kill is illegal
Though if a person is shot without intention to kill but still dies as a result - its his own fault
I heard of one instance when a drunk person (mildly drunk) shot a robber
A court was held but he was justified, because person's right to self defense is above the law forbidding drunken carry and use of weapons
The self-defence laws in Lithuania differ depending whether you’re  protecting your property or yourself in public
Certain items, like clubs are legal to have on your property, but you can’t have them on you or in your car if you or your vehicle are not on your property, if caught the items will be confiscated and you will be prosecuted accordingly
All you can really have on your person in public without having a special license is pepper spray
Edit: also as far as I know, it is possible to carry a concealed weapon if you have a specific licence for that, but for example if you have the gun in your car with you, it has to be out of reach, so if you’re driving, you can’t have it in the glovebox, it should be in the boot, to reduce spontaneous use
And if you have a gun in your home it has to be in a safe etc etc
The LGF (Lietuvos Ginklų Fondas - Lithuanian Weaponry Fund) was closed/reorganized in 2020
They don't sell weapons to the public or register guns anymore, now any gun store can sell all legal firearms to the public and do the same functions
Side note, carrying while below a certain amount of promiles/BAC is still legal but its pretty low
Then once you go above that limit its a fine, and once you go further and further beyond the limit the punishments become more serious
Also this might be the court case you are thinking of:  A man shot 4 unarmed attackers while not sober, one of them died, and it was ruled justified self defense
> Pažymeta, kad neblaivus asmuo nepraranda teises gintis
and
> Teismas pažymi, kad asmuo turi teise i butinaja ginti
Šia teise jis gali igyvendinti neatsižvelgdamas i tai, ar galejo išvengti kesinimosi arba kreiptis pagalbos i kitus asmenis ar valdžios institucijas
N. M. gindamasis nuo pavojingo kesinimosi neperženge butinosios ginties ribu, todel, remianti BK 28 str
nuostatomis, jis neturi atsakyti pagal baudžiamaji istatyma
Definitely not true, the law allows you to carry a concealed firearm on your body for the purpose of self-defense
If you have the permit you may have it on your body, for example in a holster hidden from view, as you drive
You may also have it loaded and ready for self-defense while at home - depending on your living arrangements
If you live alone for example, you can your pistol in your nightstand in case of a home invasion
If you have kids or a partner then a different setup would probably be better
But you absolutely can have a firearm on you for the purpose of self defense
Here is a case I linked elsewhere on this thread:  A man shot 4 unarmed attackers while not sober, one of them died, and it was ruled justified self defense
>  Pažymeta, kad neblaivus asmuo nepraranda teises gintis
and
>  Teismas pažymi, kad asmuo turi teise i butinaja ginti
Šia teise jis gali igyvendinti neatsižvelgdamas i tai, ar galejo išvengti kesinimosi arba kreiptis pagalbos i kitus asmenis ar valdžios institucijas
N. M. gindamasis nuo pavojingo kesinimosi neperženge butinosios ginties ribu, todel, remianti BK 28 str
nuostatomis, jis neturi atsakyti pagal baudžiamaji istatyma
I didn’t state anywhere that there is no legal way to have a gun on your person now, did I.
Of course you can have a gun for self-defence, but it is limited to licence holders only, not every looney that spontaneously decides to get one in a Walmart
Having any type of weapon without a licence is highly illegal, be it a gun or a metal club
Even a metal BB gun isn’t allowed without a licence, having a kitchen knife in your pocket without good reason can too get you arrested
The only thing you can carry for self-defence without a specific license is pepper spray
Now how easy it is to get a licence, is another matter, technically, you need to undergo various tests, a medical examination, a psychiatric assessment, but from the gossip it seams pretty easy to achieve
All in all, the vast majority of people that actually have licences to have guns seem to be hunters
However, I might not be the best intel on this, as  getting attacked in public or on my property is not something I worry about
It's not hard at all in Lithuania and gun laws have been progressively relaxed since 1996/1997
Anyone with a clean record can take a class and pass it and get the permit
Usually it takes a month or two, but only a week of actually doing stuff like attending the class a few times a week, taking the test, going to your doctor, and so on
The rest is waiting as the police can take up to 30 days to issue your permit once you submit all your information
I don't think getting attacked in public or private in Lithuania is likely either, but I've seen the pictures from January 13th, 1991
For our international friends thats when Soviet soldiers and tanked murdered unarmed Lithuanian citizens
To those that think it could never happen again, look at eastern Ukraine and Crimea
Have you ever thought about what you would do if anything were to happen again
Of course I don't think a pistol is going to do much against a tank
But it's better than nothing for a civilian trying to escape a warzone, like Ukraine
Also, Lithuania has about 100k gun owners and about 30k are hunters, and 30k are self defense permit holders, the others would fall into other categories like sport shooting and so on
Here is a Lithuanian gun store's page with more info:
There is regular police and MP
Police does police stuff and MP does the same just with military/soldier related stuff
When times are tough (now), MP works as backup police force, along with volunteer military force and military guild/volunteers "šauliai"
When police need backup for patroling, etc, the Public Security Force (gendarmerie in everything, but not the name) assist them
They are located only in largest cities though, and the countryside only sees the police
Šauliai can be translated to paramilitary or militia, and volunteer military force is an equivalent of American National Guard
We just skip a bunch, we learn the medieval times where we were a superpower in Europe (~1300) and the we just jump straight to The occupational years courtesy of Russia and then back to the first spoken Lithuanian words
It’s really confusing ._.
A lot of people mated together to produce more people
You finish High-school (Abitura) when you're 18-19, and do uni afterwards
Some people have a gap year, others have to do military service since we have mandatory conscription
In Lithuania there are 12 years, if you started school at the age of 6 you finish the year you turn 18 + there is mandatory year of kindergarten before school where you learn to read
Panevėžys = pane (an archaic way of saying 'Pone' = sir) + vėžys (crayfish)
The legend goes, that a woman was washing her clothes in the river when a crayfish gripped onto her hand
She got scared, saw a man walking by and started screaming 'PANE, VĖŽYS
' and that's how the name came to be
Well at least that's the legend, the name actually just comes from the river Nevėžis which the city is situated on
I live in Punskas
The name is derived from the lake Punia in this town and Punia is derived from Pūna, which means "(that thing) is rotting".
That's such a weird one

Fuel running out while driving somewhere far away

Also lots of petrol stations all over the place
Getting lost in a forest is somewhat understandable, we have some big forests, but then most of them have 4G reception
As it recently turned out, we had a secret CIA prison in Lithuania, right next to the capital city
The building used to be a horse riding school with a huge indoor riding arena, so nobody really suspected various cars and trucks coming and going
I've driven all the way across Czech Republic and back a couple weeks ago, I'd say your highways are pretty good
Smaller roads suck, but still not too bad
One Lithuanian truck driver has a youtube channel, posts daily videos about his work
In the last season he got to drive from Lisbon to Skarsvåg (the northernmost town in Norway) and back, several times
It was quite interesting
You actually have quite a few marching bands, they're just not as popular as in the US
I used to play in a band in Lithuania, we've traveled around Europe to various orchestra events, including a few in Poland
Obviously they're nowhere near as popular as in the US, though
He could say "kilometres" but then americans would complain :)
So it is indeed a get out of jail card for those rich enough
Someone with no money couldn't pay the bail and wait for the trial out of jail
Here we use various methods to make sure that they don't get away
Some will be kept in jail, if they have a history of running away or if their crime is particularly serious
In some cases the person's passport will be taken, a written promise to not leave could be signed
Some are placed under house arrest, so they can stay at home but can't leave
Sometimes it's just a curfew, where they must return home before 10pm or whatever and check in
In some cases they must come to the police office to check in every day
Normally a guarantor is needed, if the person wants to stay out of jail until the trial
It's usually the suspect's parent, friend or spouse
The guarantor is prosecuted if the suspect runs away
What about drug dealers, thieves and such, who have a lot of unaccounted income
Oh great, so you can go in debt too
Oh yes they would
(In my experience
) I lived in Barcelona for years
Learned castillano, spoke it daily
It wasn’t good enough for many Catalans
They would still speak to me in Catalan and refuse to speak Spanish
Not all but some
I think someone here mentioned that Latvian bottles work in Lithuania even though they don't (?) have a deposit system, lol
Makes sense if the barcodes match
IIRC Apple chooses to pay fines than rather change their chargers
Also USB-C and USB micro are different
[Potato - Meat dumplings] known as Cepleinai
It's really fatty but damn good
You can only have one and be full
Fun fact is that the name derives from the word Cepelinas(Zeppelin), becouse of their shape
Well, if a dumpling is just dough wrapped around a filling, then our “Kibinai” should be good
It’s just meat, covered by a THICC layer of dough and cooked, when you bite in, all of the meat juices come out
This is traditionally served with some kind of vegetable broth
Though you can eat it alone
Apart from cepelinai which were mentioned, we also have virtinukai (pierogi) and koldūnai (pelmeni)
Can't beat some good virtinukai with porcini mushroom and onion filling
Cepelinai - if you ever go to Lithuania, go to a traditional food restaraunt and try it
on an aesthetic level, I would
Simply because I like designs that are in unison
Otherwise, I've no idea
Since that's a lot of political implications and I'm wholeheartedly unqualified to make a judgement
I don't mind to be honest
I'm certain some nationalistic people will scream "BUT MUH IDENTITY
" when in reality no one really cares
Lithuanian one
It is much more cool to have a passport that only 3 million people have, not 513 million
Passport is a symbol of sovereignity, EU is not a country and EU citizenship is only complimentary to national one
Actually no Soviet Block countries were called 'Republic of X'.
aand Ireland is 'Republic of Ireland'.
Yeah, but there were no 'Republics of X' in the Eastern block and plenty of Western democracies like Republic of Austria, Republic of Cyprus, Republic of Finland, or Republic of Malta
Our prime minister and the whole parliament
Edit: Lithuania
The rock paper scissors game
In Lithuania instead of rock we use a well
Scissors get thrown in it and with paper you cover the well
Does your country also use other things when playing this game
Maybe you don’t even have this game
What I'm also curious about is why we Lithuanians say *vaskiči* (at least in my neighborhood) when playing the game, instead of *šulinys, popierius, žirklės* ('well, paper, scissors')
It doesn't mean anything in Lithuanian, so I always thought maybe it comes from Russian or Polish, but I'm not sure since I don't speak either
Putin once said that there are only 1 million of Lithuanians and that million is already leaving the country
He said that we're a Balkan country and we're responsible for the Yugoslavian wars
I'm sure you know who said it
Oh god that shitshow with children
Norway doesn't let people treat children like garbage
KIDNAPPERS REEEEEEEEEE
I'm ashamed
And then one day you'll check out Japanese engineering
They just don't break down, so the repair prices don't matter
No, because the country is the Lithuanian nation state
Lithuanian citizens can vote in presidential, parliamentary, EP, elections and referenda no matter where they live
By the way, 2020 Lithuanian general election even had a diaspora electoral district which was won by the leader of liberal party
All residents regardless of citizenship can vote in municipal elections and I support expanding their powers
Democracy is about representing publics voice
If one doesnt live there, why would one want to be represented in things irrelevant in ones life
Permanent residents, who are legal and adapted to culture, language and are functional members of society must be able to vote
Emigrants, if they live away for more than 1 full term of parliament, should not be able to vote
I don't know much since I didn't live in that period of time, but the one thing that stuck to me the most is the stealing and corruption
For example, if you were to steal from your job, that'd be considered normal
Also, if you wanted to get better care form doctors you had to slip them some money, it still happens sometimes
I speak 3 language (Lithuanian, English, Russian) yet as a waitress I had to resort to lots of handsigns and drawing pictures (if I am a tourist I usually just use phone to find pictures or Google translate stuff)
Especially with polish folk because their language is waaay different than Russian and not many realises that
However if all involved parties seeks understanding communication is indeed possible
Speaking only about LT/PL and LT/LV borders:
Yes, it is painless
I have never been stopped on these borders
There are some old crossings with checkpoint remnants - there are some speed limits, but overall there are no slowing down to 30 km/h.
It has been open since 2007 and I hasn't changed much, only some more cross-border roads have been reconstructed or built
Sometimes there are patrols of border officers on major road crossings, usually for ambushing some people traffickers or other criminals
It eases travelling a lot  – there's no point in having border controls inside of EU
We still have leftover border control buildings from soviet times, so you would see that you're crossing the border(differently from lets say France-Belgium, where in the middle of the city there is just a drawn line for people to know and thats it)
But those buildings now are mainly abandoned, only few are used for border police to do bigger bus and import/export checks
And it is a slowing down zone and you might get pulled over if you look suspicious

23C is warm gold ideal
Old houses that use coal or wood heaters temperature cannot be controlled very well, and house can heat up to 26C.
New houses usually run on "eco" and keep temp around 21-23C. Enough for walking in shorts, barefoot and tshirt
Nope, Moldova is the name of the region of Romania and the separate country, Moldavia is the Latinized name of said region and the former official name of said country
I live in the capital, Vilnius
It's not an easy question to answer, since my experiences might not reflect the situation objectively
But personally while I'm a woman and I feel better walking alone in daylight than nighttime by default, I've never been hurt, robbed or talked to by someone who seemed dangerous at night
Maybe a few drunks or a group of guys making me uncomfortable by asking for my number and wanting to know if I have a boyfriend, but that normally happens in daytime
My female friends have had the same experience, and I've never known anyone personally who got robbed
However, I know several men and one woman who got beaten up or with whom others wanted to start a fight, but I don't think it's related to the time of the day
All of these people I know either were metalheads, punks, or had longer hair (as guys)
Although to be fair I haven't heard of anything like that in the last 10 years
Either times are changing, or it's because my friends are turning 30 and don't look that much out of the ordinary anymore
Other groups of people that I've heard getting beaten up are black people and openly gay guys
The country is still pretty backwards when it comes to respecting those who are different than the majority
600k is a town in Germany
We have some that are very similar(basically the same) to other instruments that our neighbours have (like [kanklės] or [skudučiai] but the only instrument that is really unique to Lithuania is probably [skrabalai]

It's called kanklės

My boyfriend is Dutch and I'm Lithuanian
There aren't any huge cultural differences, but there have been some things I noticed about the Dutch:
* They like to freeze their bread
I like nice bread so I thought I could never do this, but I admit to starting doing it while I was living in NL
Now that I'm back in LT though I don't do it anymore, I can have my favourite bread again, I can't freeze it
* They can be very direct, while we might leave some things unsaid
There was a lot to learn for the both of us while learning to communicate in the relationship due to this, but it also helped us grow
I really appreciate the directness in a lot of cases, but sometimes it might feel a little rude to someone from a more indirect/reserved culture
Just like indirectness probably feels insincere to the Dutch
Any stereotype that assumes something is universally true in the continent is highly likely to be bullshit
But that's what some/lots of Eastern Europeans say

A roller coaster, designed to kill it's passengers, called the [Euthanasia Coaster]
Edit: it's actually a hypothetical design with a scale model but it got a lot of attention from the media for it's concept of ending lives
The euthanasia coaster
Not well known, but it's all I can think of
It is a roller coaster designed by Julionas Urbonas that is designed to kill people without damaging the roller coaster itself
There's a video about it
>fully automatic rifle
First fully automatic rifle was invented by the Italians
What you did was invent the first succesful assault rifle in StG-44 and the first succesful submachine gun in MP 18
Bro, E = mc^2 is not an invention, it's a discovery
It's like saying Newton invented apples falling from trees
[Relevant scene from the Sopranos]
I didn't say machine-gun I said sub-machine gun, which is a bit of misnomer
I like the german term maschinenpistole a lot better, which is descriptive, because a submachine gun is a gun that is capable of shooting pistol caliber bullets in full auto
The difference between a fully automatic rifle(AKA battle rifle) and an assault rifle are mainly in the caliber(assault rifles use a smaller caliber) and thus their roles in combat
Pretty much all of the most famous automatic rifles(AK, AR-15 and various others) are assault rifles
AK-47 was actually heavily influenced by the StG-44
Not necessarily
I would make the distinction that "discoveries" are something that independently exist whether their "discoverers" are there or not, i.e something that is ''natural''. Hydrogen is made of a proton and an electron independently whether something is there to ''observe'' them or to ''find'' them as such
Invention has an ''unnatural'' connotation to it, i.e it has an element of chance
Could the spoon be ''discovered'' by some aliens in a far away galaxy
Sure, but it's not a certainty
What would the chance be for a proton and attracted to an electron via the coulomb force if noone in the universe found out this relationship
100%.
What algorithm are we talking about here
If you misspoke and meant  ''formula'' then it's also false
He discovered that the inertia of an object is directly proportional to its energy content, with the proportionality factor being 1/c^2, where c is the speed of light
His genious was in discovering the relationship, not the formula(although he did that by manipulating other relationships)
Anyone at least somewhat compentent in highschool physics could write down the formula if he knew the relationship
Probably the most well known
I was referring more to the concept of the "assault weapon" using an intermediary rifle cartridge
Quotes from wikipedia: "On 15 July 1943, an earlier model of the Sturmgewehr was demonstrated before the People's Commissariat of Arms of the USSR
[14] The Soviets were impressed with the weapon and immediately set about developing an intermediate caliber fully automatic rifle of their own,[10][11] to replace the PPSh-41 submachine guns and outdated Mosin–Nagant bolt-action rifles that armed most of the Soviet Army
[15]"
and
"The AK-47 is best described as a hybrid of previous rifle technology innovations
"Kalashnikov decided to design an automatic rifle combining the best features of the American M1 and the German StG 44
"[21] Kalashnikov's team had access to these weapons and had no need to "reinvent the wheel"."
Could be used as both I guess
[FG-42] is also a good example
Aweful thing
Bro that was the height of german weapons engineering and miles ahead from anything everyone else had
Its downfall was that it was too expensive, too complicated and wehrmacht didn't really need it
It was only used by luftwaffe paratroopers(fallschirmjäger)
Yes, garlic sauce and (extra) ketchup is usually served alongside the pizza in most places, and many people make use of both
Mmmm garlic sauce is the best
pizza with ketchup
yes
No, there's usually tomato sauce, my mistake
Ketchup is more expensive than a tube of concentrated tomato paste and a packet of dry basil
That is literally healthier and more flavorsome than ketchup
There are also canned tomatoes with basil, that are much cheaper than ketchup
Use of ketchup is a matter of culinary ignorance
Nothing else
Brother latvian folk song:

The fact that a lot of jewish people, that stemmed from israel, came back to israel after WW2, could also be impactful culturally
I said the jews that *stemmed* from israel came back
They might've migrated, had children, maybe even grand children and returned with their entire families
Besides, you know what I mean
Lots of jewish people returned to israel after WW2
K, dude
It doesn't change anything
A lot of jews *went to* israel if you want to cling to the exact phrasing, after WW2
Did a cultural change happen
Yes
Did they return
Did they go there
Yes
Would it affect the cultural change, if they returned, not went back, after living a few hundred years in europe
Doesn't matter, wheter they returned, or went there
Either way, a cultural change would've happened
We're not talking about how, or which culture change happened, but if it happened and the answer is yes, it did
Soviet aggression of 1991 January
We had already declared independence, but Gorbachev despised that idea and sent Soviet troops to our capital Vilnius to take over the TV tower and parliament
On the night of January 12th-13th, they started with the TV tower takeover
Thousands of unarmed civilians gathered around it and basically formed a human barricade
The Soviets didn't care and either crushed people with tanks/shot at completely unarmed people just to get through
14 deaths and a few hundred severe injuries later, they ended up taking it over
Unmarried lmao
Gal labiau unarmed
Motherfucking autocorrect :DDDD
Chicken Kiev here is super popular in cafeterias, probably can order it in most
Sounds like these came from russians
We have these as well, but only people who thoroughly follow superstitions are russians :)

I am so confused right now
Folders, colors
what
You use folders
We don't have folders and textbooks are random colors (preferably blank colors, bought from MAXIMA)
Because all textbooks looked the same, I started writing subject names on upper textbook part, so I wouldn't have to take it all out just to read the subject name in small text
No we don't I just wrote colours that I would use if we used folders lmao
It has a bunch of dumbass politicians who keep fucking up our country
Definitely Klaipėda city, Western Lithuania in general also
I live in the capital, Vilnius
It doesn't stay that cold all winter here, but it's not unusual to get a couple of weeks of -20°C. Although even in those periods -20°C and colder is usually night or early morning time temperature, in the day it's more often a few degrees warmer
It all depends on the wind really
If it's -20°C and no wind it's not bad, but if it's windy and -13°C I just wanna stay home
If I drive somewhere from door to door I might not wear extra layers, just jeans, t-shirt, hoodie, scarf and a coat, but it's one of those long warm puffer coats, with feathers inside
If I'm walking somewhere for more than 5 minutes I'll wear thick tights under my jeans or wear two pairs of pants
I also always wear leather winter shoes with fur on the inside or mountain shoes
Hat or hood is necessary, gloves as well, unless maybe if you're gonna keep your hands in your coat pockets at all times
Stuff runs more or less normally, but school might get cancelled (before the pandemic)
At least 10+ years ago kids in elementary school were able to stay home if it's -20°C and older kids could do so if it's -25°C.
I don't know much about cars, but mine doesn't have a problem starting up
It's more so snow that I have trouble with
It's good to have an all-wheel drive car, and mine is only 2-wheel (I hope I'm using the right terminology), so I get stuck navigating apartment building parking lots sometimes and have to be pushed
Lithuania here
I work in an international company, but our lithuanian team still writes everything in english
The problem with lithuanian terms is that most of the times they sound very stupid and a lot of the terms dont even have translations
CS students especially feel this when writing their graduation papers
We also tend to "lithuanize" some words from English to make it sound legit in a Lithuanian sentence
For instance the word "Paste it" (copy/paste) in lithuanian is "įklijuok", but programmers tend to say "įpasteink" like "į-PASTE-ink", which is not a real word, but we understand its meaning (the last part might have been off topic, but i thought it was interesting :))
English
If code has both English and another language then it doesn't make sense
It's probably the most competitive in terms of price, and it's generally viewed as a better employer than other chains
Limited brands (you can't find some that you can find in other supermarkets) still it is the best option when comparing prices and the quality
I mean the quality is great
I shop almost all groceries there and only a few products that I buy elsewhere (dairy products, cleaning supplies, beer and some other)
People used to joke about it when it just came to Lithuania, but it is all over now I think
I myself didn't like Lidl at start because I could not find the groceries I am used to buying
It's cheaper and people like Lidl
Of course, though it's rarer to see that between teenagers after puberty kicks in
I myself had a lot of girl friends when I was a boy
You would just basically befriend everyone who was hanging out in the yard of your apartment block, and there were a lot of kids there
We also have a strong bond with all our classmates, don't know how it is in other countries, but we basically stay in the same class with the same people from the age of 6 to 18, so naturally, they become sort of like your family
When puberty kicks in though, it gets more complicated
You start seeing them as more than just another human being, you start getting attracted to them, or they may start getting attracted to you, and even if both sides aren't interested in each other that way, there will always be annoying pricks that start spreading gossip that you're dating this girl if you hang out with her
Things change again when the teenage years are over and you become more mature
Then it's very common to have friends of all genders and nobody bats an eye
"Alio, klausau" "Hello, (I'm) listening". Alio isn't an exact translation of the word Hello, just more of Allo (I don't know if it's ana ctual word, sorry)
Sometimes there's no "Alio", sometimes just "Alio".
the name was first mentioned in 1009
Lithuania is one of the oldest countries being first know about somewhere in 1009
Most people here are paractical and own estate cars or suv
Those can fit most large purchases
Hardware stores:
Every time you buy or order online, there is an option to have the items delivered to you
You can choose between courier company and the shop itself
If the total price of purchase is about at least 100 eur, delivery will likely be free
Furniture shops:
Delivery always included unless stated otherwise
Delivery includes getting the piece into the living space
Costs about 6 eur per 1 building level required to lift up, delivery itself is free
Assembly is often recommended, some times free
If all that doesnt suffice: you can rent a loading van, and most gas stations offer trailer rental
Or theres always that one friend of a friend who knows, does or has the stuff that you desperately need and somehow cooperate together to get it done for smth symbolic like a bottle or just a thank you
I've never had to transport anything so big that it wouldn't fit in the back of my car with the seats down, but my first choice would probably be using a carsharing service
They have some vans parked at popular DIY/furniture shops, you can use an app to open the car doors and to pay for using it
> From a cost perspective it is much cheaper to just rent a van whenever you need to transport something bulky yourself
This is entirely based on your circumstances and where you live and how you live
Really
She never said that to me :(
Home economics lessons were(still are
) Gendered in Lithuania, so it's mainly girls who learn to cook (while boys learn wood carving and other useless things)
Some schools let you choose the subject you're placed in (and that's usually followed by bullying if you choose the "wrong" class for your gender, sometimes even by the staff)
Yeah
Usually half of the class goes off to woodworking classes, the other half to cooking
When the second half of the school year comes, the groups switch places
I really liked these classes just because of how creative you can get with your projects
And, in case of the cooking classes, you can eat them afterwards
Brilliant
Are religion classes mandatory in Poland or something
Ah, so they're not really mandatory if your family isn't from the believer side
That's neat
Similar to Lithuania, here you can choose either religion (Catholicism) or ethics-psychology lessons
They have right to do so, but it would be nice for them to learn it
they should know the basics, but lithuanian is pretty damn hard, even for a native speaker so i understand them
I have yet to see such person
Hello
Nice to meet you
I prefer english language to lithuanian
Flair checks out
But i never saw you so my argument still stands
My parents are really good friends with our Russian neighbours :)
My parents have been living in their apartment building for 30 years and so have most of their neighbors, so they know each other and their names
They regularly chat with a few of them and have been on a skiing trip with one,  but I wouldn't say that they're good friends with any of the neighbors, nor do they hang out regularly
There are 20 apartments in their entrance so I think it kinda makes sense to get to know everyone at least slightly over 30 years
Me on the other hand, I've been in my building for a couple of years and I don't know anyone except my childhood friend's parents
The building has something like 80 apartments so it's hard to know everyone, but people do say 'good morning' in the elevator if they're in a good mood
There are a few very friendly neighbors who start small talk
When I lived in flats [Khrushchyovkas] I knew some neighbors just because we went trick or treating in February (a tradition, and easy, but risky way to get some money and treats)
When I moved to house, I started to know neighbors, but less than flats
Hmmmmmmmmmmm
Mayyyyyyyybe
what's a commute
15min walk or 3min on a bus
I prefer walking though
k I google searched it
I wasn't sarcastic tho
Wolfgang just sounds really cool to me
Also because Mozart is one of my favourite composers
Leyla, Athena, Cassandra, Mark, Nyx
All of them are really strong and not related to plants or hope (pretty common theme in my country
Some of the scientists says, that one of the most popular name is literally a shortened form of "bread")
I like the shortened version of the female russian name Tatjana (Tanya)
When it comes to male names I like both german Adolf and old greek Astolfo
Fun fact about the name Audra - when it's a given name, it changes inflection
It's also an old French name
You may have heard the more popular name Audrey, comes from the French Audra
Not country, but city
We (Memel) defended ourselves with throwing cheese at swedish
Grand duke of GDL also *claimed* the title of Russia (Unitors of Rus' lands)
Contemporary Republic of Lithuania was established not in 1990, but on 16th February, 1918
After the Soviet occupation in 1940, many Lithuanian embassies kept on working, but most of them were eventually closed by Nazis or after the Soviet pressure
However, embassies in the USA, UK, France and the Holly See kept working without interruptions until restoration of independence in 1990
Lithuanian guerrillas who fought against Soviets are considered legit military veterans these days
Poland-Lithuania ;)
I know Samogitian (technically a dialect, but also has a collection of people who want it to be classified as a language) and the Samogitian wiki is really oddly political sometimes, for example the entry about the falklands basically used to say that it's rightful argentinian land under British occupation, even uses the Spanish name for the island
It's really odd
Lithuanian in famous people youtube vids
Muon keista buva sužinuot kad žėmaitiu vėkėpedėjė yr tuoke
Nuors žėmaitiu vėkėpedėjė yr gan sens projekts pasiruodo
(Žemaičių suprantu, bet žemaičiuoju tragiškai
no obviously not, hot takes on wikipedia are usually edited out immediately, but due to the small number of speakers that take was there for a while
this was like half a decade ago, you've got the memory of an elephant
no, I checked the article before I commented, it was fine
My god he did change it :D, now it says that the falklands are to the east of Britain
> It was
> i rītus nū Argentėnas, prīgol Britanėjē
and it should remain that, the political comments in the article I mentioned was from years ago, not the current entry :D
> (e: I moved (renamed) it to Falklanda salas and reordered the lede)
that's more reasonable since most people would know it by it's english name
There's another slight hint of politics, it refers to the 2 main islands by their spanish names (but I can't be bothered to look up their english equivalents, or at least I'm assuming that "Soledada" and "Gran Malvėnas" aren't english)
Another issue it the sources, the first source is literally a webpage from argentinian military (it's titled as "why the Islas Malvinas should belong to Argentina")
There's probably more issues, I'd fix them I cared enough (or knew how to edit wiki pages)
dude, I only know how to read Samogitian, I don't know how to spell it
They don't teach that in school
> Malvėnū salas sosided ėš 2 dėdliū salū (Soledada ėr Gran Malvėnas) ė tepuogė da aple 700 salieliu
Falklandū salas sosided ėš 2 dėdliū salū ė tepuogė da aple 700 salieliu
you can change it to that and it'd be correct, but that's as far as my knowledge of samogitian grammar goes
Plus waiters in Bavarian-themed pubs
I've seen Lederhosen within 300 metres from the Urania clock on Alexanderplatz
Never knew this concert existed
Don't think anyone's watching it here
That's quite funny actually, how is that piece called
Ahhhhh has everyone seen the [King Edward chair] Such an amazing accomplishment
What's the context
Man, I WAS wondering why Bayern is spelled like that
Oh I still remember learning about him in school and how influential "Konrad Wallenros" was to the patriotism of Lithuanians
He was a true national treasure for both countries
That is most certainly true, but the formula *gente lithuanus, natione polonus* I think defines his identity quite well
Milk and kefir or buttermilk in bags
Apparently idea of milk in bag is crazy for rest of the west world (exept Canada)
Its a thing in Lithuania
My Dutch boyfriend recently moved in to my place in Lithuania
He brought his toilet birthday calendar among other things and that was the first thing I hung so he would feel at home
I've never seen that anywhere else
It's a useful tradition, only it's a bit weird that it's in the toilet, but I guess that's a place where you will surely notice and look at it since you have a minute to spare
In Baltics its super popular
I'm still not sure I understand how is it different, can you try to explain
Apple cheese
It's a very weird and unique form of something apple marmalade-like
The apples are covered in honey or sugar and cooked for 6-8 hours
After that additives like quince fruit, cherries, or nuts are added
Then, the apples are put into a cheesecloth, dried and pressed in about a 6 week long process
It's long and complicated, but the result is sooo worth it
It's even a part of lithuanian culinary heritage
There is an interesting story how he tried to pass up for a noble by changing his van to a von
Didn't really work well for him and I think from that point on he quite despised nobility
His family was from Flanders I think, so technically Belgian
Not as far as I know
We do have Glühwein
Inga Valinskienė. Singer, actor, businesswoman
Wife of Lithuania's biggest entertainment business shark Arunas Valinskas (almost as big, wealthy and important as any east european oligarch, but doesnt do shady stuff)
Her voice is very deep and adds much to her looks/height
She also voices S rated movies
Ramūnas Karbauskis, the head of the ruling 'Peasant' party
Yup, we call it 'karštas sumuštinis' which translates into 'hot sandwich' and we make them usually in those special kitchen appliances (and sometimes in owens or pans, depending on what crunchiness you want to achieve, but if it's in a pan we call it a Parisian hot sandwich) and put anything we like in them, although the cheese is a must, because it's not a proper hot sandwich without it
Great achievements:
First in covid
Used to be first in suicide
We, along with Poles, probably made UK to decide to leave the EU
You're welcome
Krašto apsaugos ministerija, litterally the 'Land Security Ministry'. Official English name is 'Ministry of National Defence'.
Not a fan of watching basketball games
Like playing though
I don't care about basketball
I hate basketball
I've lost interest in basketball a long time ago
I hate šaltibarščiai
I hate varškė, kefir, grietinė, yoghurt (just milk products other than milk itself, butter and cheess)
I don't hate Poles
...THAT much
[On purpose
Aw, poor guy
"Ramus, kaip belgas"
Calm like Belgian (a person from Belgium, I don't really know how you call yourself as the only Belgians I ever talked referred to themselves as Dutch
In Lithuanian we say "ramus kaip belgas" -- "calm as a Belgian".  I've heard recently, though, that this saying refers to some animal breed rather than nationality
Do you just let them sleep in the canals
The ones to find a bike and cycle out of it are deemed worthy to keep
Užgavėnės.
It's a holiday, where skinny guy - kanapinis (Cannabis) fights a fat guy - lašininis (bacon/lard)
Skinny guy wins because fat guy represents the ending of lazy and workless winter
During the holiday, some kind of a straw woman is burned and kids pretend to be Gypsies and knock on doors asking for "pancakes, cocoa or money".
It's like Lithuanian Halloween
One of our stand-up comedians even did [a bit] about how hard it is to explain Užgavėnės to foreigners
Hemp-man is said on wiki, but it's more like cannabian (made out of cannabis or hemp)
Oh wow what a great guy
To note his wonderful contribution to society I will tattoo his name
After all we should remember heroes
Not  a single shot was fired while beeing occupied by ussr
Same here
Lithuanian governement argued for accepting all the Soviet demands and not resisting in line for not to destroy economy get people repressed and killed
Actually Soviet regime made Lithuanian economy pretty stagnant (compared to capitalist Europe) and deported+killed hundreds of thousands of people
We had our anti-Soviet war too late, not like Finns
Something simillar with President Brazauskas and Latvians happened in 1990s here
Vilnius and Kaunas
You would be surprised what 5 years can do
And its been like that for at least 15 years now
Tabletop gaming, DnD, Warhammer and other geek shit
"Best way to get into D&D is just go to your local gaming or comic book store and -" nope, those don't exist
Just tiny tabletop game stores with family games
"It's real easy, just find a friend who has a D&D group and ask to join, everyone has one" - virtually nobody I've known in real life has even the concept of what a tabletop RPG is, much less actually witnessed a physical board
So I'm just painting minis by my own and only playing RPGs in video game form
here you go
I heard there are pubs/clubs that have tabletop game evenings, some might allow DnD
Would love to try it out at some point
I've dabbled with some online friends, but it feels clunky
And really, there's better games if I'm playing on a computer
I just want the actual experience I guess
There could be, but I'm not sure how to search like you said
If there are circles, I'm not adjacent to any of them
Google
You can find some forums with last posts dating years back
Facebook
I find one "club" that has opening hours of 3hr once a week with the last post being a year old about them selling off their whole stock
Where else
Can't exactly search on Discord
I'm not saying it doesn't exist at all, but it's much harder to find anything as it's very underground, in my personal experience anyway
[: \)]
You can just play the board games online, but it's not what I'm looking for
There's better games to play online, I was just talking about real life experiences
I was only just born in the early 90s, so maybe they're all playing with each other and the later generation never picked it up
Ne Vilniuj gyvenu
A club here seems to exist, but the last post was a year ago about selling their whole stock, so it's not very promising
Second biggest uni I finished a few years ago didn't have anything of the sort
I doubt my smaller town uni would
But I'm not emailing the staff to ask about a boardgame group to play in : )
There's one every year
It's a 4 hour trip and 40€ both ways
Then all the gaming happens in the evening, so I'd need to rent a place to stay, which won't be very cheap in the capital
A lot of money and hassle to play for a few hours with strangers
Hassle and money I'd put up with if maybe I was going with a friend, alone it's too much
Definitely without
I didn't see other people write it that way around me either
They do exist, but they are pretty rare though
Nope
Very rare
We get them when we're baptized, but its rare for  someone to write/say it
Only if your first name is not a name of any apostate or whatever
That is if you're a christian, otherwise there wouldn't be any second names afaik
afaik most people have them, but they are usually not mentioned whatsoever, unless it's written on official documents
Putting their life story in stickers on the back of their cars
Old German men actually wear long black socks with sandals
Raw sugar snaps as in sugar snap peas
But those are amazing
It's worse in winter, when "zero degrees" means completely different conditions, but it's not obviously apparent which scale it is in, the way it is with summer/indoors temperatures

Jūratė and Kastytis would be a great Disney film although it has a sad ending
It think it's similar to the little mermaid but without voices and all
Also Eglė Žalčių karalienė. Sad ending too but also some animals, trees
Yes we did
Yap, I remember our history teacher organised a discussion about the war after we read about it and asked us to discuss between ourselves if it should be considered a victory for Finland or not, and contrast it with the actions of the baltic states at the time
Yep, part of the build up to WWII
How Finland bravely resisted in contrast to our own folding under pressure from the Soviets
Well we were taught that it happened and its consequences
graduated in 2012
I've no idea what the curriculum was before me or is now
just extra flavour
For me personally it’s probably Pont-du-Garde
our country rarely gets into international news media
Had a banquet a few weeks ago
Some of my friends were involved in it
So we had some drinks and we saw a basketball court
Somehow managed to find a basketball nearby and we just played 2x2 with our suits on
Later we continued drinking
Watched basketball in an arena to support the boys
People from countries with no dual citizenship, how strong is support for it
Do you want it
If you're from a country that allows it, do you like it
In Lithuania we had a referendum and the majority of participants voted in favor of dual citizenship, but referendum failed because only 37% of eligible voters turned out for this referendum
As for me, i don't support it
You can't live in two countries simultaneously
A lot of lithuanians immigrated and they won't go back, so it seems pointless that they should retain their lithuanian citizenship
But countries don't give citizenship as soon as you arrive
You have to live for some years in the country
The longer someone lives in a foreign country, the more   likely they are to stay there
People find new friends, get married and have kids
These people won't abandon their new life and go back
Very few people actually move back and forth between countries
As I've said before, you can't live in two countries simultaneously
Hahaha, that's true
I think all the Baltics are trying to run as far as possible from Russia due to historical things and hate being confused with it
We had a referendum recently where we voted for allowance of dual citizenship
However, people voted for no dual citizenship
As I heard, that is because people who have only one passport could be somehow “discriminated” by people who have dual citizenship
I think it's a more nationalistic thing
Also, people who have Lithuanian descendants can apply for a Lithuanian passport and still keep theirs, there are more exceptions like that, when you can have dual citizenship, don't remember all of them thought
Poland, except for jokes from Lithuanians
Poor african countries
Never saw a joke that makes fun of them
He's just like his ancestors
Oh, right
I forgot about slow Estonians
My family was half Lithuanian half Russian, so I had 2 nicknames one was "sese" which just means sister (I had a brother but even my parents called me that) and " Рамашka " which translates as camomile, and rhymes with my actual name
My mum calls me "kačiukas" it means (male) kitty even though I'm female
Or she calls kids and teens (including me and my brother) "lėliukas" it means little baby lol
Now because of her I call people babies too and sometimes It slips and I call them a baby in front of them
Gambling
So he cant own stocks or be a business owner
I get that he shouldnt do business while in office but your statement is confusing
And what if it also benefit others too
You could argue then that a business owner and now a politician voting on laws that make business environment better is acting on his own interests but it also helps others too
Well, we don't have many urban legend monsters, but we have some mythological beasts
There's Laumes, which are women, kinda similiar to the Ladies of the Wood from the witcher 3
They use their shining, ornamented, colorful, beautiful belts to blind poor people with greed and lure them in, for later consumption, but they can also change into young women and help (for example) lost children find a way out of the woods
We also have kaukai which are little dwarves, or creatures that help people taking care of them
They are freed, when given an article of clothing
Writing this I remembered, that I have a slavic monster bestiary and I read that, (from legends) there was a basilisk in Vilnius, that people killed, by throwing rūta plants into the basemend that it lived in, becouse allegedly they had anti-magical properties
There was also a few other basilisk legends from kraków or warsaw
There's a SHITTON of balto-slavic monsters, and not even half of them are in the witcher, although some of them are mentioned
Despite that, the witcher does quite a good take on the baltic-slavic mythology
There's even direct references to different countries, like the von Everec people
Olgierd(Algirdas), Witold(Vytautas) and Kiejstut(Kestutis) are all originally Lithuanian names and those three were dukes directly related to each other
Algirdas was Kestutis's brother and Vytautas was Kestutis's son
There's a lot more references if you look into it, so if this mythology interests anyone, here you go
In some way, maybe, but they're still a little different
They litter the house and poor ash into beer, or milk and if the owner doesn't clean up and drink the beer, the kaukai consider this as a pact
Then, when the owners house is clean and their life is happy, the kaukai demand any article of clothing as a reward, so it's more of an exchange, as opposed to HP house-elves living as slaves
In Lithuanian there are genders, but we know it instantly when we hear or see the word, cause everything ending with s is masculine and everything ending with a or e is feminine except for very few minor exceptions
There are no articles here and they are nightmare for us to understand, often we don't get the purpose of their existance
Oh yeah, I know, but you still kind of naturally know it based on stress or diminutive words
That we play basketball and it's basically our religion
I really don't know if it's popular here anymore, because I rarely see basketball courts, and people that actually play basketball on these courts are even more rare
I'd say that football is way more popular among the youth
15-20 range
Depends for how long I am to be outside
5 minute run to the shops, like 10c is fine
5 hours of little movement outside
I'd like it to be closer to like 23
well it highly depends on the season we are in
18C in Fall is cold, 18C in spring is hot
* Quick deterioration of relations with Russia
* Introduction of €.
* Re-introduction of military draft
* Doubling of military budget to catch up with the 2% of GDP pledge
* Ongoing trial of several politicians and parties
* 2016 Seimas election, LVŽS won
* Political chaos since then
* 2019 presidential election, Nausėda won
* failed dual nationality referendum due to not enough turnout
Euro in 2015
Euro - 2015
Some prices went up, some went down, but most of the wages are growing much faster than this
Except for public sector
> The Latvian lat was more expensive than the Euro, so everything seemed more expensive at the start
And for us the opposite
100LTL for a T-shirt
Thats a rip off
~30€ for a T-shirt
Well it's only 30
Yeah, pretty much
Our wages were pretty low to start with, but Euro kicked in growth for everything
Sevices got a price hike (haircut from 5,7€ to ~8€, pizza from 5,7€ to ~7,49€) And for wages, well I wasnt working back then, but even in last two years, my wage has doubled (Take into account that I started fresh and now have 2 years of experience)
Vytautas the great
During his time GDL span from one sea to another
Also he basically did an outstanding move to destroy some nasty germans during the battle of grunwald(Žalgiris)
Vytautas the great, (i think thats how it translates)
During his reign, he expanded Lithuania to the Black sea he would've become the 2nd king but he died when he fell of the horse
Well basically we know that he married a 12 year old girl to become king of Poland
And later he helped to christianize Lithuania
Also he fought with polish troops in battle of Grunwald
We don't look at him negatively, but Vytautas is far more popular here
He's just kinda forgotten
Yeah, but he's less known here
Lithuanians think the same, we just don't agree with some romatacized, maybe, not on purpose some historical pop interpratations
My parents stood in the [Baltic Way,] a 650km long human chain, connecting all three Baltic capitals
It was a protest for our independence from Soviet Russia
2nd husband of my grandma was a fighter in the anti-Soviet guerrilla war in 1940s and 1950s.
All my grandparenta and parents stood in the Baltic Way and my father left Vilnius just in the evening of 12th January, 1991
How old are you wtf
I guess that none
Only some Lithuanian Grand Dukes had claimed that they are of Roman descent
Public transport usage
> Drinking alcohol in the street being socially acceptable
That's illegal in here, unless you are drinking in an establishment that serves alcohol
We probably have the harshest drinking laws in Europe
Well the main idea behind this law is that it helps police to deal with people drinking in the public while creating annoyance to others
For example a drunk person might be a bit to loud, but being a bit to loud is not illegal
So if police catches you drinking in public, and you are not creating any issues, then they will ask you to pack your things and just leave
So it is enforced, but not to strictly and won't cause you to much trouble if you break it
Nothing really
We do Lithuanize some English words by adding "as" in the end, but that's about it
If somebody uses a non-existant word or a grammatically incorrect phrase, you will be seen as a subpar human being and will be immediately corrected
I would argue that we have the opposite problem
The Lithuanian Language commission (yes, a thing like this actually exists) introduce these fake lithuanian words in order to "save the language" or something, but nobody really takes it seriously
I'm in Prague right now (technically not my country but w/e) and I would say what tourists need to watch out for are the Euronet ATMs, they are by far the biggest scam I've seen
They're so blatantly anti-consumer (and practically lie in the advertisements) i'm surprised they're legal
Well Afrikaans is closer to Dutch than English
There are some great takes on English cuisine
Roasted veggie medley in England is probably of the most varied that I tried (the inclusion of parsnips is uncommon elsewhere in Europe)
Yorkshire pudding with Cumberland sausage is simple and tasty
I do find the national dish(Sunday roast) to be less flavoursome, than many other smaller dishes
Someone should let Gordon Ramsay yell obscenities at a plate of Sunday roast
Probably the flag of the [Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic] Though I'm pretty sure most people born after 1990 don't even know what it looked like
It's not that they aren't "appreciated by the public" but they are just straight up illegal, together with the flag of the soviet union and nazi germany
Same for Lithuania as well
I.e. reverse Egypt ?
Spread the cheese, basically one kid would be chosen to either sit or lay down, then everyone jumped up on him to basically spread the cheese, it was a pretty dangerous game now that I think about it
same here, but instead of a yellow car we punched someone if we saw a beetle car

Become a democratic country, acknowledge the attrocitoes commited by them, become a mature and politically active nation, value honor, respect and personal liberties above brute force, influence and wealth, keep their end of a bargain, stop propaganda amd cyber warfare against its beighbours, especially in europe
I mean most ex-soviet states will agree that Russia's "peaceful inclusion" was no more than an invasion
Be they mad or not
Another Baltic here to agree
Everyone had chaos solely because of how disorganized and corrupt soviet union was
Russia didnt "give" independence, we declared ourselves independent
Russia tried to stop us, shot at civil people, drove tanks over them, shot at journalists broadcasting live translation on tv, sent soldiers to kill our unarmed border guards
Russia is spreading fake history through tv channels, seeds national hate in social media comments, frequently carries out cyber attacks against our government and business IT systems
Your attempt of democracy was actually an authoritarian oligarch taking controll by force
Then *giving* lead to putin
We, for example, had elected the very same communist party leader, who opposed our independence, to a president after independence council finished the constitution
Because people chose to
That is true democracy - reflecting the choice of people
You were betrayed by powerful criminals, yes
We all lived through that
Now all SU slaves who kept good relations with Russia stayed authoritarian, with georgia, ukraine maturing for clear democracy not too long ago, armenia still struggling to break out
Honestly, have you all tried demanding the truth and transparency, investigating the claims, and not giving in for corruption
We have had protests demanding annullment of corrupt politician-business deals (like selling away national energy monopoly to private owner), bad laws, bad reforms etc
Have you ever asked yourself why nobody protests when your country shelters a fraud-bankrupt bank owners, poisoning people in display of power, defending an autoritarian regime leader who used chemical weapons on civils multiple times, claiming to willingly ignore mutual assured destruction and use nuclear weapons if putin sees it beneficial
A country with morals would not allow its government to even think of doing that
Yet you dont show discontent, still afraid to say it out loud
Why a country with so much oil being sold is considered to be VERY poor in all types of ratings, while fairytale countries like Quatar, Kuwait exist
Where does the money go
Not to you, fellow russians
sadly
This is likely the reason why most immigrants to our country are russians
Very intelligent, very business and scirnce oriented
If your nation had any self confidence, you would mature to demand reform to fair government and live as good, if not better, than germany
Solely based on oil exports
Hope you dont get offended, didnt meant to offend
It is our mutual interest to have russians living very well and having a global-example government
Godspeed mate
Eeeh, not really "Traditional" per say, but Alias is probably the most popular one

Austrija-Vengrija
Austro-Vengrijos imperija
Austrijos - Vengrijos imperija
I think I remember using Austro-Vengrija in school
Or am I imagining things
Well, I don't recall this usage, at least not in my school
Reason why we're happy it's because we use too many antidepressants
I don't know stereotype which is true , but PLEASE stop calling us Soviet or Russian
Same here
voverė  [ʋoʋʲɛˈɾʲeː], really not that difficult to pronounce
From Proto-Indo-European *wewer-, from *wer-. Baltic cognates include Latvian vāvere, Old Prussian weware and the Samogitian dialect's vuoverie
Other Indo-European cognates include Latin vīverra (“ferret”) and Polish wiewiórka, as well as Russian dialectal веверица (veverica), вевёрка (vevjórka), Belarusian вавё́рка (vavjórka), Ukrainian віве́рица (vivéryca), веві́рка (vevírka), ви́вірка (vývirka), Bulgarian ве́верица (véverica), Czech veverka, Old High German eihhurno, eihhorno (< *aik-wer-ną, German Eichhorn, Dutch eekhoorn, Persian وروره‎ (varvarah) and Welsh gwiwer
Vovere in Lithuanian
It's not a hard word to say for foreigners because it's written and pronounced the same way
Voverė in Lithuanian
I can see the connection deep in the roots, unless its some kind of coincidence
In Lithuanian it's voverė :)
> Orre = a big bird
does it really
looks like it could be from PIE -wer, meaning woodland animal
Operating secret US CIA torture prisons within our country
Too less hawkish on China, especially after this August diplomatic incident
'Ratas' means 'wheel' in Lithuanian lol
In my experience quite common, I personally had math tutor at middle school and then again went to the same tutor during the final 2 years to fill in the gaps I had in school, I also went to Lithuanian language tutor for about 6 months before final exam to fill in specific gaps from earlier in life (if not for that, I probably would have failed Lithuanian language exam)
Out of my final year class, I would say that about 20-30% students had private tutors for at least one subject (most often it was math), having a tutor would help with school exams, but not always
Its sad that kids often need them, but in major cities, schools are quite full so teachers can't dedicate enough attention to everyone
Also this was not necessarily a rich kid class as my school was just like any other school with all income families
Eggs are sold out in shelves/freezers (※) (depends on a supermarket chain), but we keep them in fridge, in 0°C section
Mostly people do that there too
(※) Edit - meant fridges
We keep them in the top shelf of the fridge
He means fridges, we don't have frozen eggs
Also nobody I know keeps them in a 0° zone
Mostly in the egg shelf, or just anywhere
※ I meant fridges
Sorry
We've called you *Čekija* for ages, so it's nothing unusual to Lithuanian ears
We call it *Vanta*
Train or bus inside Lithuania or when going to neighbouring countries including Estonia
Planes for all the other cases
It's not weird, he knows what he's doing
Sanders is a full on tankie, but he knows speaking about communism is politically untenable, so he just substitutes the word communism with Democratic Socialism and tries to equate his positions with that of Nordics, because his constituancy holds Nordics in high regard
It's a simple bait and switch tactic
What is this nonsense
Venesuela confiscated and nationalised more than a 1000 of various private companies, factories, everything during the last 20 years, not just 1 major oil company
They just recently started ceding the control, because they are in total shambles
> He's a democratic socialist
Yeah, that's the bait and switch part I'm reffering to
Dude literally had a hardon for Soviet Union, flew Soviet flag in his office, praised soviet block countries numerous times and is now trying to convince everyone that Nordics are socialist to get support for his policies
Wiki list of companies owned fully by the Swedish state is 20 companies
Also the word "partly" is doing a lot of heavy lifting here
They partly own SAS and Telia, neither of which they own the majority
You see a difference between a state investing into companies, buying/creating them outright and nationalising/seizing companies that belong to other people, whilst firing most of their trained staff, preventing their owners from entering the coubtry and replacing them with government agents
And the list of companies that this happened to was in the thousands, not fucking 20
70% of what's left of Venezuelan economy is privately owned you mean
Oh you watched the same Scandinavian fiction as the guy above
Any recommendations
Yes, nationalising and appropriating thousands of companies, very market economy
At 5-6 years old
We call latvians "broliukai"- little brothers
Broliukai, sesutes (to Latvia)
Just FYI: braliukai is more of a mix between latvian brāļukas and broliukai (which is the diminutive for brothers)
Don't know why we use braliukai instead (I do like how it sounds and it's always clear who we are refering to though)
Su Šventom Kalėdom, braliuks
Very Lithuanian-centred
It starts with 1939 March when Nazi Germany annexed Lithuanian Klaipėda Region after an ultimatum – that was the last pre-WW2 German annexion
Then it goes to August 1939 with Ribbentrop/Molotov pact, invasion of Poland (including Hitler's offer to invade Poland together and the acceptance of thousands of Polish refugees), 'recovery' of Vilnius and acceptance of Soviet military bases to Lithuania
Then it turns to 1940 with 06 11 Soviet ultimatum and our cowardly government that agreed to it; Sovietisation of Lithuania and beginning of Soviet genocide (the mass deportations to Siberia in 1941 06 14)
During this time France, Denmark and Norway falls
On 1941 06 22 Germany invades Soviet Union and the uprising in Lithuania starts, on 23 June the Provisional Government declare restoration of independence, but the Germans come, start the Holocaust and scatter Lithuanian government
Ghettos are created and more than 200k Litvaks are killed
During that time, Pearl Harbour occur and meanwhile, Germans begin failing in the Eastern front
When the Soviets are returning in 1944, hundreds of thousands of Lithuanian refugees retreat to the west with the German military
Lithuanian paramilitaries sided with Germans are created and then dispersed in 1944
Soviets capture Vilnius and Kaunas in the summer of 1944, Klaipėda in January 1945
The anti-Soviet pro-democratic guerrilla war starts immediately after the Soviet re-occupation
Meanwhile, Lithuanian diplomatic service around the world continues to work till today without interruptions of Soviet (1 year), Nazi (3 years) and another Soviet (45 years) occupations
Well we've played huge roleplay in holocaust because of the amount of jews that lived in Lithuania,we wanted to end up living with nazis,but instead we were communist country for 50 years and if weren't communist country we would be as rich as finland
I grew up in the Soviet Union
That's why I read a lot about WWII now, and sometimes it is a completely different story than I was taught in school
I don't know how it is now, because our education system keeps getting changed every other year, but back when I was in school, it went something like this:
We first start off with German entry into the Rheinland, then we learn about the Sudetenland crisis, the annexation of Czechoslovakia, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and then we learn about the official start of the war on the 1st of September, 1939 when Germany invades Poland, while the Soviet Union invades them shortly after as well
Then we learn about the deal with the devil that we made, when we allowed the Soviets to station some troops in our country in exchange for Vilnius
Then we learn about German victories in the west, the surrender of France, and the annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union
Then we learn about the mass deportations, violence and looting done to us by the soviets in 1940, and then we learn about operation barbarossa
Then we learn about all the holocaust stuff and the return of the Soviets
Then we learn about the 1944 invasion of Normandy and the Soviet push west
Then we learn about the German surrender, the peace terms, the Nuremberg trials, and then finally there's one small page on what Japan did and about how it was nuked
That's pretty much it, after all that we move on to the cold war
In Lithuania (which was occupied by Soviets) we mostly talk about secret pact with Ribbentrop and Molotov then general things
One book page about Holocaust, another about Stalin's gulags another one in Poland invasion
What is taught about ultimatums to Baltic states, military bases in 1939, annexions in 1940 and the inception of deportations here in 1941
The reign of Vytautas the Great, 1392--1430, obvs
Then the Grand Dutchy of Lithuania was the largest country in Europe, stretching between the Baltic and the Black seas
The time when Vytautas the Great was in charge, aside from that not much else
But that is pretty funny as the Great Duchy of Lithuania was obviously not a nation state
Interbellum and contemporary Lithuania are much more Lithuanian nation states than the GDL
Chiken is quite rare in traditional lithuanian quisine
Geese and ducks are more common
Duck is often served with cranberry jam and goose meat is often used along with pig meat in "zrazai", which are these lithuanian meatballs
Pigeons were eaten too, however they were considered the cheap, lowest class food, so they're not eaten anymore
Quail, or quail eggs are also a part of lithuanian culinary
Beje/Beja - "in addition to"
Deja/Deje - "unfortunately"
Ačiū/Ačių -"thank you"
NYC is great to visit
But
NYC has changed drastically in the last 5 years - since I moved to NYC - not to mention last 20 years
Also - please don't visit NYC any time other than April/May
Other than those 2 months it just stinks
You clearly haven't seen W4th Street
Or never confused avenue and road in Queens
And no - not all US cities adopted numbering
Have you been to Boston
Atlanta
New Orleans
&#x200B;
Numbered streets are not at all a huge benefit or a drawback
with the exception of studies, that suggest that people from places with numbered streets have poorer navigation skills
Lock, Stock and two smoking barrels were translated in Lithuania as Bark, Howl or Shoot
It's ridiculous when translated, but it sounds alright 'lok, stauk arba šauk' haha
As someone from Lithuania we have an awesome quirky song about being able to do whatever you want, when you're alone home
Mantas ir Monika - Žemė plokščia
God damn I am embarrassed to say this
Im surprised nobody mentionet this yet:
Evanescence - Bring me to life
Why wouldn't straight people listen to Verka
It's an entertainment act
and a damn funny one, at it
Ahhh
Every fifth-grader girl sings this
It just has that hook, that ear worm, that just gets in your head
Same with Russian, the words for your native country are cognate with the words "to be born" (родина) and "father" (отчизна), rather than "mother".  Purely an English thing
Pretty much every window made in the last 15 years is like that
I also have a few where you can choose how much the top part opens, so you can leave just a crack, for a little bit of ventilation at night
Very common, even in Lithuania, Latvia
Except in old old villages
I never realised those weren't common everywhere
Pretty much every building here has those, unless it's very old and unrenovated

Yeah hes cool
It's very common here, you shake your hands everytime you see a male friend
If it's a woman you say hi or hug
Always
Daily greeting if any interaction is going to happen
A nod if you're just running by
„Old Scots“? Isn‘t it just „Scots“?
Only reliant now because my new job requires me to travel all over the country with heavy gear
Before that public transport, biking or car sharing systems had me covered
I'm 20 and I don't have the licence as well
Public transportation + shared bicycles work fine for me
Some significant and beautiful artifacts from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania are in the museums
Sadly most of our historical artifacts have been destroyed or stolen during conquest
Before wide spread conquest you had pagan tribes that weren’t the best at recording their lives and activities
A small amount of the Soviet history has been preserved by choice (for education) but both the Soviets and Germans worked hard to cover up the horrific crimes they committed here in the 20th century
I pay by app
I constantly use buses to get around for university, so usually use a public transport app where you can buy tickets on your phone and activate them whenever you go in a bus
You can also use a card with a card reader in buses, or you can buy a paper ticket from the bus driver (it's also the most expensive method)
In Klaipeda:
From kiosk:
Paper ticket for one ride (they have QR codes on the back so the scanner scans them)
To card/student ID (one ticket or month/year)
From driver:
Cash only
Kaunas city (trolleybuses and buses):
* having ticket card that can be topped up with money or weekly/monthly/yearly passes online, in kiosks and supermarkets
I use my student ID with integrated ticket as there are the least hassle, I only need to buy a 55 € yearly pass online once a year
* [Žiogas app] on the smartphone
Upon boarding you need to write 3 symbols bus number and show the app to the driver
If you reach fare threshold, a continuous pass activates
* Buying from the driver
As a student I have to pay 50 ct in cash and then I get a small receipt  working as ticket
Suburban buses:
* In most cases I just pay with cash (with 50% discount as a university student) and get a ticket from the driver
* Some companies, like Kautra, allow buying suburban tickets in the same manner like intercity buses on [www
autobusubilietai
lt]
Railways:
* I usually buy them online on [www
traukiniobilietas
lt]
* It is possible to buy the tickets in the ticket offices of railway stations
* It is also possible to buy tickets in trains, but they are additionally charged if you don't board the train from a station without ticket office
Cash and card
Intercity buses:
* I usually buy the tickets on [www
autobusubilietai
lt]
* However some companies do not sell tickets online – then I have to purchase them in the ticket counters of bus stations (cash or card) or from the driver (95% of cases only cash)
Good at basketball, amazing potato dumplings and life experience that's getting better time to time
> silent fireworks
TIL that's a thing
Exactly
In Lithuania football isn't popular
We go crazy because of basketball instead
I still can't forget ~10 years ago when some club went to play in Lithuania and these polish hooligans came with swords, machetes and other insane stuff
Now every time polish clubs come to play you will hear - police forces are streghtened, polish cars might be stopped
(That one riot in Vilnius also helped)
Riots were between Vilnius Vėtra and Legia
Not sure which clubs were with swords but has to be one of the top ones as far as I remember it was some european competition qualification
at the start we'd be the star and later we'd get all of our food put on our plate by Poland
Lithuania would join braļukas
That hurt and I'm not even Estonian
I started hating most pop artists
Yes
But it gets less affordable
Yep, there are quite a few fancy camps in Lithuania
They're private, so the workers are actually qualified and well paid
Most of the camps are specialized, aimed specifically at sciences, arts, acting, sports, etc
Abolished in 1998
Last person to be punished was Dekanidze, a head of mafia called "Vilnius brigade". Sentenced and shot after killing a journalist for writing an investigation or satire about him
Recently few people say they want to start killing criminals again, but most of them are undereducated people driven by physical instincts rather than calculated thoughts
You mean Lithuanian-Polish Commonwealth Constitution:)
Actually Polish-Lithuanian
Kingdom names always go before Dutchy names as the rules of titles suggest
So you Greeks have Christmas on December 25th (not like Russian Orthodox), but the Easter correspond to the Russian Easter rather than Western
I've just seen on the news that your prime minister is chilling in Vilnius and our president is chilling in Warsaw
That's the union
Cheers to you, mate
While historical discussions have that added twist of nationalism, naming rules a quite clear, the more important titles have to come first so in this case there isnt a lot to argue about
Unless ofcourse you want to argue that we should have been a kingdom if not for our stolen crown /s
> Unless ofcourse you want to argue that we should have been a kingdom if not for our stolen crown /s
We always were a kingdom but we also were a border region
To the east they were named duchies to the west - kingdoms . That's why our grand dukes wrote to the west that they were "kings" or "emperors" and no one batted an eye
To the east - grand dukes
Somehow, somewhere we chose to stick with calling ourselves grand duchy and relegated being a king as only blessed by the pope when we were a border region and mix of traditions

Šalčininkai and its region
The apendix
Called *Gaidžio koja* (transl
Roster's foot)
Another stalin's brilliant idea to incite territorial disputes, conflict (about 50km inside belarus teritory are lithuanian villages)
Majority of people living there are belarusians, polish and rusians
To enter the place you need a passport, customs sometimes check for contraband
The place is void of business, people often dont like tidying up their land so most houses and their land looks awful (why put effort to make "foreign" land look good
), generally nothing happens there
Vilnius county has 2/3 of all lithuanian minorities, and many people who live even near the city have worse looking houses, yards, fences, public property than those in the furthest, most desolate regions of lithuania
With years these matters are improving, polish and russians grow fonder of our country by the day, but with putin funded parties like polish-russian alliance fueling hatered for lithuanians changes are slow
As a lithuanian i can say we dont see nationalities, we want you to strive with us to live better, and we wish you well
Taip ir maniau, jog Šalčininkai bus paminėti
( sorry, i couldn't say it in english)
>Another stalin's brilliant idea to incite territorial disputes, conflict (about 50km inside belarus teritory are lithuanian villages)
Stalin has nothing to do with the appendix
It's a myth that when they were drawing  Lithuania's map,  Stalin's pipe was lying on what is now the appendix and nobody dared to relocate it, so they drew the map with it
I doubt whether anyone in Belarus cares about Dieveniškės ( that's appendix's official name)
It's simply useless
There are no major cities, important routes or belarussian population who would be glad to join Belarus
>Majority of people living there are belarusians, polish and rusians
Majority of people living in Šalčininkai region consider themselves to be polish
The key word here is 'consider'. Many of them don't speak polish or care for polish culture
There are very few russians and belausians
In fact, there are 2 times more lithuanians than russians
>To enter the place you need a passport, customs sometimes check for contraband
You don't need a passport to enter
They sometimes chech check for contraband when you are leaving
However, if you plan to explore Dieveniškės glorious woods you better have your passport with you
>The place is void of business, people often dont like tidying up their land so most houses and their land looks awful
Šalčininkai is indeed one of the poorest regions in Lithuania and poor people don't have beautiful houses
>why put effort to make "foreign" land look good
It's not ''foreign'' land
It's their land
The land where their parents, granparends and great-grandparents lived, worked and died
People who live in Šalčininkai are not foreigners
They lived on this land for generations
If they don't speak Lithuanian, it doesn't mean they came here during Soviet occupation
About lithuanian villages, i mean lithuania has no dispute with belarus, just that 90% of those villages have lithuanian names
About foreigners not willing to live bette on foreign land
that was said in brackets
People there dont see lithuania as anything good, they prefer russia, but call themselves polish while they in fact are belarusian/polish/russian
Rest of lithuania doesnt seem them as exclusive, better or worse
But vilnius county in general has minorities who feel like somebody owes them something so they feel angry at their government, love putin while he poses a real threat to destroy their lives
Ive lived in many places in lithuania, even the poorest people make huge effort to have their lawn cut, house exterior made clean and tidy, have fences fixed and decorete it all with plants
People in vilnius county, *especially* minorities, do not do that
Shack or a mansion, many dont give a damn how they make it look
I dont know if its a cultural thing or not wanting to make effort to make lithuania beautiful to live in one household at a time
Gotta read how its written and how its meant to be understood, not reading between the lines
Not that I'm aware of
Vilnius - around 600k people
They think they're the best and don't care about other cities
Some speculate that 90% of Vilniečiai have never been outside Vilnius
They call other cities villages :(
Kaunas - around 300k maybe
normal calm people, look like workaholics
Also most lithuanian
Klaipėda - around 150k people
THE BEST CITY EVER (biased because I'm from it) people here think they like art and jazz very much
Also they probably think that they love sea
German city
Nahhh
It's now more russian:D
Šiauliai - around 100k people
"Sun" city
Haven't been there much, but their mall is massive
Also kids here are too happy to live
Klaipėda represent
Yes
Some examples,
Elizabeth II - Elžbieta Antroji
George VI - Jurgis Šeštasis
Charlemagne - Karolis Didysis
Friedrich Wilhelm - Frydrichas Vilhelmas
Henry VIII - Enrikas Aštuntasis
Mechaninė Saulė by Juodvarnis if you're looking for metal, although I personally prefer Solo Ansamblis - Miestas ant Kalno, although they're more electro post-punkey light rock
I went to both of these bands concerts at Mėnuo Juodaragis festival last year and they were both amazing
Edit: I also read, that they should have some distinctive elements, so I recommend Žalvarinis
They have some really cool songs, one of their best is "O Kai Saulutė Tekėjo". It's literally a remixed lithuanian folk song, so you can check that out if you want
I really like the band Kælan Mikla
They're really cool and have that 80's vibe
Rotting Christ is awesome and they're also from greece
My personal favourite of theirs is "Χ Ξ Σ".
Rotting Christ are Greek tho, as far as I know
Oh my god, that song has literally been resurfacing and echoing in my head randomly for years, and I never knew what I was called until now
Thanks
Probs it's Vytautas the great
Why
Beat teutonic order /w poles, ruled lands from sea to sea, brought us kibinai :D
That's nothing insane
Only Paksas is the insanest one xD
Oh the biggest Vytautas is Vytautas Šuštauskas
He was only ruler of Kaunas, not whole Lithuania
Woah
Never would have thought that it's similar to Lithuanian thank you - Dėkui
Lil Díky
we say shule instead of school everytime

„Quotation marks
Šlangas, šlagbaumas
Even das Handy
They're pretty common
I have long hair, and I don't get any weird faces from people in public
Maldininkas- pray saying, men
Maldininkė- pray saying, women
Mald(a)-meaning a pray
ininkas/ė- someone who is doing something (this case- prays) professionally
In lithuania it's male "maldininkas", or female "maldininkė". It means "praying man", or "praying woman", although it could be translated as "prayer", or "prayress", so person not an object
Similarly, in Lithuanian it is called “Maldininkas”
(Male who prays)
Mantė is a female lithuanian name, so interesting coincidence
It also has a male equivalent Mantas, which is my name
If we're talking classical songs like the anthem, then either *Lietuva brangi* or *Lietuviais esame mes gimę*, but definitely not famous internationally
If modern, the only one that comes to mind is *Po dangum*, purely due to its views on YouTube, and I know it attracted some international attention a few years back
We don't have anything that is *that* famous though
Being called Russia or a part of Russia
I used to work in a call centre and used to hate this often occurring interaction:
*- Where are you guys based
*- In Lithuania
*- Oh, Здравствуйте!* (customer all happy with themselves)
*- Oh haha, I actually don't speak Russian
It's not like I didn't understand them, I'm familiar with some words, but I'm from the post-Soviet generation, and never learned Russian
But I didn't want to ruin the rare happy/nice moments in a customer service call either, so I was always conflicted what to say
"Where are you from
"Lithuania
"Oh I've been there
Loved Riga
Our country didn't really exist after the war, and by the time we did come into existence, most of the collaborators were dead at that point
The majority of them either died in Soviet repressions in the following years or fled to the West, where they didn't really suffer any consequences, afaik
One, don't really care about them, I'm more of a nature guy
To be honest, way too many
Šaltiena (aspic)
It literally makes me vomit, it's like jello, but made of meat
Šaltibarščiai, the iconic Lithuanian pink soup
I just detest kefir, and sadly it is used for this soup as well
Oh good, I'm not the only one
It seems like I'm the only one in my extended family that hates it
We also do that in lithuania
Two in Vilnius, one in Panevėžys (why tho, Panevėžys is only 5th largest city)
It's super good, but franchisers rarely pick Lithuania, so we don't have Starbucks, Burger King, Domino's, etc
We got LiDL not long ago (in 2016)(and LiDL is the best thing that happened to humanity)
Also we don't have many mcdonald's. Only one Mcdonald's in Klaipėda (100k inhabitants) is an insult and the lines are always super long
Even some 20k cities in USA have 6 McDonalds
Edit: I read that we are having Burger King, first will open in Vilnius Akropolis, but it's delaying
In Lithuania we don't have any Burger Kings at all
probably Ukraine
Estonia and, to lesser extent Ukraine
Maybe Germany as well
It was a neighbour until 1945
Why not Estonia
There are no woman on that island
Hence the name
well Estonia is more neighbors with Finland and we're neighbors with latvia
Estonia is a baltic state but they seem to have more relations with the north
Estonia doesn't want to be associated with Lithuania probably
that is 100 percent true
Not a thing
And i love it
Lottery is a almost always a scam and run by shadiest people
Is where I live
Trip with classmates and trolling Latvians with Lithuanian (They answered Lithuanian questions really good, I was shocked)
Sleeping in hotel with my classmates
It was fun af
Some kids ran into parking lot at night and somebody called police on them
Eating goulash at Szeged
Camping in countryside
Mostar
Slipping on rocks and watching some guy jump off the bridge
Eating frites
Swimming next to jellyfishes and some crabs (I dunno what these were)
Disneyland
Watching cats sleep together on a bench in Croatia
It was really cute
Mountains
Watching at them
It was
awesome
Swimming in Adriatic sea
I don't know, just passed through
But Beograd was nice
Edited: a typo
Poland
that was my first trip abroad, saw the Malbork Castle
In another trip my school director paid for my lunch in Poland
Latvia
I was on debating tournament and in the evening drank some cheap Latvian vodka with some Estonian fellows – whose names I have forgotten
Later that night I went to explore Riga, it's pretty cute
Germany
I was 14 and went with my choir to Berlin
As our host family couldn't take us from the concert venue, they ordered a taxi for us
I started speaking in German with the driver and got a nice free night sightseeing trip around central Berlin while en route to Friedrichshain
Berlin is my most favourite 1M+ city
Russia
I saw the Hermitage, Kunstkamera and the white nights
During that time Russians downed the MH17 over Ukraine and it was pretty interesting to watch their propaganda on TV while checking facts in Lithuanian/English/Ukrainian websites simultaneously
Czechia
Spent a night roaming through Olomouc in 2014 and Prague in 2015
Austria
I enjoyed walking through Vienna
Estonia
AHAA in Tartu
Later the old town of Tallinn
Tallinn reminded me both Vilnius and Kaunas by its scales but has kind of Nordic feeling
Belarus
I bought a white-red-white flag and got a picture holding it near the central Lenin
As there were lots of militsiya, I thought that I can easily run into a problem, however, nothing terrible happened
France
Louvre was nice as well
Paris felt like a really global city, somewhat more elegant than Berlin
Belgium
I had a night walk with a friend through Brussels and the borough of Molenbeek
As a joke, I have written another good friend of us in Lithuania, that it was pretty bad here (it wasn't)
When we returned to the hotel and turned on the TV, it turned out that the 2016 Bastille day attack occured in Nice at the same time
Netherlands
I was sleeping in a bunk bed and fell out of it while sleeping
While not fully woken up, I said that I will never sleep on top of it again, and I went there back again
I had only 5 hours in Amsterdam, so I need to revisit it back some day
Slovakia
I was in the Northern European Cooperation for Sex Education, my first ever international event of International Federation of Medical Students Associations
I enjoyed that
Hungary
As I had free last evening in Košice (SK), I took a train to Miskolc in Hungary, as I had never been there before, took a 1 h walk in the city and then returned back to the last train to Slovakia as my flight from Košice was in the very early morning
I saw some weird Fidesz and Jobbik ads against refugees/migrants, as the Hungarian elections were held in that spring
I celebrated a birthday of my friend who studies in Cambridge, another day I walked \~20 km through London and got soaked by rain in the evening
Ukraine
I slept in Hotel Ukraina in Maidan around which dosens of people were killed in turn of 2013/2014
It was my cheapest ever visited European city (with metro ticket for 8 UAH)
I went through the Arsenalna escalator few times and I ate in an fantastic Crimean Tatar restaurant in the Maidan
I also saw the Chernobyl power plant from the plane
Finland
I have never been here before, and my only two visits were layover between planes from Vilnius to Shanghai and back
However, both times I asked for a passport stamp, so I have undeniable evidence of visiting Finland
Yeah, the old ones are basically celebrities constantly giving out interviews form jail, the unjailed ones try to pass of as legit businessmen now, and the new ones are not yet caught and know better than to become household names
Realistically: none
Theoretically: maybe Žemaitija (Samogitia), their culture and language are a tad bit different than that of the rest of Lithuania
At least around Vilnius, I don't remember there ever being a stray dog problem
We do have stray cats, but not to the level of it being a problem, there's municipal cat houses/shelters spread around the neighbourhoods
Not really, I don't think so
Most people know that there are various dialects from general knowledge
And some dialectal words can be found:
a) Traveling in that area
b) Randomly
c) Reading old books
d) Speaking with a person from that place (especially Samogitians)
Meat and cucumber
Sometimes butter, but rarely
If we're talking about toasted sandwhiches, I just stick to cheese and ketchup
US definitions of democrats and conservatives (and liberals) are severely fucked up
I am voting for the conservative party here in Lithuania, but it would be defined as borderline communist in the US
As a student, I get a 50% discount, as well as another 5% discount for the discount card (bought for \~50 ct, valid indefinitely) .
Ticket to Vilnius (100 km) from here  (Kaunas) costs 2,28 € with both my discounts applied
And the longest internal route, Vilnius-Klaipėda (\~400 km) costs 14,50 € full price and just 6,88 € for me
We moved our one ministry to Kaunas, būt that was super hard
I didn't read it yet, my father read it: Altorių šešėlyje
From my personal experience: Romeo and Julliet
Antanas Škėma "Balta Drobulė". It's a book about an after war Lithuanian emigrant in US who is  schizophrenic (book writer was also schizophrenic), and a book is written by a main protagonist perspective
It was probably of the hardest books I ever read
Whitehorn's Mill, definitely
Although I liked the actual story, there is so much to read
And it's a bit difficult to read too, since people don't really talk like they used to when this book was first written
Wait, how else do you say Ehre
"es ist meine Ehre euch kennen zu lernen"
Doesn't strike me as very right wing, at least I hope not, that like my go to phrase
> More proper would be "Es ist mir eine Ehre ..."
I was going to write that but forgot how to spell "mir", havent used any German for well over a decade
No investments here, just savings account with zero percent rate
:( But what about income, I am happy - more than half of it comes straight to saving account and I use it for big buys and vacation travels, and for what is left I live pretty comfortable
Have enough savings to live for year and a half without any income
Which translates into less money being available in capital markets and investments and then this sub cries when americans buy up all of our startups
Why
Eternally growing wealth is as unrealistic as any other utopia
We already have extremely wealthy dynasties that basically live in a different planet with different rules
The way money works in Europe where most people are living a comfortable life and most of them having the time to to the things they want is at least somewhat possible to sustain in the future
It wasn't growing all the time before, only in the recent history the progress and jump in wealth of the general population has been large
At this point our consumption is already killing the planet so it can't grow all the time
Plenty of reasons to not invest
The first one is simply not having enough money to put away for years or risk on a bet
The way we view money will need to change if we want to reduce consumption, of course I don't expect it to change
The world already is and will be burning, poor people will keep suffering like they always have been
The return on investment is tiny if you don't want to take big risks and that means that those who have more money benefit more, always
What about simple wage growth
Inflation is relevant in strong economies that don't have catching up to do
For us in the Baltics since 10 years ago wages rose more than double
So your investment 10 years ago at best would not have decreased
Sure, but since we are talking about poor people they don't usually get to have much money sitting in their bank account
To invest they would have to cut their expenses somehow reducing their quality of life and maybe or not get a return when it barely matters anymore
That's why I am saying investing isn't actually for everyone
Yes
Most of the words are for anglicized topics such as technology, business and finance
Yep, when i talk to someone i often say, "like uhm that thing, you know, right
Uhhh
It happens to me all the time, and I just end up using the english word instead, because otherwise I have a slight brain freeze and have to think for good 10 seconds until I remember that word
Lithuanian - Salieras
1st in the list and, according to national statistics, First by viewership is LNK
Private owned channel
I dislike it personally because it's shows are copied from USA, Russia
And sometimes it's bad quality
Poland – the PLC redux
Pretty good scenario as we are already in the Schengen area, EU and NATO and culturally similar
According to NUTS, you will get Wilno voivodeship and Lithuanian voivodeship
Lithuanians in Sejny area and Poles in Šalčinininkai will be happy af because of reunification with their ethnic relatives
&#x200B;
Belarus – Grand ~~Duchy~~ Republic of Lithuania 2
We will throw out Russian language, and will enforce unconditional democracy
Good for Belarusians, costly for us (but EU could help us with integration of our former neighbouring dictatorship to the EU
&#x200B;
Latvia – we're brothers
This would be an incestual marriage
However, it would be hard to deal:
* how this country should be called
* where should be the capital
* will we learn both languages
* wich religion will be predominant
* will our country be parliamentary or semi-presidential
So Polish merger is less complicated
&#x200B;
Russia – the 3rd Russian annexion
We have suffered enough during 170 years of Russian/Soviet oppression
Go f\*\*k yourselves
We would cause nuclear war as we have NATO battalions stationed here
OK, more sofisticated merger: Lithuania+Kaliningrad Oblast :)
Renaming the localities (although Google Maps already show traditional Baltic/Germanic names when used with Lithuanian language), so it will be called Prussia
Getting rid of Russian military and nuclear weapons
Teaching inhabitants Lithuanian language
Making Prussia Special Economic Zone of the EU and putting shitloads of EU financial help to re-integrate it back to the Western civilisation
Encouraging all the immigrants to settle in Prussia
&#x200B;
Latvia: Trump called us Balkans rather than Baltics before, does it count
Poland: Commonwealth is back, baby
Fire up those coal power plants
Russia: Soviet union is back, tovarisch
It's starving time
Belarus: same as Russia
> how this country should be called
Aistija, duh
>where should be the capital
Rotate between Pasvalys and Bauska
>will we learn both languages
I'm pretty sure the "everyone under 30 knows English, everyone over 30 knows Russian" rule applies to both countries, so we got the work cut out for us
>wich religion will be predominant
Baltic paganism
(Serious: irrelevant question, both countries are officially secular and we're past the point in history where religion was a major divisive question in the region)
>will our country be parliamentary or semi-presidential
Neither, both of our Presidents join together in marriage and form a royal dynasty
We're already in EU, NATO and Schengen :)
They are forbidden in Lithuanian Constitution
Well, we could give them to Germans, as the Luftwaffe is already armed with some
But you know, everyone already understands everyone via English/Russian/local languages (borderland people), there are no visas, no border control, same currency, allied miltaries
I think it's better than being under Russian oppression or idiotic incestual marriage :)
we still have our flags, the Vytis and the Three Stars, Tautiška giesmė and Dievs Svēti Latviju
Current situation is ok
(well, not for our PM)
They would be put back to European civilisation
Freedom&democracy without compromises
What would you do with Transnistria and Gagauzia
Don't forget Ė. And we will add Ų and Į near yours Ą and Ę :)
Don't worry, it would just be integration to EU
Btw, Russian is no official language of EU, so they would need to learn one
Sorry for the off-topic question: how is Russian contigent supplied if Transnistria is landlocked between mainlaind Moldova and Ukraine
What about going further and just extending our great Commonwelth over the whole EU
And alphabets :/
So ok, we can stick with your plan
I thought that Dublin was in Poland
Maybe becouse of another city - Lublin
> Lithuania is fictional
why
Vietnam is in portugal
That one got me
Not only poland
A lot of countries next to the baltic sea have something about sweden in them
There was even a country called "ingria" that was established by a swedish prince marrying a russian princess
That was a way for swedes to expand their teritorry into russia
Mainly St
Petersburg, becouse that's where the country was situated
There's even a chance for the country to break out and be independent again, although it's highly unlikely for russia to give a away St
Petersburg, since it is a source for a crapton of money
Oh, my bad
I didn't know that, but the context is still the same

None, really
Rare, cold and brief
People generally don’t speak to people they don’t know unless absolutely necessary
And when it happens it’s usually very to the point
Even when out in pubs Lithuanians are quite passive and indifferent towards strangers
German and the Slavic languages (excluding Poland, they have too many cz sz stuff)
With Russia: Stalin,
With Poland: Zeligowski
Stalin is WW2 hero for Russians and leader of aggression and genocide against Lithuanians in Lithuania
Pilsudski is one of founding fathers for Poles, but a half-Lithuanian-who-stole-our-capital guy for us
Considerably less evil than Hitler or Stalin, though
Leaders of post-WW2 resistance, especially Jonas Žemaitis and Adolfas Ramanauskas are treated as heroes in Lithuania, but as criminals in Russia
Russian propaganda tries to call them (and all anti-Soviet resistance as Nazi somehow)
While Pilsudski was the one who aspired to rebuild Poland with Commonwelth borders and was the commander of the whole Polish-Lithuanian interim war he was not the one who betrayed his own people (if you could put it that way), from this point of view Pilsudski is not the villain in my eyes
No, because the only languages that are endangered are those that have fewer than 10k speakers, have no legal status, no dedicated media and aren't used as languages of instruction in the education system
If anything, it's regional languages that are endangered, but they're getting replaced not by English but by the official languages of the countries where they're spoken
In the past, sure
Nowadays, the attitudes towards regional languages has definitely shifted in most of Europe at least, but regional languages have been irreversibly damaged already
> as a global language would just diverge into new languages after a while
That depends on interconnectivity, I think
100 years ago, when people only had access to their own local communities at any one given time
Sure, absolutely true
However, if more and more people have access to the internet and use it daily, a global language could be "held together" in a sense, with language shifts not happening in only one place, but also spreading through the entire world
In such a case, language may shift, but not necessarily diverge, even on a global scale
In Lithuania, it was [book smugglers]
>Lithuanian book smugglers or Lithuanian book carriers (Lithuanian: knygnešys, plural: knygnešiaĩ) transported Lithuanian language books printed in the Latin alphabet into Lithuanian-speaking areas of the Russian Empire, defying a ban on such materials in force from 1864 to 1904
In Lithuanian it literally means the one who carries the books
Opposing imperial Russian authorities' efforts to replace the traditional Latin orthography with Cyrillic, and transporting printed matter from as far away as the United States to do so, the book smugglers became a symbol of Lithuanians' resistance to Russification
Nah, in our case, they were smuggled from Prussia (which had a large Lithuanian population at that time)
It was the town of [Tilsit] (now Sovetsk) where books were printed
1000 years in the future, I'd get a ticket to New New York and get a job as a delivery boy
either 13
8 billion years ago to see how the big bang happened or 60-70 mil
years ago to see the dinosaurs
Either 2009 and I would become bitcoin billionaire, or 3-5 decades to the future, when Lithuania will be more developed
There's 3 in lithuania, byt there's also a huge factory in kazlu ruda, that is being heavily invested in by ikea

Wtf did the police even say
"Black people can't be selling stuff"?
Everyone would agree we're Baltic
Discussing whether we're Northern, Eastern, or Central European would be more contested
I like Northern most and I *really* hate being called Eastern
Some might say you're the westernmost eastern europeam country
It's a bit different in lithuania
Everyone agrees we're a part of baltics, but there are also people that would say the whole of baltics is northern, not nordic, not scandinavian, but northern europe
After all we're the same latitude, or even above denmark, which is considered scandinavian
Edit: Damn, I kind of started a small riot in this thread
I want to clarify I don't say baltics are scandinavia, becouse obviously they're not
Hell, we're not even nordic
All I was saying is that some might consider lithuania, latvia and obciously estonia a northern european country, becouse they all either go above or are on the same latitude, than denmark, which is considered a scandinavian, so automatically also a northern country, and if baltics are above the latitude of a northern country, they're also northern
I'd say, germany is central, but definitely leaning towards western europe
I feel like the only people who class as us central are foreigners
Erm what debate is there
Scotland is in Europe
Meh, most everybody here agrees irl we're EE, barring crybabies on the i ternet
I think it’s because of our historical association with Poland and how Poland can be either Central or Eastern European
In my experience, some say we are Central Europe because there's a claim that the geographic center of Europe is in Lithuania
Maybe single words from a sentence, but these two languages are pretty different, from listening
Yeah, that's what I said
We're not scandinavia, not nordics, but northern eruope
I know, I just feel like "those Czech and Hungarians are our brothers" is not something I would ever actually hear, or have heard (apart from a general euro thing)
I agree
We’re not really Central
Poland has something going with the rest of the Visegrád Group but that’s not us
We have a connection to Poland but nothing else in the region
I'm not angry, everyone's allowed to have an opinion
It's just that there was an other post on this sub, that clasified baltics as central europe, and many people (mostly others, not baltic people) disagreed, and said they think it was northern, so I thought it's a commond thing to think, but I guess not
It probably depends on the POV too, if you're from spain, you would probably classify lithuania as northern, other thing when you're from norway
Probably, becouse of the post-soviet state of pretty much all the european countries that are still or were bordering russia
Even though there are a lot of russians here, the anti-russian sentiment is prominent
Wellthats mostly on business side of things I guess
Tried it for the first time a few months ago, didn't get it
It's just sausage with sauce
What's so special about it
I guess it's similar to Swedish meatballs, cheap frozen mass-produced food that's easy to prepare
For me, buckwheat, salt, water, some butter is all I need to make a meal
Then I find stuff like [this] online and feel like a shit-kicker
Ah, well I’m not sure we have one
Could another Lithuanian please show me if we have one
I’d like to know now
Haha, I think I prove your hypothesis correct
Coronavirus is really the least of my worries :D best of luck to you
Maybe our [basketball anthem
[This] song is pretty much our second anthem, always played during competitive sports matches
Everyone knows the lyrics, it's very approachable, easy to listen
However, now that I think of it, its never really played anywhere but sporting matches
Hence, I would argue [this] is our true second national anthem, as you can play it at any event - be it a concert or a memorial
The first few chords are enough to make people pull out their lights and sing along
Andrius Mamontovas is our national treasure

what about [Ant Kalno Mūrai] ?
i love rabbit
deer isn't that common but we do eat it and ducks are very common to eat
Same, my Lidl recently had rabbits
My ancestors moved here from Africa
From the more common ones: Vandenilis (H), Azotas (N), Deguonis(O), fun fact about it: deguonis in lithuanian is literally "something that burns"), Auksas (Au), Sidabras (Ag), Anglis (C), Helis (He)
So from the more commonly found (culturally) ones, most don't work with the symbols, but when you go to the more uncommon ones, like Litis(Li), Wolframas(W), Manganas(Mn), Bizmutis(Bi), most work
That's really nice to hear
Basketball
I hate it and it's fucking everywhere
Front pages on the news, basketball players are giving speeches at public events, they're in ads, the city councils are donating tons of money to the teams, they're like national heroes or some shit
I think that 1/3 of kebabs usually have no onions by default
No, not common
Never heard this joke
The Grand Duke of the time slept on the hill and dreamed an Iron wolf that should protect the city
So there's that
There's a saying in lithuanian that goes "neapeina" or "neapeina man". It roughly translates to "it's not walking around", although it means "i don't care".
"Not my circus, not my monkeys", interesting, in Lithuania we have "Not my pigs, not my beans" which has the same meaning
Hmm maybe that our language is the oldest in Europe
Our country was extended to the Black Sea

r/photoshopbattles where u at
Yup, Vilnius is doing a lot to make the city centre friendlier to pedestrians
Trains
The strangest thing driving through Poland was always the amount of those ads and billboards
Every square meter of any public facing building was covered
And not some nice ads by Coca Cola or Samsung, but signs about key makers, mechanics and the like made with MS Word
Yeah, that was a bit of shocker one of the first few times I visited Poland
Billboards, advertisements - EVERYWHERE
Not exactly sure why we didn't have it so bad it here in Lithuania
Great
Now norway should stop oil drilling and earth polluting
Yeah, same experience travelling through Poland
In terms of ads in cities it's way different, mainly because our cities had anti random ads policies for a couple of decades now iirc
You can have ads in designated places in cities like Vilnius, but those places are reserved by big billboard agencies, so only bigger companies can afford to advertise on city billboards
It's different near highways, there are quite a few ugly billboards that random small companies advertise on
And in the old town of Vilnius even the store sign above your business door need to adhere to certain standards
Also small businesses are not as prevalent here as in Poland (we do have them, just less), so not as much things to advertise
Not necessary
If norway would top oildrilling the prices would increase, now oil price is only 50usd per barrel which oil community is not happy about it, they want to be more
And reduced supply would increased more to maybe 60usd per barrel and price increase would reduce demand for oil
Everyone would win
AH SHIT I SLIPE
Dangerous, but a very clever statement
they only started one, pretty shit record
2019 was soooo last decade
Shhh
Don't you dare to ruin my joke
And nowadays Facebook groups make these morons even more plentiful and stubborn
Gosh, America dun goofed this time, fellas
"Pretty good run"
Fun fact - Reich Chancellery was owned by Lithuanian nobleman family Radvilos (Radziwiłł) - very powerful and one of the wealthiest families in Europe - before being acquired by Prussia in 1869
Hitler organised to build new Chancellery and they were connected by that Fuhrerbunker
This is a deeply sad day for all Parisians and French people, and to an extension the entire world

Well, now that it's playing, I'm obliged to listen to it to its end, I don't get rick rolled much these days

POV: You are 30 yo Lithuanian in EC, and you know how to do memes
And weirdly, our second quarantine doesn't even start until Saturday (or maybe Monday
Rare to see a fellow Lithuanian in hot on Reddit
There was Kęstutis Pūkas in the Lithuanian parliament
Pūkas literally translates to "fluffy". [Total Chad
] Married five times and has 9 kids
Impeached for sexual harassment
I think it's just strawberries with whipped cream
My man is celebrating in style
> Pūkas literally translates to "fluffy".
More like "fluff". It's a noun, not an adjective
As a Lithuanian, I find this very funny, thank you
In Lithuania he is in the Peasants party which is officially Peasants and Greens Party but realistically it's anything but green
Party leader is an agriculture tycoon who imports nasty Russian fertilizer and drives an Escalade
Being green is absolutely the last thing in their list of goals
"Čėdyti" is a dialectical loanword from the Slavic languages meaning "to save, protect, put aside", and it's appropriate as Virgin-ijus is the Commissioner for the Environment, Oceans and Fisheries

Lithuanian in a sketch:
hmm
so Lenin is Tatarian
I guess Lithuanians are known for their legendary chins
I'm developing feelings for that guy
well, nationality in this case ment exactly the same as ethnicity
It’s quite obvious they are talking about the lithuanian savant Mikalojus Tešla
Moldova can into coastline
I would say that Iceland here is misrepresented the most
Yea but the concert was in 1991 after [failed coup] (pro soviet people tried to overthrow pro democratic government but they failed) and in general USSR in 1991 was already was different to what it was in 1985
American movies and western books were very strictly controlled and censored in the USSR
I still have a bunch of books from those days
Western culture was usually depicted as vapid, perverted and all that
A lot of those books are from the Zenith series, it's science fiction about space travel and all that
In one of them a USSR spaceship finds an abandoned american ship
They board it and find porn magazines scattered around, porn posters on the walls, etc
Music was equally restricted, you just couldn't get most Western records, smuggling of music was a thing
We did have access, but not legally
As I said, stuff was smuggled, some people had radio receivers to listen to Radio Free Europe, it was an american-funded news station which broadcasted to all the occupied countries around Russia
USSR government tried banning receivers capable of receiving that signal, so people built their own out of spare parts
What the hell is wrong with Ireland
We lithuanians are white as our white bread, not paper
The girl be very white tho
wtf Ireland
I hope this is the end of this now
Yeah
Instead of a man, like Ireland

That's cool
Yay, it's independence day

In Lithuania it started snowing in November
When I was there for Christmas it was raining most of the time and it was miserable
Ans it turns out they have no good beers to even drown the sadness
Just some cheap pisswasser
And when leaving Prague the plane was late 2h so connecting flight lost our baggage
I am into all kinds of dark beers
Stouts, Porters - intense ones
And good luck finding anything of sorts in Prague
I had a few locals guide me to some bars but maybe I am spoiled in Vilnius and Copenhagen but these were disappointing
why though
*roman salute lmao
It's a shitshow on a level never seen before
OK, whatever, let the UK burn if that's what they want

I moved to Europe from the US in February and I was planning on only staying a year to travel and now, I don't think I'm ever going back
I had a great opinion about the US when Obama was in charge (too young for Bush)
Then Trump came and it went to absolute shit in a heartbeat
But democracy is democracy and if Trump is really what Americans want, we just have to deal with it
Now it's time for Belarus
What if your car brakes down in suburbs of Paris and you need to put a yellow vest to change a spare tire

How to enter main road from a side road as a lorry driver in the eastern bloc:
Check if there are lorries on the main road, if not - you have right of way
There are Italians, and then there are Sicilians
I still have PTSD after driving there
I firmly believe 60% of Sicilian drivers never passed a single exam
In highways they are OK but cities are each man for himself kinda deal
Right of way
HAHAHAHHAHAAA

I went to Rome immediately after Sicily
It felt like being in Germany
The contrast is insane
In Rome they let you cross the pedestrian crossings
The only one who didn't was a priest in a Ferrari
He could have delivered me to the god faster
Scotland definitely needs to be independent
It will be really difficult for UK to return, and the conditions won't be as nice as they were
I'm certain that Schengen and Euro will have to be adopted if they'll want back into the Union

Rather foolish of her expecting police to be able to read
Request to see the reports so far, please
Thank you
At least people are trying to change things in their country, ye most people know that it might be useless, but they are still trying
Least we could do is support it morally even if it adds nothing to the cause
I keep seeing the same post every goddamn protest in totalitarian government regime
Your post is on the verge "everything is useless, nothing will change and we should do nothing, because everything is useless"
damm
true
This looks like lithuanian capital Vilnius sort of too
Poland is the most Christian country in Europe, not surprising
You're Belarussian and you think that
Did you skip your history class
5 million is too low for stalin
There are estimates, that the [Holodomor] was \~4 million deaths alone
And later, after his death, there were discovered 800
000 confirmed kills just from archives alone (deaths, where the person was not deported, but just brought to a mass grave and shot, like [Kurapaty] And of course, there were \~1
7 million death in gulags
The full total is set to be around 20 million, but those are only estimates

Thanks, CGP Grey
Good on you
I support it too, since I think people should have the power to decice all the time, not most of the time
Stay strong belarussians

Our government is working on letting people, who were injured in protests, be taken care of in our hospitals
You are all welcome here
I propose a union state with Belarus and Lithuania, and possibly huge chonks of Ukraine and Poland for good measure
Anyone in favor
Situation is a bit different, Crimea had a strategic port
Belarus does not have a strategic value at the moment
Taking even part of it has no real value for Russia
Not to mention economy of Belarus regions is even worse than that of Russia
To add to that, eventual occupation of another region would be very very expensive in terms of military expenditure and Russia for the all the appearances has real financial issues at the moment, oil, the main cash cow of Russia has dropped in price quite a lot
Overall slowed down world economy due to covid does not help either
Exactly, a buffer state, therefore it is not worth it to occupy it
If they want to put pro Russian by force, they will have to stay there to enforce, ergo occupation, ergo no buffer
The best bet is not to interfere directly
It would take decades for Belarus to get anywhere near EU and NATO on its own
They aren't. Why should they be
Neither of Koreas is occupied last time I checked
How is the flow of the war even relevant here
Why do you assume that Belarus will even lean west
Ya that is nearly not enough to mean anything of you compare it to Ukraine for example, which started from a thing called Euro Maidan
Untill we see Russian military actually acting in Belarus, those pledges are empty
In Lithuanian Venezia is Venecija, so pretty close
Paris is Paryžius, though
Yeah, we took that random ž thing for Paris to Lithuanian, too

And it has to do with Europe fuck all

Now I get it
I get that it most of the city's inhabitants didn't quite have a choice whether they want to live there under communism, but why would anyone subject themselves to life in such an utterly depressing and dangerous place these days
Identity politics is a cancer upon society
Maybe if you fucking asshats wouldn't shit on white cis males as "oppressors" all the goddamn time we wouldn't be in this fucking mess
We do not live in a patriarchal society
The Middle East does though
According to the language you use, feminism is all about power nowadays, not equality
Why don't you let people do whatever they want to do instead of attaching some sort of boogie-man of a 'patriarchy' to it
Equality of opportunity is in place in most Western countries
Show me one law where it says otherwise and I might be willing to agree with you, but the current rhetoric about this patriarchy, power structures and other identity politics nonsense that seems to demonize men just seems pulled straight out of power-hungry, bitter people's asses
I hope the violence finally ends
The former president is true enemy of the state
He should give up and let Belarus be a free country

Their former president is kinda going crazy
There were reports that he landed in helicopter holding AK-47 (if I remember right)

The amount of nazi defenders in this comment section, wtf
The guy got killed by nazis, the nazis are the problem
There's no "but".
It's always the self-proclaimed defenders of the West who breach western values like democracy and human rights
I wonder that, too
I'm not praising the guy who died
I don't care if his music sucks
Tell me again that he deserved to die

Let's hope our order and justice in Lithuania will never again be that popular
They have pretty similar views also
Wait
I thought gays are the #1 threat

Yea, my conservatives are some of the most socially liberal
somehow
I voted for the other liberals, though
They at least mentioned climate change in their program
If Lithuania then add half green and half blue

Lithuania here, 15 euro for a stable 950 upload and download, plus a stable 1ms latency because it's all optical fiber cable
But there is also similar specs to yours for 10 euro/month from an another provider
In Lithuania this costs around 15-20 eur
Probably you should mention that you can achieve this speed only connected via wire
Wireless would reach only about 400mbps
But that ping tho

When and in what context was this foto taken
This gave a needed chuckle
His political views suck ass
This statement is so fucked up
Like how many nations did Red Army freed
And how many were lets say "Under new management"?
And lets point out again
It was war which they started together with Nazis by invading yours Finland and Poland :D So fuck Hemingway on this one
Mankind
Maybe to themselves
Say that to enslaved innocent civilians from Soviet countries
Wow such a dumbass view
You do realize the only reason Finland was on Nazis side is because like few years before Soviets tried to occupy Finland just like Baltic countries
Because fuck I would been killing Soviets on Nazi side for such things too
This is not about "choice". It is about some genocidal regime trying to pose themselves as freedom fighters as first comment suggests
While being just another murderous regime
Nobody in Lithuania "had a choice" at that time
They were forcefully occupied
Oh yes I can agree with that
But it is just two totalitarian regimes killing millions because of their leader ambitions
There are no "saviors' in that battle
Just two bloody regimes killing own people
Well we will never know whom I would been
But I sure I would not join today
And if Hitler was such antislav why Stalin signed Molotov-Ribentrop pact
He sure was all buddy buddy with him when he got what he wanted
Yeah man, there was no internet back then
And in 1940 only one regime had wronger Lithuanian people
So people acted accordingly
Until they realized who occupied them again
Soviets saw no problem bombing Helsinki during Winter war
So karma is a bitch
Yeah I am well aware of that
But Stalin had no problem with it
Oh he is no slav actually :D Explain a lot
I had good lough of this :D
Could someone explain who is Oswald and what did he do to be hated so much
So he got beaten just because he had an unpopular opinion
Alrighty

Letting commie pig dog army pass through states on their way to "help" Czechoslovakia would have ensured earlier commie block establishment
You know considering how the Soviet-occupied countries ended up like post-WW2 with deportations and repressions, I genuinely doubt Spain would be better off if it came under Stalinist influence
Many movements like labour unions existed before Marx shared out his mistake lmao
Communists merely latched onto these movements, negatively impacting them
It's called April Fool's because you have to be a total fool to buy into far left propaganda
> USSR was not communist
It was socialist
Can you even call it that
I'd call it state capitalist
But regardless of those semantics, if all known attempts to make communism happen end in authoritarianism, then can you call communism innocent
I don't think so
EDIT: Your point about democratic approaches is valid - it hasn't been done and it might be much better, but is it possible at all
I have doubts about that
It would have a place in this world of ever-increasing automation, especially if it gets to the point where it really starts to cause large amounts of unemployment, but how would it be executed
Yeah because modern day socialists are the exact same as communists of interwar period
"Lol you can't compare all communists to Stalin
Also all capitalists are exactly like slave owners"
This is your brain on tankieism

Seriously what were the pilots thinking flying over a war zone
Edit: I lol when people think I’m trying to blame the pilots
Nice try
However, if the flight path was around the war zone those lives would be saved
I saw it posted not even an hour after it happened
Crazy stuff
Sorry for your loss
Add to it everyone else who allowed flight path over a war zone
They have their share of the blame
Well the chances of being raped walking through a park at night are higher than during the day time
Just like flying over a war zone has a higher chance of catastrophe than flying around it
Exactly why I said everyone else involved with the flight path fool
“Dolt” wow such a cool insult
Partly
No, never the persons fault for being raped, however precautions can be taken to lower the likelihood of something happening
There will always be bad people in society
Because people think I’m putting the whole blame on the pilots, which I am not

I rode my bike yesterday around noon, had a couple errands to run
Anyway, my bike computer has a thermometer and while I don't trust it 100% (bought in in Lidl for like 7€) it [heated up to 45C] in just a couple minutes of direct sunlight
Riding in the shade against the wind dropped the temperature down to a comfortable 32C.

Hey santa, I hope you are in your sandals
rip
Yes, so much yes
I wish we had a program like that here
I believe we ceded too much space to cars here, especially in the city center, some of the parking lots could be converted into public squares and green zones
Knowing how sometimes it is hard to find a parking space it is angering, but knowing how food it is for the world makes it amazing
Cars being a status symbol doesn't mean they offer you more freedom than a comprehensive public+private transport system
Carshare, micromobility and public transport, when a city has enough supply, is, I would say, even more convenient
Say I want to go downtown to have a coffee - I can walk to get some exercise, halfway there I might want to hurry up so I hop on an escooter
Say, on my way home I want to pick up a few bags of groceries that I don't want to haul to the bus - I grab the nearest car share and drive myself home
It's really not as utopian as it may sound - I have been living like this for a few years now in Vilnius (not the most well funded or innovative city by far)
Before Covid I'd estimate my budget for travel was probably in the 60€-80€ range per month
Now between parking fees, maintenance, gas, insurance and everything else, I'd say that's waaaay less than it would be to own a car
Obviously each person's lifestyle is different, but having a well put together multimodal transit system would do very well for a LOT of people
My city has started implementing this Park & Ride thing
Parking lots on the edge of the city where you park your car for cheap and then get on a bus or an electric scooter or whatever
You get a free bus ticket if you pay for parking there
Not with that attitude, it doesn't. London already has more remote towns with train lines to London considered as 'commuter' towns
If fast and accessible public transport is available to larger cities, people will live there
Urban life is not for everyone after all, and places within an hour of bigger cities, given good public transport, could be extremely attractive options
Islsmists were triggered by some old cartoons
That's all it takes, that's how fragile and on the edge they are
I've seen another pole elsewhere saying that it is allowed only during first trimester, which means a doctor needs to rule that there is a threat to the life of a mother in 12 weeks after conception, which means it is basically banned as well as it is unlikely to happen even if you try, because there is not enough time
So maybe that was mixup which mislead me, I remember him saying that rape and danger to life under the same conditions
Eitherway, if danger to life is possible to prove, good luck proving rape in 12 weeks
Nobody cares
Putin can kill as much people as he want
He has nukes and he is untouchable

Aww Lithuania so cute :)

Yea but there is lithuania in it ant it joined 2004

Women also read more, are more likely to be teachers, and more likely to play musical instruments

So I wouldn't say that list is very accurate

Technically this is wrong as Belarus changed to their independence flag after their exit from the Soviet Union
We use the grand duchy flag as our state flag
Nah man it looks too communist
Nu uh
The lithuanian flag has been changed since
Before, it was simply the coat of arms in a red background
It looked too "communist" so we changed it
Yeah, he's right
The amount of red has really strong associations with communism and most people don't want to be reminded of the thing that weakened our country so much
It is a really good looking flag, but it's just too traumatic for people to see
Especially considering that there are 40 year olds that still remember a siege of the Vilnius TV tower
The russian goverment literally killed 13 unarmed people and injured a lot more
Yeah, but tge thing is you can't remember these times
Maybe lithuania was the strongest, but there are no people to remember it
Just like a photo doesn't show the true beauty of a place, a history book won't show you what were those times like, you know
Standing in a screaming crowd of people surrounded by tanks, seeing people lose their limbs or even lives, feeling the heat and sweat is more than enough to cause stronger feelings than a simple book, or a TV programme
Thats the thing people in lithuania associate the color red with
Besides, times change
Imagine this: you're cool, you have a lot of friends, but all of a sudden you lose them
Are you going to talk about  how you were the coolest person in your group of friends, or are you going to change and accept the fact that you're not as great as you were before
P.S
The situation I described happenned in 1991, (for refrence) just 5 years before eminem released his first album
I know that you're not familiar with a lot of the lithuanian history, I am not Familiar with the estonian history, but you calling this dumb would insult a lot of people in lithuania, so you know
Just saying
I wouldn't say that it's to far fetched
Look at the communist and our old flag
Just make the knight smaller, move it to a corner and boom
You don't even have to add anything
There are probably differences between estonian and lithuanian mentlaities that make our opinions differ
Whees the ŚÍ poster
But for real what did police in europe do to deserve this
Do they have the authority to do that
Latvian police, just like most European countries', don't choke black people for funzies, don't spray peaceful protesters with tear gas and don't injure AND murder innocent people in cold blood
While this American problem is a good opportunity to give some thought to racism, true justice and equality, there is no excuse for things like protests/hooliganism against the European police, especially in Latvia
Hell, there aren't many black people there either
There aren't many here, in Lithuania, either, so no one really bothers and racism is mostly non-existent (just like in the most part of Europe, I guess)
Good job, Braliukas

Funny how most of unfriendly countries are countries that were in their treaty of friendship, aka Warsaw pact

No surprise at all, Lithuania is the longest and most vocal, harsh critic of Kremlin Government
It should tell you a lot about state of our relationship with Russia when i say this
Our last high profile diplomatic meeting was back in 2011, when our previous President Dalia Grybauskaitė met Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
Since 2000 when Putin was first elected, we understand from the start, the danger Putin will probably pose to Lithuania
And our fears were confirmed soon enough, when we saw Russia's regression and the backsliding in terms of Democracy, Press Freedom, Freedom of Expression
What didn't help also, is long history of Russian imperialism, that Lithuania and its neighbors have suffered from
If anyone interested to know more about Lithuanian History, i recommend everyone to read this [The History of Lithuania in PDF]

I'll wear that as a badge of honour
Ah yes the second biggest threat and "unfriendly" nation to Russian Federation is the mighty Republic of Lithuania
Gotta love the Kremlin's dog brain propaganda
Thanks Russia, right back at you ;)
This is a very proud moment for lithuanians
Feeling proud
Top 9 most based countries in the world
You bet your ass we’re not friendly

Yay
And also sucks

no shit
Wow ok
That's rude :(
Feel quite proud of it for some reason
Is this how mosquitos feel
Hey, that's me
I wouldn't say the Baltics have a great relationship with the big ol' russians
Especially with Lithuania and the whole past stuff
I am a bit surprised there is no France on it
I always heard people saying French do not like tourists, but I dunno if it is true so don't take my word for it
"unfriendly" well no shit based on how much pain Russia caused to some of those countries
Ah, badge of honor
Truly
Welcome to the Club :)
Glad to see it's not only us, good jo
When the live TV showed NATO fighter jets landing for the first time (symbolic, but still), I felt a weight lifting - a hidden weight I never knew I carried
Watching those poor Sakartvelians and Ukrainians getting harassed by the revolting bully still feels like that moment most of us have had at least once: stopping crossing the street a split second before a truck roars by
For my money, let's double defense spending to 4% GDP and buy a battalion of those Abrams USA still makes as a jobs program and has no use of
Or 1000 Stingers - just to make the bully remember *that other place*.
Dodged a bullet
It is sad that Russian has rolled into another cycle of authoriatrian rule
Most of the countries in the list are small and don't give a flying f*ck - just like those tiny psycho dogs which yip and bite without fear
All that doesn't sound like Finland at all :)
Šaunuoliai braliukai

They might try to use your country as fifth column
Sure, come for a visit - wonderful countries
And if you want you can even move here like some serbians I know did
I think you'll love it
Uraine's biggest mistake was not walking together with Poland, Romania, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania into EU and NATO
Amen man
While Baltic countries worked hard for this, but you must admit luck was on our side
Luck which happens rarely in history
I dont think current NATO would dare to expand this close to Russia
Especially after Sakartvel and Ukraine

Interesting, though unsurprising, which one
My pop spent a decade in the Russian north and used to say that there are two countries inside Russia: the good people ('russkaja dusha') and the evil government ('rak')
Being a militant atheist, he compared that to Italy and the Vatican :)
We don't consider you our enemies too
Just *the Vatican*. And that *pope*. It's not as if you voted freely ever since the time of Yeltsin
... 1917
Right
It's been 7 years and somehow the separatists are still getting new weapons and tanks
I wonder how Russia missed tanks rolling from Russia towards Mariupol in 2014
There's a difference between placing nuclear missiles in Cuba and conducting drills
Those nukes were also in an era before ICBMs were common
But I don't expect them to be totally OK with it
What I expect is them to stop pretending that Baltic states are their territory
When did Sweden, Poland or Germany last claim the three countries to be their rightful territories
When did they ethnically cleanse them and are now defending those ethnic cleansings
Exactly
It is in same loop permanently
>and never will
Nothing lasts forever
I'm honestly surprised they're not trying harder to ensure sea access in the Danish strait, historically it's been one of the main geographic factors hindering Russia's geopolitical strength and even economic development
Sorry but NO
Fuck all Russians
No political correctness here
You have managed to have fucked up government for 100 years who occupy, kill and rape other nations
And even now this moment you have such government
At last you should take some responsibility for this
Your nation could have slipped ones or twice
But you really had something humane only for 10ish years since 1990-2000
Russia is a flat circle
Wait till many Russians demand that you be thankful for "liberating" you from Nazis in about 2½ weeks ;)
LOL
Russians are the biggest snowflakes
My narrative is one sided - because only one side is still arguing that ethnic cleansing was "acceptable" and acts like they own the whole of eastern europe
When there's a stable consensus in Russian society about the evils of mass murder and mass deportations - then you can come back with this bunkum claim
And no
I'm not going to be "thankful", just because some ignorant person on the internet told me to be
My both parents are Russian and my existence is miracle already
because the same communists already killed ¾ of my family by 1940 and exiled my family to central asia twice after that

I grew up in one of those
It's like living in a giant park
Every apartment building has their own area, but there were no fences or anything, so all the kids just roam from block to block and play anywhere they want
Many apartment blocks (especially Khrushchevki) actually had their ground floors reserved for retail spaces

The ridiculousness of oversaturarion in this pic takes away from its beauty
It's a super cool idea, but the cost of building this comes around at a million to few million euros, so it's a huge investment +taking into consideration that the movement on a highway is stopped for at least a few days it's a huge cost
It's a super cool idea and it's a good thing to build them, I was even lucky enough to see a highway in Alberta full of these, but what I took away from it, is that building a strech of road long enough, for these to be effective is just too costly for the near future
That's quite the sausage fest

There's not a high chance of Islamic terrorism in my country, so seeing the amount of comments from local Christians that rather that reacting by *"Oh ####, somebody got brutally murdered"*, mostly begin with *"He should have respected religion"* is what worries me

Haven't heard this idiom in Lithuania
Not in my surroundings at least
Some people may say something similar to "you're speaking Chinese" and Lithuanians would understand the phraseology, but it's not commonly used
What I *have* heard (and used myself) is a phase "bird language", as in "you're speaking bird language
" Personally I would use this phrase when describing a language I don't understand or the one that sounds very foreign, also when somebody's describing something in very specific or technical terms that I don't understand
Eh, bird language is more commonly used in this context than Chinese
Once again Lithuania and Latvia are missing
What is bizzare is that I never heard in Lithuania "It's like Chinese to me", so I googled, and the only usage of the phrase is in various dictionaries
So, literally no one says that in Lithuania
Just to be more interesting,
In Lithuania we also say "paukščių kalba" - bird's language
Personally I hear this idiom way more than "Chinese"
What a polished pun
and they pack bananas in plastic
Well this war helped us to break free from Russian Empire
Quite sad that German Empire didn't win this one
You concider this a victory
20 million people dead and you think this is a victory
Sure, it gave many nations independence
The second world war at least had a point
Eliminating evil
But in WW1 no-one achieved anything
Made the life of Europeans even worse
As the war gave birth to the soviet union and the nazi party
So I wouldn't consider it a victory
More of a loss to all countries
Like I mentioned, many countries gained independence with blood and hard work
Mine did too
It's just a fact, that generally speaking, the war didn't have a point
It started with a wrong guy being in the wrong place
And it's effects on the world are still seen today
Almost half of the dead were civilian casualties
The war was the cause of the Russian revolution, and the Nazis
While there were good things achieved, and they impact modern society today, they barely outweight the bad things

I understand that there are long history of pain between us, but i want to believe that many adequate citizens of my country will agree with me and wish your country only best
I am glad that future of your country now in hands of its people

Same for you my friend
Make sure to keep strong stance against imperialistic Russia, don't step your foot back, because they moment you do they will put theirs in that place

Tips depend on the time you spend here
But I would say, visit Vilnius and Trakai
Book something in the old town of Vilnius, its not expensive
Then visit Klaipeda and the curonian spit
Visit our UNESCO heritage dunes
Its something really
I would advise to have at least 3 days for a stay in Lithuania
It will be packed, and you wont regret it
If you want more, theres more to do

It works in whole baltics, youll get a fair price everytime
Dont sit to a taxi out of the airport
They're expensive
If you need a car quick, you can always take a city bee, its easier to rent than conventional car rents
You can pick the car up and leave it in designed spots or even other cities
Taste cepelinai and saltibarsciai
Also taste out our beers, you'll like it
We love dutch beer, but I am sure we have worthy beer also
A lot of us speak english
So approach anybody if needed, ofcourse younger people speak better
Lithuania is quite safe, so no special tips for pickpocketing, we dont have that much
Oh, and have a mini umbrella
Some clothes to withstand rain
It rains here, as in the Netherlands I suppose
And enjoy your time
If you need any help, you can write me a PM, or come to r/lithuania , we would be happy to assist you in any matter
Edit: also check this site:
As a Lithuanian expat that lives in the Netherlands, prepare to see less smily people :/
Please research cepelinai and šaltibarščiai
Don't dive head first
I had too many guests not able to stomach both of these dishes
I would rather you have a good opinion of Lithuanian cuisine, that is much broader than those two
And don't get a full portion of cepelinai without knowing what you're getting into - unless you're preparing to participate in a strongman competition
If you wish to have a great culinary experience - book Sweetroot restaurant in Vilnius well in advance
It's one of the most amazing experiences that I had
It takes about 3 hours and costs about €70 per person
Not really, they had cultural superiority but not political
Ive got plenty of guests to smash them both
Its fine, people eat fries all the time, and those are worse than cepelinai for sure
French fries are very simple in flavour
Don't contain minced pork and aren't covered in sour cream with smoked side bacon bits and onions
(I love that, but it's definitely a strong mix of flavours)
The fermented milk is typically the issue with šaltibarščiai
Let alone - those are just total cliché...

East Europe has this most probably
Well yeah, but looking back 20 years and you see huge progress everywhere, so there really is nothing special compared to any other european country
Draw a Lithuanian one
Why do they even care
Proving once again - tax funded media is very fallible and majority rule is simply crap
I disagree on the term colonialism used, but Polish Kingdom was definitely imperialistic - Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Russians and Belarusians
I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that it has Lithuanian flag inside it

And then do it some more since she will probably die early from obesity related causes
Goddamit Lithuania, we could be cool, be no, marriage is too much
I am honestly amazed how homophobic Lithuania is
The shit they comment on a wholsome post just because it is a gay couple and if they have a kid it is always "poor kid" how is he poor
He has a loving home
Based eastern europe
Estonia did, Lithuania is "thinking" about it, a lot of soviet and religious scum are against it, some of that scum is in parliament, so outcome is not certain
Not sure about Latvia
Nah, the mentality of soviet relics is anti-gay, the mentality of religious nuts who got their freedom from soviets is also anti-gay
It'll be a long time until we see full LGBT acceptance here, which is sad
Soviet shadow still poisons our minds, also relogious nuts
I don't see anything wrong with people being religious, considering in reality religion tells them to respect everyone
It's just a lack of education on the matter mixed with a feeling of supremacy with a facade of "my religion is against this
Not many left in Lithuania parliament
It's very likely to happen soon
Hopefully our first gay parliament (Tomas Raskevičius) member with Armonaitė will change things
I've personally talked with that dude a couple years back, he's incredibly productive and loves helping people out
I'm 100% sure he'll be the first step to improve LGBT issue in our country
In the legal sense I mean, because he's already done a lot of good things for the LGBT community (especially the T part) in five years than the entire government of 20 years work
Hopefully
Well we've recently had an openly gay couple on a magazine, though idk if that LGBT propaganda,and we have had some small scale parades
Lithuania, everyone I know supports gay marriage but not the damn govmt, hence not cool
Backlash based on emotions is irrelevant and invalid anyways
Snowflakes will snowflake
> our first gay parliament (Tomas Raskevičius)
Not the first one in the Parliament, not even the first openly gay MP - there was [Rokas Žilinskas] before him
Raskevičius is definitely much more active and outspoken about the equal rights, though
Oh, completely forgot about him, you're right thank you for correcting me
Well I the younger ppl do, it's just that the more conservative parties keep getting elected, by older ppl
I love how something only concerning gay people isn't decided by gay people
Democracy failure
So they want to "seem progressive" instead of
actually being progressive

Ukraine is not a EU or NATO member, so backing them against Russia would technically be an act of aggression rather than one of defence

We lithuanians had to decomission our only nuclear powerplant - the Ignalina NPP
It used the same RBMK reactors that Chernobyl did
The decomissioning was one of the requirements to join the EU in 2004
It's mostly wood, not solar or anything
We're still burning shit
Generation losses plus transmission losses is in the same ballpark as vehicle internal combustion engine energy losses
With the current infrastructure and technology electric isn't always the cleanest option, it's just that it is easier to deal with the pollution of power plants versus various methods of pollution that is caused by individuals such as by driving personal vehicles
Some politicians in Lithuania said that the people responsible for these sham elections will be banned from entering Lithuania, and we'll work to ban them from entering EU at all
EU can't force it's member states to do so, but if the member states decided to do it on their own I don't think there is anything that could stop them
I'd like to note that obesity in Lithuania is very age-specific
Old people (and especially old grandmas) genuinely don't give a fuck and they mostly eat a carbohydrate diet (pastas, porridges, potato dishes) which makes them balloon
Obesity among the post-Soviet generation isn't widespread, it's actually fairly rare and the "Healthy at any size" movement isn't sticking
Cross refrence this with a map showing  bullying experienced by children in europe

Surely OP is referring to Dalia Grybauskaitė, a karate black belt
As a Lithuanian I can confirm that the president is much more scarier to fight than any bodyguard
She is a fucking black belt and can fire guns like a pro

The woman is the Lithuanian president

Poland is like Europe's China, they make everything

Thank you for your time writing this and bringing such issues to attention
Man I remember in 00s I saw Google like: "Yeah they are big but at the same time they are doing bunch of cool and *good* things". And years before they even removed the "Don't be evil" motto it turned to "fuckers are too big and went from doing *good things* to straight up illegal shit".
EDIT: Some comments pop up, so - Yes, they didn't remove the [Don't be evil] from their code of conduct
Just trimmed the explanation and moved it slightly to [the very end as a footnote/last sentence] My mistake but either way this is a shift in culture either way

Copenhagen is such a small town

>How to recognize a neo-communist in a few easy steps:

Unironically thinks that any and every foreign policy of the US is neo-colonialism in disguise
Unironically calls Americans faschists
Supports or denies any crimes against humanity, commited by the USSR, China or other totalitarian socialist republics
"Every kid that was sent to a GULAG and starved to death was a Nazi imperialist, who totally deserved it because America did slavery 100 years ago".
These cheap ass bots aren't even trying to look reasonable
Nobody is insane enough to escalate any conflict into nuclear exchange, not even North Korea, its an atrocity and could escalate other countries to resort to nuclear weapon usage, which has catastrophic potential to undo human development in centuries or millennia even
On other hand, joining the NATO reduces the chance of these countries becoming targets of conventional war because they have the deterrent that both Ukraine and Georgia lacked
Technically only Albania
It was in pact like for month :D Still counts as one
Regardless of where you are, if nukes get involved, it will cause a chain reaction and all of humanity is doomed
Don't see what you're hinting at

I'll try to list the references (left to right):
Mushrooms: [Lithuanians love mushroom picking] The brown one is the king of all mushrooms Baravykas (Boletus)
Basketball: I feel this one is obvious
8th in the world according to FIBA, 107th according to FIFA
Curd snack: that red square underneath the cat is a sweet snack made from curd cheese
[Specifically this one] I would call it a small cheesecake instead of a curd snack (courtesy of Wikipedia
Pink Soup: a traditional Lithuanian cold beet soup often enjoyed during the summer (but don't try and stop me)
[Almost as popular as pubs in UK
Vilnius TV Tower: one of the biggest symbols of Vilnius and whole Lithuania
A historical monument that represents freedom from USSR occupation
[see January Killings]
Necklace: not sure about this one
It could either be [dehydrated apples] or "baranka" ([Russian bublik]
Books: "Dievų miškas" (Forest of the Gods) a very dramatic memoir about concentration camps
"Balta drobulė" (White Shroud) an eclectic psychological book about life in WWII Lithuania and USA
"Altorių šešėly" (In the Shadow of Altars) dramatic take on the thoughts and doubts of a priest
[Gediminas' Tower] top shelf
The symbol of Vilnius and the only remaining part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Castle of Gediminas
([visualisation]
Šakotis: bottom shelf
Although regarded as a German pastry, Šakotis or the tree cake is now synonymous with Lithuania
[It has a very difficult making technique] and is often brought as a gift
The book in bookshelf (top one)is Forest of god's by Balys Sruoga my favourite I have read it like million times and yes it have English version
Unrealistic
"Altorių šešėly" should be [thicker]
(Jk of course this looks great)
It looks very Lithuanian, but the TV tower is blue at night
But great job
Everything is very on point, well done
There's a basketball, šaltibarščiai, sūrelis, TV tower, mushrooms and one of my favorite Lithuanian books, Dievų Miškas (Forest of Gods)
It's a dark comedy about life in a nazi concentration camp

Reaminds me to go mushroom pickin'
All nice ant local, but that particular brand of snack is actually made by Latvian company
(and yes they are my favorite by far)
Where's Gediminas tower
Where's Katedros Aikštė? Where's the view over Laisvės Alėja
While I like the effort put in, it lacks some Lithuanian-ness in it
Also cepelinai

Im very happy that it was cool and fun for you:)

Baumkuchen is a bit different isn't it
It's layered and smooth, the dough is added with a paintbrush looking thing
funny thing, I took the book today from my school's library for Lithuanian class
And now I see it here lol
No they are not
Dont be misteken by the name
company is in Luksiai, Šakiu country
Šakotis is layered too, the dough is poured on it while it slowly rotates over a fire
A lot of people colloquially call šakotis "baumkuchenas" or "bankuchenas".
It's a great book
The only book I enjoyed reading from start to finish at school for Lithuanian classes
doesn't matter, had snack :)
Maybe the paper packaged ones are made in LT and plastic packaged in LV ? ... I could swear I read it's made in Latvia on one package, but no matter, HAD SNACK :)
I've had a bunch that were pretty cool: Benedikto slenksčiai was a cool book but I think it's new in the system, Faust was also very fascinating
Altorių šešėly has good reviews but it's pretty damn long
700 pages for 2 weeks of schooltime lol
Nop
URIGA is 100% Lithuanian brand :)
I hope that all cities will be like this one day

Also, as the photo in the OP is taken from very far away, the distance between the buildings in the foreground and background can be several kilometers

Basically when all major governmental Polish figures died in Russia, in that "accidental" plane crash, Polish people should have been very careful of new election, but they failed and now a Russian puppet is in place and will have Poland leave EU and join the sphere of RU
:/ wish the best of luck to Poles, the road ahead might get bumpy for a few decades to come if not the right choices are made
That's the worst part of it, Russia is already at a point of no return
In this age of information, governments can monitor their subjects easier than ever before and in the coming decade, AI will be sophisticated enough to wade through all internet trafic flagging subjects of interest and automatically calling for a government sancioned hit on the "perpetrator".

I sure hope you are right, by this "Money was always the states pressure point and now this stronghold slowly crumbles" I assume you have in mind crypto-currencies, you might be right, but they already understood the scope of change these currencies can bring, so state initiatives to regulate them are already popping up
Well, good luck and I do actually mean that
It must be hard to live in Russia as an open minded individual
Yeah I have to strongly disagree with this statistic that shows Lithuanian media is 28th and its classified as a problematic while Uruguay had multiple incidents of journalist being hurt in recent years, but sits in 19th place
Our tv channels that we have here are not biased, but based on objective facts and not opinions, lies or propaganda and there is plenty of news and articles that are critical to gov on factual basis . And Lithuanian news sites that we have are also mostly the same: reporting factual news, stories and opinions like what experts think on certain subject
Government here basically never interfere with press freedom and there never as long as i can remember was and incident were Journalist was harassed, beaten, jailed or even killed
When i looked in there assessment of Lithuanian press freedom they wrote about quite miniscule incident ( about how main party of Lithuania tried somewhat temper with press freedom here, which is of course bad, but of course it was denounced and they simply backtracked it )
So basically we have here high standards for press freedom and i would only say that we have to improve more civil activism to protest and etc
I doubt anyone has to do anything to prevent Turkey's membership in EU

>If you were to describe the idea of capitalism to people living under feudalism, they'd laugh you out of the room
Char 1 - the radical thinker-capitalist:
\- I have a radical new idea
How about the people that own the land or the tools keep the results of their work
Char 2 the peasant:
\- Well duh, that's how it works
\- And those people that make money pay a part of it to the local rulers to fund the military, build civic buildings like town halls, markets, roads and give alms to the poor
\- Again that's nothing new, except the church helps the poor, but I suppose that the rulers could do that too
\- And we elect our rulers
\- You mean like we elect the our elder or the guild master
\- Yeah all that and even the king and the dukes
\- Like they do in the Holy roman empire, Venice and Poland-Lithuania
\- Yeah like that
Capitalism would not really surprise a lot of medieval/feudal people, especially if they were from the merchant/tradesmen class
Pretty much the only difference is that you in most cases only lowest officials were elected, and now you pay something like 40% of your income in tax while in the middle ages you paid 10-20%.
Pretty much in every city all over Europe
Most lower officials (elders, guild masters and some other "bureaucrats") were elected and the townspeople had fairly extensive rights
Of course same does not extend in most cases to serfs
And most elements of the capitalist economic model have been going on form much longer then people give them credit just like the few that I mentioned in my shitpost:
Owner of the means of production decides what happens with the production
Wage labour was the norm for the majority of the population (farmers work the nobles fields, they pay a part of the harvest as tax and keep the rest - their wage
Free farmers were exempt from it
Taxation for public services (fewer services, more corruption and lower taxation but you get the point)
International trade with developed networks (when in the 16-th century the Brits chopped down all the yew trees used for making longbows, they started importing staves from the Baltic Hanza towns)
Beautiful buildings

Construction stopped because it was more expensive than expected
Now it's been sitting like this for quite a while
I went there recently, locals said that it will probably never be finished

Doesn't russia really hate gays
I mean I heard that at one point putin banned teching kids that homosexuals exist
I might be wrong, but from the interviews with random people on the street in russia about this topic I've seen that most people don't like homosexuals and believe they shouldn't be allowed to kiss/hug/hold hands in the public
Any russians here who can confirm or deny
Edit: I personally don't think these things and in my opinion they are absolutely outrageous
I'm just curious as to what the russian reddit community thinks about it

Capitalism has lifted the most people out of the poverty this is a fact
I went to future once, I only found a memorial commemorating the awfulness of your takes
OK Anglo
Chapos lierally enraged rn, saying that this sub is fashist because of this post, lmao
Coming from the guy who lived in the lamest country in Yugoslavia
And what is the issue
Many Estonians fought and died on both sides of the war
USSR was a Russian imperialism project, the polled support or hostility towards USSR aligns with polled opinion towards current Russia more than anything
This is a dumb take
The percentages of people living in poverty are steadily dropping, so are stats like preventable disease deaths or child mortality - and subsistence farming in preindustrial conditions is a very fickle affair with constant famines and other misfortunes
That somehow makes me feel better about my country, and that is a very rare feeling
LITHUANIAN HERE
CAN CONFIRM
I love this architecture
So calming and in sync with nature
Lovely town
/u/FellowRedditeer/ account is only spamming the same thing about Finland's conpiracy memes for the last year
can we get him banned
Finland does not exist
exists
nice try
The test and maybe treatment idk is free in Lithuania
Dark side vs light side
Just want to note that I didnt take this picture, I found it on internet
Thank you all for rewards
These shields are common all around Eastern Europe, including my own country
Do you even know what this is
They arent that heavy tho, my country has the same
Do you even know the situation in Belarus
Its not about hating police
Its about struggle for democracy
They literally took their soviet flag and removed sickle and hammer
Hey, I didnt mean to seem rude, just asked
I think that if you fight (peacefully as long as possible) for what you believe is right and dont cause problem for the others (unlike most protests in US atm), you are a good person
Damn, really sad to see no rating for Vatican :(
Distributing pornography is illegal in Lithuania
That's probably a bigger reason
stinks
I know like 3 people who actually believe in god
I think religion is very much overestimated in Lithuania
[For the downvote]
Lol, my grandma
That's 'bout it :D
I think my culture was more influenced by kebab kiosk behind the corner than the church
Yeah I always found our year counting stupid
I would more call it a mark in history, rather than influence
If it wouldn't be counted since "death of Jesus" it would be called something else
Still has the same number of days
I don't know, but I am pretty sure we can find something better
Year 2000 sounds so wrong when you knows there is a lot more of it
Aciu visi
See you on March 11th when our next independence day is celebrated
On behalf of all Lithuanians, I thank you
Aww, thanks bro
Fun fact: because of this reason we have Iceland street in Vilnius and in other towns
You'll be invited on March 11th to celebrate our second independence day
I'm pretty sure, that the Germans were the first to recognize the 1918 February 16th declaration of independence
What about Moldova
Every Lithuanian knows this and we're beyond grateful
That's why every year we say [Takk, Ísland
Dziękuje bardzo :)
It was probably King Mindaugas Day
It's also a big nationwide celebration
free Catalonia
still cute
No, our birthday is on February 16th
Lithuania is independent for 103 years now
Now gib Suvalki
Yeah, you guys demonstred a very strong balls back then, and you deserve to be proud
We are forever grateful
We've had enough of Russia's surprises, thanks
not again
Exept if you're **Actual** commies, Not the bootleg stalinist ones, But i guess if it would be real commies, they wouldn't be invading us all the **god damn** time
Which ones
Besides the UK, they hate everyone
I said we are independent for 103 years, as a country Lithuania was first mentioned in 1009
That's good enough for me
woah, wtf, you wouldn't want any power to do that, especially usa or ussr, I'm a communist, but i hate tankies/totalitarians, and have seen the flaws they made, and it angers me to see that people paint communism as 1 ideology, Preety much as saying that all right wingers are nazis
NI wishes to reunify are at an all time high, Scotland wants independence - soon UK will only consist of England and Wales, lol
NI wishes to reunify are at an all time high, Scotland wants independence - soon UK will only consist of England and Wales, lol
Lithuania learned from Italians and shut everything off hardcore in March, as soon as a few cases started appearing
Now new cases are only a few per day, and deaths - one per week
Masks and distancing works, just like it worked here, the rest of Europe, Canada, Asia, etc
America, GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
It's the same wall Witcher poster was on
Nopians sure do confuse themselves with Lithuania a lot
or just pay attention in geography class
> longest history
What
>Latvia should be Litva
Why
you means us and Latvians or just us, cuz both are accurate
I am Samogitian and spend so much time with Latvians i can unironicaly understand them so good for me lol
More people -> more internet browsing history -> more history
Problem is that Lithuania's original name is *Lietuva*, which is closer to *Litva* than *Latvija* is
Russians and Polish also call LT *Litva*/*Litwa*. Although another [false friend] between Czech and Russian would be par for the course
>and think we sound Russian
Because we have palatalized (soft) sounds (shared feature in Lithuanian, Russian and Belarusian languages)
> Spoken language is completely unintelligible
I spent about a week in Latvia once (mostly with Latvians) and after 3 or 4 days of asking about certain common words and phrases that are different and getting the hang of them, I was surprised by how much I could understand
So I'd say 'completely unintelligible' is a little too strong
Why would anyone think that living right next door to a volcano is a good idea
Not to mention that this one is known for multiple eruptions and burying an entire city
Unless housing next to the volcano is cheap enough to be close to being free, I'm pretty sure there are always some choices, especially in the 21st century when people aren't tied down to the same village for their whole lives
Also, it’s just one moment
Bride and Groom definitely had many other face expressions during the ceremony
What a sad outlook
You just sound like a very selfish person who would probably have no issues with watching his country destroyed by an invading force
People fought and died for their countries only for selfish, entitled people to say that the nation means nothing
It’s an obligation to your ancestors, family, neighbours
Whatever country you are born in
What good is in throwing it away
Cool, how about every Croat moves to Germany
How about every single Eastern European, African, Asian who have hard lives all move to Germany
People help improve the country
Just like those students who move to countries outside of Romania would be making Romania a better place if they stayed
People fleeing persecution is a completely different argument
I have some family members who escaped the Soviet advance to Germany
It’s a completely different argument to emigration
Tell me how you are suffering
If anything that is an insult to those who actually suffered persecution during wars and occupation etc
So, you personally
Not many streets in Belarus worth looking at anyway
I feel offended when baltic states are not marked
Such a clever memorial
Really shocking
Lithuanian here, there are 2 limits on our motorways
The left lane is limited to around 170kmh due to our poor quality roads, and the right lane is around 100-120kmh where all the slow cars drive
Germany looks so nice
Speeding fines are tiny and insignificant, so nobody really cares about these limits
I've been there and it's just as spectacular [from close up]
It was absolutely insane seeing this in real life a few years ago
Surreeaaaal
Americans: Sorry, I only understand guns per eagle reservoirs
Hopefully you guys won't end up like Ukraine
Baltics into north Europe confirmed
Into nordics we go

Bruh, never in history has lithuania had any other name for beer
I've searched for lithuanian beer synonims and these ar all that came up: Putokšlis, Miežienis, Gira, Birbalas, Birzgalas, Bizalas, Bizalakas, Pirmalakas, Pirmokas, Pirmašakis, Antralakas, Antrokas, Antrašakis
Translations to all the ones that start with "P": Foamer, Firstdrinker, First grader, First brancher
Poland trying to be russian :)
So heavily guarded
Because they have zero issues with each other unlike India and China
I would totally Czech that place out
Germany is the epicenter of the railway it seems
There is a dark joke in this somewhere
This is stunning
this photo reminds me of my dog who passed away recently
We bought him pink flowers and on that day, the sky was all pink
Now every time i see pink sky’s, it reminds me of him
He was a poodle and we always joked he was a Frenchman
This post in general just reminds me of him
Rikis, i love you <3
look at this dude
This is the best one of all
bruh
Bullshit, most of UK live in apartments
A house is when you have no wall with neighbours
What they call houses is just an apartment with entrance straight from outside
So you're saying that now is the time to go on vacation there
Lukashenko named as "Illegal president of Belarus" on Lithuanian national TV news
Literally on point with Lukashenkos position title
Nothing, literally nothing can be done otherwise
Kick out Cyprus, vote, accept it back, repeat
But for real tho why are they voting against
Actually Lithuanian language is tightly tied with sanskrit
It thought to be an oldest language in Europe
Yes
Most archaic\*
>"apsišaukėlis" (impostor, pretender)
"Self-proclaimed" is probably the best translation
Impostor/pretender is "apsimetelis".
makes sense
isnt that the same
It's more that Lithuanian language has changed least from proto-Indo-European language
Same with Sanskrit and old Greek
E.g. Ugnis (LT) vs Agnis (skrt
) or Pilis (LT) vs Polis (GR)
No, it is not the same
That's their ideology, so yes
Why
They're totalitarian dystopian shit hole that massacred and mass starved their own population
All communist states are like this
2018-02-16 is Lithuania’s Independence day 100 year anniversary
Soon you’re going to have Lithuania all over r/europe
Post it
And we're just sitting here, waiting to celebrate our 100^th anniversary for the first and the 28^th anniversary for the second declaration of independence
Thanks, but you a few months early
We have one independence celebration on February 16^th and another on March 11^th
How will the Russians try to get Lithuania in its sphere of influence
We hardly have any Russians here
They're a minority in every place in Lithuania, except for a small town called Visaginas
I'm from /r/all what are the protests about
My people should learn a thing or two from yours about standing up for themselves
Best of luck to you all
Also problem here in Lithuania somewhat
But most people aren't partisan, a lot of people call EU "socialist" and "new world order" that need to be removed
But a lot of people also don't like Russia at all, most people are neutral about it because of this facts
Why would you ask to come for dinner and not mean it
What kind of evil horrible person would do that
Burn in hell
That's and interesting new phone model
anglophone :/
Seriously
Some Brits say "You 'right
" instead of a normal "Hello" and for the first three days of uni I assumed that everyone was just very curious and caring
everyone in that room seems to be thinking 'this is so unnecessary'

Wtf, 39,4 from Lithuania
Didn't even knew we export it
I heard talks about starting to import, but didn't knew we send it to Poland
Looks beautiful
What the fuck
Ah yes, cultural heritage of having people who are deemed "superior" just because they are born into a certain family
:) Such sophistication
Naivety
Just you wait until it gets all dirty like every other metro in the world
u/RepostSleuthBot
Oh, how great an RPG would be in this setting
I can already hear angry Estonian noises far in the distance approaching very very slowly
I think that we should just start dividing stuff in to "Wine Europe", "Beer europe", "Vodka Europe" and be done with it
Baltic states, Central
so it is in central northeast
I consider Baltic states as northern Europe, but whatever
Baltic countries are not central europe
its more like northeast
How the fuck are the Baltics Central Europe
If there is a southeastern Europe, why isn’t there a northeastern Europe
(Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, northern Russia)
In my opinion, Europe can be divided into these regions based on socioeconomic and cultural factors: Eastern Europe (all former communist countries), Southern Europe (basically PIGS countries + Malta and Cyprus), Northern Europe (the same as is shown in the OP's map) and Western Europe (every country that doesn't belong to the aforementioned regions)
I know that people from former communist countries don't like being called Eeastern Europeans, but it was the Cold War and its aftermath that defined Europe as it is
And trying to label your country as Central European or Northern European is just delusional
I see that Lithuania tag lol
Yes
Yeah, I was surprised that Baltics were assigned to Central Europe
I never thought about my country that way
I can see Poland as Central Europe, but Lithuania
Geographically we're Northern Europe, culturally we're central due to heavy Catholic/Lutheran influence
The thing is that most people still use cold war stigmas on ex commie countries and that's annoying as hell
>Culturally, geographically, and socially, we are Eastern European
No we aren't.
We are northern europe, not central
As of recent years ~2016 something
That's the straightest nonsense bullshit I ever heard
Yes
Yes we are
This is cultural proxomity biased map though
Geographically we are more in North than Denmark and more in West and Finland
No, at least I always thought of Lithuania as belonging to Eastern Europe
Due to cold war stigma
[Hi fellow Orthodox brother]
How so
Mm now that you said it
Correct
hey dude, why does your location say spain, if you're actually vilnietis
Oh fuck, thank you so much for reminding me of Asterix
I loved that shit when I was a kid but completely forgot about it since
Yeah, it should say "Portugal"
ah, lithuanian girlfriend (or boyfriend), huh
well, I guess we got the finest of both genders
The fact, that China isn't even on the list, says a lot
Vilnius in 1940 vs Vilnius in 2020
that goddamn useless pipe near the river or so called art
Labai gražus miestas
Bardzo piękne miasto
If anyone wants to visit Vilnius PM me
I work in the nicest and biggest hotel in the city centre and I could organise some nice trips and sightseeings
The bottom picture is wrong
The picture on the bottom was taken probably in 2010 - 2011
Thanks I lol'ed
Vilnius resident here
Fuck that fuckin pipe
Yes, hello I'm one of them
There's a fair number of them in the suburbs, not so many in the city itself
Studentas
Never thought about it
But according to some googling
Out of 44 European capitals 12 don't have rivers flowing through them:
Monaco, Monaco
Athens, Greece
Copenhagen, Denmark
Lisbon, Portugal
Nicosia, Cyprus
San Marino, San Marino
Stockholm, Sweden
Valletta, Malta
Chisinau, Moldova
Tallinn, Estonia
Tirana, Albania
Vatican City, Vatican City State
It is kinda hard to could Stokholm or Copenhagen :D They are basically on water anyways
Probably not any time soon tho
It's "Art"
Sometimes im the summer it does get a bit dry, but in this case I think it's just a filter on these photos
you can see on the riverside in the second photo, i believe it cost city around 29k euro, and it's truly miserably looking nowadays
Yeah Russian is more common as second language in city
I would say even English is easier to go around
Polish is basically only for native poles
So maybe 1 in 5 chance you will meet one
It was supposed to be temporary installation at first, but never got taken down for many reasons, no one knows anymore
But the artist said it was supposed to make people think about and discuss the purpose and goals of art in public places, whatever that means
Most people hated it and still do
It has some but I wouldn't say "many". According to 2016 data, there were over 40k students in Lithuanian schools and just  3600 in Polish schools
Yup, people are still talking about it when they see it in some photo
Half the population hates it, other half enjoys listening to their angry ramblings, "Hurr durr, pensions are small yet they spend money on this rusty pipe".
Pretty sure overwhelming majority of people like artworks only if they look nice
This is not one of those artworks
If people hate it, it shouldn't be there
Yup, you got it
Many people don't.
why did you remove all the posts about muslims youths rioting in a church in Vienna ?
is the discussion of islamic threat only allowed when it takes lives ?
just answer the question you coward
We've got way too much potato
Not realistic
So Latvia can finally into potato
This is the most accurate representation of Europe I had ever seen
I really like this, but why am I in the potato land
Shouldn't Ireland be potatoes
us too, I guess
Haven't you ever seen a cabbage ? wait that looks more like a strawberry actually
I live in potato land so I know that this is very accurate
uh UH NO NO
WELL
better than Russia I guess
but still come on
i thought we were bros :(
That's beautifully put
if only history was teached this way, people would be way more interested
Amazing
TIL
I'm afraid money is a problem
Just use like Dropbox/YouTube lol
I seriously started clapping, what a wonderful speech
He not wrong
That was the point of EU but that's not what it is right now sadly
Just because something originally had a great idea but changed over time isn't immune to criticism
Today was -28 in Vilnius 6 a.m
Screw mosquitos, our real problem is ticks
We need another week or so of these temps to hit them well
My condolences to any of my diesel-driving brothers caught in the crossfire

/r/AbolishTheMonarchy
>Baltics, you're still Russians, right
This will get you beaten in no time
That shit is nothing to joke about here
Almost as bad as saying to a black person "Remember the times when your kind were slaves
Good times, right
As a Lithuanian living in America, I get asked this all the time
You hit it right on the head of the nail
Lithuania: WILNO NASZE
That would do the job and maybe start a war
I think calling us Russians is bad, but that's pure ignorance, at least it has a reason, soviet occupation and all that
The worse thing would be calling us Slavs
Now *that's* fucked up
If I had a euro for every time someone says that about the Baltic States
I'm from the Baltics and the sentence about us didn't annoy me at all
Nah, the only way you'd get beaten is if you said this to a skinhead or smth, otherwise people would just get annoyed and correct you
Westerners are known to make this mistake
Of course
My comment was just an exaggeration of the truth

Well, he does when it comes to urban design anyway

Happy birthday, friends

Let's have another 100 or more
Congratulations Estonia
Your flag is so beautiful
Hell yeah, just no Soviet interruptions this time please
Poor poor Estonia ;( What can they do to change the ignorant Nordics
Well, shit, we are as bad as French
The fact that former soviet countries are more proficient in English than Mediterranean countries
Weird but understandable
I guess in Italy and Spain it’s not cool to speak English
Maybe it’s the nationalistic/ fascist past
Like how some in Eastern Europe think it’s a sense of pride to speak Russian and not English
Do you mean
Aia no speaka inglese
Poor Ireland
Wouldn't it make sense to put it on Calais and not the much wider side of 4he channel

Jokes aside it is beautiful photo
Okay now this is a whole new level
Could you at least figure out what to do with the nuclear waste
So they make us close the Ignalina plant because "oh no terrible" and then 15 years later come out with that because NOW it suits them

You should see buses/trolleybuses in Vilnius, they're so crowded I'm not even joking

Possibly ever

Well, Lithuania is giving political asylum to the Tsichanovskaya, who ran for the election against lukashenko, at the moment
It wouldn't be far fetched if she got Lithuanian support in the end
Lithuania-Russia relations are nonexistant anyway
Wont change much
Unless Russia would decide to attack, but then that decision was done long before this
We cared, but it's an internal issue, how are otjer countries supposed to do anything about it
Now that Belarusian people are fighting for change, we support them - wholeheartedly
Lithuanians tend to have a really poor outlook on the Commonwealth
Although Lithuania was the bigger country when it formed, the leadership was all polish, and Lithuanian culture, including the language, was seen as untasteful, and everyone sought to speak polish
In general it's taught here that in the commonwealth, Lithuanians were treated very poorly by the Polish
This subreddit seems to fetishize the commonwealth, but I think most Lithuanians really don't like that point in history and would not accept any sort of coming back to it
If any Lithuanians feel differently, feel free to chime in, I'd love to hear why
In general Lithuanians mostly meme about going back to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which was the biggest country in Europe at the time, stretching from the baltic to the black seas
I'd rather see the Grand Duchy
Well, since there are 141 members in Seimas and there were 122 attendees, this means  a total of 19 members did not attend, those three among them
No need to single them out
Of course, then there is this Jedzinski guy - [
Kinda shitty of him to use the protests in Belarus for cheap shots against his political opponents
Afaik the European Council will hold an extraordinary meeting on Belarus tomorrow
To add to that Commonwealth was really not a successful country
It lasted that long purely because Poland and Lithuania before commonwealth were quite powerful countries on their own
This
The Commonwealth here isn't looked upon as some sort of "glory days", unlike Poles
Not yet, atleast not officially, but I really hope it's the second step we take
Don't know what you are actually talking about Ukraine
It was long time puppet of Russia
Now it's starting to stand on it's feet, of course it's hard at first- when you drop the shackles of former oppressor and go to war with him, but Ukraine is one of the fastest currently growing economies in Europe and predictions looking nothing but bright
The same could follow for Belarus or better depends how this all goes down
And the EU part, from my understanding Belarusian people don't currently have a wish for it, that's why we don't see Russian tanks running around Minsk already
It partly is becouse of it
Some of us are kinda insulted by you guys calling Piłsudski a national hero, becouse to us he was an enemy
That's how they get you
That's why Lithuania bought/rented(kinda stupid decision but whatever) a LNG Carrier "Independance" to literally say fuck you to Russian as in "You won't pull us on that string anymore
Belgium isn't that big after all
"your mother was a hamster"?
This is how all renovations of older buildings in Europe should look like
"No-go zones" is the one thing Trumps administration was as actually right about
In a number of places in west EU
Of course Americans tend to generalize Europe as this one and same place, so they have a bad time with geography
You got Lithuania wrong
We have the best from our neighbors
The blet and kurva are goin strong
"Keikti
" in Lithuanian is just "To swear
", the most common national one I can think of is "Po venių!"
Shit map
Source: Lithuania
For Lithuania "keikti
" means "to swear
". Such a meta nonsense
Go to swear yourself
The Lithuanian one is not even a swear word, it's just a verb meaning 'to swear'.
This is why I hate maps like these
People who make them often have no expertise on the subject and just rely on the first results on Google, apparently
Lithuanian is very wrong
It's "Kurva
" or "Blet
We in Lithuania don't even use our swear words
Keikti in lithuanian is literally "to curse". We don't really have a lot of vulgar swearwords
We have "šūdas" which means "shit", but other than that, not a lot
We sometimes say blemba, but it's not really a swearword
In lithuanian keikti just means swearing
... keikti
Keikti
Lithuania: Keikti means swear(as in insult swear) fuck is Pisti
This map sucks
Lithuania is wrong
Wtf is "keikti" I've never heard a lithuanian say that, like never, We say "BLET" or "KURVA" or "BYBYS"
Keikti
This litterally means "to swear" lol
Yeah, this map on Lithuania literally says "to swear", not "fuck".
How did people make this map
With google translate
Hey we have a native one
"Bybys
" AFAIK, it's the one and true Lithuanian curse word
Plenty of colorful variations too
Neither does Lithuania
Noone swears in Lithuanian, we all use loaned swear words from Russia or Poland
*Also keikti makes absolutely no sense, it's not even a swear word, it just says „to swear“*
Just "velnias".
They googled "How to swear in Lithuanian". Google thought he wanted to know what is "to swear" in Lithuanian from that query
Extremely poor research for this post, OP
Nah, "Kad tave šikantį sutrauktų" (loose translation - "I hope you get cramps while you are shitting") is the king
Ką?
Šitas irgi dažnas, bet truputį nuobodesnis žodis

I don't think it was called anything else than Čekija in Lithuanian, but I thought it was disrespectful or something to call it Czechia in English too
why tho
Guys im dying ovh in lithuania
idk how people survive in France etc

Ok, we need to climb the ranking
I won't be satisfied at no
Russia should definitely be on the list
Even the ones down under got on the list
First - Eurovision, now here
Good job Aussies

Well if a country is in that list, it's gotta be doing something right
As a Lithuanian, I am honoured to be "unfriendly country" to Russia
Bulgaria, welcome to the children sandbox disputes
The competition is tough
They should make groups in the future, if the list grows bigger
Australia too
Damn, welcome to the club, i guess
As if we would participate in that
Hello friend
**One of us
One of us
One of us
Austria is one of the more pro russia countries in EU
There's no way there are making the list
that's how it should be
Because there are so many Europeans in Australia

How’s it’s going there
There was some dumb bitch running around sick, spreading corona in the bars
I dodged a bullet, I came back from there two weeks ago

No jokes in Czechia this time looks like
It's so much more difficult to release a minister in Lithuania it seems
When they gets hold of that post
Oh man they will hang on
Not that bad
Few weeks ago our parliament declined a law that would've established civil unions only because it would also let same-sex couples to register partnership, so you know
Blitzkrieg
Looks like Lithuanians just won't feel comfortable in general
what the fuck, Lithuania
I'm disappointed in my own country
Goddammit Lithuania
Checks out
For 3 out of 4 i'm a very big no
"Would you feel comfortable if your child was in a relationship with a person
20-29% comfortable
Feels uncomfortable man
> colour
No thank you
You are disappointed because not everyone is a sheep thinking like they're told to
People have their own opinions
Yes, that includes race mixing
What's disappointing about that
Ah yes, the classic 'only my opinion is valid, everyone else is sheep' comment
Don't see a lot of those around the shops, so you'd be owning a monopoly
Well not really
I think both sides of people are right because everyone has free will
We're no longer communist
This isn't about letting or not letting, this is about liking it or not liking it
People can do whatever they want as long as its their own free will that led them to the choice
But that doesn't mean that they are entitled to being liked
as everyone has the right to be disappointed, too, so what are you doing trying to undermine my disappointment
you don't make sense
I didn't think about that
Good point
that took guts
And the dunce next to him mixed up Baltics with Balkans
I bet our presidents were really happy to hear that they were responsible for the Yugoslav wars from Mister Trumpet
Wouldn't be america if they didn't mess up European names
Shit man, I really hated that show as a kid, fast foward some 10 years i realized its pretty good and should not be taken as serious as I took it, plus all these Number One memes made me actually reconsider myself and start loving it, shit I'm so sad right now , the man looked so happy and enjoyed what he did
RIP
Oh god no, I watched one of his videos just yesterday :(
Rest in peace, Stefan, you will be missed by me and so many others
It was an honor to live on the same planet with a man as talented as you
Amazing, I really like it
I'm tempted to do one about Lithuania
Those are some stupid high costs you got there
[Telia's] most expensive plan in Lithuania costs the same as the cheapest one in the page you linked, while offering the same calls&SMS and way more data
By the way, it might seem like there's not a lot of data on any of the plans, but since Telia merged with Teo Group ( largest telecom, internet and cable provider in Lithuania), with each plan you get unlimited Wi-Fi access covering most of the capital anyways
Is there a higher resolution version out there
This would make a great wallpaper
Now both irl and in minecraft ill have to go far away to find pretty landscapes :( Lithuania looks FLAT
Look at us, geting all big and mighty, then disappearing, then popping back into existence (in min-sized), then disappearing, then finally reappearing (min-sized+)
Lithuania :((((((
Well, first there were those christian orders that were quite a force, then there was Russia, then Sweden, then more Russia, and then more Sweden, then we got split by Prussia, Russia and Austria
More or less, we tried, but fighting strong countries (sometimes against both Sweden and Russia), and being in between a few countries isn't easy
But without the lousy politicians
I think I read that the veto was overused, so caused some serious problems to the country
We were one of the biggest ones at one point
2nd largest
The map also shows how hard it was to have lands towards west europe, but easier going towards the black sea
Remind me the Free Election
[Here] is Vilnius city centre, for illustration purposes

One step forward, two hundred steps back
I'm done
Fuck the whole system, TOR and VPNs it is then
They can continue to live in their illusionary world
Yall are idiots
How are they going to enforce this
They can't. I'm just gonna post links and memes all over the place and they won't be able to do anything about it
Actually I checked my Lithuania
Would be same as Latvia
So at least in Lithuania issue is domestic violence
Which is connected to high alcohol consumption and people in social risk families
Drunk people killing each other
Huge problem we try to reduce
But with upcoming crisis and increased unemployment will probably just worsen

2008 a beer in a bar in Lithuania/Vilnius was 1 euro, 2021 its 3
It's the same ethnic group as Finland, so in a way
I know it's a joke, but LT/Poland border to Tallinn is 655 KM by the straightest road possible
That's pretty much the same distance as crossing Germany from west to east from BeNeLux
My road trips through the Baltics were usually about a weak long and I'm usually just doing Latvia/Estonia
I think they were talking about Luxembourg there
real tears start at 1€ vodkas
Yeah, our suicidal tendencies are very obvious on the road too
Fun (not) fact
Out of my school year of 120 people 3 guys died in three separate car crashes, all before they got 20 years old
And all the accidents were their fault
Settle in Romania
The 20% in Lithuania are old people
that's a nice theory you got but considering you're yet to do that not even during the crisis, I would assume you'll never break the peg
Good thing I live in Lithuania
Thank f*ck I live in the Baltics
Good luck to the rest of you
Are the baltics colder than scandinavia
That's some black magick fuckery right here
Lithuania:
winters have no fucking snow or ice
summer is half rain half wearing sweater with a couple of days 20°C+
Baltics: Y'all feel something
Let it stay that way
This summer has already been too hot
Latvia looks cozy sandwiched between Lithuania and Estonia
What's up with Kaliningrad
Not part of Russia anymore
Pokemon Go is cancelled
It's all about Chop n' Go now
Me thinks we need an international investigation on this to confirm whether they grow or not, and why
Could be world changing revelation
TIL most of Europe is Lone-lands (minus Amon Sûl)
> Oh yeah, and forests
We have one of the most forested countries and
not even a bush
Latvia is the most forested in Europe
North Germany is usually always included in the Northern European plain
Sometimes even the Netherlands
Doesn't surprise me, after their foreign ministry posted an infographic about Forest Brothers in the Baltic countries being terrorists and murderers
Here's a [short summary] of that
You northerners are weird, you talk differently, drive differently

Eh, I still mostly use youtube when I'm at home but some artists can be really aggressive about taking down their music from yt, even if you click through to the "xyz - topic" videos rather than random uploads from other people
Fucker should have thought before feeding all that grain to Nazis
When your BFF stabs you in the back
I don't really like the choice of shades here, especially with the majority being black and dark
I just can't tell the difference between the dark ones
The reason is that those few extra countries are places like Tonga or Solomon Islands
You probably won't go there, ever, so it makes sense to portray the passports as pretty much equal
Meh, Android also has overpriced manufacturers like Samsung, and at least Apple has better software
At the end who cares what people enjoy owning
World is too big to be bothered by little things like what phones people buy
looks like the guy will turn to the dark side soon
bruh
That's probably true, yet that page currently is quite nice
Lots of country flags, lots of little hearts among them, cartoon characters, Mona Lisa is still there, the Darth Plagueis has been untouched for quite a while now, etc
I highly recommend this video (and the whole channel tbh) to everyone
In our family (Lithuania) every Christmas Eve we watch "Merry Christmas Mr Bean". It's hilarious every year
and I thought you watch "Sagan om Karl Bertil Jonssons julafton"
Home Alone and Harry Potter are staple movie franchises for Christmas
> If the whole planet is connected within 6 degrees of separation, I think that means literally half the planet is likely also equally connected to the owners of that house
I don't think it is the case, no
Each person knows some amount of other people, let's mark the average amount of people known as K, whatever the number might be
Then that means, on average, the amount of people that are separated by 3 degrees from you will be K^(3), while 6 degrees would be K^(6)
K would have to be ridiculously low for what you said to be true
Oh god
The climate has risen by +0

Do you have any place to download it from, that would make sure it's not compressed down, as I'm guessing that Reddit compresses the pictures

Now this is art
Dunno from where they taking these numbers
Here (in Lithuania) we usually have classes of 25-32 people, 4-8 classes per grade (depends to the size of the school)
Never seen smaller ones
This number is much lower in rapidly aging/ emptying rural areas, but there number residents/ schools is much lower than in cities
I would like to see their analysis methodology
Quite old data
Also, the low average class size is indicative of a problem
As much as 18% of the state budget is spent on education, but still last November school teachers went on strike over pay reform
Movies and cartoons of them were on TV here
Funny times
Oh man, I still have a comic book of them, I'll try to find it today

I indeed became slightly more suicidal when i moved to Sweden
Atleast Lithuania is top 3 in something
We'll get you next year, Russia
Finally we are 1st at something
Dam Russians, first they take our lands then our independence and now this
I don't want to talk about it
Never better
You're not wrong
Just what I thought - you need a man to get a job done
It's just the old folks
Don't mind them
They're not dangerous, but can definitely be rude
But don't smile or make eye contact with people who are wearing full Adidas with chains and shit
Those can be more dangerous sometimes
Nah, but seriously we're just kind of a bit grumpy, so please stay happy and bring the happiness here, and don't let anyone to suck it out :)
Just subtract everyone who emigrated and we'll be #1
Lithuanians tend to keep to themselves, so things like depression usually eat the person up from inside, as they don't go reaching out for help
We are small and we have no money
Also it's cold and mental illness is stigmatized
Stigmatized mental health issues, lack of access to mental healthcare, alcoholism, sexism (boys are often shamed for not being "manly enough"), low wages, poverty, lack of accessibility for disabled folk, homophobia, transphobia, minority marginalization, catholic church and that sweet sweet soviet spirit that still finds ways to poison our ethics and interactions with others
There's probably way more but it's all that i could come up with atm
As a fellow lithuanian i can vouch for this as well
Most of the suicides arent breing brought to light here in lithuania, but if you look at the data the truth is there
Also suicides have been romanized in our culture for ages
Lithuanians used to massively burn themselves when Crusades took castles
Partizans against USSR occupation used to massively blow themselves up their faces with grenades too so they wouldn't be recognized
So we Lithuanians got that "better dead than X" mentality
> lack of access to mental healthcare
Is it
You can get 3 months of free weekly sessions with a psychologist per year, on top of that you can go to group therapy and group "life skill improvement seminars". Basically you can get 6-9 months of psychological help for free
Now it's not ideal and it gets worse the smaller the city you live in, but I wouldn't really say there's a lack of help available
Yeah, i was only talking about Lithuania
Asking for help is frowned upon
Most of us can't tell our family members that we need help
And when the person is underage, it gets really complicated
I personally couldn't ask my doctor to get me to see a psychologist because I lived in a small town where everyone knew everyone
One of my best friends had a terrible experience with a public psychologist and now years after she still avoids seeking help
Moreover, when she was trying to get a driving license, she was asked why she went to a psychologist at the age of 10
If you seek public help, the records will follow you your whole life
And when it comes to adults, people with really serious issues are ashamed to seek for help because "that's what crazy people do".
Lithuania doesn't support transitioning
This is why I believe that if we're discussing Lithuania, it's the gender that was assigned at birth
Oh I'm not arguing about the stigma surrounding seeking help, just saying that people underestimate the help that's available
Have no idea where else to ask, but is [this] okay
Offering something for free to accept everything
Fucking with people by giving them bullshit tips is one of the main reasons why I wanna live beyond 100 years

It's not a very good graph if the biggest section is "Others".
It's the Alps, temperature varies wildly depending on elevation
I've been to the Austrian ones recently, it was over 30 C at the base, around 0 C at the top
It's usually very safe to assume that any story that came from a guide is bullshit
I want to believe though
Warmongering Lithuania looks at Russia with suspicion
Belarus is like Switzerland except not rich, ruled by a dictator and has no clocks, knives, chocolates or cheese to boast with but at least makes good games
surprisingly good guy belarus
Maybe it has to do with traditional dishes
We also eat a lot of tomatoes in Lithuania, it's one of our main vegetables along with cucumbers
But I can't think of a single local traditional food that comes with tomatoes
However they all do involve potatoes
[Cepelinai] - a huge 'dumpling' where dough is basically potatoes, [kugelis] - a potato oven dish, [vėdarai] - sausage filled with potatoes, [bulviniai blynai] - potato pancakes
Even our traditional [cold beet soup] which is supposed to refresh you on a hot summer day, comes with hot potatoes on the side cause we can't live without them
I'd play the rythm on it
Blap blap blap, boop
Oh no, oh god no
What a fool I was to think that the heatwave is coming to an end
Welp
I'm close to Poland
Fuck me too I guess
Yup
Most people in Poland don't have AC
He said Europe
Edit: awesome to know how many of you guys can take a joke
I don’t think Poland or Hungary cares what some cartoonist says
Yes sir
Its just the countries they know in general

Hello neighbors
Nice tradition you got there
Climate Change in Lithuania is all on EU because our ruling "Peasants and Greens" party turned out to be not green at all
The leader owns a massive corporation that imports nasty chemicals and fertilizers from Russia and he drives an Escalade
Well we do trust the EU more cause our government is shit
Right wing is usually pro bussiness, cheap labour is good for bussiness, but the right wing voters usually are against immigration
Right wing parties want to get reelected, so they will say one thing, but at the same time they want to help their bussiness friends, so they'll do another thing
He's nice at first
thanks for making me feel old and dusted

Might be bacause I'm colorblind, but that looks pretty far from yellow
wack
Can Baltics into Scandinavia
Could anyone explain Turkey
Why's it almost all red with a few blue patches
24 degrees today in Vilnius
I am SCARED of summer, most people here dont have AC since
well we never needed it
so yea
Holy shit this looks ugly
I wish all the best for the Belarusian people, but at the same time I can't help but feel like their goal is unachievable unless Russia somehow decides to look the other way, which I just don't see happening, since they've already lost Ukraine from their sphere of influence
The only way this can succeed is if Russia has it's own mass protests and instability to not be able to focus outwards
Belarus and Lithuania have hundreds of years of shared history
There was a time when Belarusians called themselves "Litvins" - Lithuanians, before the modern 19th century concept of nationality and Tsarist Russification changed that
Pretty sure it is Pagonia
3 quarters of the island atleast
I love how you guys act like you care about it but then want me to get banned and my memes removed the moment I post school shooting meme :)))
The issue isn't companies, but special snowflakes like you guys
Oh wow, I can't believe I can recognize the memes just from text
What 8 €/month gets you in Lithuania
Also, if you need slightly more, [you can get 300mbit for ~12
5€/month]
EDIT: Also forgot to mention, a gigabit for ~20€, but come on, who needs that much
I don't. The prices can go even lower in major cities with different providers but I am outside of those so
I also live in Lithuania
My friend got 300Mbps for 20€, but he called the customer support and asked if they could make it cheaper
They activated some kind of "deal plan" and it costs 10€ now
Speeds are the same
I don't know what's the catch
I have the same plan :)
[Your bitch ass stealing my wifi]
You can even get a 300up/300down connection at a similar price if you manage to get a promotional offer
I pay like 15 for 300mbps in Lithuania
but fr 20 € for 300 mbits
and if you pay double that you can get 1gbit
I fucking wish
Rookie numbers
300/279
Maybe you are using a wifi
Which provider is this
Cause me and my family have Mezon and we pay 17
90 Euros per month and we get 25 Mbps give or take, granted we do have to use a signal booster
Most discounts are tied to the minimum length of service (usually 2 years)
Telia, but it's optic fiber so I don't think it is available everywhere
Ah okay, yeah
I think we might be able to get it in the house we live in currently, but due to how much we move, it might be a bad idea
Germans and Americans are fat
Russians are slim fit and healthy people

I am sure germans are getting bored with her, but for an outsider she was always the "wiser" politician

Oh, I see, you have multiple degrees in geopolitics
Everyone in this survey knows about Austria but 2% don't know Germany

That's a weird cat
I don't know what to think after this
I read a fair bit of smaller (local) American news sites and i've noticed that the recent EU internet privacy law (GDPR) has made more than half of smaller sites completely banned and inaccessible
I think we should let them back in and kick them out right after that
You can also see, that if you're wearing the mask under your nose, you have a small dick
Fun fact, we have started calling people wearing their masks wrong like this „bybianosiai“, which roughly translates to 'dicknose'. This is where this campaign seems to stem from [\(link to lithuanian satire wiki\)]
If you get headaches from wearing a mask you might have some really serious issues, visit your doctor

Please google where Vilnius is located
Then check which language is spoken in that country
First time in my life I'm hearing of Coptic
According to internet searches it is Egyptian language, a northern Afro-Asiatic language
That is completely unrelated to Lithuanian
I don't understand what you are talking about
In Lithuania we speak Lithuanian, which is a Baltic language, coming from a family of Indo-European languages
It would sound funny in Lithuanian because "nebe" means "no more". It would be no more lux (good/luxurious)

*The Lithuanian press ban (Lithuanian: spaudos draudimas) was a ban on all Lithuanian language publications printed in the Latin alphabet in force from 1865 to 1904 within the Russian Empire, which controlled Lithuania at the time
Lithuanian-language publications that used Cyrillic were allowed and even encouraged
*The concept arose after the failed January Uprising of 1863, taking the form of an administrative order in 1864, and was not lifted until 24 April 1904
The Russian courts reversed two convictions in press ban cases in 1902 and 1903, and the setbacks of the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904 brought about a loosened Russian policy towards minorities
Why is Estonia so high up compered to the rest of Russian empire
Like that
Except the bucket is much larger on the military helicopters because they can lift more

Whole 22C heatwave right now
Haven't seen 30+ in months I think
Are we (Lithuania) allowed to be in Northern Europe now
We're even below Sweden, sooo why not
I'm at a festival in Denmark rn and all of these bikes aren't locked up
Welp, free real estate I guess :D
Not saying it was right (because as you mentioned it affected a lot of innocent people), but Germany's goal was to expand and unify all the German lands (where there were Germans)
Removal of Germans was done to compensate Poland for the territory lost in the East and Germans were removed from other countries (and Königsberg) to prevent Germany from having a justification for starting another war like this again in the future

Hard to believe Lithuania is better-off than Portugal
Or Greece
I've been to Greece, we're not fucking better off than Greece
almost makes you want to get off your chair and sing the ''tautiška giesmė'', don't you think
It might blow your mind, but I didn't miss the second most talked about European kerfufle in a decade
Turns out it's "kerfu**ff**le"
I don't know where I learned it, probably reddit
> if you think that they are better off than Lithuania
I don't think random shit, I see, and what I see is a higher living standard in Greece than in Lithuania
> No, what you’ve seen is tourist areas in a warm country with wealthy foreigners buying property
Oh, I see you somehow got hold of my travel itinerary
> Also, anecdotes aren’t exactly a strong comeback to facts and figures
Like the very submission we're commenting under that shows Greek average salary to be almost 30% higher than Lithuania's?
> Again, which millionaires are moving to Lithuania
What
> Greece’s economy is thoroughly fucked all throughout the whole country
Their government is on the verge of a collapse
Greeces economy is recovering for some time now
> There’s plenty of high skilled workers fleeing the country because of jobs disappearing
Do I really need to start sharing emigration figures
Lithuania is literally number one in EU by this metric
