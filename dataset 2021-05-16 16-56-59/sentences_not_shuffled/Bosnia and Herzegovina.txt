Some cowards decided to join the SS during the nazi occupation and formed divisions of bosniaks that commited several war crimes against the population of Yugoslavia
My family used to live in Sisak until the Yugoslav wars and what you said is true
Croatia, at least until Serbia joins the EU
In that case, Serbia and Croatia
Actually, take us too
Fuck it, three for the price of one
Rename the hole that's left over as the Sea of North Macedonia or some shit
Serbia so i can go to Bijeljina on vacations
May I just say how it's funny to me that people call socialist buildings from the 50s, 60s and 70s poor people places
There's a massive difference here, it might mean you're upper middle class or super low class depending on the location and the decade it was built
Yes, there are some pretty low quality new buildings that are pretty far away from both cities and suburban action
I have an american accent and I dont like it
I wish I had more british accent, however when I try to use it I sound like I am trying too hard
Bosnian/Croat here
Believe it or not, I don't really have an accent
I started learning English in 4th grade, and with no prior knowledge whatsoever, I became fluent by the time 5th grade rolled around
I now am 19, and have a sort of a American accent
It does not sound foreign at all
Maybe I slip up here and there but you could not tell unless you are a English proffesor or have a great insights in accents and languages in general
It was greatly influenced by TV (Disney channel) and I could not be happier that I have it
And surprisingly, as far as I noticed, young people in my area are not bad at English at all and we at least have a general understanding of it
Dutch English speakers always sound American to me ngl
Same for me, but I mean you guys sound American by default
Over here we have a Slavic accent if we don't work towards either American or British
Weird request, but do you maybe have a video you could link where someone from the  Netherlands is speaking English in their native accent
I think it has to do with the branding
You get +3 charisma if you have that Apple logo on your phone
Probably "Gornja Maoča". It's not necessarily a city, it's a village; but it is known to be a place swarming with potential wahaabi terrorists
Other than that, I'm pretty cool with pretty much every city
Except Banja Luka, but for political reasons
Banja Luka is a good city if you are from a small city and wanna go shopping
I'm not saying it's a bad city, I'm saying I'm biased because of political differences compared to where I'm from
I just don't like the people that live there
I dont care about that i just wanna go shopping
Go shopping my man, nobody's stopping you
Oh i will, i will
We use that as a "gotcha" joke too
Just instead of trains we use trams (talking about the capital, Sarajevo)
I like this similarity
Janitor
100% janitor
Hmm, what would BIH be
Uuh standing around doing nothing while we wait for money from our German aunt
But do they actually do it regularly
Like when going to work, supermarket, out for a beer, etc
>(Držislav, Višeslav, Vojnomir, Trpimir)
I find these names pretty cool
They sound a lot like old Croatian kings
I asked myself always if these names were preserved for the kings and upper class or did common folk used them as well
Zdeslav is my favorite btw
We have 3 presidents, offensive jokes (which here nobody finds offensive since we know they are jokes), we are at the same time the biggest patriots and the biggest haters of our country
Dear people, I present you the Bosnia and Herzegovina
Funny thing is that the Qatari government is probably the most transparent and smartest in the way they spend their resources on their citizens in that region, what could man expect from the others then
*sigh*
I wouldn't mind winter stuff if there was actual snow outside I can't remember what was the last time I saw proper snow in my
city
Absolutely not
Everyone here in Bosnia wants to be German and jokes about how their income is huge
We are fans of Germans if nothing
Baustela calling
Never say burek with cheese or potatoes
There is only one burek
As a European who visited the US, its all you guys ever talk about
Sorry, never heard of it
“Pita sa mesom” is burek
Burek only contains meat
Glad to hear there is unity and normal functioning,we dont have that in most of the balkans
This is fucking *AMAZING*
lmao the same in Bosnia
Umm it's not common
"Puši ko Turčin" - "smokes like a Turk" smokes a lot
"Špansko selo" - "Spanish village" something not understandable, you know nothing about it
"Glup ko Amerikanac" - "stupid like an American"
"...ali na Njemačkom" - "..., but in German" opposite
That there is a war going on here ...
Huh it's actually unusual how late in June it has gotten warm
Last year this time around we have been swimming in the rivers for 2 weeks already
I like summer and sunshine
The weather here in Bavaria wasnt't the best in the last two weeks
It rained a lot and it was about 20°C.
Right now it is 26°C so it is not bad and the weather will stay nice till sunday
The next week the temperatures will go down again
So i am enjoying these 2-3 days of summer
34°C, no clouds, unbearable humidity
and it's not even July yet
I want to die
Thanks you too
Went swimming today lol
The water got warm pretty quickly
This was a lot more wholesome and uplifting than I thought it would be
Thanks, I'll try not to
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah
First you feel either Bosniak, Serb or a Croat
After that it depends on the person
Almost all Bosniaks fell Bosnian
With Serbs and Croats it is another story
Someone even tries to deny the Bosnian nation, language, histroy etc
I am a Croat, but I feel Bosnian at the same time
No problem with that
I am 24
Yes and no
The younger generation tends to be more open but another factor that comes into play is the region where you are from
In Tuzla, the city where I come from, I do not know anyone who gets offended for calling them Bosnians
But there are other cities/regions where people will try everything to covnience you that they are not Bosnians
>Thats how it should be
Well, if that were the case everytime, BiH would have a really strong football team
It is hard to explain
I feel as Croatian as you do but Bosnian at the same time too
In the end my parents are from there, grandparents
How can I deny all that and pretend to be something I am not
Yugoslavia was an utopia in theory
It tried to bring similar ethnic gropus together and form a nation out of it
Well we all know how it came to an end
The situation can be compared to Germany in the 19th century
You managed to overcome that regional Bavarian, Saxonian etc
national identity and form a unified German one
We failed at that level
As I said earlier it depends on the region
In my region it is a common thing to see mixed marriages, whereas in other parts of the country, especially in the rural areas, it is a rare thing
The younger generation doesn't care most of the time
In the end, we all speak *the same language* and want to have fun like all young peole in the world

Something my friend who lives in Slovenia told me
"Slovenian sounds like a Bosnian is having a stroke"
Italian has three articles too, il, la and lo which work similar to der, die und das (atleast as far as I remeber
And I think so do other Romanic languages
I think the special thing in German which really barely any language has is how precise it is
There are single words in German where you'd need whole sentences to say that exact thing
For example 'Schadenfreude' (which even got integrated into the English vocabulary) or many more
Didn't know that but tbh I'm not surprised by that as German and Dutch are really close linguisticly anyway
I mean honestly, listening to Dutch I think I can understand little more than I would listening to some Swiss dialects (I live in Southern Austria)
My mistake then, my lessons in Italian lie 5 yrs in the past
I speak German but I I thought you meant articles in general and not the form article take, then I'll need to take my statement back
Summer time of course, sun already rises at like 5am in the summer, 7am in the winter and the winter days end at like 16:30 or 17:00 so having them end at 17:30 or 18:00 would be better
The further away you go from the centre the more gang members approach you
My friend has known someone who was called Niko, but it's Croatian name from what I know
That Tito died in WW2 and was replaced by a Russian spy or that Nikola Tesla was contacted by aliens and by far my favourite: that the Bosnian pyramids were built by an unknown prehistoric civilistation and that they are some kinds of “energetic centres”. Also some people think that aliens helped them and that they hid in pyramids for some reason and a later civilization (also unknown) buried the tunnels under the pyramids for unknown reasons
I think that there’s something to this but I don’t think all of these statements are true
Really
That’s even wilder
Yeah
We dont kidd around with that stuff, unles hahahah maybe hmmmm, what if, and by Allah hear me out on this one
Every country has certain things that are different and that just they understand
I am completely fine with this
It's what makes us unique
But one thing that I really can't understand and accept is the gun culture
Seriously, it's easy to buy a gun as it is to buy milk
A first world country doens't need this imo
That "buy like milk" reference was definitely an overestimation
I will try to explain myself a little bit different than
When I visited Texas I saw those selling gun shops every now and then
To put this into perspective you don't see this in Europe at all
AT ALL
Second, I am totally anti military leaning
I just don't like anything that has to do with war
It's my nature
And than you have media who potrays that issue in their own way
So, when I combine all this and compare it with what I am used to ( Europe beeing almost universaly gunfree)
I get a feeling that the USA has a really large problem (in my opinion) with their guns
It's just my opinion on how different I see that topic
Of course not every American is a gun freak
Besides all that I would definitely visit the States again
I gave an better explanation somewhere in the thread
Compared to Europe what I am used to, it's definitely waaay easier to own a gun in the States
It's not that I don't want to see it,  I really didn't see it in Europe
As I said I went to Texas once and it was different
I just compared that
Now I got curious and researched a little bit
It seems that around Zürich, Switzerland there are about 9 official stores
I am suprised honestly
Interesting to know
Somehow the only guns I ever saw in my life are those carried by the police
I don't even know someone who owns one
As I got deeper in this topic now, I changed my view a little bit
Calling Europe gunfree was false
You learn something new everyday
It has to do how we as a whole perceive it in my opinion
It varies from region to region, but overall I don't remember that Europe ever had a negative connotation with it
But I want to point out something
[This statistic] pretry much highlights want I wanted to say
The difference between the USA and the rest of the world is really huge
Remnants of the Yugoslav system
Also a nice tax evasion technique so most companies pay maximum allowed "lunch/hot meal" money
If you like knowing half of the language just by cussing then you'll love the Yugos
That's what's so shocking about the UK, insurance prices vary too freaking much, I'm sometimes glad it's a flat rate for everyone here plus a 50% discount if you've been driving for 3 years without an accident (it's progressive so you get 75% after your first year etc)
Young people seem to be a huge threat on the island, whereas it's mostly the 30-45 folks that cause the most accidents per number of licenses here
Yeah, I was about to write that, testbooks here have around 300 pages of various stuff, some of it is unpredictable (the famous wheelbarrow man in an intersection), most of it is easy, but it would take everyone at least a few days to pass that test from their first attempt
Every time or is it just for the older folks
Me too
Mine too
Imati muda (having balls) or imati muda od čelika (having balls of steel) means being brave
Hladiti muda (cooling your balls) means being lazy and doing nothing in particular
Edit: another word for balls is "jaja" which means eggs
Edit2: I had to edit it for the second time because I remembered "Imati muda do poda" (having balls to the ground) is actually used the most to reffer to being brave
That the high representative, the guy with the strongest power in Bosnia because he can change the constitution is never bosnian, croat or serb aka is not from this region
I also didn't think that this position still exists
He's from Slovakia
Yes
Stupid autocorrect
Hahahahaahahaha
He only messed something up one time and after that he is doing literally nothing and getting paid heavily
He's doing nothing like everybody else in politics in B&H
Yeah, especially those whose jobs are to root out corruption
Never seen it, I go to Adartic sea and I have never seen it
Bosnia
Lego is about the same price as Czechia, butthe avergae salary is 400€ a month
Lego is incredibly expensive here
Living on two 450€ incomes is alright, you won't miss anything in life, more than enough food, clothes, lot of eating out, vacation locally etc
Thing is that some families of 4 live on that amount or less per month which makes it harder
A Bosnian who doesn't eat burek
A Bosnian who doesn’t like Burek and Chevapi
I am Bosnian and I don't like ćevapi und burek
And also a Bosnian who doesn't love Germany and everything from that country
I don't like burek (the only (meat) pie that should bear that name), I adore zeljanica though
Smoking is far less prevalent among younger people here, is that the case in Croatia too
To Sunce = That Sun (Neutral) (but would mostly be perceived as male)
Taj Mjesec = That Moon (Male)
I'm using terms that, when translated are closer to "that" than "the" because "the" isn't really a thing in Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian
Last Nemanjić died in like 1371
Many wars were fought where Bosnia helped Serbia so you didn't fall under their influence for 70 years more
This exactly
It is impossible for croatian
There are so many tells for the pronunciation and the accent, and the grammar is very hard
Serbian
Writing is really easy
Accent - it depends where you are from, it is not impossible
Grammar - Good luck
From what I have heard from people who tried learning serbian, grammar is a nightmare
Thank you Germany for giving us jobs
But seriously we would be pretty fucked(and more crowded) if it wasn't for you
Croatia and Serbia equally
You can't decide between them
The Balkan is a Battle Royal
Ah yes, the famous Balkan bronemy triangle
Either we are brothers and want Yugoslavia back, or we want the others to disappear
There is almost no inbetween xd
I prefer [this] one
We felt it also, it woke me up, I live in the northern parts of Bosnia
In north west Bosnia and Herzegovina
Felt it too, wake me up this morning
Bosnia here (Sarajevo), I didn't feel anything but I'm a pretty heavy sleeper
I am Living in the central part of B&H and could still feel it
Felt nothing really, it wasn't a big earthquake but the damage was surprisingly great, makes you wonder how many of us have Austro-Hungarian period buildings that haven't been attended to in 100+ years, pieces of them just waiting to fall like they did in Zagreb
When I got the first opportunity to move to Germany I took it immediately without really thinking about the consequences at that time
5 years have passed by now and reflecting on my time when I grew up in Bosnia and being able to compare with it with other social and political systems, it hurts me to say it but it is an honest opinion, Bosnia is a shithole
I don't understand how 30 years after the war there is still this ethnic divide between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks
The situation is better between the younger generation but still this burden of war is there and it will be there for the next time unfortunately
I still love my country and visit it twice a year but the way it is organized it is doomed not to prosper and move forward
We have the nickname "Apsurdistan" and it really sums it up perfectly
For such a small country to have an unlogicaly complicated political system is apsurd
As I said being able to see and to live in much healthier and more organizes societies, there is no need for me to ever go back
I don't have those stories but from experience it is frowned upon to walk in home with shoes on, or bring in pets in somebody's home without asking
Lmao seperating trash in Balkan
Most places only require you to have a seatbelt in the front seats
My parents fled the war in the 90s so I was born in a different county
Although I I have lived my entire life there I just dont feel at home
I feel like I shouldn't be here at all
The people are nice and most of them see me as one if there own  but my heart just doesn't feel at home here
Indeed
If I don't want to get drunk, I'll drink coke or sparkling water or something
Not alcohol, the literal thing that makes you drunk
In Sarajevo, there are some billboards with citations from Quran and things Prophet Mohammad said
Other than that
As far as I know, no
Oh, thanks for pointing out
Ćevapi i burek
No doubt
ćevapi
meat sticks typically served with pita bread, onions and sour cream
Ok(no offense) so here in Bosnia burek is only meat pie
Sirnica is cheese pie
Zeljanica is spinach pie
Krompirača or krompiruša is potato pie etc
You can find that cheese mostly in Bosnia,Serbia,Croatia and I think in other countries of ex Yugoslavia
A Bosnian flag is very rear at least where i am living, but croatian flags are very common, hell i have one
I think you display it mostly during a World Cup
In Herzegovina (especially high Herzegovina) live moastly Croats, and as you know we are very proud of our country
The flags not always out on display, but on some acasions, some examples are: at weddings, when the roof is being placed on the house and when we are in the finals and semi-finals of sporting compatitions
Yeah, it's cool to see
Here is the photgraph and some context:
Tbh women are capable for all three currently existing types of services, no need to choose between exempting them and making new types of service up
Obviously adjustment can and should be made to make it proportionately less physically strenuous
Same here, would be a success
No true brother country, but I’d consider Austria, Germany and the US as very close friends of . We have a discusting trend of some people calling Turkey our brother nation which is just ridiculous
Croatia and Austria have too been always fond of us
Greetings to the ex Empire
The reasons people call us brothers for, given our history, are disgusting
I would go back to the old one as it has much more history and meaning behind it
First it needs to be said that the door that everyone here is talking about aren't really self-__locking__ -- they're still  unlocked, it's just that the external handle isn't functional
In theory if you squeeze something thin in the right spot in the space between the door and the door case, the door will open
For example a credit card
The external knob is fake, or to put it better it just serves so you can push the door once you turn the key
I'd say say they're a good thing and I'd prefer them over the doors that have a functional handle on both sides, but they have their downsides -- the feeling of fake safety will make you forget to *really* lock, and there's a solid chance you'll lock yourself out occasionally
Locking yourself out of a car has always been possible in European cars, too
I remember it happened to my mother once on an old Opel Corsa B back in the days
Steps to do it were: on a car with all other doors locked open the passenger's door, forget the keys in the car, press the lock on the passenger's door while exiting and close them that way
Voila, your keys are in the car with all doors locked
Džon mejd hiz vej tu a tevern tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut det hi forgot d mani

Detc kul
Do you know that back in the 19th century a linguist from Croatia, Ljudevit Gaj, used the Czech alphabet as an inspiration to create our modern writting system
First it was used in the Croatian language, but it spread out to the other South Slavic languages
Thats why we have letters like Č Š Ž Ć etc
Tenks for det Čekia
Haha me tu

You're not that far away, come and see us
We are way more interesting than we appear
I’ll just say - the Balkans
That should be enough
Pretty good
There was a joke i read
We are second most corrupt country in the world
We would have been first, but they paid us to loose
Well at least I know that it's from the same family
The model fits so so so perfectly with wath we have over the branch (haha grane)
its not the scratch my back I will scratch yours, it mutated into something more than simply quid-pro-quo
weird stuff
shhh it doesn't count
How could have you forgotten Stefan
Every ruler from Nemanjić dynasty was named Stefan
Over here she thought English and some Spanish words would sometimes be added
In Bosnia it's wether it's "burek sa sirom"(burek with cheese) or "sirnica" I think
We are less known
Most of the time people wouldnt know we exist and people dont know our capitals, I guess because there arent any major events in the capitals so there is no spotlight on us (just one of the reasons)
I think we are better in geography in general
Cities like Hamburg, Seville or Naples you hear from time to time and I can without any problems point them on a map
Then I meet people who don't even know that Sarajevo is our capital
The most common mistake is they mix it up with Zagreb or Belgrade or don't know at all
I meant entertainment event
We've been deflated by our politicians since forever, the corruption is unbearable here
Also, what war song
I've been out of touch with everything about war for the last couple of years, I cannot stand listening to anything related to that anymore
If I am to be honest, this is my first time hearing about this
I asked my mother she also said she hasnt heard it before
She also says there were a lot of war songs back then but she doesnt remember any and she doesnt want to remember either
It might have something to do with where you come from and how your family deals with what happened in general
My family, for example, doesnt want to remember war or talk about it more than necessary, which is I guess why I never heard about this
I'll be the non-EU bot that will correct you to EU only
This word exists in Bosnian too - čežnja
Other ex-yu languages have it as well
Haha, many journalists in Bosnian media mistranslated "haven" as if it was "heaven" over here, to the point that that tax heaven/paradise has entered the common usage
Seeing the mistranslation now leaking back into English-language media is really funny
1 billion percent
Ustashe is used for croats and chetniks for serbs
Same
Spezi is fairly available in coffee places and bars here too
Kinda disgusting when you drink it alone but combined with a spicy doner it's heaven
Tito is liked by the majority
The people that hate him ive only ever met in comment sections
Although i come from a very "red" town but still
Now that Covid is active ive heard his sentence about a million times:" IF THIS WAS TITOS TIME, WE WOULD HAVE A CURE THE MOMENT THE FIRST CHINESE SNEEZED
That's nice
We use Tunguzija to describe a really far away place
This is a actual place in Siberia (Russia)
We also use names that are not related to any real place but constructed by playing with words
Vukojebina (the place where wolves fuck)
Nedođija ( not+coming, the place where it is impossible to come to
I will include this althought it loses the entire meaning and it is hard to translate into English properly but believe it makes sense in Bosnian)
Nigdjezemska ( nowhere+land)
Bestragija (without a trace place)
Tungusia (nobody actually knows if it exists, and I’m too lazy to google it because it usually shows a river in Russia), but we more often say Bogu iza nogu or behind God’s legs
Oh we use a lot of different ones, like "usred ničega" which translates to "middle of nowhere", "Bogu iza nogu" which literally translates to "Behind God's legs" and "vukojebina" which literally translates to "wolf-fuckery"
There's probably a lot of others, but these come to mind first
I doubt it honestly
Pretty sure nobody cares about rules in Croatia unless it's an UNESCO town
I hate the old ones (well everyone has PVC now) but newer wooden ones are pretty fine
We do as well
You guys not only have Vegeta there, it's also a household name
TIL
I know it's exported to many countries, but thought its fame was mainly an ex-yugoslav thing
And 'UHU' for glue
Here we use zmaj (very similar to Romanian isn't it)
We always tend to dress up even for going to the store which feels weird when you visit Austria and Germany, but most countries are fine
Aww man, I'm a developer and consider myself more than literate, but at some point I developed the habit of doing two quick Caps Locks instead of Shift even for a single capital letter
People usually just find this funny when they see it, never thought people saw it like that I don't know about Shift
On the other hand, I do have prejudice against people who pronounce Ctrl by spelling it out instead of saying "control".
I would say sadly no one, we were friends with Croatia and Serbia for a long time, but our relationship is very complicated nowadays
We like you guys, Croatians too
People that like Ukraine, like Belarus too
Mostly prople that are nostalgic about Yugoslavia and support the pan-Slavic idea
In Yugoslavia days
I think that we weren't really enemies in that period
Throughout entire history up until the WW1, especially in the madeival times
Bosnian king sent tens of thousands soldiers to help Serbs fight the Ottomans in the Battle of Kosovo
You were opressed by Ottomans not Bosnians
Whats your point
Really popular, i sgarted drinking when i was like 15-16
Popular among people that drink alcohol, not everyone does though, that makes us different from the others
9/10 males in Bosnia drinks
Absolutely not true, not even in Tuzla
I'd say 5/10 for under 30s, 7/10 for older folks
I think that you are way off
My social circle doesn't include hardcore Muslims only, yet the minority of my friends and acquaintances drink
When I went to high school, there were never more than 4-5 boys that drank, out of ~20 in the class
Plenty of Bosnians feel Agnostic/Atheist but still reject alcohol
Hello, we have three presidents that represent three different nations, we have no say in anything, votes are always rigged, nice to meet you
Had grandchildren, i'm 26 after all
[This building is an architectural sin ]
Just a building blocking the wiev of a hotel and “hugging” it
Unexpected TV house, I'd think [Tibra] but that angle of the TV building is horrendous
Yes, it's common here
But you can choose do you actually want to go
Yes, they do, because we are a bit religious nation
The government-owned health institutions are a bit inflexible with salaries, i.e. all doctors on the same level have an identical salary, and it stays the same infinitely until the doctor's union goes to strike or something like that
So what happens is that the doctors that provide a good service in the public health sector can become somewhat well-known
Then they can simply negotiate, say, a 30% higher salary in the private sector
The result is that you're forced to pay something like 15% of your salary every month, but sometimes the best doctors are not covered by it because they moved to the private clinics
The upside is that due to the free competition, going private without any insurance whatsoever isn't terribly expensive, either
You can get an MRI with contrast for like $300, fix a tooth for $30, ultrasound for $20, etc
And I'm paying a private insurance plan that costs around $150 annually, covers up to $2000 in full amount (meaning I pay zero out of pocket), and with these prices it's quite hard to spend all that
Some people mentioned that you can spend a lot of time in the waiting room, tbh it sounds spoiled, I'm sure 99% percent of the Americans would love to be offered not to  pay the bill if they sit for an hour more
School starts at 8, 5 minute breaks in between, 30 minute break after 3rd period, 7 periods a day max in 99% of the cases
Hell yeah
When I saw the thread title, I immediately jumped in to talk about the 1st of May in Bosnia, but you described it perfectly
I guess the communist regimes did a good job at promoting celebration of labour
No one cares about the original purpose of the holiday anymore, but the timing is just perfect -- mid-spring when it's not cold anymore but the heat waves haven't started yet either -- and you get two days off work so you don't have to worry about being hangover
The very stereotypical 1st of May menu is a spit-roasted lamb, but some general selection that includes lots of ćevapi will suffice
[Here's a bonus picture of scenes similar to what you posted from Romania
Also every year there's an article in the local news outlets that takes a couple of photos of empty streets of cities that look like ghost towns because everyone is barbecuing somewhere
It’s mostly concentrated in the cities of Mostar and Sarajevo for internationals, however locals and people from the region like to visit all of the ski spots like Bjelašnica, Vlašić and Jahorina
Not WW2 but my great-grandfather was POW  and was held in Sicily
When he got released, he had to walk by foot back to Bosnia
Nevertheless he was really happy when he found out that the Austro-Hungarian Empire fell
Balkan wikis are biased as hell
About things that happened here English wikis usually just take one side of the story and put it up as fact
If possible be Slavic
If not be ready to cry
Croatian is hard for non-native speakers
"Ja sam the napravila i ja cu te i pokvariti"
I made you and I can destroy you too
We have " were you born on a boat"
Yes I can
It's the same like with your language
Every sound has it's letter and how you say a word is exactly how you will spell it
Yes always
It's not that hard tho, because our writing system is almost 100 % phonological
Edit: just foreign words are spelled like in the original language
All of the south slavic languages are essentially the same
would also add things like brate/bra, abi and habibi which all were brought up by immigrants (Ex-Yugoslav, Turks and Arabs in these cases) and are in common use for German/Austian young people
Serb, Bosniak or Croat, all can say there is only one burek
Burek is the pita made with Beef and onions and only that
Everything else needs to be refered by their respective names (sirnica, krompiruša,....)
Yes, it is also a valid answer, but only meat burek is exclusively Bosnian
I worked at an Italian restaurant here in Austria, my boss was Italian and I can remember a couple things he was disgusted about regarding order by customers:
- ketchup on any kind of pasta or pizza, highlight was one guy who wanted ketchup on a Frutti de mare pizza
- a guy wanted Gorgonzola on the Frutti di mare pizza
- Grana in any kind of pasta with seafood or fish in it (except for salmon)
There were more but these are the ones I remember fondly
Gud bevare postnord
I have to say Zenica from my country
Fucking nuclear wasteland (not really nuclear but a huge factory-based city, I swear its the top 3 most polluted cities in the world)
Brain drain
ya know, young and old educated people
for a better life
same old same old
*pretty much any Balkan country
it can be as cheap as 0

Don't have an opinion on them
Zdravo, zovem se Ivan
Drago mi je
Odakle si ti
Hi, call myself Ivan
Nice me is
From where are you
A Chancellor is just a German name for a Prime Minister
So there is no difference between
A Prime Minister is the head of goverment
After every election the new goverment chooses their new PM and every decision they make the PM is responsible to perform it
The President is seen as more or less a ceremonial position
He is not directly involved in the decision making of the goverment
He normally has a veto power and can overthrow the goverment and set up new elections, but this happens very rarely
Every country is different in their structure
I know that in France for example they have a semi-presidental system
Basically the President has more power than in a parlamentary republic
PMs aren't members of the parliament in any of the Balkan states for sure, it could be anyone who's trusted by the ruling coalition of political parties
No Man's Land
It won an oscar
No Man’s Land
Bosnia's "the perfect cyrcle". Its the most popular movie about the yugoslav wars in sarajevo and other bosnian cities
It has the same actor as the one that played Izet Fazlinović in the comedy series "lud, zbunjen, normalan".
Really good movie
It was frustrating but very interesting
Totally my shout as well
Amazing production, with an insight on our ideological problems and a strong anti-war narrative
Amazing production, so glad I watched that (history buff)
Anyone
I'll take anyone at this point
On of our current presidents denies the existence of the biggest genocide in our country's history
Hell I'll take even Trump
I don't know who's running the Belgian government, but I pick them, no one else would understand Bosnia
Yeah our fortresses and both Roman and medieval remains are often overlooked in the touristic offer, many people will mention Jajce waterfalls and beautiful scenery but you'll rarely hear about the fortress, same applies to Ključ, Srebrenik, Blagaj, Vranduk and other fortresses
Not from PIGS or stereotypical South Europe but my driving examiner got mad at me for taking the inner lane in a roundabout (I was taking the third exit so it was logical) and told me to "save that behaviour for after getting my license"
Not here, outer lane even if you're going a full circle for some reason, probably afraid of a candidate not checking their mirrors and crashing into someone
Well there are no regulations here on how you should behave in a roundabout, there are recommendations and stuff but you don't lose points for driving in the outer line, only if you don't stop or cut ahead of a car that's already in
Not as fancy as the other museums mentioned but I really like [the national museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]
It's awful that's what it is
My grammar school had around 550 students like 10 years ago
Now it has 70
And a normal hs next to us had like a few thousand students and now it has 700
The city is like a ghost town
And the holiday season is awful, when everyone comes visiting and you can't literally breathe because of them
And they are very entitled,thinkibg that the lives of us locals revolve around them lol when in reality we are looking forward to the peace and quiet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Which high school had thousands of students lmao
Where do you live
Statistically your population seems to be about the same as 20 years ago, if the data is correct
Not like idk 10 thousand but 10 15 years ago it had like 2 thousand which is considerably more compared to now
I live in USK but I won't specify the city because ya know I would like to stay anonymous
I'd love to spend some time in Cluj as a software engineer
Yes, it's one of the most prominent European hubs, the fully abolished tax on IT income makes it very competitive salarywise with some more developed countries and I've only heard the best about the city itself
Still shouldn't be much more expensive than here and given the wage gap in IT the living standard should be even better there
Yeah it's about the same here except you won't pay the 10% income tax after all the social givings
When I went to school, we more or less all came to the school without adults during the first grade, today it starts happening a couple of grades later
I live in a rural setting though, but I talked to my peers who grew up in cities and it seems like the age where they start walking alone has quite moved up there, too
It seems as a general trend that younger parents are becoming much more protective of their kids than the earlier generations, and it reflects on this, too
I can somewhat understand Medieval Bosnian, and also the writing because its similar to the cyrillic alphabet
1600s Travnik
1700s Sarajevo
1800s Sarajevo
1900s Sarajevo
2000s Sarajevo
Probablt correct, BogauCelo
It was capital before Sarajevo existed
It's Travnjak in Bosnian
Actually, im mistaken
It was capital when Sarajevo was burned to ground because of it's location
And it was in center of country
Sarajevo was burned to the ground in 1697, between the 1660s and 1690s it had over 100k people and was around the 10th place in Europe's biggest cities
We get English as a subject in schools in 3rd grade, so then
I improved my English by watching YouTube videos
It's actually an EU-funded programme that lets you travel to Balkan and Eastern Europe countries that aren't in the EU and lets us go anywhere too
Given that the supply of places outweighs the demand and you're getting a free scholarship, a lot of people just go, do nothing at their host uni and save money
>If you have the money, it might be worth investing in an electric car, as these will soon be mandatory in much of Europe anyway, and are much better for the environment
Maybe in 2040
We have 20km of coastline
The rest belongs to Croatia and Montenegro
Their identity issues are truly a sight to behold
When I was a high school student, I had a discussion with a philosophy professor from Skoplje on Facebook and he had some interesting obscure German philosophers to recommend but holy mother of God, his views on history were Skopje 2014 down to a T. I still vividly remember a boyhood memory when I first asked my father about the controversy around the name of the country and my father started his answer with ''Sine, Grci su u pravu'' (Son, the Greeks are right)
In Bosnian it would be "majmun", meaning monkey, or "ludo a", meaning crazy A.
"Ludo a" or literally translated "crazy a".
It's very funny whenever I think about it -- it sounds like just a very honest description that was created on the spot by someone who isn't the slightest bit creative, imaginative or funny
A total opposite of the typical stuff that enter the slang of the general population
For some reason I find that unfunniness so funny
Like yeah, it's an 'a', but not a regular a; it's a weird a. Duh
Same as most people here, I support other Ex-Yugoslav countries
I was pretty bummed when Croatia lost in the WC Final
Serbia
Croatia
Slovenia
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Anyone else
Everyone loves the Irish, they're just so interesting lads
Most of the Balkans is like that, still unspoilt by big production
It's normal here too so they might be Balkan
Was it tho, Algoritam translation just uses more apostrophes to make it seem he's from a rural setting
My mom calls it šalabakter, I guess that's how they used to call them back then
Nowadays it's called puškica, meaning little gun
My friend once wrote a cheat sheet the size of a notebook page and we joked that it's not a puškica, it's a machine gun
We call them puškice-little guns, tomovi-no special meaning and šalabahter-also no special meaning
Đonovi
It literally means shoe soles and makes absolutely no sense
Same here as well
Đon and šalabahter are more popular
Never heard those two before
Absolutely not, 8kg backpacks were common
But in high school nobody carried books and mostly carried only 2-3 notebooks so it was a way to relieve the back pressure
I think small kids nowadays are required to have a locker in their school at least up to 3rd grade
We have them in my HS, but it's definitely not the norm
The only thing resembling a locker I ever had was in kindergarten, it was a locker where we would put our jacket and shoes for the time we were in kindergarten
Although I have a friend in gymnasium (is that how you write it
) who says they have lockers
So maybe some highschools have them
I remember it was the worst when I was like 9-11, later I guess they stopped checking if we brought all of books and in highschool they are almost completely unneeded
Which is great
It seems to be so everywhere in Europe
However, under the influence of the American media, I wouldn't be surprised if we made a switch to their system in the future
It's not uncommon for less quality press to translate trillion as
trillion, instead of a billion which is our actual equivalent
Hell, I've even heard some youngsters who consume a lot of American content to say "billion" for a milliard, though that's not common yet
Our government is just terrible
Not unique, I know, but we have THREE presidents
3x more corrupt and useless than any other nation’s leaders
It is only “normal” for us
In order to bring an end to the Bosnian War in the 90’s, an agreement was made between the “3 constituent peoples” of Bosnia
Those being Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats, and Bosnian Serbs
The agreement decided that two entities within Bosnia would be created, those being “The Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina”, and “Republika Srpska”. They are basically two states within Bosnia and Hercegovina
The reason we have 3 Presidents was to appease the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs, and to lessen the potential of discrimination between the 3 peoples
I must admit that this does make sense for the time, as you can’t allow any of the people groups to be discriminated against, especially after a war that included ethnic cleansing and genocide
(Crimes on all sides)
However, these days the system leads to high levels of corruption, and a political system that promotes division instead of unity
Sentiments like “Vote for my party, we can’t give the Bosniaks/Croats/Serbs too much power
” Are common and are used to divide us
Decisions for the country can’t be made without the presidents agreeing, and that basically never happens
This is a big reason why Bosnia is poor and backwards
It’s a framework that just doesn’t work anymore
However, the Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to support abolishing our Tri-President system
They would see this as “losing”, and people from the Balkans don’t like to lose
The fact of the matter is, that as long as we keep our current system, the entire country loses
If we were to get rid of the current framework, we would just need to make sure none of our people groups are discriminated against
We are neighbors, brothers, and citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and we must move forward together
Which would you say is the most corrupt
Mostly ethnic, but religion is a part of many people’s identity so that is considered as well
Most people have no issues between ethnic groups
It’s only a concern when it comes to politics
It is really just old people and the “villagers” that have issues between ethnicities
By villager, I mean those that live in the middle of no where and only know people within their ethnic group
Hmm, well I don’t have any statistics to argue with you, so I suppose I’ll trust you lol
Honestly I’m a bit surprised that North Macedonia is that corrupt, they seem to be headed in the right direction
I completely agree with you
Unfortunately, Bosnia is too poor to drastically overhaul its education system
Those that are highly educated end up leaving the country for more prosperous ones, like Germany
We have some of the highest levels or “brain drain” in Europe
I appreciate your kind words, friend :)
Yes I understand what you mean
I suppose the quality of the education is important too
What people don’t realize is if kurds get their own state bordering turkey and become powerful enough they woll start cpntesting the land that a large portion of kurds live in turkey
Turkey is just preemptively preventing this
A kurdish state would not be yazidi
You wanna give up a piece of australia for them
Only a minority
They are mostly sunni muslim
...neither are the english
Wanna give up all of your land to the indigenous australians
I mean its easy telling others to give up some of their land
not so much when its your country in question
Well you have the only city with two clubs who both won the UEFA Champions League (AC Milan and Inter)
Can confirm
well we dont have words and its artificially made so it fucking sucks
It has no text and it lacks a "climax" or drop because its just build-up with nothing to top it off, if that makes sense
A džezva
It’s a special Bosnian ”pot” for making coffee

English is generally speaking an easy language
Because a majority of media is in English it is easier to learn
But the pronunciation was for me a bit difficult
The same letter is pronounced differently is different words
My languages is phonetically consistent so that was for me the most challenging part
I honestly don't see anything bad at that, I met a lot of 2-4 finger typers that can type 80-90 wpm
Be aware of robbers
They are masterminds
Also taxi drivers sometimes overprice
What countries do you call differently in your language ?
Completely different from the official English name used by the UN and what does it mean
Example: Germany - Njemačka ( land of the mute people )
I would say them but you already know
Edit : I edited the question
The accent is on **completely**
We use Ujedinjeno Kraljvstvo ( United Kingdom ) just for formal meetings
In regulrar daily speech if you are referring to the UK most would say Velika Britanija ( Great Britain )
What does the word "an" mean
And why do some countries have it in the beginning and others not
Is there a pattern
We got the name Njemačka from the word *nijem* which means *mute, silent, not being able to speak* When the early Slavs encountered Germanic tribes they couldn't understand them, and said " Ok guys, these people are not able to speak proper, let's call them *Nijemci*"
But as I saw here it is a common Slavic name for Germany
It lasts until today
Germany has quite a list of foreign names for the country
What about The Ivory Coast / Côte d'Ivoire
I think it's an interesting name because most countries use a translation from the English / French term as the official name for the country
Bijelo means white in all Slavic languages
So Bjelorusija is White Russia
Let me guess
Bosnia et Herzegowina
Lol, I like the story
So in Romanian *Nemti* could mean something along the lines of a foreigner
The word itself comes from Proto Slavic *nijem* meaning mute, silent, not being able to speak
When the Slavs encountered the Germanic tribes, they were not able to understand or to communicate with them ,obviously, and started to call them Nijemci
That's why we call the country *Njemačka*, the people *Nijemci*, or the language *njemački*
I saw somewhere in the thread, someone said that *welches* means foreigner and that's how the country Wales got it's name
"The land of foreigners" sounds cool tho
[here you go]
Edit: what I found interesting is that the Welsh name for their country *Cymru* means *countryman* *from the people*. So you basically have two completely different  names and meanings for the same country
The historic country of Venice is called *Mletačka republika* but the modern city itself just *Venecija*
If you ask me I guess it is a cognate
Veneto - Beneto - somehow Benatky in the end
But I am far away from being a linguist you should trust
>Baltarusija
So if *balta* means *white* obviously, is that how the region the Baltics got the name ? Meaning *the white land* or something similar
I never meant this
I answered this somewhere there in the thread
But here we go again:
The United Nations is a international organisation with 6 official languages
One of them happens to be English
Therefore every country has an **official** English name with which it is listed in the UN
Official, meaning from the Oxford dictionary - "Having the approval or authorization of an authority or public body
I didn't used the word *official* meaning *right* or *proper*
"Official English name used by the UN". The way the UN lists countries is in a way official
There are six official languages of the UN
These are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish
I try to avoid this, althougt I know there are people who make this mistake
Calling the whole UK just Engleska is disrespectful to Scotland, Wales ans Northern Ireland
Oh ok
I just looked up the link you posted and was curious
It seems it is used 50/50
Well that's their problem
I will be honest with you
If someone thinks Bulgarian or Bosnian are equal with English, they should go to Sweden for example and speak their native language
Good luck communicating with someone
I don't mean we should abandon our native language and start speaking English
I would never do that
But comparing English with languages that are spoken just in one country it's apsurd
English is the most common lingua franca in the world
It is an easy answer
Because everyone in this subreddit uses English and it is by far the most understood language here
If I asked to compare it to Bosnian no one would have a clue because you don't know how we call other countries
Of course it is official
Every country has an official name for another country
The United Nations, as I said, has 6 official languages
Therefore there are 6 official ways you can name a country in the UN
I don't understand what is the problem with that
Qatar is literally the "least bad" country in the Gulf, they care a lot about education and healthy fundamentals for such a small country and even survived the blocking by imperialistic alliance led by Saudi Arabia and even the workers rights that are horrendous in whole of the Gulf at least state that physical workers can't work in peak sun hours
Of course, we should absolutely raise questions about the elevated number of deaths caused by workplace incidents and overworking of mostly South Asian construction workers and possibly think about repercussions and boycotting but the comment you made definitely supports the wrong side
Well that's a risk with all of the countries of the Gulf but none practice sharia on tourists anymore
Sveto Rimsko Carstvo Njemačke Narodnosti (The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation)
This is the official name but the last part (German Nation) is mostly left out
Sveto rimsko carstvo- basically the same as in English
It would be too much work in our case for something so unneeded
I have a Bachelor's in English and I still sometimes mix in and at when it comes to places
Well, let’s just say that’s when the 3 different ethnicities used the wars to justify their atrocities
The real hate of each other stems from the World Wars, and the ethnic cleansing / genocides that came with them
Not really
The country we were in has fallen apart in 1990s so we could start foreign relations from scratch but the war that happened in 90s.largely effects it tho
I don't and we are mainly Muslims but still act pretty much the same as anyone in Hungary or Austria, surely the mentality is a bit different from the Austrian one, but that has more to do in being abused by big empires, therefore less developed and encouraging people to find ways to "cheat the system" which was always the case, even in "peaceful and prosperous" socialist Yugoslavia (the 1945-1992 one) people still found ways to ensure that they get more of what was supposed to be "equality".
Turkish customs didn't really stick that much unless in very rural places and we are all much more Italian/Spanish than Turkish looking
Being compared with Ukraine, Moldova and Kosovo hurts, things are sometimes very slow due to ethnic groups blocking laws they don't agree with, but come on
Je n' ai pas beaucoup l'argent
[This one definitely]
but we sadly had to change it because of the
[Dayton agreement] Agreement

I've only seen people pack their bags in a designated space in DACH
Everywhere else I've been you pack it as they come from the cashier at the checkout like in any other hypermarket
Is it different in Ireland
All of ex Yugoslavia actually
Maybe Portugal
Croatia - small in population, but a football powerhouse
It seems very amazing to me that's group of 16 year olds can understand Dachau and that it can touch them, kudos to you
In Bosnia, as well as other as other west Slavic languages I think, we don't bother pronouncing the umlauts, but also usually replace ü with i and ö with e.
So we just say (and often write it) Minhen, read like that - "Minn-hen", and Dusseldorf is pronounced like diesel-dorf
Traveling on the M6, it connects the towns of Čapljina - Trebinje and is a common route people take when heading to and from Dubrovnik (coastal town in Croatia) or to Montenegro
Besides a couple of towns, it's very rural and all you will see for nearly 2 hours is mountains after mountains, hardly any houses and one gas station
The most quietest part of the country in my opinion
Good luck hearing anything on the radio besides static when traveling through here
You'll also pass a few signs saying "watch for mines", just to keep you unnerved throughout the journey
Based on a study I did in my household 30 seconds ago, It's not really popular here in Bosnia & Herzegovina
Same thing was with being fat
If you have a different accent you are probably from a different city or county
That's all as far as I know
I don't think so, pretty normal for students and people who work alone or just want to blow off some steam
There are [three cultural sites] in Bosnia and Herzegovina (and 11 under consideration)
French names are the best and I'm sad I won't be able to name my children French names
I think it's typed esmeé and Elise is also a nice name
If I spelled it right
South Slavic surnames, typically, end in “ić”.
The ić ending has the same meaning as your aforementioned examples
It means of the x descent/family/profession
Can confirm, BiH right now is a bit of a mess, politically and ethnically
Hopefully another war doesn't burst out anytime soon, and everything could be solved without one
The problem is that the political leaders in the Balkans are nowhere near the best, and I highly doubt that these issues will be solved completely
Youth people don't feel patriotic at any side and the veterans are fed up with the way the government is treating them so there's no way anything happens
TBH the economy started getting better before Covid and the political stuff is actually getting better every day, only outsiders think that something will happen and Serbians pity us for some reason, even if they're not better developed at all
I'd say the same for us but we fired our worst coach in history and will play both the semis and the potential finals at home and we're pretty damn good at home so there's hope
Who did that
So sad to see that
Bosnia and Herzegovina:
Probably during the 1910’s, including the lead up to World War 1
A story centered around the plot to assassinate the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is exactly the type of story Assassins Creed is made for
Serbian and Croatian I understand everything
Suprise, suprise
Macedonian it gets a little bit tricky but it is not a big deal
Slovenian and Bulgarian is where the fun starts
I have to be really focused to the speaker if I want to understand a good portion of the sentence
From other Slavic languages, Slovak is the most understandable
It is because of the pronounication, that is similar to our South Slavic one
Slovak has words that they share with Bosnian but not with other Slavic languages
One example  **mačka** meaning **cat**
Another language with a high understand rate is Russian
The pronounication is completely different, but there are huge junks of words that share an common origin
Both Russian and Bosnian were influenced by Old Church Slavonic
Czech is almost like Slovak but not quite
The pronounication sounds to hard for me, where else Slovak has this mixture od hard and soft, like we have in the South
With Ukrainian and Belarussian I did not have a lot of contact
I can recognize that is a East Slavic language because of the pronounication
Somehow Russian is in the end the most understandable
I put Poland on the last place
Sorry guys
It is really hard to understand
You get some words here and there but that it is
Polish is unique among Slavic languages
The way it is pronounced and written it is almost alien
Yeah I'd go along with putting Polish in the "I get we have similarity, but what the fuck
" section
Than *kukuruz* *šetati* *pandur* *cipela* or *hajduk* does not sound unfamiliar either ;)
Exactly this
The first time I heard Slovak I was like : Wait, you guys really speak that similar to us o.O
Correct 5/5
I know about these examples, but there seems to be more because
Szoba is definitely a room
Csizma - boot
Sogor - your wife's brother
That is a Croatian word
In Bosnia we say *zet*
Malna - ? some kind of berry, blueberry, rasperry maybe
Kovacs - Smith
Alrighty then i guess im not coming to Split again any time soon
Vi havde også én uges svensk og én uges norsk i folkeskolen, så helt indelukkede er vi heller ikke
Virkelig
Havde det en enkel gang i 7
eller 8
, det bestod bare af at læse tekster på et af de to sprog
Se det er interessant
Vidste slet ikke man skulle have svensk og norsk på STX, men min erfaring med lærere er at de hopper rundt og udvælger det de synes er vigtigst/ungår det man ikke kan trække til eksamen
Ahahah jeg behøver skam ikke en kandidat for at regne den ud
Spøg til siden, faktisk for nyligt tænkte jeg på hvor meget klogere er en dansk lærer i folkeskolen egentlig end en 3
g’er på STX eller whatever tilsvarende
Naturligvis glemmer man ting hist og pist, ikke nødvendigvis kun en dansk lærer men også flere fag
Idk var bare en tanke midt et samfundsfags lektion
The jokes are way older than the post-Yugoslavia form of Bosnia and Herzegovina though
Well subtitles are important for proper spelling even after understanding what the people were saying
And obviously for late night binge parties when the sound can't be that loud
For some reason, *rare* is much more difficult than *rural* for me, but generally I agree the words with multiple Rs are worst words to pronounce
And *rarer*, is that even a word
I don't have any huge trouble with Ls, though, or any other combinations in particular
The Baltics seem to be really similar when you compare the sense of humour and what could've been without the war
We share a basketball passion with Lithuania and Latvia too
Here(at least in my town) the tradition is that when someone dies ,the neighbourhood digs the grave
One person from each household has to go
I live in a pretty "red" neighbourhood but everyone still does it
If nobody from your house goes(without a valid reason)  its considered rude
During the burial religious people stand in the front for the prayer while we others just stand in the back ,wait till its over, cover the grave and thats it
Usually food ia made and given to the family
Youre oblidged to go to their house for coffee in one of the next 40 days
[The Cellist of Sarajevo] is a pretty strong contender in my opinion
The juxtaposition of a cultural monument reduced to rubble and a living nicely dressed musician playing a cello during a medieval style city siege in the late 20th century is quite a combination
I've seen dude summing up all angles in triangle and getting 214 degrees or something
It was Introduction to Mechanics on First of Mining Faculty
I find ancient civilizations pretty interesting
One that stands out for me is Greece
The amount of things they contributed to our modern western world is astonishingly high for a relatively small country
The philosophy of ancient Greece is my favourite topic
How they thought about life, us humans, the world around us is just amazing
And don't get me even started on the mythology stuff
How they tried to describe the world, I could listen to this all day long
Even the waiters walk around in your national wear in that pub
Hope you had fun in Sarajevo
Not always first on people’s to visit lists, but people always end up having a lot of fun
No I haven't. Should I?
Besides Austria where I live and Bosnia where I'm from I know most hymns due to watching World and European cups
I believe the countries I could confidently say I'd guess only by hymn would be Croatia, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the UK and Brazil (who I think have a really cool anthem imo)
And due to media I'd add the US and Canada too
Few years ago it would snow quite regularly, now it barely does
Fairly often December-February, usually 10cm or so, we had a few bigger hauls with 0
5-1m in the last 20 years, nothing has changed in the recent years
It's frowned upon and in my experience people will try to shove their religion down your throat
Big no-no
People don't know how to mind their own business here
Well the 3 of them are all a big fat joke
The whole goverment is
Some tv station put a paper on the wall of the parliament that said:
,, For sale because it isn't used often''
That pretty much sums it up
North and South America are two seperate continents
Central America is mentioned aswell as a region and thus part of North America
As for the other I honestly don't remember what we were officially taught
It is up to personal preference more then anything else I would say
Australia is the default name and it is more used in conversation
I even saw those two named combined, so you get "Australia and Oceania".
Almost the same here, Australia and Oceania is the only difference if I remember correctly
The only family gatherings I've had have been funerals
Other than that, I don't really stay in touch with anyone but my parents, grandparents and sister
Neither of my parents have siblings, so it helps in keeping this part of the family sort of isolated from the rest

His mother always make pasta mushy and he hated that
Sometimes I joke that he married me because of food
That we have 3 presidents(Bosnia)
When older people close all windows during summer because the draft will kill you
I have heard of it in a cartoon
We don't have it because words ate written like they are said
No, we don’t. Our language is really phonetic, but there are organized competitions from some subjects like Bosnian(Croatian/Serbian), Geography, Maths, English, Computer Science, Physics
first level is municipal competitions, then cantonal, federal and state ones
And here if the bathroom is too small for a bidet
Uhh there's a band from our country that perfectly sums up our country's state
These two are my favourite: [song 1] and [song 2] You can turn on CC for both
Our football fan song "Hajmo Bosno" (Go Bosnia)
One of my favourites songs at all, I love it
It sounds very Bosnian and I think it perfectly reflects our Bosnian spirit, patriotism and culture, and the lyrics also describes geography of our country, singing how the song of joy and happiness spreads throughout the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Una river to Drina river, across the mountains and hills towards our sea and Sava river, and that song really triggers many emotions at me
I remember how everyone was singing that song in November 2013 when B&H qualified to the World Cup 2014
Or myb try with this link as it has better audio quality
Indeed, those are also pretty great
Why is that so
We dont have fancy letters, well maybe a couple like ž š č ć đ dž lj nj, but our grammar sucks and everyone would hate it
My nose would freeze if I opened the window and slept while 15° is the daily temperature
That's barbaric IMO, I always freeze if the temperature is below 22-23 degrees in my bedroom
[Blackburn Rovers]
Biased for sure as it is my favorite team but AC Milan is my top
pick
Real Madrid, Olympique Marseille, Olympique Lyon and PSG have nice logos too
That's why I like it most, unique shape, colors, meaning, art, beautiful
Maybe not unique to my country but unique to the region is having loads of bread with pretty much every dish
In Bosnia, we make plum Knödeln (knedle), and there are even shops dedicated to them (not many)
11th century (?) - 1463 (Ottoman rule)
1992 -
No,Bosnia was an independent country and it even had larger teritorries including Dalmatia
Bosnia even had their own religion-Church of Bosnia which lasted until the Ottoman rule because patarens (members of Church of Bosnia)had a similar religion to islam and they eventually all became muslims
What city disappointed you the most when visiting
For me it's definitely Palermo
Here we go:
* Lack of sights and squares
* Very little pedestrian options
* People selling their stuff on carpets at weird flea markets where everyone stares at you like you don't belong there even though it's in the central area of the city
* Organised dog fights literally in the back alley of the said market and in one other park that's a bit more near the port
* Unsafe and sad feeling throughout the city
We pronounce it as H in words, like Horse
And we pronounce the letter itself like H!
Or "vukojebina" for that matter
Pretty much everyone
In Bosnia it's "list, kamen, makaze". This can be translated as "__leaf__, rock, scissors", or "__paper__, rock scissors", since we use the same word for a leaf and for a piece of paper (typically you'd say "a leaf of paper" if we translate literally)
In my mind as a kid the list part always stood for a leaf, rather than a piece of paper, though
Yeah and kids actually often say it out loud while doing the hand-shaking thing, like "Liiiiiiist, kameen, makaa
-ZE
", with the "ze" part being simultaneous with the rock/paper/scissors gesture, haha
I can't imagine your variant being said out loud in this manner, it's either not said at all or it's a different rhythm
We have these two exactly the same as you :
>Jasne jak słońce
Jasno kao sunce
>Mieć coś w małym palcu
Imati nešto u malom prstu
The meaning is the same obviously
Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro without problem
Slovenia would be pretty doable and North Macedonia/Bulgaria would be more difficult but possible
I could travel around Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, no problem :)
Germany:
"Guten tag
Ich spreche nicht Deutsch
Sprishst du Englisch
Sarajevo is rather safe at night in terms of walking home alone, no issues
Residential neighbourhoods will often be empty so when you get there from your night out it might feel odd but there's nothing to be afraid of
Kite means *dicks*
I am croatian and half of those are the same over here
It's expected here too, not necessarily in cafes or cheap pizza/fried food places, but it would be weird not to tip in restaurants
That's very popular in Bosnia too, although luckily dying with the younger generation, I never encountered anyone under 30 that fought about who's paying, unless if it was a surprise "I'm paying" and the bill is 20+ euros
I agree, it's a mortal sin not having it
TBH the subbing is far more common in Europe, it's just that the bigger countries can afford to dub if their language is strong
Of course it does, it's sold in most theaters
Not many buyers though for obvious reasons
Not Europe as a whole but about the balkans
Some people think Bosnia Serbia Croatia Montenegro slovenia and macedonia are the same thing
And they don’t understand why we arent one country
>someone does something gay
>” its french”
Goes to berlin, paris, rome and/or london
Says that they traveled all of europe
I say on the internet that im slavic and everyone goes “cyka blayt” or “your russian
” or some other adidas or vodka joke
Yeah its a pretty good song
True but it does have the international airport where people might visit it that way
TIL there's a Kremlin outside of Moscow
*skaht* is basically *skhot* in our language, language rules make it into *Skot*.
But only Serbs transcribe names out of all Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian-Montenegrin-whatever speakers
Yes
Heres a controversial one: ćevapi
yes, we do like to eat them every so often but not like every week, most people eat them once a month
- Maths - blue
- English - red
- Science - green
- Second language - Yellow
How is the Vlore airport project going
Of course they can, it's not frowned upon by regular people and is pretty normal to see friends sharing a coffee in a bar without assuming they're a couple
We just say ”halo”, which doesnt have a proper translation in English
Drywall isn't a thing unless your existing brick/concrete walls aren't straight so you put it to fix the issue
Otherwise, new things will be delivered to your actual apartment/home and installed usually for free by the seller and for old stuff you just rent a van or a moving company
Yep, you lay a foundation mixture and foundation colour when you renovate and then you paint over that
drilling or making obscene noise at 7am
Yeah but that doesn't last long unless they're either:
* very poor or both unemployed
* living in a huge house
Not sure about you guys but freshly-wed city couples are expected to rent here as soon as they marry
And if you're from the biggest city in your country that also has a significant part of the population, you don't move out :D
True, except while driving, expect the unexpected if you're driving in Albania :D
And the food's awesome, there is no other country that offers so much good quality cheap food with the most chefs being trained in Italy
We have it in Bosnia too
We call them kifle as well
Common in rural areas and among poor people in cities
Because it's usually the poor that live outside the natural gas and city heating system zones and can't afford electric convectors
They also often use charcoal
Bruh, modern Bosnia and Herzegovina has a ''hold my beer'' competition when it comes to traitors
Even during the halcyon days before the war (neighboring Croatia was already balls deep in conflict during the same time frame) you had Croat and Serb ethnic para-states in waiting
But those aren't the only ones
Fikret Abdić, the guy who had won more votes than Alija Izetbegović for Bosnia's collective presidency in 1990 but inexplicably forfeited the leadership of said presidency, formed a para-state of his own in Velika Kladuša during the war
He is now the mayor of said city
He is also a convicted war criminal
Ali-aga Rizvanbegović i Smail-aga Čengić
Fikret Abdic is a good shout
For anyone thats not familiar with the Bosnian War - think of the scenario as an influental Jewish army leader who worked alongside the Nazis
What makes things worse is that he should have won the elections, democratically
Literally cucked out on one of the earliest rebellions in Europe, the predecessor of the 1840 revolutions across Europe
Fucking money-grabbing pricks, long live secular Bosnia under Husein captain
Who is ''you'' and who is ''us'' in your sentence ?
Who are ''our people''. People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on one side and people of Serbia on the other ? I'm a Bosnian Serb btw
All the non bosnians i know call sirnica "burek sa sirom"
Burek je burek, sirnica je sirnica
Seljačine
Yes but it tastes real bad, had zeljanica for dinner today tho
Finally someone i agree with
Plenty of people in my maternal grandfather's home town don't bother to close the door to their house for most of the day during summer
The result is that their living rooms are often filled with flies, ''Lord of the Flies'' style
Most everyone is very religious as well, there isn't much fun to do, people sleep on weird tiny pillows and the kids are little shits, one even groped me
The place was always suffocating for me and I hated visiting it
My maternal grandmother's home town was much lovelier
It's pretty possible if you hit something in front of you which makes you fly over the bike straight onto your head and knees
Folk dance known as "Kolo" across Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
Lol Gaudeamus brings back high school Latin memories, it's usually sung at University ceremonies when diplomas are handed, but it's never by students
Maturantski ples doesn't exist in high schools here (thank God I guess), although I did have a weird feminist PE teacher who forced boys to dance
We fought eachother for 4 bloody years and tore our country apart, and we wont be able to fix it in a long time
Same with Sarajevo
Like a country within a country,all money goes to it
I mean its not Munich but compared with the rest of Bosnia its strong af
Everything
Bosnia is very underdeveloped
Without by standard, older people do the line but it's considered bad practice
No one has a second name that I know of
Second or middle names are practically nonexistent here, but some names like ''Ana Marija'' are usually (and legally at least in the case of the Federation) considered as one name with multiple words
nije kod nas ko kod zapadnjaka jbg
yea so do we, they’re only used in official documentation, like birth certificate, bills or your deathcard
When talking about people from high school/college Americans often refer to them with they full name
So, two people who didn't go to the same HS/college often use sentences like:
>*Brad Clint was into fishing back in college*
Even though the other person has no clue who the particular Brad is
Well I wouldn't cut the whole steak at once, but I would switch to my right hand after cutting each bite, it's not that uncommon here as in many cultures, most people are right-handed and some cultures value the right hand more when it comes to doing stuff
Debit cards can also have a negative allowance, in fact most do have it
The process of reporting a fraud is the same for both options here, in both cases you will get your money back if you responded within 24 hours
Well it's the opposite here: Including the last name would make me think and try to remember if I know a Brad with that surname, whereas the other person would let me know that we hadn't met if they started speaking about A Brad from HS
They have a multiple personality disorder (with 3 personalities
She would eat meat
She'd also argue (with herr neighbours) a lot
For the companion animal, uhh
a bear would be fitting
It sounds like a pretty okay system, except for the part that they don't sell Single-Trip tickets on the bus itself
A lot of them are simply attention seeking fit people like YouTubers with no real knowledge
What sort of lies are you talking of
We have a similar problem in Bosnia where international media blasts the migrant camps as inhumane or unjust, when in reality its the exact opposite (for people who walk in Nike shoes and leather jackets whose demographics are strictly adult men)
I don’t think the majority of Europe would understand this joke, but this is hilarious
I don’t like when someone insults the other Ex-Yugoslav countries
I don't like when people say something about Serbia in a negative way
Let the poor guys stay in peace with only 20% of their past land
My name is Dario, but many of my relatives used to call me "Dado", which is like a more comfortable cute nickname to get, not really any meaning behind it
Now, one of my aunts used to call me "Ec" pronounced like the word "nets" without the N. She explained why she used to call me that a while ago, but I can't remember why
To daughters they say "my son".
To sons they say "Konju" . Konj means Horse
Basically every parent ever
For the children its mostly the same as everywhere
"Mali/Mala" means "Little boy/Little girl/
"Duša" means "Soul" and so on
We don't have articles, which is a good thing
On the other hand the language is complicated af for foreign learners, especially non -slavic speakers
Probably the flags under yugoslavia
The Bosnian one didn't have any national simbols, and Croats hate anything to do with Yugoslavia
We have that too in Bosnia
No it isn't that small
Around 20
000 km²
Vjeverica
I am not Shure but i thing it comes from the verb "verati" which means to climb
Verati is not used in Croatian standard language, but only in regional dialects
I think that its not hard to pronounce
Quite a few
First one that comes to mind: Not recognizing Kosovo
I live in Bosnia
But Kosovo isn't a separatist movement, it's a state in basically every sense and it feels weird not to recognise them
Yeah
The triple presidents
1/3rd
Maybe some do it but I haven't heard of anyone doing it
Only thing similar to that that students do is instrukcije ( literally translates to instructions) for mathematics if they are bad at math
You have special teacher that explains lessons you don't understand to you and maybe few more students, although I wouldn't know I never went
There are also courses in foreign languages if you are bad at them or if you want to learn more
Took me a lot of scrolling to find a country that keeps their eggs in a fridge or a refrigerated shelf
I can't imagine eggs being kept at room temperature or at a shelf in the summer, despite all the AC
Please don't, not all of Europe has a functional international rail service
A lot of people from the Balkans started flying and experiencing other cultures thanks to LCCs and it would be vile to take it from them just because someone on the other end is able to pick between too many types of connections
We call croatia "hrvatska", it calls itself that, the other countries like serbs and montenegras call it that
In Bosnia we say "cetnici" for Serbs, "ustase" for croats and "balije" for Bosniaks
All are really offensive and come from either WW2 or the civil war from the nineties
I think its the same for Serbia
Cetnici (original name was "Jugoslovenska vojska u otadzbini" which translates to "Jugoslav army in the fatherland") were a partisan group during WW2 that occasionally sided with the nazis, ustase where nazi puppets and balija was a word used by the Turks to call the people that were shepards and beekeepers from mountainous regions
It was later adopted by the Croats and Serbs as a insulting name for Bosniaks
This doesnt drive me crazy but some people get mildly annoyed
When someone says for example “reko”. The correct form is “rekao”. And this goes with a lot of the verbs
People say these verbs incorrectly all the time and its kinda the norm now
Its the same here, its just grammatically incorrect
I only know two people who actually say “rekao” and other verbs correctly
That seems like quite a lot for an intern
Of course I fully support it just didn't expect what's a solid starter wage in many western European countries
Got my steam account stolen and the 20 euros on it
Very common, even among good friends, some don't like the bro-hug and you have to respect it
Thats a very general question
For me, its my own hometown but then again if you mean historically - its a couple of cities, there cannot be only one most important city
History was written all over Balkans, i.e. Belgrade is not more or less important than Sarajevo, Zagreb, Athens, Istanbul, etc
Perhaps if you were more specific
Edit: to make it more clear, do you measure it by famous people born there, famous people who died there, what happened in the city, or w/e?
And the Winter Olympics in 1984 from more recent history
It's not common to greet the clerk in many countries unless the shop is like 20sqm
Kebab shops don't sell fries here
Mashed potatoes would be missed
I think the whole Balkan section would start WWIII
Ok that is hilarious
Why would you care if it's a good song
Do we put the Balkans in the same category as Turkey
I feel happy reading that, people often embrace the shared history and really try to immerse themselves in the culture but they get overshadowed in the media by the lesser educated people going for quick construction cash
In Sarajevo, the attitude towards the people from the Sandzak region (part of Serbia with a significant Bosniak population) is that they are less cultured, more conservative, that they all dream of moving to the Bosnian capital and they all help each other when they get there
For example, there's an old joke that the road from Novi Pazar to Sarajevo is the longest one-way road in the world
From what I've heard, people in Zagreb have a similar attitude towards Herzegovinians
While Bosnians do occasionally jokes
about Herzegovinians, they're in no way looked down upon
>coupled with specifically northern Croatian stereotypes (cold, introverted, stingy, arrogant etc)
Wow seriously, there's that stereotype for the northern Croatia
A good chunk of my family is from the north (Zagorje and Podravina)
When I visited them I was amazed by how literally everyone seems to have a vineyard and drink all the damn time starting from breakfast, hard to be introverted in that environment
I think it was my grandmother who mentioned to me that back in the days even as little kids they would get a glass of wine before school in winter so they feel a bit warmer
That's kinda a lot to drive
Oh boy, you're in for a treat
We have **domestic** medieval monarchs with two variations of the same name
This is to a large extent the consequence of nationalism in the region
Ethnic identity of medieval residents of Bosnia and the demographics of the place are a highly contentious topic
How does this translate into regnal names ? Bosnia had a lot of Steves on the throne
Stephen is a Greek name with different variations in different languages
Our royal Steves are either Stjepan or Stefan depending on who you ask
These Steves are long dead but you can read their names on medieval charters or coinage to make sense of what they would have called themselves in their own language (the name of the language would be another contentious topic)
I was hoping for a similar answer :)
Well thanks it's nice to hear that from tourists
It is still bouncing back I live here and the city is constantly getting bigger and more beautiful
[Indexi - Bacila Je Sve Niz Rijeku] is probably one of the best songs ever written here
The lead singer awaited a child with his girlfriend but without  telling him she had an abortion and moved out of the country
He never saw her again
This song is about her and most of the songs have a trace of her inside
The most popular bands are Bijelo Dugme,Divlje Jagode and so on but Indexi are the best(at least in my opinion)
I really dont know what genre they are
Sounds like an amalgamation of every genre possible
But i did completely forget about them thats why i said Bijelo Dugme was the most popular since they were in Ex Yu Rock terms
Completely forgot that Dubioza has a strong international audience
I think theres one worse than him
Hmm
maybe the one about the murder of Dženan Memić
In Gymnasium is a little bit of everything, depending on a year
Starting from antic Greece literature like Illiada and then it follows historical progress, but not strictly
In between there are books from Bosnian authors
Almost every big literature piece is mentioned and read
We read Tolstoy, Dostojevsky, Shakespeare, Goethe, Molier, Hugo, Kafka, Dante, Sofoklo, Krleža, Zola, Jesenjin, Servantes
When we want to say  no way not happening we sometimes use malo Morgen
Inside Austria maybe, but I'd guess a couple Falco songs might me alot more famous
On that point I wonder why none of the Italians have mentioned 'The four seasons" by Vivaldi, I'd guess a great percentage of people at least would have heard parts of that
Probably nothing,i mean they can't even bulit proper roads and hospitals,don't think they would care
No, it would be very weird
Really
It would be strange here if it wasn't family, quick pull and two taps on the back is the common way between male friends
That's normal here too
I'm from Sarajevo, during my studies I've met plenty of people from all over the country, none of them kissed each other on the cheek
We don't have it here
We had McDonald's for some time, but they closed it
It had worse food then the places we already had and it was more expensive
We dont have it here
I would like to try it, but I doubt I would ever eat more than once there
We used to have a massive stray dog problem 5-7 years ago when they passed a law that banned removing them from streets and putting them to sleep so the country was stuck in a vacuum of having to build many shelters in a short time whilst having stray dog attacks on a daily basis
Nowadays it works well and you rarely see them in public, there are stray cats too but they don't cause problems and are friendly most of the time
Germany
Reason videogames
Switzerland
better economy,safe place,nice quiet life
We don't really have that problem here,yes; a lot of institutions are in Sarajevo but, because we're a fucked up country , pretty much every other big city has some form of government HQ
Oh damn so many bad memories from that shit, it's still in programmes here
>We don’t need to justify our right to bear guns, **it’s god given**,
And Gods name is Con Stit Ution, apparently
Sounds really interesting
Brilliant idea
One thing I find bothersome with Swedish is that the most common things are sometimes called the same
For example, leg and bone are both called "ben", six and sex are also both called "sex".
I agree, most of the time it's easy to infer from the context, other languages have this as well
I still feel that "ben" is used for two things that are easily confused
Working in biology, we often have to make it clear which one we we are talking about with the help of English words
I went shopping once
While still browsing I was asked how many pieces of an item I wanted to buy, at which I shouted "jag vill ha sex
" across the store
People turned around
Since then, I always make sure to say "jag vill ha sex stycken", or buy five or seven items :)
Yes, of course you can specify it more or use scientific names
It would just be handy to be able to use one word to refer to several types of bones without having to list all the specific names not to confuse it with legs
Also, "ben", both singular and plural
Well um
2nd Balkans scenario
I wouldn't mind Montenegro though
INb4 Montenegro merges with Albania and everyone is shocked
Thought the same about serbian
Not my country, but region
When you enter Bosnia, all logic disappears
I have the feeling that our number system is pretty consistent
1 jedan 2 dva 3 tri 4 četiri 5 pet 6 šest 7 sedam 8 osam 9 devet 10 deset
From 11 to 19 you use a basic number plus the ending -naest
Example 15 is *petnaest*
20 is dvadeset (two ten) 30 trideset (three ten) 40, 50, 60
you get the point
78 is sedamdeset i osam ( seven ten and eight)
99 devedeset i devet ( nine ten and nine)
We have some minor rules for writting
For example the number 90 is written devedeset not deve**t**deset
It is easier to pronounce, that's why
40 is četrdeset ( basic 4 is četiri
Easier to pronounce again)
100 is sto, 1000 is hiljadu (tisuću)
Just one thing for the German system: Learning numbers in German was always fun
It happens rarely now that I mix up the numbers like it was before but I still have that feeling that it is wrong and unnatural for me

It sounds very melodic to my ears
Don’t let the Balkans answer this one
It’s honestly very annoying, and makes all of us look bad
Agreed, especially when some people think they “saved” some people
No, they’re all trash
Early 1900s. Period of Austrian rule
Would love to see the transition from an Ottoman wasteland to a pretty formidable European country
That makes two of us
Bosnia Mitteleuropa
Really
I’ve never been to a Croatian friends home and saw another guest wearing shoes
I thought it was expected that you remove your shoes everywhere in the Balkans
They wouldn’t get dusty if they didn’t bring in dirt with their shoes lol
Serbia and Montenegro
Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro in general
The most popular ones in Bosnian would be:
boli me kurac (my dick hurts) very informal and rude but still used a lot
One possible alternative is "boli me uho" (my ear hurts)
Jebe mi se za to (I want to fuck because of that or I am not really interested in that so I would likely fuck something instead) Now I am really struggling to translate this
It looses the entire meaning when translated
Nije me briga (I don't care)
We don't have Russians visiting, but the CHINESE
I mean they're pretty chill they just take a few pictures here and there

yeah I mean when you want to eradicate all slavs the only country left standing should be the only one thats named after the slavs
Greater Serbia coming soon
After this, the Serbian regime will have 3 countries under control by puppet politicians in them
He is still president until 2022 or 2023 afaik and current parliament seats are 41-40 in favour of opposition
He will try to buy someone definitely let's see if opposition sticks to its preelection stands of not going to coalition with dps
People here apparently don't understand some things
Neither he was dictatorship nor he's out
He is still a president of Montenegro and there is still a chance that his party gets the most power in the government
It depends upon the vote of one party
The pro-Serbian opposition won
How
Because it supports Serbian Orthodox Church and Milo advocates for the equality of all religions in Montenegro since different ethnic groups live in Montenegro
That's basically the only reason why opposition won
The OP is Serbian btw
An anti-milo, opposition party
Get a grip man, he lost
Why are you so salty
It took only one day for the first attacks on non-Serbs
In the town of Pljevlja, Bosniaks came under physical assault, ending up in the ER
and how the people who brought it there would be capable of even using that thing or ever have the intention too
its so obviously symbolic, but still disturbing
I'm really happy for Biden as he was much better choice for my country than Trump, probably the best possible president of the USA when it comes to Bosnia in general
I didn't say he will remove the Dayton as it guarantees the peace and disfunctionality of the country to its core, but he will definetly support B&H more than previous presidents of the USA and as president of the USA it's not that he can't do anything, especially if democrats win the majority in Congress
There is a document where it stands what what he will do with Bosnia in case he wins
Yea
But people in Bosnia chose nationalism over prospect, so I think we kind of deserved to be fucked up
All these years people thought it was the Queen, turns out it was the Bean
Is anyone going to mention Bosnia as the most south and most forest cover
I'm Bosnian, I live next to a small wooded area
Like my house is next to a little forest in the city
So cool and cozy
Can confirm city surrounded by forests and live next on one
Something to be proud of
Wooo

It's definitely not more mangled than our political system so yeah
Are covid19 cases surging
I don't get it really, how could you have so large gatherings without any consequences
And the reason is we might use it to our own benefit eventually, so better just sit back
As a muslim, I adamantly disliked those comics, and as a muslim, I despise that the monsters who committed that attack dare call themselves righteous followers of the Kur’an
They’re nothing but murderers and bullies, and I hate them more than I will ever hate any bigot
No one deserves to die for their beliefs, as long as they don’t transition into something violent or oppressive
this was nothing more but a provocation against the muslim populace in order to prove how sensitive we are
i'm not saying they deserved it, but they got the reaction they demanded
both sides are at fault here
That's 470m euros, what the fuck

Hello, fellow Sarajlija
Ćejf is a word almost impossible up translate properly, to English at least
My home town, in spring that spot is even more beautiful
Hi from Sarajevo
Lot's of love
Lijepa kasaba
I disagree about the food though
There aren’t many local dishes I’d actually recommend to someone
Though if you were to look right from here, you’d see a somewhat normal city skyline with higher buildings
This is the far north edge of the city (the oldest part)
It feels that way because it is
For a good chunk the city is less than 1km wide, but it's more than 10km long
It's terrible
In the Balkans, we still ride on the Roman roads
We are the chads
Thought I'm on r/okbrudimongo
I just wish for one day where something isn't falling from the sky
When a cell realises it's turned into cancer it tries to kill itself
Meanwhile a Croat was fined 25€ for wearing a Croatian jersey the morning after the finals, in the Republic of Srpska entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina
He was traveling south to the sea and stopped for coffee and somebody called the cops on him
Reason for the fine was the jersey and it being provocative and looking for trouble
They look they had just had some fiery lunch and every single one of them is holding their diarrhoea in
today 22° and tomorrow gonna be max 10°Celsius
There was an if only moment
If only Kane didnt miss that 1 on 1
Other than that England played well
Count Josip Jelačić
O partigiano portami via
Ché mi sento di morir
death to fascism, freedom to the people
This
And so much this
I'm sad a lot of the former Eastern Bloc countries can't relate with Yugoslavia but the buildings made in the 50s and 60s are probably the best when it comes to quality, not being able to hear your neighbours ever as well as location, most of them are close to the city making them desirable and highly appraised even if they have rundown facades which correlates to safe neighbourhoods full of quality content
And they planted a lot of trees here too
US has 8 times more people killed by police per capita than Finland ,first European country (except Luxembourg, that has 1 person killed but due to small population seems larger, still smaller than the US though)
Police brutality is much smaller problem in EU than in the US
It seems the most of the demands by protestors (at least to me) are around ways to end police brutality, especially against black people
What would be demands in a European country
Not hugely popular but exists here too
Looks similar too
Accurate
Imagine being from a country so right wing where authoritarian conservatives aren’t far right
Lmao
You don’t have to be a nazi/fasisct to be far right
Ayy BiH is in something that's not negative

Dobri ljudi sa Balkana mogu raditi dobre stvari
Ovi stariji kojima je rat i konflikt sve u zivotu su razlog zasto se "mrzimo".
I saw an advertisement in ***Srebrenica*** that said "Srebrenica for Vucic". I mean vote for who you want, but it's another level of being disrespectful
It's weird to see our neighbours more in the news about corruption and protests then ourselves
For once Bosnia seems like the sane part of ex-Yugoslavia
I think BALKAN is becoming America and I dont like that
DRZI TE SE BRACO SRBI <3
Bosnia doing its part too
Nice
Happy indepence day from Sarajevo
Same, it doesn’t look real at all
Make a longer bus stop so everyone's FINe
This rent-free complex is pathetic
Mate in Bosnia it's a massage just to go to the store
I visited Moldova,Bosnia-Herzegovina,Republika Sprska(Serb Republic of Bosnia), Georgia,Azerbaijan, Russia,Ukraine and Kosovo
I saw so much hate for gay people in these countries
They are extremely homophobic
Based eastern Europe, we have better things to do than complain about same sex marriages
The Prime Minister of Serbia is a weak puppet
The homophobic president(a dictator ike Orban and Erdogan) rule the country
This will not happen
Vucic and his supporters are extremely homophobic
Bruh, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the Europe, if not the most
"fart on your dick" jesus bro you killed him lmfao ;DD
For all the EU4 people, he was just sending a scornful insult to get an alliance with rivals
No other reason
It sounds weak compared to the comments they make towards each other lol
What is a mink
and they are going to kill them
Wow
rude
Off topic, but is a mustache mandatory to hold political office in Turkey
what kind of stupid irrelevant comment is that
wtf Lithuania from nuclear to fossil fuels to renewables in 10 years
I guessed something like that happened, it just looks unusal on the graph
The Croatians are planing to throw that shit into our country :(
Yes and since its only one plant, holding all of its waste can be done in the power plant itself, so its not a problem
Turkey loooooves *Turkey* lol
Croatia is not that obese they just have Jacques upping the average
Where were you where there were tanks in the fields
Austria and Hungary
r/hmmm
Sretan Dan nezaviznosti ️
Yugoslavia is back
Balkan is not insulted
Atleast yugoslavia looks okay
>Yugoslavia
Joke's on you, I'm into that shit
How does the bus driver not notice
The Balkan People shall not be slaves to corruption anymore
Yeah, this is definitely not propaganda and completely unbiased
Fact: it is VERY easy to get lost in Venice so, please stay with your guide
Next is Bosnia
Absolutely horrible
Genital mutilation should be stopped and only go through if the kid in question grows up and wants to (which I don't know why they would)
Bosnia casually strolling by
It is a pleasure to be with Austria and Germany in something, at least
Well we blame Google, not the government
Serbia isnt EU
In Bosnia we have three main - tax funded* TV stations: BHRT (for the whole country, but is under political influence from the Federation), FTV (for the entity of the Federation) and RTRS (for the entity of Republika Srpska)
When something happens that's anti Serbian or anti goverment of the entity Srpska, it gets coverage on FTV and BHRT (which usually include both sides) and it gets buried in the RTRS chanel or gets the "they hate us, it's always our fault" treatment
If somethings negative about Bosniaks or Croats, it is going to get blown out of proportion on RTRS with whole day coverage, "expert" panel, comments from the ruling and opposition party members; it gets some coverage on FTV and a some on BHRT
*Tax funded- currently the TV and radio tax is collected via the electricity monthly bill, but people can just write a bank order excluding the tax and pay their bills
So sad
The Yugoslav passport was once the most coveted, letting you in virtually everywhere
It should be around 110 but this list is probably excluding visa on arrival
Of course, their liberation was only, ya know, followed by the subsequent raping of MANY prisoners and continued genocide and persecution of all kinds of peoples
It’s easy to say they were “liberated” by the “good guys,” but it’s hard to admit that life isn’t as black and white
Sources in a child comment
that's shitty to clean
In Bosnia we never leave
Very common here, people in early 20s earning enough to rent and live normally but not allowed to till they get married
What's Estonia like, how cold it gets ?
How's the infrastructure ?
Mirisem sarkazam
Pridobili su me sa dobrim cestama
Man, it will take years for us to join
Fucking Russia loving and anti UN Serbs in here, and fucking corruption
Let us in, let us in
Well to be honest (in my opinion) it would not take a long time to make us economically stable
We are starting to get rid a bit by bit of corruption in federation entity and I am hopeful that we are going to get there in 5ish years
On the other hand, keeping us economically f**ked is because people here are too stubborn and want to keep other entity (republic one) artificially alive
Federation pays almost 65% of total taxes, while RS pays other 35%. When money is divided RS gets 49%.
Leaving out fact that we had war in 90s here, and people in RS considering their home country Serbia,  imagine this situation back in days with Germany
Well, if we are being honest, Europe wanted to close outward border with Russia, so Greece and all other countries form a whole
I think that is the reason why EU gave you and Romania "some slack" with requirements to join
Man you said it better than anyone I have heard that tried to explain it
Well, we had election in November
Most of the parties that where ruling for past 20 years in capital city of Sarajevo where overthrown
That along with Drasko being elected as mayor of Banja Luka made a huge impact and shake-up on political scene
As far as Drasko goes he made huge news for couple of days as being "refreshment" on the political scene
Young, ambitious, wants to move forward, he was seen as someone who can make 2 entities work together and get this country somewhere
Then
then he went old nationalist route as did his successor
Not only that, but refuses to move forward with the "Serbian ideology" in Bosnia
Still considers himself only Serb, not in any part Bosnian
Is against joining NATO, openly anti-gay, made a lot of the statements that crumbled all of the hype that was built around him and shakeups in Sarajevo, to make this transition into EU country at faster pace
So basically, it was yet again, another political game
> Also, what does anti UN mean
Is it because they wanna be in Serbia or
I messed up here, I wanted to say "anti Nato", well according to your flair you should know why, but for other people reading this here is brief summary:
In war in 90's Serba was bombed for 50ish days by Nato, in order stop advancement of war, as peace treaty was going around that time
Serbs refused, so Nato bombed them
In my opinion this is pure hypocrisy, as my home town was bombed by Serbians for 1400- some days
Yet, still we live in same country as they do
I just looked it up (I was not aware of this) and fuck me if I don't learn every day what we are missing ...
Nope, I totally understand what is happening with EU and criteria for entry being upped
It's a shame really people here refuse to split with RS entity for sake of "keeping medieval borders and our heritage". I am sure EU would be a piece of cake if that ever happens to us
In federation have such an good decentralised and diverse political climate
Man, I am hopefully its getting to the Austrian level of diversity in next 4 years
Coalition of 4 parties on left won local elections, 3 that ruled are in minority on right
Young and educated people came to political scene
Transparency laws are hitting left and right
We are getting there, I am sure in coming years
But RS,  can't do shit when they never went away from their totalitarian and nationalistic ideologies
Hmm, I see you are down-voted everywhere, but I just think you are missing some info about us
We are in numbers quite small country, there is only like 2
5m of us at current time (which let's face it is just a normal town anywhere in Europe, and not even big town that is)
But, we are fucking rich in resources
We don't have economy to harvest those resources, but being in EU would allow foreign investors to come in and basically built shit they want and earn their money back
We have a lot of great great mountains for winter sports, and also a lot of nature reserves too (springs, parks, forests)
EU is already looking at renewable sources for electricity, and being as small as we are, we are exporting much more of electricity than we need at current pace
Building more of them would pose no issue for someone who is looking to invest and earn their money worth pretty fast
Land is awesome for agriculture as well
It is already semi-automated, and you can literally grow anything except exotic fruits here (if you go from the north where we usually get melons from, to south where you get oranges and olives from)
We have so many springs with fresh clean water, literally if you dig less than 4m under any place you will find it
Testimony to that is that Coca cola has regional factory for its products here
Ores and wood are also everywhere
&nbsp;
I mean it is all here
And I don't think that we are going to contribute anywhere near if we join at current moment
But with right investments and game plan, literally both BiH and EU can benefit mutually
> So, Dodik the second
Something like that ...
> what about the sarajevo guy/gal
what are they about
Hmm, quite some stuff here as well
Ruling party (SDA) has been overthrown after 20 fucking years with coalition of 4 other parties (NiP, SDP, NS, IS)
Hip fucking hooray
The only downside to this is that some people digress that party called NIP is made of people who left the one overthrown (SDA) and that is a bad thing
Imo, I don't trust them as well, but I don't give a shit, as they alone don't have majority of seats, and can't do anything on their own
But, when they had (this group of parties) majority in parliament briefly (before some SDA butt licking parties betrayed agreement) they did shit TON of good stuff
Most notably, they made everything transparent as it can get in that short amount of time
Would do a lot of good stuff I am sure of it, but their majority fell apart quickly and were unable to implement it
I have high hopes these younger and more educated bunch is going to do a lot of good stuff
Also, since now all of the power is not in hands of single party, we don't have that totalitarianism, so I am certain this if awesome thing that happened
But, time will tell
I like how always Bosnia is missing in these kind of Statistics
I mean there is nothing to measure anyway
They didn't actually, many roads were built and some of the richer Romans enjoyed the sunny Herzegovina
Many modern cities were founded on Roman ruins (Bugojno, Blagaj, Stolac, even Banja Luka), our country wasn't very lucky throughout history, each time a new country/empire took over B&H, they ended up demolishing what was left of the former one

I love Europe too, that's why I hope the EU can be dismantled
Grow up and stop role-playing as political entities, its creepy
No one should respect this if he's one of the terrorist groups who killed thousands of Turkic people but if he's a regular Greek citizen or soldier who did nothing wrong then it's fine
OP never said that who this dead guy is
You can stand for war being bad, not good
People die because of war
(on all sides) But no one can defend a terrorist who killed "humans". Just because he's Greek and the other side is Turkish
Be human
Turks and Greeks tried to live together but that didn't go so well
Because Greek fanatics got crazy and started killing Turkish people in Cyprus
Turkey did what it has to do and it's not called independence war in Turkey
It's called Cyprus Peace Operation
My grandparents (Balkan Turks) escaped from WW2 and started living in Cyprus back in 40's. My uncle (4) was killed by Greeks in 1971
Then they returned to our homeland, Bosnia
As a Turk who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina
I'm sad for innocent people(Greek and Turk) who has died in Turkish Invasion/Peace Operation of Cyprus
Just don't be racist
That's all i want
r/europe members should be non-racist enough to upvote if this was a Turkish old man crying over his dead son, right guys
r/europe hivemind
Covid loves this
Dude, you can't use word fascism that easily for everything
Today marks 22 years since the Srebrenica genocide, the worst crime on European soil since the Holocaust
Lest we forget
I was born in Canada
When I first visited Bosnia with my family, I was a young boy, maybe 10 or 11
I saw posters for the remembrance of the Srebrenica genocide and never knew what anyone was talking about, only that my dad would tell me to keep quiet every time I asked
I had no idea until years later in my life what a tragedy had taken place, one that almost robbed me of the family I have today
Cherish everyone you love deeply, and do not participate in such ignorant hatred as characteristic of this war
May all the innocent lives lost rest in peace
There are people here, on this subreddit, that downplay, justify, or outright celebrate these things
Just saying
It's one reason that I dread seeing anything about Bosnia here
So, today, let us nominally pay our respects for the dead
The *provocateurs* will continue posting their bullshit unabashedly
And the next time the Bosnian NT goes to Greece or Romania -- "civilized Europe" -- they will be met by flags and banners celebrating Srebrenica
they like to show solidarity with their Orthodox brothers
And all of the arms and volunteers, from your civilized countries, that curiously found themselves participating in siege and slaughter, against largely unarmed civilians -- I hope (I know) they sleep soundly at night
Unfortunately, for some of us, this day signifies the loss of completely innocent people, family members, that no longer exist because
some reason
Shit, even this thread currently is mostly filled with people proclaiming that it wasn't *that big of a deal*. Some French dude is talking about Soviet gulags and the Croats are talking about Bleiburg (as they are wont to do)
And I suspect things will only go further down hill
All of this
it's insulting
We don't need your fake solidarity, anyway
Take your EU and stick it up its own ass
> First using the term 'Serbia' and not the 'Serb government and/or military of the 90s' is actually branding the whole nation as killers and terrorists
Yeah mate, but I doubt anyone means the entire nation of Serbia when saying that here
They probably mean the government/the men who did the atrocities, and I doubt people will specify 'the government of Serbia' or whatever, since it's much easier just to say 'Serbia' (while actually thinking the right thing)
> Drawing comparison to ISIS is especially distrurbing and sick, especially if you consider that 99% of the people didn't know what was happening on the front lines, as each republic was spewing hate and concealing all information which would tell its citizens what's actually happening
It was always the other sides fault
What happened in Srebrenica is definitely comparable to ISIS, maybe even worse, but I am not very familiarized with what ISIS is doing right now to comment on that
The second part I can't provide an opinion, since I wasn't alive back then, but I'd imagine you're probably right that everyone is feeding propaganda to their own country
> All 3 government sides in the war benefited hugely from prolonging the war, and was disregarding any human casualties or impacts as long as it helped their interest
Which 3 sides
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia
First of all, I think you can't put Bosnia in there because I doubt there wasuxh profit from us, considering that Serbia was much better equipped than us
I also don't think that Croatia or Slovenia would profit from prolonging the war (perhaps attempting to gain more land
), but I don't know much about that, there are probably some Croats or Slovenians here to comment on that
Serbia also didn't profit from having 3 wars simultaneously, but it was in their interest to keep Yugoslavia together and stop the republics from gaining independence
I'm surprised you never heard of it
It's almost the only thing the average European knows about Bosnia and Herzegovina
Couldnt have said it better mysef, bravo
Sorry
I generally avoid threads about Bosnia because they're filled with propaganda bullshit
I guess I had to make an exception today
I consider myself pro-EU, and even the eventual admittance of Bosnia, but I don't like that people pretend that the Croats and Serbs were killing people in a vacuum
There was a support structure, and volunteers from various countries that also "helped out". Many of these countries are in the (so-called progressive) EU now, and it makes me salty thinking about it
Sorry, again

They banned propaganda

Isnt this a bit like calling Adolf Hitler "the conqueror of the jews"
I mean he did also do genocides
Definitely rakija
Or, like, a HV soldier giving water to a Serb or Bosniak
Yes, what happened at the very end of the war erases everything that happened in the previous 5 years
I know, you're not allowed to talk about Croatian war crimes among westerners
Or Bosnian war crimes
Especially on reddit
Everyone gets uncomfortable when their idea of evil Serb hordes genociding everyone gets challenged
Ahh I see Bosnia has none
If any Scot or Englishman can help with this qustion
Is Scotish independence likely and is there an actual plan (unlike Brexit) for the seperation from separatist parties
It seems like massive pain to divide England and Scotland due to all the shared institutions and markets they have had for decades
And at this point the only benefit Scotland would have is re-joining the EU but that would take years and it seems dumb to divide Scotland from the strong English economy and the benefits of the pound
Good job guys, Bosnians applaud you
I love this
Happy national day to the Balkan dream country
Great job Romania, we should all follow suit !
Wow, I wish people in B&H had this much interest in their future

It was never round, more like a thick crescent before the Ottomans
I have been wondering about something lately
When the Molotov-Ribentrop thing went down, and the Soviets were invading Poland, Finland etc
Why did the Allies not declare war on the Komies too
No, but I was just wondering what the decision process was in London and Paris in regards to the moves the Soviets were making
Then your google search is wrong
I have a feeling a lot of people on this sub just hate turks so they upvote this shit without even thinking critically
Hey, I've seen this one
I don't really understand this conflict and how everyone is against Azerbaijan and Turkey all out
I am  FAR from a Turkey fan but at this point they are just "claims" no proof yet
So Azerbaijan is in conflict with one of it's regions, alright nothing out of ordinary, no one recognised the region in the world as autonomous
Then Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of shelling mainland territory so that's a wash
I don't really see an obvious "bad guy" here
based
Gotta give it to Croats for their successful Central Europe campaign even though most of Dalmatia is Balkan af
Dalmatia should be south-eastern europe
I know that cuts Croatia in two but it makes a bit more sense
Only thing Slavonia and central Croatia have going for them to be Central Europe is being flat and having Hungarian architecture, so does north B&H (Posavina and Semberija) yet we don't panically try to push those parts into Central Europe just because we're ashamed of geographically being SE Europe and on the Balkan peninsula
South Korea radically lowered infections by mass testing and quarantining the sick,so they didn't have to completely shut down the economy

The french will never give into that bullshit
I don't think Serbia is triggered by this
They love their "War Heroes"..
This is an old representation of the Balkans, Bosnia should have a Turkish or Arabian flag since its being invaded by them
Well, that would be hilarious

Woah man, way to keep Homer at such a low standard
There is currently a lot of illegal immigrants from middle east  in Bosnia and  I hope Europe reacts fast because after all of these events that are happening I have a bad feeling that this will just be the beginning of attacks
Ffs why are the jews always attacked
What the fuck did jewish community did this time
Exist
At least with French and Armenians they can at least pretend they have cause (however fucked up it is), Jews are just punching bags for whenever things go wrong
No wonder Israel is being an asshole to everyone, this shit is happening to them for centuries
Communist (well socialist in our case) housing (especially from the 50s and 60s) is considered top level building in Bosnia and Herzegovina, buildings with thick brick/concrete walls where you don't hear your neighbors at any time, no matter how loud they are
It's always funny to see how some other Eastern countries bash those buildings and how different an experience can be
Cant belive this is not spread out more
First time Im seeing it

Let me just add that the Balkans too, use “kurva” but it means “wh*re” not “f*ck”
"Jebat ću ti prvi red na sahrani" (I'll fuck the entire first row at your funeral)
"Bog te jebo" is my favourite
These are not actual translations, these are what we call "beforewaters". It's intentionaly bad literal translation
Like for instance, mountain Kopaonik got it's name from mines and the name means "mining place", but a beforewater version is "Nick was digging", and you get that by separating the word into Kopao and Nik
Nik=Nick, kopao=was digging
Even the word beforewater is a bad translation of the word "prevodi" (which means translations in Serbian), where the original word is separated into pre=before and vodi=water

God I'm glad my country is not part of EU right now
Here's the thing with this bill
It helps creators and companies but hurts regular people
Internet shouldn't be regulated because you can't regulate it, you can only make people look for VPNs and shit
The Parliament shouldn't prioritize creators over the people, this law will be abused by the companies like Disney that have the power (and the will) to sue anyone and everything
Imagine not being able to make Star Wars memes anymore, R.I.P. r/prequelmemes
Jesus is it ever final ? Even with the net neutrality, we've lost over 50 net neutrality votes by now, is net neutrality even gone in US ?
All the member states voted for this bill
ALL OF THEM
This isn't some corrupt power, this is democracy, a shitty democracy but still a democracy
How is EU "ruling" the countries when the member states control the EU ? How is this bill a proof that EU controls member states if member states all agreed on this ?
You don't even know if Europeans agree with you, you just see these posts on Reddit

Just like americans have American dream, Germany is bosnian dream
We are just gonna have to wait for people who lived before the war to die
They keep voting the same gang into power every 4 years
One of our presidents, yes you heard it right presidentS claims that Bosnia and Herzegovina isnt a legitimate country
And these mfs voted for him
Im not worrying at all
Im a truck driver and its real easy to find work in the eu

Wait WHAT the highest temperature in Bosnia was recorded in 1901
WTF
Well Bosnia and Herzegovina is a fairly hot country, cities in Herzegovina have had the Mediterranean climate for decades, cities like Mostar and Čapljina reach 40 degrees every summer for at least a few days, they average 50 tropical nights per year (temperature not going under 20° at night) so it's not a big surprise
I am just happy we aren't last
Eastern Europeans are magicians when it comes to driving new cars and travelling
A lot of people freelance or work illegally without contracts
For instance I know that a lot of people in IT industry where I work report salaries of 300-400€ gerting the low taxes and some 1000-1500 as we would say "in an envelope". The police here in B&H arrested some guys recently and the trials are yet to begin
Same thing applies for waiters, some private doctors, sports workers, freelancers
Edit: Obviously they earn less money but the point is that unemployment and earnings aren't as bad as they seem, some low class people double shift, collect mushrooms, clean houses or repair bikes to make the cut
Bills and rent are usually around 200-300€ for those people, often in bad neighborhoods
Owning an apartment makes it so much easier for them, one would never guess their income
Accomodation is not that much expensive when going to big cities
Obviously if I wanted an apartment by some swiss lake it would be much more expensive
Food is pretty much similarly priced, a lot of countries have discount stores like Lidl or Aldi, and as for eating out, I guess people do it in cheap in midrange places mostly, the poorer ones may just opt for one or two visits to shopping centres or cook at their apartment
Hvala brother
Some cowards decided to join the SS during the nazi occupation and formed divisions of bosniaks that commited several war crimes against the population of Yugoslavia

May I just say how it's funny to me that people call socialist buildings from the 50s, 60s and 70s poor people places
There's a massive difference here, it might mean you're upper middle class or super low class depending on the location and the decade it was built
Yes, there are some pretty low quality new buildings that are pretty far away from both cities and suburban action
I have an american accent and I dont like it
I wish I had more british accent, however when I try to use it I sound like I am trying too hard
Bosnian/Croat here
Believe it or not, I don't really have an accent
I started learning English in 4th grade, and with no prior knowledge whatsoever, I became fluent by the time 5th grade rolled around
I now am 19, and have a sort of a American accent
It does not sound foreign at all
Maybe I slip up here and there but you could not tell unless you are a English proffesor or have a great insights in accents and languages in general
It was greatly influenced by TV (Disney channel) and I could not be happier that I have it
And surprisingly, as far as I noticed, young people in my area are not bad at English at all and we at least have a general understanding of it
Dutch English speakers always sound American to me ngl
Same for me, but I mean you guys sound American by default
Over here we have a Slavic accent if we don't work towards either American or British
Weird request, but do you maybe have a video you could link where someone from the  Netherlands is speaking English in their native accent
I think it has to do with the branding
You get +3 charisma if you have that Apple logo on your phone
Probably "Gornja Maoča". It's not necessarily a city, it's a village; but it is known to be a place swarming with potential wahaabi terrorists
Other than that, I'm pretty cool with pretty much every city
Except Banja Luka, but for political reasons
Banja Luka is a good city if you are from a small city and wanna go shopping
I'm not saying it's a bad city, I'm saying I'm biased because of political differences compared to where I'm from
I just don't like the people that live there
I dont care about that i just wanna go shopping
Go shopping my man, nobody's stopping you
Oh i will, i will
We use that as a "gotcha" joke too
Just instead of trains we use trams (talking about the capital, Sarajevo)
I like this similarity
Janitor
100% janitor
Hmm, what would BIH be
Uuh standing around doing nothing while we wait for money from our German aunt
But do they actually do it regularly
Like when going to work, supermarket, out for a beer, etc
>(Držislav, Višeslav, Vojnomir, Trpimir)
I find these names pretty cool
They sound a lot like old Croatian kings
I asked myself always if these names were preserved for the kings and upper class or did common folk used them as well
Zdeslav is my favorite btw
We have 3 presidents, offensive jokes (which here nobody finds offensive since we know they are jokes), we are at the same time the biggest patriots and the biggest haters of our country
Dear people, I present you the Bosnia and Herzegovina
Funny thing is that the Qatari government is probably the most transparent and smartest in the way they spend their resources on their citizens in that region, what could man expect from the others then
*sigh*
I wouldn't mind winter stuff if there was actual snow outside I can't remember what was the last time I saw proper snow in my
city
Absolutely not
Everyone here in Bosnia wants to be German and jokes about how their income is huge
We are fans of Germans if nothing
Baustela calling
Never say burek with cheese or potatoes
There is only one burek
As a European who visited the US, its all you guys ever talk about
Sorry, never heard of it
“Pita sa mesom” is burek
Burek only contains meat
Glad to hear there is unity and normal functioning,we dont have that in most of the balkans
This is fucking *AMAZING*
lmao the same in Bosnia
Umm it's not common
"Puši ko Turčin" - "smokes like a Turk" smokes a lot
"Špansko selo" - "Spanish village" something not understandable, you know nothing about it
"Glup ko Amerikanac" - "stupid like an American"
"...ali na Njemačkom" - "..., but in German" opposite
That there is a war going on here ...
Huh it's actually unusual how late in June it has gotten warm
Last year this time around we have been swimming in the rivers for 2 weeks already
I like summer and sunshine
The weather here in Bavaria wasnt't the best in the last two weeks
It rained a lot and it was about 20°C.
Right now it is 26°C so it is not bad and the weather will stay nice till sunday
The next week the temperatures will go down again
So i am enjoying these 2-3 days of summer
34°C, no clouds, unbearable humidity
and it's not even July yet
I want to die
Thanks you too
Went swimming today lol
The water got warm pretty quickly
This was a lot more wholesome and uplifting than I thought it would be
Thanks, I'll try not to
Lord, the house lookin' like a rummage sale, yeah
First you feel either Bosniak, Serb or a Croat
After that it depends on the person
Almost all Bosniaks fell Bosnian
With Serbs and Croats it is another story
Someone even tries to deny the Bosnian nation, language, histroy etc
I am a Croat, but I feel Bosnian at the same time
No problem with that
I am 24
Yes and no
The younger generation tends to be more open but another factor that comes into play is the region where you are from
In Tuzla, the city where I come from, I do not know anyone who gets offended for calling them Bosnians
But there are other cities/regions where people will try everything to covnience you that they are not Bosnians
>Thats how it should be
Well, if that were the case everytime, BiH would have a really strong football team
It is hard to explain
I feel as Croatian as you do but Bosnian at the same time too
In the end my parents are from there, grandparents
How can I deny all that and pretend to be something I am not
Yugoslavia was an utopia in theory
It tried to bring similar ethnic gropus together and form a nation out of it
Well we all know how it came to an end
The situation can be compared to Germany in the 19th century
You managed to overcome that regional Bavarian, Saxonian etc
national identity and form a unified German one
We failed at that level
As I said earlier it depends on the region
In my region it is a common thing to see mixed marriages, whereas in other parts of the country, especially in the rural areas, it is a rare thing
The younger generation doesn't care most of the time
In the end, we all speak *the same language* and want to have fun like all young peole in the world

Something my friend who lives in Slovenia told me
"Slovenian sounds like a Bosnian is having a stroke"
Italian has three articles too, il, la and lo which work similar to der, die und das (atleast as far as I remeber
And I think so do other Romanic languages
I think the special thing in German which really barely any language has is how precise it is
There are single words in German where you'd need whole sentences to say that exact thing
For example 'Schadenfreude' (which even got integrated into the English vocabulary) or many more
Didn't know that but tbh I'm not surprised by that as German and Dutch are really close linguisticly anyway
I mean honestly, listening to Dutch I think I can understand little more than I would listening to some Swiss dialects (I live in Southern Austria)
My mistake then, my lessons in Italian lie 5 yrs in the past
I speak German but I I thought you meant articles in general and not the form article take, then I'll need to take my statement back
Summer time of course, sun already rises at like 5am in the summer, 7am in the winter and the winter days end at like 16:30 or 17:00 so having them end at 17:30 or 18:00 would be better
The further away you go from the centre the more gang members approach you
My friend has known someone who was called Niko, but it's Croatian name from what I know
That Tito died in WW2 and was replaced by a Russian spy or that Nikola Tesla was contacted by aliens and by far my favourite: that the Bosnian pyramids were built by an unknown prehistoric civilistation and that they are some kinds of “energetic centres”. Also some people think that aliens helped them and that they hid in pyramids for some reason and a later civilization (also unknown) buried the tunnels under the pyramids for unknown reasons
I think that there’s something to this but I don’t think all of these statements are true
Really
That’s even wilder
Yeah
We dont kidd around with that stuff, unles hahahah maybe hmmmm, what if, and by Allah hear me out on this one
Every country has certain things that are different and that just they understand
I am completely fine with this
It's what makes us unique
But one thing that I really can't understand and accept is the gun culture
Seriously, it's easy to buy a gun as it is to buy milk
A first world country doens't need this imo
That "buy like milk" reference was definitely an overestimation
I will try to explain myself a little bit different than
When I visited Texas I saw those selling gun shops every now and then
To put this into perspective you don't see this in Europe at all
AT ALL
Second, I am totally anti military leaning
I just don't like anything that has to do with war
It's my nature
And than you have media who potrays that issue in their own way
So, when I combine all this and compare it with what I am used to ( Europe beeing almost universaly gunfree)
I get a feeling that the USA has a really large problem (in my opinion) with their guns
It's just my opinion on how different I see that topic
Of course not every American is a gun freak
Besides all that I would definitely visit the States again
I gave an better explanation somewhere in the thread
Compared to Europe what I am used to, it's definitely waaay easier to own a gun in the States
It's not that I don't want to see it,  I really didn't see it in Europe
As I said I went to Texas once and it was different
I just compared that
Now I got curious and researched a little bit
It seems that around Zürich, Switzerland there are about 9 official stores
I am suprised honestly
Interesting to know
Somehow the only guns I ever saw in my life are those carried by the police
I don't even know someone who owns one
As I got deeper in this topic now, I changed my view a little bit
Calling Europe gunfree was false
You learn something new everyday
It has to do how we as a whole perceive it in my opinion
It varies from region to region, but overall I don't remember that Europe ever had a negative connotation with it
But I want to point out something
[This statistic] pretry much highlights want I wanted to say
The difference between the USA and the rest of the world is really huge
Remnants of the Yugoslav system
Also a nice tax evasion technique so most companies pay maximum allowed "lunch/hot meal" money
If you like knowing half of the language just by cussing then you'll love the Yugos
That's what's so shocking about the UK, insurance prices vary too freaking much, I'm sometimes glad it's a flat rate for everyone here plus a 50% discount if you've been driving for 3 years without an accident (it's progressive so you get 75% after your first year etc)
Young people seem to be a huge threat on the island, whereas it's mostly the 30-45 folks that cause the most accidents per number of licenses here
Yeah, I was about to write that, testbooks here have around 300 pages of various stuff, some of it is unpredictable (the famous wheelbarrow man in an intersection), most of it is easy, but it would take everyone at least a few days to pass that test from their first attempt
Every time or is it just for the older folks
Me too
Mine too
Imati muda (having balls) or imati muda od čelika (having balls of steel) means being brave
Hladiti muda (cooling your balls) means being lazy and doing nothing in particular
Edit: another word for balls is "jaja" which means eggs
Edit2: I had to edit it for the second time because I remembered "Imati muda do poda" (having balls to the ground) is actually used the most to reffer to being brave
That the high representative, the guy with the strongest power in Bosnia because he can change the constitution is never bosnian, croat or serb aka is not from this region
I also didn't think that this position still exists
He's from Slovakia
Yes
Stupid autocorrect
Hahahahaahahaha
He only messed something up one time and after that he is doing literally nothing and getting paid heavily
He's doing nothing like everybody else in politics in B&H
Yeah, especially those whose jobs are to root out corruption
Never seen it, I go to Adartic sea and I have never seen it
Bosnia
Lego is about the same price as Czechia, butthe avergae salary is 400€ a month
Lego is incredibly expensive here
Living on two 450€ incomes is alright, you won't miss anything in life, more than enough food, clothes, lot of eating out, vacation locally etc
Thing is that some families of 4 live on that amount or less per month which makes it harder
A Bosnian who doesn't eat burek
A Bosnian who doesn’t like Burek and Chevapi
I am Bosnian and I don't like ćevapi und burek
And also a Bosnian who doesn't love Germany and everything from that country
I don't like burek (the only (meat) pie that should bear that name), I adore zeljanica though
Smoking is far less prevalent among younger people here, is that the case in Croatia too
To Sunce = That Sun (Neutral) (but would mostly be perceived as male)
Taj Mjesec = That Moon (Male)
I'm using terms that, when translated are closer to "that" than "the" because "the" isn't really a thing in Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian
Last Nemanjić died in like 1371
Many wars were fought where Bosnia helped Serbia so you didn't fall under their influence for 70 years more
This exactly
It is impossible for croatian
There are so many tells for the pronunciation and the accent, and the grammar is very hard
Serbian
Writing is really easy
Accent - it depends where you are from, it is not impossible
Grammar - Good luck
From what I have heard from people who tried learning serbian, grammar is a nightmare
Thank you Germany for giving us jobs
But seriously we would be pretty fucked(and more crowded) if it wasn't for you
Croatia and Serbia equally
You can't decide between them
The Balkan is a Battle Royal
Ah yes, the famous Balkan bronemy triangle
Either we are brothers and want Yugoslavia back, or we want the others to disappear
There is almost no inbetween xd
I prefer [this] one
We felt it also, it woke me up, I live in the northern parts of Bosnia
In north west Bosnia and Herzegovina
Felt it too, wake me up this morning
Bosnia here (Sarajevo), I didn't feel anything but I'm a pretty heavy sleeper
I am Living in the central part of B&H and could still feel it
Felt nothing really, it wasn't a big earthquake but the damage was surprisingly great, makes you wonder how many of us have Austro-Hungarian period buildings that haven't been attended to in 100+ years, pieces of them just waiting to fall like they did in Zagreb
When I got the first opportunity to move to Germany I took it immediately without really thinking about the consequences at that time
5 years have passed by now and reflecting on my time when I grew up in Bosnia and being able to compare with it with other social and political systems, it hurts me to say it but it is an honest opinion, Bosnia is a shithole
I don't understand how 30 years after the war there is still this ethnic divide between Serbs, Croats and Bosniaks
The situation is better between the younger generation but still this burden of war is there and it will be there for the next time unfortunately
I still love my country and visit it twice a year but the way it is organized it is doomed not to prosper and move forward
We have the nickname "Apsurdistan" and it really sums it up perfectly
For such a small country to have an unlogicaly complicated political system is apsurd
As I said being able to see and to live in much healthier and more organizes societies, there is no need for me to ever go back
I don't have those stories but from experience it is frowned upon to walk in home with shoes on, or bring in pets in somebody's home without asking
Lmao seperating trash in Balkan
Most places only require you to have a seatbelt in the front seats
My parents fled the war in the 90s so I was born in a different county
Although I I have lived my entire life there I just dont feel at home
I feel like I shouldn't be here at all
The people are nice and most of them see me as one if there own  but my heart just doesn't feel at home here
Indeed
If I don't want to get drunk, I'll drink coke or sparkling water or something
Not alcohol, the literal thing that makes you drunk
In Sarajevo, there are some billboards with citations from Quran and things Prophet Mohammad said
Other than that
As far as I know, no
Oh, thanks for pointing out
Ćevapi i burek
No doubt
ćevapi
meat sticks typically served with pita bread, onions and sour cream
Ok(no offense) so here in Bosnia burek is only meat pie
Sirnica is cheese pie
Zeljanica is spinach pie
Krompirača or krompiruša is potato pie etc
You can find that cheese mostly in Bosnia,Serbia,Croatia and I think in other countries of ex Yugoslavia
A Bosnian flag is very rear at least where i am living, but croatian flags are very common, hell i have one
I think you display it mostly during a World Cup
In Herzegovina (especially high Herzegovina) live moastly Croats, and as you know we are very proud of our country
The flags not always out on display, but on some acasions, some examples are: at weddings, when the roof is being placed on the house and when we are in the finals and semi-finals of sporting compatitions
Yeah, it's cool to see
Here is the photgraph and some context:
Tbh women are capable for all three currently existing types of services, no need to choose between exempting them and making new types of service up
Obviously adjustment can and should be made to make it proportionately less physically strenuous
Same here, would be a success
No true brother country, but I’d consider Austria, Germany and the US as very close friends of . We have a discusting trend of some people calling Turkey our brother nation which is just ridiculous
Croatia and Austria have too been always fond of us
Greetings to the ex Empire
The reasons people call us brothers for, given our history, are disgusting
I would go back to the old one as it has much more history and meaning behind it
First it needs to be said that the door that everyone here is talking about aren't really self-__locking__ -- they're still  unlocked, it's just that the external handle isn't functional
In theory if you squeeze something thin in the right spot in the space between the door and the door case, the door will open
For example a credit card
The external knob is fake, or to put it better it just serves so you can push the door once you turn the key
I'd say say they're a good thing and I'd prefer them over the doors that have a functional handle on both sides, but they have their downsides -- the feeling of fake safety will make you forget to *really* lock, and there's a solid chance you'll lock yourself out occasionally
Locking yourself out of a car has always been possible in European cars, too
I remember it happened to my mother once on an old Opel Corsa B back in the days
Steps to do it were: on a car with all other doors locked open the passenger's door, forget the keys in the car, press the lock on the passenger's door while exiting and close them that way
Voila, your keys are in the car with all doors locked
Džon mejd hiz vej tu a tevern tru d dark forest, onli tu fajnd aut det hi forgot d mani

Do you know that back in the 19th century a linguist from Croatia, Ljudevit Gaj, used the Czech alphabet as an inspiration to create our modern writting system
First it was used in the Croatian language, but it spread out to the other South Slavic languages
Thats why we have letters like Č Š Ž Ć etc
Tenks for det Čekia

You're not that far away, come and see us
We are way more interesting than we appear
I’ll just say - the Balkans
That should be enough
Pretty good
There was a joke i read
We are second most corrupt country in the world
We would have been first, but they paid us to loose
Well at least I know that it's from the same family
The model fits so so so perfectly with wath we have over the branch (haha grane)
its not the scratch my back I will scratch yours, it mutated into something more than simply quid-pro-quo
weird stuff
shhh it doesn't count
How could have you forgotten Stefan
Every ruler from Nemanjić dynasty was named Stefan
Over here she thought English and some Spanish words would sometimes be added
In Bosnia it's wether it's "burek sa sirom"(burek with cheese) or "sirnica" I think
We are less known
Most of the time people wouldnt know we exist and people dont know our capitals, I guess because there arent any major events in the capitals so there is no spotlight on us (just one of the reasons)
I think we are better in geography in general
Cities like Hamburg, Seville or Naples you hear from time to time and I can without any problems point them on a map
Then I meet people who don't even know that Sarajevo is our capital
The most common mistake is they mix it up with Zagreb or Belgrade or don't know at all
I meant entertainment event
We've been deflated by our politicians since forever, the corruption is unbearable here
Also, what war song
I've been out of touch with everything about war for the last couple of years, I cannot stand listening to anything related to that anymore
If I am to be honest, this is my first time hearing about this
I asked my mother she also said she hasnt heard it before
She also says there were a lot of war songs back then but she doesnt remember any and she doesnt want to remember either
It might have something to do with where you come from and how your family deals with what happened in general
My family, for example, doesnt want to remember war or talk about it more than necessary, which is I guess why I never heard about this
I'll be the non-EU bot that will correct you to EU only
This word exists in Bosnian too - čežnja
Other ex-yu languages have it as well
Haha, many journalists in Bosnian media mistranslated "haven" as if it was "heaven" over here, to the point that that tax heaven/paradise has entered the common usage
Seeing the mistranslation now leaking back into English-language media is really funny
1 billion percent
Ustashe is used for croats and chetniks for serbs
Same
Spezi is fairly available in coffee places and bars here too
Kinda disgusting when you drink it alone but combined with a spicy doner it's heaven
Tito is liked by the majority
The people that hate him ive only ever met in comment sections
Although i come from a very "red" town but still
Now that Covid is active ive heard his sentence about a million times:" IF THIS WAS TITOS TIME, WE WOULD HAVE A CURE THE MOMENT THE FIRST CHINESE SNEEZED
That's nice
We use Tunguzija to describe a really far away place
This is a actual place in Siberia (Russia)
We also use names that are not related to any real place but constructed by playing with words
Vukojebina (the place where wolves fuck)
Nedođija ( not+coming, the place where it is impossible to come to
I will include this althought it loses the entire meaning and it is hard to translate into English properly but believe it makes sense in Bosnian)
Nigdjezemska ( nowhere+land)
Bestragija (without a trace place)
Tungusia (nobody actually knows if it exists, and I’m too lazy to google it because it usually shows a river in Russia), but we more often say Bogu iza nogu or behind God’s legs
Oh we use a lot of different ones, like "usred ničega" which translates to "middle of nowhere", "Bogu iza nogu" which literally translates to "Behind God's legs" and "vukojebina" which literally translates to "wolf-fuckery"
There's probably a lot of others, but these come to mind first
I doubt it honestly
Pretty sure nobody cares about rules in Croatia unless it's an UNESCO town
I hate the old ones (well everyone has PVC now) but newer wooden ones are pretty fine
We do as well
You guys not only have Vegeta there, it's also a household name
TIL
I know it's exported to many countries, but thought its fame was mainly an ex-yugoslav thing
And 'UHU' for glue
Here we use zmaj (very similar to Romanian isn't it)
We always tend to dress up even for going to the store which feels weird when you visit Austria and Germany, but most countries are fine
Aww man, I'm a developer and consider myself more than literate, but at some point I developed the habit of doing two quick Caps Locks instead of Shift even for a single capital letter
People usually just find this funny when they see it, never thought people saw it like that I don't know about Shift
On the other hand, I do have prejudice against people who pronounce Ctrl by spelling it out instead of saying "control".
I would say sadly no one, we were friends with Croatia and Serbia for a long time, but our relationship is very complicated nowadays
We like you guys, Croatians too
People that like Ukraine, like Belarus too
Mostly prople that are nostalgic about Yugoslavia and support the pan-Slavic idea
In Yugoslavia days
I think that we weren't really enemies in that period
Throughout entire history up until the WW1, especially in the madeival times
Bosnian king sent tens of thousands soldiers to help Serbs fight the Ottomans in the Battle of Kosovo
You were opressed by Ottomans not Bosnians
Whats your point
Really popular, i sgarted drinking when i was like 15-16
Popular among people that drink alcohol, not everyone does though, that makes us different from the others
9/10 males in Bosnia drinks
Absolutely not true, not even in Tuzla
I'd say 5/10 for under 30s, 7/10 for older folks
I think that you are way off
My social circle doesn't include hardcore Muslims only, yet the minority of my friends and acquaintances drink
When I went to high school, there were never more than 4-5 boys that drank, out of ~20 in the class
Plenty of Bosnians feel Agnostic/Atheist but still reject alcohol
Hello, we have three presidents that represent three different nations, we have no say in anything, votes are always rigged, nice to meet you
Had grandchildren, i'm 26 after all
[This building is an architectural sin ]
Just a building blocking the wiev of a hotel and “hugging” it
Unexpected TV house, I'd think [Tibra] but that angle of the TV building is horrendous
Yes, it's common here
But you can choose do you actually want to go
Yes, they do, because we are a bit religious nation
The government-owned health institutions are a bit inflexible with salaries, i.e. all doctors on the same level have an identical salary, and it stays the same infinitely until the doctor's union goes to strike or something like that
So what happens is that the doctors that provide a good service in the public health sector can become somewhat well-known
Then they can simply negotiate, say, a 30% higher salary in the private sector
The result is that you're forced to pay something like 15% of your salary every month, but sometimes the best doctors are not covered by it because they moved to the private clinics
The upside is that due to the free competition, going private without any insurance whatsoever isn't terribly expensive, either
You can get an MRI with contrast for like $300, fix a tooth for $30, ultrasound for $20, etc
And I'm paying a private insurance plan that costs around $150 annually, covers up to $2000 in full amount (meaning I pay zero out of pocket), and with these prices it's quite hard to spend all that
Some people mentioned that you can spend a lot of time in the waiting room, tbh it sounds spoiled, I'm sure 99% percent of the Americans would love to be offered not to  pay the bill if they sit for an hour more
School starts at 8, 5 minute breaks in between, 30 minute break after 3rd period, 7 periods a day max in 99% of the cases
Hell yeah
When I saw the thread title, I immediately jumped in to talk about the 1st of May in Bosnia, but you described it perfectly
I guess the communist regimes did a good job at promoting celebration of labour
No one cares about the original purpose of the holiday anymore, but the timing is just perfect -- mid-spring when it's not cold anymore but the heat waves haven't started yet either -- and you get two days off work so you don't have to worry about being hangover
The very stereotypical 1st of May menu is a spit-roasted lamb, but some general selection that includes lots of ćevapi will suffice
[Here's a bonus picture of scenes similar to what you posted from Romania
Also every year there's an article in the local news outlets that takes a couple of photos of empty streets of cities that look like ghost towns because everyone is barbecuing somewhere
It’s mostly concentrated in the cities of Mostar and Sarajevo for internationals, however locals and people from the region like to visit all of the ski spots like Bjelašnica, Vlašić and Jahorina
Not WW2 but my great-grandfather was POW  and was held in Sicily
When he got released, he had to walk by foot back to Bosnia
Nevertheless he was really happy when he found out that the Austro-Hungarian Empire fell
Balkan wikis are biased as hell
About things that happened here English wikis usually just take one side of the story and put it up as fact
If possible be Slavic
If not be ready to cry
Croatian is hard for non-native speakers
"Ja sam the napravila i ja cu te i pokvariti"
I made you and I can destroy you too
We have " were you born on a boat"
Yes I can
It's the same like with your language
Every sound has it's letter and how you say a word is exactly how you will spell it
Yes always
It's not that hard tho, because our writing system is almost 100 % phonological
Edit: just foreign words are spelled like in the original language
All of the south slavic languages are essentially the same
would also add things like brate/bra, abi and habibi which all were brought up by immigrants (Ex-Yugoslav, Turks and Arabs in these cases) and are in common use for German/Austian young people
Serb, Bosniak or Croat, all can say there is only one burek
Burek is the pita made with Beef and onions and only that
Everything else needs to be refered by their respective names (sirnica, krompiruša,....)
Yes, it is also a valid answer, but only meat burek is exclusively Bosnian
I worked at an Italian restaurant here in Austria, my boss was Italian and I can remember a couple things he was disgusted about regarding order by customers:
- ketchup on any kind of pasta or pizza, highlight was one guy who wanted ketchup on a Frutti de mare pizza
- a guy wanted Gorgonzola on the Frutti di mare pizza
- Grana in any kind of pasta with seafood or fish in it (except for salmon)
There were more but these are the ones I remember fondly
Gud bevare postnord

Don't have an opinion on them
Zdravo, zovem se Ivan
Drago mi je
Odakle si ti
Hi, call myself Ivan
Nice me is
From where are you
A Chancellor is just a German name for a Prime Minister
So there is no difference between
A Prime Minister is the head of goverment
After every election the new goverment chooses their new PM and every decision they make the PM is responsible to perform it
The President is seen as more or less a ceremonial position
He is not directly involved in the decision making of the goverment
He normally has a veto power and can overthrow the goverment and set up new elections, but this happens very rarely
Every country is different in their structure
I know that in France for example they have a semi-presidental system
Basically the President has more power than in a parlamentary republic
PMs aren't members of the parliament in any of the Balkan states for sure, it could be anyone who's trusted by the ruling coalition of political parties
No Man's Land
It won an oscar
No Man’s Land
Bosnia's "the perfect cyrcle". Its the most popular movie about the yugoslav wars in sarajevo and other bosnian cities
It has the same actor as the one that played Izet Fazlinović in the comedy series "lud, zbunjen, normalan".
Really good movie
It was frustrating but very interesting
Totally my shout as well
Amazing production, with an insight on our ideological problems and a strong anti-war narrative
Amazing production, so glad I watched that (history buff)
Anyone
I'll take anyone at this point
On of our current presidents denies the existence of the biggest genocide in our country's history
Hell I'll take even Trump
I don't know who's running the Belgian government, but I pick them, no one else would understand Bosnia
Yeah our fortresses and both Roman and medieval remains are often overlooked in the touristic offer, many people will mention Jajce waterfalls and beautiful scenery but you'll rarely hear about the fortress, same applies to Ključ, Srebrenik, Blagaj, Vranduk and other fortresses
Not from PIGS or stereotypical South Europe but my driving examiner got mad at me for taking the inner lane in a roundabout (I was taking the third exit so it was logical) and told me to "save that behaviour for after getting my license"
Not here, outer lane even if you're going a full circle for some reason, probably afraid of a candidate not checking their mirrors and crashing into someone
Well there are no regulations here on how you should behave in a roundabout, there are recommendations and stuff but you don't lose points for driving in the outer line, only if you don't stop or cut ahead of a car that's already in
Not as fancy as the other museums mentioned but I really like [the national museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]
It's awful that's what it is
My grammar school had around 550 students like 10 years ago
Now it has 70
And a normal hs next to us had like a few thousand students and now it has 700
The city is like a ghost town
And the holiday season is awful, when everyone comes visiting and you can't literally breathe because of them
And they are very entitled,thinkibg that the lives of us locals revolve around them lol when in reality we are looking forward to the peace and quiet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Which high school had thousands of students lmao
Where do you live
Statistically your population seems to be about the same as 20 years ago, if the data is correct
Not like idk 10 thousand but 10 15 years ago it had like 2 thousand which is considerably more compared to now
I live in USK but I won't specify the city because ya know I would like to stay anonymous
I'd love to spend some time in Cluj as a software engineer
Yes, it's one of the most prominent European hubs, the fully abolished tax on IT income makes it very competitive salarywise with some more developed countries and I've only heard the best about the city itself
Still shouldn't be much more expensive than here and given the wage gap in IT the living standard should be even better there
Yeah it's about the same here except you won't pay the 10% income tax after all the social givings
When I went to school, we more or less all came to the school without adults during the first grade, today it starts happening a couple of grades later
I live in a rural setting though, but I talked to my peers who grew up in cities and it seems like the age where they start walking alone has quite moved up there, too
It seems as a general trend that younger parents are becoming much more protective of their kids than the earlier generations, and it reflects on this, too
I can somewhat understand Medieval Bosnian, and also the writing because its similar to the cyrillic alphabet
1600s Travnik
1700s Sarajevo
1800s Sarajevo
1900s Sarajevo
2000s Sarajevo
Probablt correct, BogauCelo
It was capital before Sarajevo existed
It's Travnjak in Bosnian
Actually, im mistaken
It was capital when Sarajevo was burned to ground because of it's location
And it was in center of country
Sarajevo was burned to the ground in 1697, between the 1660s and 1690s it had over 100k people and was around the 10th place in Europe's biggest cities
We get English as a subject in schools in 3rd grade, so then
I improved my English by watching YouTube videos
It's actually an EU-funded programme that lets you travel to Balkan and Eastern Europe countries that aren't in the EU and lets us go anywhere too
Given that the supply of places outweighs the demand and you're getting a free scholarship, a lot of people just go, do nothing at their host uni and save money
>If you have the money, it might be worth investing in an electric car, as these will soon be mandatory in much of Europe anyway, and are much better for the environment
Maybe in 2040
We have 20km of coastline
The rest belongs to Croatia and Montenegro
Their identity issues are truly a sight to behold
When I was a high school student, I had a discussion with a philosophy professor from Skoplje on Facebook and he had some interesting obscure German philosophers to recommend but holy mother of God, his views on history were Skopje 2014 down to a T. I still vividly remember a boyhood memory when I first asked my father about the controversy around the name of the country and my father started his answer with ''Sine, Grci su u pravu'' (Son, the Greeks are right)
In Bosnian it would be "majmun", meaning monkey, or "ludo a", meaning crazy A.
"Ludo a" or literally translated "crazy a".
It's very funny whenever I think about it -- it sounds like just a very honest description that was created on the spot by someone who isn't the slightest bit creative, imaginative or funny
A total opposite of the typical stuff that enter the slang of the general population
For some reason I find that unfunniness so funny
Like yeah, it's an 'a', but not a regular a; it's a weird a. Duh
Same as most people here, I support other Ex-Yugoslav countries
I was pretty bummed when Croatia lost in the WC Final
Serbia
Croatia
Slovenia
Montenegro
North Macedonia
Anyone else
Everyone loves the Irish, they're just so interesting lads
Most of the Balkans is like that, still unspoilt by big production
It's normal here too so they might be Balkan
Was it tho, Algoritam translation just uses more apostrophes to make it seem he's from a rural setting
My mom calls it šalabakter, I guess that's how they used to call them back then
Nowadays it's called puškica, meaning little gun
My friend once wrote a cheat sheet the size of a notebook page and we joked that it's not a puškica, it's a machine gun
We call them puškice-little guns, tomovi-no special meaning and šalabahter-also no special meaning
Đonovi
It literally means shoe soles and makes absolutely no sense
Same here as well
Đon and šalabahter are more popular
Never heard those two before
Absolutely not, 8kg backpacks were common
But in high school nobody carried books and mostly carried only 2-3 notebooks so it was a way to relieve the back pressure
I think small kids nowadays are required to have a locker in their school at least up to 3rd grade
We have them in my HS, but it's definitely not the norm
The only thing resembling a locker I ever had was in kindergarten, it was a locker where we would put our jacket and shoes for the time we were in kindergarten
Although I have a friend in gymnasium (is that how you write it
) who says they have lockers
So maybe some highschools have them
I remember it was the worst when I was like 9-11, later I guess they stopped checking if we brought all of books and in highschool they are almost completely unneeded
Which is great
It seems to be so everywhere in Europe
However, under the influence of the American media, I wouldn't be surprised if we made a switch to their system in the future
It's not uncommon for less quality press to translate trillion as
trillion, instead of a billion which is our actual equivalent
Hell, I've even heard some youngsters who consume a lot of American content to say "billion" for a milliard, though that's not common yet
Our government is just terrible
Not unique, I know, but we have THREE presidents
3x more corrupt and useless than any other nation’s leaders
It is only “normal” for us
In order to bring an end to the Bosnian War in the 90’s, an agreement was made between the “3 constituent peoples” of Bosnia
Those being Bosniaks, Bosnian Croats, and Bosnian Serbs
The agreement decided that two entities within Bosnia would be created, those being “The Federation of Bosnia and Hercegovina”, and “Republika Srpska”. They are basically two states within Bosnia and Hercegovina
The reason we have 3 Presidents was to appease the Bosnian Croats and Bosnian Serbs, and to lessen the potential of discrimination between the 3 peoples
I must admit that this does make sense for the time, as you can’t allow any of the people groups to be discriminated against, especially after a war that included ethnic cleansing and genocide
(Crimes on all sides)
However, these days the system leads to high levels of corruption, and a political system that promotes division instead of unity
Sentiments like “Vote for my party, we can’t give the Bosniaks/Croats/Serbs too much power
” Are common and are used to divide us
Decisions for the country can’t be made without the presidents agreeing, and that basically never happens
This is a big reason why Bosnia is poor and backwards
It’s a framework that just doesn’t work anymore
However, the Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to support abolishing our Tri-President system
They would see this as “losing”, and people from the Balkans don’t like to lose
The fact of the matter is, that as long as we keep our current system, the entire country loses
If we were to get rid of the current framework, we would just need to make sure none of our people groups are discriminated against
We are neighbors, brothers, and citizens of Bosnia and Hercegovina, and we must move forward together
Which would you say is the most corrupt
Mostly ethnic, but religion is a part of many people’s identity so that is considered as well
Most people have no issues between ethnic groups
It’s only a concern when it comes to politics
It is really just old people and the “villagers” that have issues between ethnicities
By villager, I mean those that live in the middle of no where and only know people within their ethnic group
Hmm, well I don’t have any statistics to argue with you, so I suppose I’ll trust you lol
Honestly I’m a bit surprised that North Macedonia is that corrupt, they seem to be headed in the right direction
I completely agree with you
Unfortunately, Bosnia is too poor to drastically overhaul its education system
Those that are highly educated end up leaving the country for more prosperous ones, like Germany
We have some of the highest levels or “brain drain” in Europe
I appreciate your kind words, friend :)
Yes I understand what you mean
I suppose the quality of the education is important too
What people don’t realize is if kurds get their own state bordering turkey and become powerful enough they woll start cpntesting the land that a large portion of kurds live in turkey
Turkey is just preemptively preventing this
A kurdish state would not be yazidi
You wanna give up a piece of australia for them
Only a minority
They are mostly sunni muslim
...neither are the english
Wanna give up all of your land to the indigenous australians
I mean its easy telling others to give up some of their land
not so much when its your country in question
Well you have the only city with two clubs who both won the UEFA Champions League (AC Milan and Inter)
Can confirm
well we dont have words and its artificially made so it fucking sucks
It has no text and it lacks a "climax" or drop because its just build-up with nothing to top it off, if that makes sense
A džezva
It’s a special Bosnian ”pot” for making coffee

Before anyone else from Balkans jumps in I am gonna claim [*šljivovica*] for Bosnia

[You have your wine at least]
English is generally speaking an easy language
Because a majority of media is in English it is easier to learn
But the pronunciation was for me a bit difficult
The same letter is pronounced differently is different words
My languages is phonetically consistent so that was for me the most challenging part
I honestly don't see anything bad at that, I met a lot of 2-4 finger typers that can type 80-90 wpm
Be aware of robbers
They are masterminds
Also taxi drivers sometimes overprice
What countries do you call differently in your language ?
Completely different from the official English name used by the UN and what does it mean
Example: Germany - Njemačka ( land of the mute people )
I would say them but you already know
Edit : I edited the question
The accent is on **completely**
We use Ujedinjeno Kraljvstvo ( United Kingdom ) just for formal meetings
In regulrar daily speech if you are referring to the UK most would say Velika Britanija ( Great Britain )
What does the word "an" mean
And why do some countries have it in the beginning and others not
Is there a pattern
We got the name Njemačka from the word *nijem* which means *mute, silent, not being able to speak* When the early Slavs encountered Germanic tribes they couldn't understand them, and said " Ok guys, these people are not able to speak proper, let's call them *Nijemci*"
But as I saw here it is a common Slavic name for Germany
It lasts until today
Germany has quite a list of foreign names for the country
What about The Ivory Coast / Côte d'Ivoire
I think it's an interesting name because most countries use a translation from the English / French term as the official name for the country
Bijelo means white in all Slavic languages
So Bjelorusija is White Russia
Let me guess
Bosnia et Herzegowina
Lol, I like the story
So in Romanian *Nemti* could mean something along the lines of a foreigner
The word itself comes from Proto Slavic *nijem* meaning mute, silent, not being able to speak
When the Slavs encountered the Germanic tribes, they were not able to understand or to communicate with them ,obviously, and started to call them Nijemci
That's why we call the country *Njemačka*, the people *Nijemci*, or the language *njemački*
I saw somewhere in the thread, someone said that *welches* means foreigner and that's how the country Wales got it's name
"The land of foreigners" sounds cool tho
[here you go]
Edit: what I found interesting is that the Welsh name for their country *Cymru* means *countryman* *from the people*. So you basically have two completely different  names and meanings for the same country
The historic country of Venice is called *Mletačka republika* but the modern city itself just *Venecija*
If you ask me I guess it is a cognate
Veneto - Beneto - somehow Benatky in the end
But I am far away from being a linguist you should trust
>Baltarusija
So if *balta* means *white* obviously, is that how the region the Baltics got the name ? Meaning *the white land* or something similar
I never meant this
I answered this somewhere there in the thread
But here we go again:
The United Nations is a international organisation with 6 official languages
One of them happens to be English
Therefore every country has an **official** English name with which it is listed in the UN
Official, meaning from the Oxford dictionary - "Having the approval or authorization of an authority or public body
I didn't used the word *official* meaning *right* or *proper*
"Official English name used by the UN". The way the UN lists countries is in a way official
There are six official languages of the UN
These are Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish
I try to avoid this, althougt I know there are people who make this mistake
Calling the whole UK just Engleska is disrespectful to Scotland, Wales ans Northern Ireland
Oh ok
I just looked up the link you posted and was curious
It seems it is used 50/50
Well that's their problem
I will be honest with you
If someone thinks Bulgarian or Bosnian are equal with English, they should go to Sweden for example and speak their native language
Good luck communicating with someone
I don't mean we should abandon our native language and start speaking English
I would never do that
But comparing English with languages that are spoken just in one country it's apsurd
English is the most common lingua franca in the world
It is an easy answer
Because everyone in this subreddit uses English and it is by far the most understood language here
If I asked to compare it to Bosnian no one would have a clue because you don't know how we call other countries
Of course it is official
Every country has an official name for another country
The United Nations, as I said, has 6 official languages
Therefore there are 6 official ways you can name a country in the UN
I don't understand what is the problem with that
Qatar is literally the "least bad" country in the Gulf, they care a lot about education and healthy fundamentals for such a small country and even survived the blocking by imperialistic alliance led by Saudi Arabia and even the workers rights that are horrendous in whole of the Gulf at least state that physical workers can't work in peak sun hours
Of course, we should absolutely raise questions about the elevated number of deaths caused by workplace incidents and overworking of mostly South Asian construction workers and possibly think about repercussions and boycotting but the comment you made definitely supports the wrong side
Well that's a risk with all of the countries of the Gulf but none practice sharia on tourists anymore
Sveto Rimsko Carstvo Njemačke Narodnosti (The Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation)
This is the official name but the last part (German Nation) is mostly left out
Sveto rimsko carstvo- basically the same as in English
It would be too much work in our case for something so unneeded
I have a Bachelor's in English and I still sometimes mix in and at when it comes to places
Well, let’s just say that’s when the 3 different ethnicities used the wars to justify their atrocities
The real hate of each other stems from the World Wars, and the ethnic cleansing / genocides that came with them
Not really
The country we were in has fallen apart in 1990s so we could start foreign relations from scratch but the war that happened in 90s.largely effects it tho
I don't and we are mainly Muslims but still act pretty much the same as anyone in Hungary or Austria, surely the mentality is a bit different from the Austrian one, but that has more to do in being abused by big empires, therefore less developed and encouraging people to find ways to "cheat the system" which was always the case, even in "peaceful and prosperous" socialist Yugoslavia (the 1945-1992 one) people still found ways to ensure that they get more of what was supposed to be "equality".
Turkish customs didn't really stick that much unless in very rural places and we are all much more Italian/Spanish than Turkish looking
Being compared with Ukraine, Moldova and Kosovo hurts, things are sometimes very slow due to ethnic groups blocking laws they don't agree with, but come on
Je n' ai pas beaucoup l'argent
[This one definitely]
but we sadly had to change it because of the
[Dayton agreement] Agreement

I've only seen people pack their bags in a designated space in DACH
Everywhere else I've been you pack it as they come from the cashier at the checkout like in any other hypermarket
Is it different in Ireland
All of ex Yugoslavia actually
Maybe Portugal
Croatia - small in population, but a football powerhouse
It seems very amazing to me that's group of 16 year olds can understand Dachau and that it can touch them, kudos to you
In Bosnia, as well as other as other west Slavic languages I think, we don't bother pronouncing the umlauts, but also usually replace ü with i and ö with e.
So we just say (and often write it) Minhen, read like that - "Minn-hen", and Dusseldorf is pronounced like diesel-dorf
Traveling on the M6, it connects the towns of Čapljina - Trebinje and is a common route people take when heading to and from Dubrovnik (coastal town in Croatia) or to Montenegro
Besides a couple of towns, it's very rural and all you will see for nearly 2 hours is mountains after mountains, hardly any houses and one gas station
The most quietest part of the country in my opinion
Good luck hearing anything on the radio besides static when traveling through here
You'll also pass a few signs saying "watch for mines", just to keep you unnerved throughout the journey
Based on a study I did in my household 30 seconds ago, It's not really popular here in Bosnia & Herzegovina
Same thing was with being fat
If you have a different accent you are probably from a different city or county
That's all as far as I know
I don't think so, pretty normal for students and people who work alone or just want to blow off some steam
There are [three cultural sites] in Bosnia and Herzegovina (and 11 under consideration)
French names are the best and I'm sad I won't be able to name my children French names
I think it's typed esmeé and Elise is also a nice name
If I spelled it right
South Slavic surnames, typically, end in “ić”.
The ić ending has the same meaning as your aforementioned examples
It means of the x descent/family/profession
Can confirm, BiH right now is a bit of a mess, politically and ethnically
Hopefully another war doesn't burst out anytime soon, and everything could be solved without one
The problem is that the political leaders in the Balkans are nowhere near the best, and I highly doubt that these issues will be solved completely
Youth people don't feel patriotic at any side and the veterans are fed up with the way the government is treating them so there's no way anything happens
TBH the economy started getting better before Covid and the political stuff is actually getting better every day, only outsiders think that something will happen and Serbians pity us for some reason, even if they're not better developed at all
I'd say the same for us but we fired our worst coach in history and will play both the semis and the potential finals at home and we're pretty damn good at home so there's hope
Who did that
So sad to see that
Bosnia and Herzegovina:
Probably during the 1910’s, including the lead up to World War 1
A story centered around the plot to assassinate the Archduke Franz Ferdinand is exactly the type of story Assassins Creed is made for
Serbian and Croatian I understand everything
Suprise, suprise
Macedonian it gets a little bit tricky but it is not a big deal
Slovenian and Bulgarian is where the fun starts
I have to be really focused to the speaker if I want to understand a good portion of the sentence
From other Slavic languages, Slovak is the most understandable
It is because of the pronounication, that is similar to our South Slavic one
Slovak has words that they share with Bosnian but not with other Slavic languages
One example  **mačka** meaning **cat**
Another language with a high understand rate is Russian
The pronounication is completely different, but there are huge junks of words that share an common origin
Both Russian and Bosnian were influenced by Old Church Slavonic
Czech is almost like Slovak but not quite
The pronounication sounds to hard for me, where else Slovak has this mixture od hard and soft, like we have in the South
With Ukrainian and Belarussian I did not have a lot of contact
I can recognize that is a East Slavic language because of the pronounication
Somehow Russian is in the end the most understandable
I put Poland on the last place
Sorry guys
It is really hard to understand
You get some words here and there but that it is
Polish is unique among Slavic languages
The way it is pronounced and written it is almost alien
Yeah I'd go along with putting Polish in the "I get we have similarity, but what the fuck
" section
Than *kukuruz* *šetati* *pandur* *cipela* or *hajduk* does not sound unfamiliar either ;)
Exactly this
The first time I heard Slovak I was like : Wait, you guys really speak that similar to us o.O
Correct 5/5
I know about these examples, but there seems to be more because
Szoba is definitely a room
Csizma - boot
Sogor - your wife's brother
That is a Croatian word
In Bosnia we say *zet*
Malna - ? some kind of berry, blueberry, rasperry maybe
Kovacs - Smith
Alrighty then i guess im not coming to Split again any time soon
Vi havde også én uges svensk og én uges norsk i folkeskolen, så helt indelukkede er vi heller ikke
Virkelig
Havde det en enkel gang i 7
eller 8
, det bestod bare af at læse tekster på et af de to sprog
Se det er interessant
Vidste slet ikke man skulle have svensk og norsk på STX, men min erfaring med lærere er at de hopper rundt og udvælger det de synes er vigtigst/ungår det man ikke kan trække til eksamen
Ahahah jeg behøver skam ikke en kandidat for at regne den ud
Spøg til siden, faktisk for nyligt tænkte jeg på hvor meget klogere er en dansk lærer i folkeskolen egentlig end en 3
g’er på STX eller whatever tilsvarende
Naturligvis glemmer man ting hist og pist, ikke nødvendigvis kun en dansk lærer men også flere fag
Idk var bare en tanke midt et samfundsfags lektion
The jokes are way older than the post-Yugoslavia form of Bosnia and Herzegovina though
Well subtitles are important for proper spelling even after understanding what the people were saying
And obviously for late night binge parties when the sound can't be that loud
For some reason, *rare* is much more difficult than *rural* for me, but generally I agree the words with multiple Rs are worst words to pronounce
And *rarer*, is that even a word
I don't have any huge trouble with Ls, though, or any other combinations in particular
The Baltics seem to be really similar when you compare the sense of humour and what could've been without the war
We share a basketball passion with Lithuania and Latvia too
Here(at least in my town) the tradition is that when someone dies ,the neighbourhood digs the grave
One person from each household has to go
I live in a pretty "red" neighbourhood but everyone still does it
If nobody from your house goes(without a valid reason)  its considered rude
During the burial religious people stand in the front for the prayer while we others just stand in the back ,wait till its over, cover the grave and thats it
Usually food ia made and given to the family
Youre oblidged to go to their house for coffee in one of the next 40 days
[The Cellist of Sarajevo] is a pretty strong contender in my opinion
The juxtaposition of a cultural monument reduced to rubble and a living nicely dressed musician playing a cello during a medieval style city siege in the late 20th century is quite a combination
I've seen dude summing up all angles in triangle and getting 214 degrees or something
It was Introduction to Mechanics on First of Mining Faculty
I find ancient civilizations pretty interesting
One that stands out for me is Greece
The amount of things they contributed to our modern western world is astonishingly high for a relatively small country
The philosophy of ancient Greece is my favourite topic
How they thought about life, us humans, the world around us is just amazing
And don't get me even started on the mythology stuff
How they tried to describe the world, I could listen to this all day long
Even the waiters walk around in your national wear in that pub
Hope you had fun in Sarajevo
Not always first on people’s to visit lists, but people always end up having a lot of fun
No I haven't. Should I?
Besides Austria where I live and Bosnia where I'm from I know most hymns due to watching World and European cups
I believe the countries I could confidently say I'd guess only by hymn would be Croatia, Russia, Germany, Italy, France, Spain, the UK and Brazil (who I think have a really cool anthem imo)
And due to media I'd add the US and Canada too
Few years ago it would snow quite regularly, now it barely does
Fairly often December-February, usually 10cm or so, we had a few bigger hauls with 0
5-1m in the last 20 years, nothing has changed in the recent years
It's frowned upon and in my experience people will try to shove their religion down your throat
Big no-no
People don't know how to mind their own business here
Well the 3 of them are all a big fat joke
The whole goverment is
Some tv station put a paper on the wall of the parliament that said:
,, For sale because it isn't used often''
That pretty much sums it up
North and South America are two seperate continents
Central America is mentioned aswell as a region and thus part of North America
As for the other I honestly don't remember what we were officially taught
It is up to personal preference more then anything else I would say
Australia is the default name and it is more used in conversation
I even saw those two named combined, so you get "Australia and Oceania".
Almost the same here, Australia and Oceania is the only difference if I remember correctly
The only family gatherings I've had have been funerals
Other than that, I don't really stay in touch with anyone but my parents, grandparents and sister
Neither of my parents have siblings, so it helps in keeping this part of the family sort of isolated from the rest

Its not that impresive architecture vise but it is from the roman period so it's historically important
Its seen also on the city's coat of arms
Well that sounds great
I's about 3 to 4% of your wage and even though 15 sounds little from 400 that ain't bad

I guess having mayonnaise on pizza would be way more prevalent and everyone would be weirded out by it
The accents would be funny though
My husband and I like al dente
His mother always make pasta mushy and he hated that
Sometimes I joke that he married me because of food
That we have 3 presidents(Bosnia)
When older people close all windows during summer because the draft will kill you
I have heard of it in a cartoon
We don't have it because words ate written like they are said
No, we don’t. Our language is really phonetic, but there are organized competitions from some subjects like Bosnian(Croatian/Serbian), Geography, Maths, English, Computer Science, Physics
first level is municipal competitions, then cantonal, federal and state ones
And here if the bathroom is too small for a bidet
Uhh there's a band from our country that perfectly sums up our country's state
These two are my favourite: [song 1] and [song 2] You can turn on CC for both
Our football fan song "Hajmo Bosno" (Go Bosnia)
One of my favourites songs at all, I love it
It sounds very Bosnian and I think it perfectly reflects our Bosnian spirit, patriotism and culture, and the lyrics also describes geography of our country, singing how the song of joy and happiness spreads throughout the whole territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina from Una river to Drina river, across the mountains and hills towards our sea and Sava river, and that song really triggers many emotions at me
I remember how everyone was singing that song in November 2013 when B&H qualified to the World Cup 2014
Or myb try with this link as it has better audio quality
Indeed, those are also pretty great
Why is that so
We dont have fancy letters, well maybe a couple like ž š č ć đ dž lj nj, but our grammar sucks and everyone would hate it
My nose would freeze if I opened the window and slept while 15° is the daily temperature
That's barbaric IMO, I always freeze if the temperature is below 22-23 degrees in my bedroom
[Blackburn Rovers]
Biased for sure as it is my favorite team but AC Milan is my top
pick
Real Madrid, Olympique Marseille, Olympique Lyon and PSG have nice logos too
That's why I like it most, unique shape, colors, meaning, art, beautiful
Maybe not unique to my country but unique to the region is having loads of bread with pretty much every dish
In Bosnia, we make plum Knödeln (knedle), and there are even shops dedicated to them (not many)
11th century (?) - 1463 (Ottoman rule)
1992 -
No,Bosnia was an independent country and it even had larger teritorries including Dalmatia
Bosnia even had their own religion-Church of Bosnia which lasted until the Ottoman rule because patarens (members of Church of Bosnia)had a similar religion to islam and they eventually all became muslims
What city disappointed you the most when visiting
For me it's definitely Palermo
Here we go:
* Lack of sights and squares
* Very little pedestrian options
* People selling their stuff on carpets at weird flea markets where everyone stares at you like you don't belong there even though it's in the central area of the city
* Organised dog fights literally in the back alley of the said market and in one other park that's a bit more near the port
* Unsafe and sad feeling throughout the city
We pronounce it as H in words, like Horse
And we pronounce the letter itself like H!
Or "vukojebina" for that matter
Pretty much everyone
In Bosnia it's "list, kamen, makaze". This can be translated as "__leaf__, rock, scissors", or "__paper__, rock scissors", since we use the same word for a leaf and for a piece of paper (typically you'd say "a leaf of paper" if we translate literally)
In my mind as a kid the list part always stood for a leaf, rather than a piece of paper, though
Yeah and kids actually often say it out loud while doing the hand-shaking thing, like "Liiiiiiist, kameen, makaa
-ZE
", with the "ze" part being simultaneous with the rock/paper/scissors gesture, haha
I can't imagine your variant being said out loud in this manner, it's either not said at all or it's a different rhythm
We have these two exactly the same as you :
>Jasne jak słońce
Jasno kao sunce
>Mieć coś w małym palcu
Imati nešto u malom prstu
The meaning is the same obviously
Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro without problem
Slovenia would be pretty doable and North Macedonia/Bulgaria would be more difficult but possible
I could travel around Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, no problem :)
Germany:
"Guten tag
Ich spreche nicht Deutsch
Sprishst du Englisch
Sarajevo is rather safe at night in terms of walking home alone, no issues
Residential neighbourhoods will often be empty so when you get there from your night out it might feel odd but there's nothing to be afraid of
Kite means *dicks*
I am croatian and half of those are the same over here
It's expected here too, not necessarily in cafes or cheap pizza/fried food places, but it would be weird not to tip in restaurants
That's very popular in Bosnia too, although luckily dying with the younger generation, I never encountered anyone under 30 that fought about who's paying, unless if it was a surprise "I'm paying" and the bill is 20+ euros
I agree, it's a mortal sin not having it
TBH the subbing is far more common in Europe, it's just that the bigger countries can afford to dub if their language is strong
Of course it does, it's sold in most theaters
Not many buyers though for obvious reasons
Not Europe as a whole but about the balkans
Some people think Bosnia Serbia Croatia Montenegro slovenia and macedonia are the same thing
And they don’t understand why we arent one country
>someone does something gay
>” its french”
Goes to berlin, paris, rome and/or london
Says that they traveled all of europe
I say on the internet that im slavic and everyone goes “cyka blayt” or “your russian
” or some other adidas or vodka joke
Yeah its a pretty good song
True but it does have the international airport where people might visit it that way
TIL there's a Kremlin outside of Moscow
*skaht* is basically *skhot* in our language, language rules make it into *Skot*.
But only Serbs transcribe names out of all Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian-Montenegrin-whatever speakers
Yes
Heres a controversial one: ćevapi
yes, we do like to eat them every so often but not like every week, most people eat them once a month
- Maths - blue
- English - red
- Science - green
- Second language - Yellow
How is the Vlore airport project going
Of course they can, it's not frowned upon by regular people and is pretty normal to see friends sharing a coffee in a bar without assuming they're a couple
We just say ”halo”, which doesnt have a proper translation in English
Drywall isn't a thing unless your existing brick/concrete walls aren't straight so you put it to fix the issue
Otherwise, new things will be delivered to your actual apartment/home and installed usually for free by the seller and for old stuff you just rent a van or a moving company
Yep, you lay a foundation mixture and foundation colour when you renovate and then you paint over that
drilling or making obscene noise at 7am
Yeah but that doesn't last long unless they're either:
* very poor or both unemployed
* living in a huge house
Not sure about you guys but freshly-wed city couples are expected to rent here as soon as they marry
And if you're from the biggest city in your country that also has a significant part of the population, you don't move out :D
True, except while driving, expect the unexpected if you're driving in Albania :D
And the food's awesome, there is no other country that offers so much good quality cheap food with the most chefs being trained in Italy
We have it in Bosnia too
We call them kifle as well
Common in rural areas and among poor people in cities
Because it's usually the poor that live outside the natural gas and city heating system zones and can't afford electric convectors
They also often use charcoal
Bruh, modern Bosnia and Herzegovina has a ''hold my beer'' competition when it comes to traitors
Even during the halcyon days before the war (neighboring Croatia was already balls deep in conflict during the same time frame) you had Croat and Serb ethnic para-states in waiting
But those aren't the only ones
Fikret Abdić, the guy who had won more votes than Alija Izetbegović for Bosnia's collective presidency in 1990 but inexplicably forfeited the leadership of said presidency, formed a para-state of his own in Velika Kladuša during the war
He is now the mayor of said city
He is also a convicted war criminal
Ali-aga Rizvanbegović i Smail-aga Čengić
Fikret Abdic is a good shout
For anyone thats not familiar with the Bosnian War - think of the scenario as an influental Jewish army leader who worked alongside the Nazis
What makes things worse is that he should have won the elections, democratically
Literally cucked out on one of the earliest rebellions in Europe, the predecessor of the 1840 revolutions across Europe
Fucking money-grabbing pricks, long live secular Bosnia under Husein captain
Who is ''you'' and who is ''us'' in your sentence ?
Who are ''our people''. People of Bosnia and Herzegovina on one side and people of Serbia on the other ? I'm a Bosnian Serb btw
All the non bosnians i know call sirnica "burek sa sirom"
Burek je burek, sirnica je sirnica
Seljačine
Yes but it tastes real bad, had zeljanica for dinner today tho
Finally someone i agree with
Plenty of people in my maternal grandfather's home town don't bother to close the door to their house for most of the day during summer
The result is that their living rooms are often filled with flies, ''Lord of the Flies'' style
Most everyone is very religious as well, there isn't much fun to do, people sleep on weird tiny pillows and the kids are little shits, one even groped me
The place was always suffocating for me and I hated visiting it
My maternal grandmother's home town was much lovelier
It's pretty possible if you hit something in front of you which makes you fly over the bike straight onto your head and knees
Folk dance known as "Kolo" across Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina
Lol Gaudeamus brings back high school Latin memories, it's usually sung at University ceremonies when diplomas are handed, but it's never by students
Maturantski ples doesn't exist in high schools here (thank God I guess), although I did have a weird feminist PE teacher who forced boys to dance
We fought eachother for 4 bloody years and tore our country apart, and we wont be able to fix it in a long time
Same with Sarajevo
Like a country within a country,all money goes to it
I mean its not Munich but compared with the rest of Bosnia its strong af
Everything
Bosnia is very underdeveloped
Without by standard, older people do the line but it's considered bad practice
No one has a second name that I know of
Second or middle names are practically nonexistent here, but some names like ''Ana Marija'' are usually (and legally at least in the case of the Federation) considered as one name with multiple words
nije kod nas ko kod zapadnjaka jbg
yea so do we, they’re only used in official documentation, like birth certificate, bills or your deathcard
When talking about people from high school/college Americans often refer to them with they full name
So, two people who didn't go to the same HS/college often use sentences like:
>*Brad Clint was into fishing back in college*
Even though the other person has no clue who the particular Brad is
Well I wouldn't cut the whole steak at once, but I would switch to my right hand after cutting each bite, it's not that uncommon here as in many cultures, most people are right-handed and some cultures value the right hand more when it comes to doing stuff
Debit cards can also have a negative allowance, in fact most do have it
The process of reporting a fraud is the same for both options here, in both cases you will get your money back if you responded within 24 hours
Well it's the opposite here: Including the last name would make me think and try to remember if I know a Brad with that surname, whereas the other person would let me know that we hadn't met if they started speaking about A Brad from HS
They have a multiple personality disorder (with 3 personalities
She would eat meat
She'd also argue (with herr neighbours) a lot
For the companion animal, uhh
a bear would be fitting
It sounds like a pretty okay system, except for the part that they don't sell Single-Trip tickets on the bus itself
A lot of them are simply attention seeking fit people like YouTubers with no real knowledge
What sort of lies are you talking of
We have a similar problem in Bosnia where international media blasts the migrant camps as inhumane or unjust, when in reality its the exact opposite (for people who walk in Nike shoes and leather jackets whose demographics are strictly adult men)
I don’t think the majority of Europe would understand this joke, but this is hilarious
I don’t like when someone insults the other Ex-Yugoslav countries
I don't like when people say something about Serbia in a negative way
Let the poor guys stay in peace with only 20% of their past land
My name is Dario, but many of my relatives used to call me "Dado", which is like a more comfortable cute nickname to get, not really any meaning behind it
Now, one of my aunts used to call me "Ec" pronounced like the word "nets" without the N. She explained why she used to call me that a while ago, but I can't remember why
To daughters they say "my son".
To sons they say "Konju" . Konj means Horse
Basically every parent ever
For the children its mostly the same as everywhere
"Mali/Mala" means "Little boy/Little girl/
"Duša" means "Soul" and so on
We don't have articles, which is a good thing
On the other hand the language is complicated af for foreign learners, especially non -slavic speakers
Probably the flags under yugoslavia
The Bosnian one didn't have any national simbols, and Croats hate anything to do with Yugoslavia
We have that too in Bosnia
No it isn't that small
Around 20
000 km²
Vjeverica
I am not Shure but i thing it comes from the verb "verati" which means to climb
Verati is not used in Croatian standard language, but only in regional dialects
I think that its not hard to pronounce
Quite a few
First one that comes to mind: Not recognizing Kosovo
I live in Bosnia
But Kosovo isn't a separatist movement, it's a state in basically every sense and it feels weird not to recognise them
Yeah
The triple presidents
1/3rd
Maybe some do it but I haven't heard of anyone doing it
Only thing similar to that that students do is instrukcije ( literally translates to instructions) for mathematics if they are bad at math
You have special teacher that explains lessons you don't understand to you and maybe few more students, although I wouldn't know I never went
There are also courses in foreign languages if you are bad at them or if you want to learn more
Took me a lot of scrolling to find a country that keeps their eggs in a fridge or a refrigerated shelf
I can't imagine eggs being kept at room temperature or at a shelf in the summer, despite all the AC
Please don't, not all of Europe has a functional international rail service
A lot of people from the Balkans started flying and experiencing other cultures thanks to LCCs and it would be vile to take it from them just because someone on the other end is able to pick between too many types of connections
We call croatia "hrvatska", it calls itself that, the other countries like serbs and montenegras call it that
In Bosnia we say "cetnici" for Serbs, "ustase" for croats and "balije" for Bosniaks
All are really offensive and come from either WW2 or the civil war from the nineties
I think its the same for Serbia
Cetnici (original name was "Jugoslovenska vojska u otadzbini" which translates to "Jugoslav army in the fatherland") were a partisan group during WW2 that occasionally sided with the nazis, ustase where nazi puppets and balija was a word used by the Turks to call the people that were shepards and beekeepers from mountainous regions
It was later adopted by the Croats and Serbs as a insulting name for Bosniaks
This doesnt drive me crazy but some people get mildly annoyed
When someone says for example “reko”. The correct form is “rekao”. And this goes with a lot of the verbs
People say these verbs incorrectly all the time and its kinda the norm now
Its the same here, its just grammatically incorrect
I only know two people who actually say “rekao” and other verbs correctly
That seems like quite a lot for an intern
Of course I fully support it just didn't expect what's a solid starter wage in many western European countries
Got my steam account stolen and the 20 euros on it
Very common, even among good friends, some don't like the bro-hug and you have to respect it
Thats a very general question
For me, its my own hometown but then again if you mean historically - its a couple of cities, there cannot be only one most important city
History was written all over Balkans, i.e. Belgrade is not more or less important than Sarajevo, Zagreb, Athens, Istanbul, etc
Perhaps if you were more specific
Edit: to make it more clear, do you measure it by famous people born there, famous people who died there, what happened in the city, or w/e?
And the Winter Olympics in 1984 from more recent history
It's not common to greet the clerk in many countries unless the shop is like 20sqm
Kebab shops don't sell fries here
Mashed potatoes would be missed
I think the whole Balkan section would start WWIII
Ok that is hilarious
Why would you care if it's a good song
Do we put the Balkans in the same category as Turkey
I feel happy reading that, people often embrace the shared history and really try to immerse themselves in the culture but they get overshadowed in the media by the lesser educated people going for quick construction cash
In Sarajevo, the attitude towards the people from the Sandzak region (part of Serbia with a significant Bosniak population) is that they are less cultured, more conservative, that they all dream of moving to the Bosnian capital and they all help each other when they get there
For example, there's an old joke that the road from Novi Pazar to Sarajevo is the longest one-way road in the world
From what I've heard, people in Zagreb have a similar attitude towards Herzegovinians
While Bosnians do occasionally jokes
about Herzegovinians, they're in no way looked down upon
>coupled with specifically northern Croatian stereotypes (cold, introverted, stingy, arrogant etc)
Wow seriously, there's that stereotype for the northern Croatia
A good chunk of my family is from the north (Zagorje and Podravina)
When I visited them I was amazed by how literally everyone seems to have a vineyard and drink all the damn time starting from breakfast, hard to be introverted in that environment
I think it was my grandmother who mentioned to me that back in the days even as little kids they would get a glass of wine before school in winter so they feel a bit warmer
That's kinda a lot to drive
Oh boy, you're in for a treat
We have **domestic** medieval monarchs with two variations of the same name
This is to a large extent the consequence of nationalism in the region
Ethnic identity of medieval residents of Bosnia and the demographics of the place are a highly contentious topic
How does this translate into regnal names ? Bosnia had a lot of Steves on the throne
Stephen is a Greek name with different variations in different languages
Our royal Steves are either Stjepan or Stefan depending on who you ask
These Steves are long dead but you can read their names on medieval charters or coinage to make sense of what they would have called themselves in their own language (the name of the language would be another contentious topic)
I was hoping for a similar answer :)
Well thanks it's nice to hear that from tourists
It is still bouncing back I live here and the city is constantly getting bigger and more beautiful
[Indexi - Bacila Je Sve Niz Rijeku] is probably one of the best songs ever written here
The lead singer awaited a child with his girlfriend but without  telling him she had an abortion and moved out of the country
He never saw her again
This song is about her and most of the songs have a trace of her inside
The most popular bands are Bijelo Dugme,Divlje Jagode and so on but Indexi are the best(at least in my opinion)
I really dont know what genre they are
Sounds like an amalgamation of every genre possible
But i did completely forget about them thats why i said Bijelo Dugme was the most popular since they were in Ex Yu Rock terms
Completely forgot that Dubioza has a strong international audience
I think theres one worse than him
Hmm
maybe the one about the murder of Dženan Memić
In Gymnasium is a little bit of everything, depending on a year
Starting from antic Greece literature like Illiada and then it follows historical progress, but not strictly
In between there are books from Bosnian authors
Almost every big literature piece is mentioned and read
We read Tolstoy, Dostojevsky, Shakespeare, Goethe, Molier, Hugo, Kafka, Dante, Sofoklo, Krleža, Zola, Jesenjin, Servantes
When we want to say  no way not happening we sometimes use malo Morgen
Inside Austria maybe, but I'd guess a couple Falco songs might me alot more famous
On that point I wonder why none of the Italians have mentioned 'The four seasons" by Vivaldi, I'd guess a great percentage of people at least would have heard parts of that
Probably nothing,i mean they can't even bulit proper roads and hospitals,don't think they would care
No, it would be very weird
Really
It would be strange here if it wasn't family, quick pull and two taps on the back is the common way between male friends
That's normal here too
I'm from Sarajevo, during my studies I've met plenty of people from all over the country, none of them kissed each other on the cheek
We don't have it here
We had McDonald's for some time, but they closed it
It had worse food then the places we already had and it was more expensive
We dont have it here
I would like to try it, but I doubt I would ever eat more than once there
We used to have a massive stray dog problem 5-7 years ago when they passed a law that banned removing them from streets and putting them to sleep so the country was stuck in a vacuum of having to build many shelters in a short time whilst having stray dog attacks on a daily basis
Nowadays it works well and you rarely see them in public, there are stray cats too but they don't cause problems and are friendly most of the time
Germany
Reason videogames
Switzerland
better economy,safe place,nice quiet life
We don't really have that problem here,yes; a lot of institutions are in Sarajevo but, because we're a fucked up country , pretty much every other big city has some form of government HQ
Oh damn so many bad memories from that shit, it's still in programmes here
>We don’t need to justify our right to bear guns, **it’s god given**,
And Gods name is Con Stit Ution, apparently
Sounds really interesting
Brilliant idea
One thing I find bothersome with Swedish is that the most common things are sometimes called the same
For example, leg and bone are both called "ben", six and sex are also both called "sex".
I agree, most of the time it's easy to infer from the context, other languages have this as well
I still feel that "ben" is used for two things that are easily confused
Working in biology, we often have to make it clear which one we we are talking about with the help of English words
I went shopping once
While still browsing I was asked how many pieces of an item I wanted to buy, at which I shouted "jag vill ha sex
" across the store
People turned around
Since then, I always make sure to say "jag vill ha sex stycken", or buy five or seven items :)
Yes, of course you can specify it more or use scientific names
It would just be handy to be able to use one word to refer to several types of bones without having to list all the specific names not to confuse it with legs
Also, "ben", both singular and plural
Well um
2nd Balkans scenario
I wouldn't mind Montenegro though
INb4 Montenegro merges with Albania and everyone is shocked
Thought the same about serbian
Not my country, but region
When you enter Bosnia, all logic disappears
I have the feeling that our number system is pretty consistent
1 jedan 2 dva 3 tri 4 četiri 5 pet 6 šest 7 sedam 8 osam 9 devet 10 deset
From 11 to 19 you use a basic number plus the ending -naest
Example 15 is *petnaest*
20 is dvadeset (two ten) 30 trideset (three ten) 40, 50, 60
you get the point
78 is sedamdeset i osam ( seven ten and eight)
99 devedeset i devet ( nine ten and nine)
We have some minor rules for writting
For example the number 90 is written devedeset not deve**t**deset
It is easier to pronounce, that's why
40 is četrdeset ( basic 4 is četiri
Easier to pronounce again)
100 is sto, 1000 is hiljadu (tisuću)
Just one thing for the German system: Learning numbers in German was always fun
It happens rarely now that I mix up the numbers like it was before but I still have that feeling that it is wrong and unnatural for me

Don’t let the Balkans answer this one
It’s honestly very annoying, and makes all of us look bad
Agreed, especially when some people think they “saved” some people
No, they’re all trash
Early 1900s. Period of Austrian rule
Would love to see the transition from an Ottoman wasteland to a pretty formidable European country
That makes two of us
Bosnia Mitteleuropa
Really
I’ve never been to a Croatian friends home and saw another guest wearing shoes
I thought it was expected that you remove your shoes everywhere in the Balkans
They wouldn’t get dusty if they didn’t bring in dirt with their shoes lol
Serbia and Montenegro
Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia and Montenegro in general
The most popular ones in Bosnian would be:
boli me kurac (my dick hurts) very informal and rude but still used a lot
One possible alternative is "boli me uho" (my ear hurts)
Jebe mi se za to (I want to fuck because of that or I am not really interested in that so I would likely fuck something instead) Now I am really struggling to translate this
It looses the entire meaning when translated
Nije me briga (I don't care)
We don't have Russians visiting, but the CHINESE
I mean they're pretty chill they just take a few pictures here and there

yeah I mean when you want to eradicate all slavs the only country left standing should be the only one thats named after the slavs
Greater Serbia coming soon
After this, the Serbian regime will have 3 countries under control by puppet politicians in them
He is still president until 2022 or 2023 afaik and current parliament seats are 41-40 in favour of opposition
He will try to buy someone definitely let's see if opposition sticks to its preelection stands of not going to coalition with dps
People here apparently don't understand some things
Neither he was dictatorship nor he's out
He is still a president of Montenegro and there is still a chance that his party gets the most power in the government
It depends upon the vote of one party
The pro-Serbian opposition won
How
Because it supports Serbian Orthodox Church and Milo advocates for the equality of all religions in Montenegro since different ethnic groups live in Montenegro
That's basically the only reason why opposition won
The OP is Serbian btw
An anti-milo, opposition party
Get a grip man, he lost
Why are you so salty
It took only one day for the first attacks on non-Serbs
In the town of Pljevlja, Bosniaks came under physical assault, ending up in the ER
and how the people who brought it there would be capable of even using that thing or ever have the intention too
its so obviously symbolic, but still disturbing
I'm really happy for Biden as he was much better choice for my country than Trump, probably the best possible president of the USA when it comes to Bosnia in general
I didn't say he will remove the Dayton as it guarantees the peace and disfunctionality of the country to its core, but he will definetly support B&H more than previous presidents of the USA and as president of the USA it's not that he can't do anything, especially if democrats win the majority in Congress
There is a document where it stands what what he will do with Bosnia in case he wins
Yea
But people in Bosnia chose nationalism over prospect, so I think we kind of deserved to be fucked up
All these years people thought it was the Queen, turns out it was the Bean
Is anyone going to mention Bosnia as the most south and most forest cover
I'm Bosnian, I live next to a small wooded area

So cool and cozy
Can confirm city surrounded by forests and live next on one
Something to be proud of
Wooo

It's definitely not more mangled than our political system so yeah

I don't get it really, how could you have so large gatherings without any consequences
And the reason is we might use it to our own benefit eventually, so better just sit back
As a muslim, I adamantly disliked those comics, and as a muslim, I despise that the monsters who committed that attack dare call themselves righteous followers of the Kur’an
They’re nothing but murderers and bullies, and I hate them more than I will ever hate any bigot
No one deserves to die for their beliefs, as long as they don’t transition into something violent or oppressive
this was nothing more but a provocation against the muslim populace in order to prove how sensitive we are
i'm not saying they deserved it, but they got the reaction they demanded
both sides are at fault here
That's 470m euros, what the fuck

Ćejf is a word almost impossible up translate properly, to English at least
My home town, in spring that spot is even more beautiful
Hi from Sarajevo
Lot's of love
Lijepa kasaba
I disagree about the food though
There aren’t many local dishes I’d actually recommend to someone
Though if you were to look right from here, you’d see a somewhat normal city skyline with higher buildings
This is the far north edge of the city (the oldest part)
It feels that way because it is
For a good chunk the city is less than 1km wide, but it's more than 10km long
It's terrible
In the Balkans, we still ride on the Roman roads

Meanwhile a Croat was fined 25€ for wearing a Croatian jersey the morning after the finals, in the Republic of Srpska entity in Bosnia and Herzegovina
He was traveling south to the sea and stopped for coffee and somebody called the cops on him

And so much this
I'm sad a lot of the former Eastern Bloc countries can't relate with Yugoslavia but the buildings made in the 50s and 60s are probably the best when it comes to quality, not being able to hear your neighbours ever as well as location, most of them are close to the city making them desirable and highly appraised even if they have rundown facades which correlates to safe neighbourhoods full of quality content
And they planted a lot of trees here too
US has 8 times more people killed by police per capita than Finland ,first European country (except Luxembourg, that has 1 person killed but due to small population seems larger, still smaller than the US though)
Police brutality is much smaller problem in EU than in the US
It seems the most of the demands by protestors (at least to me) are around ways to end police brutality, especially against black people
What would be demands in a European country
Not hugely popular but exists here too
Looks similar too
Accurate
Imagine being from a country so right wing where authoritarian conservatives aren’t far right

Dobri ljudi sa Balkana mogu raditi dobre stvari
Ovi stariji kojima je rat i konflikt sve u zivotu su razlog zasto se "mrzimo".
I saw an advertisement in ***Srebrenica*** that said "Srebrenica for Vucic". I mean vote for who you want, but it's another level of being disrespectful
It's weird to see our neighbours more in the news about corruption and protests then ourselves
For once Bosnia seems like the sane part of ex-Yugoslavia
I think BALKAN is becoming America and I dont like that
DRZI TE SE BRACO SRBI <3
Bosnia doing its part too
Nice
Happy indepence day from Sarajevo
Same, it doesn’t look real at all
Make a longer bus stop so everyone's FINe
This rent-free complex is pathetic
Mate in Bosnia it's a massage just to go to the store
I visited Moldova,Bosnia-Herzegovina,Republika Sprska(Serb Republic of Bosnia), Georgia,Azerbaijan, Russia,Ukraine and Kosovo
I saw so much hate for gay people in these countries
They are extremely homophobic
Based eastern Europe, we have better things to do than complain about same sex marriages
The Prime Minister of Serbia is a weak puppet
The homophobic president(a dictator ike Orban and Erdogan) rule the country
This will not happen
Vucic and his supporters are extremely homophobic
Bruh, Istanbul is one of the most beautiful cities in the Europe, if not the most
"fart on your dick" jesus bro you killed him lmfao ;DD
For all the EU4 people, he was just sending a scornful insult to get an alliance with rivals
No other reason
It sounds weak compared to the comments they make towards each other lol

Wow
rude
Off topic, but is a mustache mandatory to hold political office in Turkey
what kind of stupid irrelevant comment is that
wtf Lithuania from nuclear to fossil fuels to renewables in 10 years
I guessed something like that happened, it just looks unusal on the graph
The Croatians are planing to throw that shit into our country :(
Yes and since its only one plant, holding all of its waste can be done in the power plant itself, so its not a problem
Turkey loooooves *Turkey* lol
Croatia is not that obese they just have Jacques upping the average

Yeah, this is definitely not propaganda and completely unbiased
Fact: it is VERY easy to get lost in Venice so, please stay with your guide
Next is Bosnia
Absolutely horrible
Genital mutilation should be stopped and only go through if the kid in question grows up and wants to (which I don't know why they would)
Bosnia casually strolling by
It is a pleasure to be with Austria and Germany in something, at least
Well we blame Google, not the government
Serbia isnt EU
In Bosnia we have three main - tax funded* TV stations: BHRT (for the whole country, but is under political influence from the Federation), FTV (for the entity of the Federation) and RTRS (for the entity of Republika Srpska)
When something happens that's anti Serbian or anti goverment of the entity Srpska, it gets coverage on FTV and BHRT (which usually include both sides) and it gets buried in the RTRS chanel or gets the "they hate us, it's always our fault" treatment
If somethings negative about Bosniaks or Croats, it is going to get blown out of proportion on RTRS with whole day coverage, "expert" panel, comments from the ruling and opposition party members; it gets some coverage on FTV and a some on BHRT
*Tax funded- currently the TV and radio tax is collected via the electricity monthly bill, but people can just write a bank order excluding the tax and pay their bills
So sad
The Yugoslav passport was once the most coveted, letting you in virtually everywhere
It should be around 110 but this list is probably excluding visa on arrival
Of course, their liberation was only, ya know, followed by the subsequent raping of MANY prisoners and continued genocide and persecution of all kinds of peoples
It’s easy to say they were “liberated” by the “good guys,” but it’s hard to admit that life isn’t as black and white

that's shitty to clean
In Bosnia we never leave

Man, it will take years for us to join
Fucking Russia loving and anti UN Serbs in here, and fucking corruption
Let us in, let us in
Well to be honest (in my opinion) it would not take a long time to make us economically stable
We are starting to get rid a bit by bit of corruption in federation entity and I am hopeful that we are going to get there in 5ish years
On the other hand, keeping us economically f**ked is because people here are too stubborn and want to keep other entity (republic one) artificially alive
Federation pays almost 65% of total taxes, while RS pays other 35%. When money is divided RS gets 49%.
Leaving out fact that we had war in 90s here, and people in RS considering their home country Serbia,  imagine this situation back in days with Germany
Well, if we are being honest, Europe wanted to close outward border with Russia, so Greece and all other countries form a whole
I think that is the reason why EU gave you and Romania "some slack" with requirements to join
Man you said it better than anyone I have heard that tried to explain it
Well, we had election in November
Most of the parties that where ruling for past 20 years in capital city of Sarajevo where overthrown
That along with Drasko being elected as mayor of Banja Luka made a huge impact and shake-up on political scene
As far as Drasko goes he made huge news for couple of days as being "refreshment" on the political scene
Young, ambitious, wants to move forward, he was seen as someone who can make 2 entities work together and get this country somewhere
Then
then he went old nationalist route as did his successor
Not only that, but refuses to move forward with the "Serbian ideology" in Bosnia
Still considers himself only Serb, not in any part Bosnian
Is against joining NATO, openly anti-gay, made a lot of the statements that crumbled all of the hype that was built around him and shakeups in Sarajevo, to make this transition into EU country at faster pace
So basically, it was yet again, another political game
> Also, what does anti UN mean
Is it because they wanna be in Serbia or
I messed up here, I wanted to say "anti Nato", well according to your flair you should know why, but for other people reading this here is brief summary:
In war in 90's Serba was bombed for 50ish days by Nato, in order stop advancement of war, as peace treaty was going around that time
Serbs refused, so Nato bombed them
In my opinion this is pure hypocrisy, as my home town was bombed by Serbians for 1400- some days
Yet, still we live in same country as they do
I just looked it up (I was not aware of this) and fuck me if I don't learn every day what we are missing ...
Nope, I totally understand what is happening with EU and criteria for entry being upped
It's a shame really people here refuse to split with RS entity for sake of "keeping medieval borders and our heritage". I am sure EU would be a piece of cake if that ever happens to us
In federation have such an good decentralised and diverse political climate
Man, I am hopefully its getting to the Austrian level of diversity in next 4 years
Coalition of 4 parties on left won local elections, 3 that ruled are in minority on right
Young and educated people came to political scene
Transparency laws are hitting left and right
We are getting there, I am sure in coming years
But RS,  can't do shit when they never went away from their totalitarian and nationalistic ideologies
Hmm, I see you are down-voted everywhere, but I just think you are missing some info about us
We are in numbers quite small country, there is only like 2
5m of us at current time (which let's face it is just a normal town anywhere in Europe, and not even big town that is)
But, we are fucking rich in resources
We don't have economy to harvest those resources, but being in EU would allow foreign investors to come in and basically built shit they want and earn their money back
We have a lot of great great mountains for winter sports, and also a lot of nature reserves too (springs, parks, forests)
EU is already looking at renewable sources for electricity, and being as small as we are, we are exporting much more of electricity than we need at current pace
Building more of them would pose no issue for someone who is looking to invest and earn their money worth pretty fast
Land is awesome for agriculture as well
It is already semi-automated, and you can literally grow anything except exotic fruits here (if you go from the north where we usually get melons from, to south where you get oranges and olives from)
We have so many springs with fresh clean water, literally if you dig less than 4m under any place you will find it
Testimony to that is that Coca cola has regional factory for its products here
Ores and wood are also everywhere
&nbsp;
I mean it is all here
And I don't think that we are going to contribute anywhere near if we join at current moment
But with right investments and game plan, literally both BiH and EU can benefit mutually
> So, Dodik the second
Something like that ...
> what about the sarajevo guy/gal
what are they about
Hmm, quite some stuff here as well
Ruling party (SDA) has been overthrown after 20 fucking years with coalition of 4 other parties (NiP, SDP, NS, IS)
Hip fucking hooray
The only downside to this is that some people digress that party called NIP is made of people who left the one overthrown (SDA) and that is a bad thing
Imo, I don't trust them as well, but I don't give a shit, as they alone don't have majority of seats, and can't do anything on their own
But, when they had (this group of parties) majority in parliament briefly (before some SDA butt licking parties betrayed agreement) they did shit TON of good stuff
Most notably, they made everything transparent as it can get in that short amount of time
Would do a lot of good stuff I am sure of it, but their majority fell apart quickly and were unable to implement it
I have high hopes these younger and more educated bunch is going to do a lot of good stuff
Also, since now all of the power is not in hands of single party, we don't have that totalitarianism, so I am certain this if awesome thing that happened
But, time will tell
I like how always Bosnia is missing in these kind of Statistics
I mean there is nothing to measure anyway
They didn't actually, many roads were built and some of the richer Romans enjoyed the sunny Herzegovina
Many modern cities were founded on Roman ruins (Bugojno, Blagaj, Stolac, even Banja Luka), our country wasn't very lucky throughout history, each time a new country/empire took over B&H, they ended up demolishing what was left of the former one

Grow up and stop role-playing as political entities, its creepy
No one should respect this if he's one of the terrorist groups who killed thousands of Turkic people but if he's a regular Greek citizen or soldier who did nothing wrong then it's fine
OP never said that who this dead guy is
You can stand for war being bad, not good
People die because of war
(on all sides) But no one can defend a terrorist who killed "humans". Just because he's Greek and the other side is Turkish
Be human
Turks and Greeks tried to live together but that didn't go so well
Because Greek fanatics got crazy and started killing Turkish people in Cyprus
Turkey did what it has to do and it's not called independence war in Turkey
It's called Cyprus Peace Operation
My grandparents (Balkan Turks) escaped from WW2 and started living in Cyprus back in 40's. My uncle (4) was killed by Greeks in 1971
Then they returned to our homeland, Bosnia
As a Turk who lives in Bosnia and Herzegovina
I'm sad for innocent people(Greek and Turk) who has died in Turkish Invasion/Peace Operation of Cyprus
Just don't be racist
That's all i want
r/europe members should be non-racist enough to upvote if this was a Turkish old man crying over his dead son, right guys

Dude, you can't use word fascism that easily for everything
Today marks 22 years since the Srebrenica genocide, the worst crime on European soil since the Holocaust
Lest we forget
I was born in Canada
When I first visited Bosnia with my family, I was a young boy, maybe 10 or 11
I saw posters for the remembrance of the Srebrenica genocide and never knew what anyone was talking about, only that my dad would tell me to keep quiet every time I asked
I had no idea until years later in my life what a tragedy had taken place, one that almost robbed me of the family I have today
Cherish everyone you love deeply, and do not participate in such ignorant hatred as characteristic of this war
May all the innocent lives lost rest in peace
There are people here, on this subreddit, that downplay, justify, or outright celebrate these things
Just saying
It's one reason that I dread seeing anything about Bosnia here
So, today, let us nominally pay our respects for the dead
The *provocateurs* will continue posting their bullshit unabashedly
And the next time the Bosnian NT goes to Greece or Romania -- "civilized Europe" -- they will be met by flags and banners celebrating Srebrenica
they like to show solidarity with their Orthodox brothers
And all of the arms and volunteers, from your civilized countries, that curiously found themselves participating in siege and slaughter, against largely unarmed civilians -- I hope (I know) they sleep soundly at night
Unfortunately, for some of us, this day signifies the loss of completely innocent people, family members, that no longer exist because
some reason
Shit, even this thread currently is mostly filled with people proclaiming that it wasn't *that big of a deal*. Some French dude is talking about Soviet gulags and the Croats are talking about Bleiburg (as they are wont to do)
And I suspect things will only go further down hill
All of this
it's insulting
We don't need your fake solidarity, anyway
Take your EU and stick it up its own ass
> First using the term 'Serbia' and not the 'Serb government and/or military of the 90s' is actually branding the whole nation as killers and terrorists
Yeah mate, but I doubt anyone means the entire nation of Serbia when saying that here
They probably mean the government/the men who did the atrocities, and I doubt people will specify 'the government of Serbia' or whatever, since it's much easier just to say 'Serbia' (while actually thinking the right thing)
> Drawing comparison to ISIS is especially distrurbing and sick, especially if you consider that 99% of the people didn't know what was happening on the front lines, as each republic was spewing hate and concealing all information which would tell its citizens what's actually happening
It was always the other sides fault
What happened in Srebrenica is definitely comparable to ISIS, maybe even worse, but I am not very familiarized with what ISIS is doing right now to comment on that
The second part I can't provide an opinion, since I wasn't alive back then, but I'd imagine you're probably right that everyone is feeding propaganda to their own country
> All 3 government sides in the war benefited hugely from prolonging the war, and was disregarding any human casualties or impacts as long as it helped their interest
Which 3 sides
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia
First of all, I think you can't put Bosnia in there because I doubt there wasuxh profit from us, considering that Serbia was much better equipped than us
I also don't think that Croatia or Slovenia would profit from prolonging the war (perhaps attempting to gain more land
), but I don't know much about that, there are probably some Croats or Slovenians here to comment on that
Serbia also didn't profit from having 3 wars simultaneously, but it was in their interest to keep Yugoslavia together and stop the republics from gaining independence
I'm surprised you never heard of it
It's almost the only thing the average European knows about Bosnia and Herzegovina
Couldnt have said it better mysef, bravo
Sorry
I generally avoid threads about Bosnia because they're filled with propaganda bullshit
I guess I had to make an exception today
I consider myself pro-EU, and even the eventual admittance of Bosnia, but I don't like that people pretend that the Croats and Serbs were killing people in a vacuum
There was a support structure, and volunteers from various countries that also "helped out". Many of these countries are in the (so-called progressive) EU now, and it makes me salty thinking about it
Sorry, again

Isnt this a bit like calling Adolf Hitler "the conqueror of the jews"
I mean he did also do genocides
Definitely rakija
Or, like, a HV soldier giving water to a Serb or Bosniak
Yes, what happened at the very end of the war erases everything that happened in the previous 5 years
I know, you're not allowed to talk about Croatian war crimes among westerners
Or Bosnian war crimes
Especially on reddit
Everyone gets uncomfortable when their idea of evil Serb hordes genociding everyone gets challenged
Ahh I see Bosnia has none
If any Scot or Englishman can help with this qustion
Is Scotish independence likely and is there an actual plan (unlike Brexit) for the seperation from separatist parties
It seems like massive pain to divide England and Scotland due to all the shared institutions and markets they have had for decades
And at this point the only benefit Scotland would have is re-joining the EU but that would take years and it seems dumb to divide Scotland from the strong English economy and the benefits of the pound
Good job guys, Bosnians applaud you

I have been wondering about something lately
When the Molotov-Ribentrop thing went down, and the Soviets were invading Poland, Finland etc
Why did the Allies not declare war on the Komies too
No, but I was just wondering what the decision process was in London and Paris in regards to the moves the Soviets were making
Then your google search is wrong
I have a feeling a lot of people on this sub just hate turks so they upvote this shit without even thinking critically
Hey, I've seen this one
I don't really understand this conflict and how everyone is against Azerbaijan and Turkey all out
I am  FAR from a Turkey fan but at this point they are just "claims" no proof yet
So Azerbaijan is in conflict with one of it's regions, alright nothing out of ordinary, no one recognised the region in the world as autonomous
Then Armenia and Azerbaijan accuse each other of shelling mainland territory so that's a wash
I don't really see an obvious "bad guy" here

Gotta give it to Croats for their successful Central Europe campaign even though most of Dalmatia is Balkan af
Dalmatia should be south-eastern europe
I know that cuts Croatia in two but it makes a bit more sense
Only thing Slavonia and central Croatia have going for them to be Central Europe is being flat and having Hungarian architecture, so does north B&H (Posavina and Semberija) yet we don't panically try to push those parts into Central Europe just because we're ashamed of geographically being SE Europe and on the Balkan peninsula

What the fuck did jewish community did this time

At least with French and Armenians they can at least pretend they have cause (however fucked up it is), Jews are just punching bags for whenever things go wrong
No wonder Israel is being an asshole to everyone, this shit is happening to them for centuries
Communist (well socialist in our case) housing (especially from the 50s and 60s) is considered top level building in Bosnia and Herzegovina, buildings with thick brick/concrete walls where you don't hear your neighbors at any time, no matter how loud they are
It's always funny to see how some other Eastern countries bash those buildings and how different an experience can be

"Jebat ću ti prvi red na sahrani" (I'll fuck the entire first row at your funeral)
"Bog te jebo" is my favourite
These are not actual translations, these are what we call "beforewaters". It's intentionaly bad literal translation
Like for instance, mountain Kopaonik got it's name from mines and the name means "mining place", but a beforewater version is "Nick was digging", and you get that by separating the word into Kopao and Nik
Nik=Nick, kopao=was digging
Even the word beforewater is a bad translation of the word "prevodi" (which means translations in Serbian), where the original word is separated into pre=before and vodi=water

Here's the thing with this bill
It helps creators and companies but hurts regular people
Internet shouldn't be regulated because you can't regulate it, you can only make people look for VPNs and shit
The Parliament shouldn't prioritize creators over the people, this law will be abused by the companies like Disney that have the power (and the will) to sue anyone and everything

How is EU "ruling" the countries when the member states control the EU ? How is this bill a proof that EU controls member states if member states all agreed on this ?

Wait WHAT the highest temperature in Bosnia was recorded in 1901
WTF
Well Bosnia and Herzegovina is a fairly hot country, cities in Herzegovina have had the Mediterranean climate for decades, cities like Mostar and Čapljina reach 40 degrees every summer for at least a few days, they average 50 tropical nights per year (temperature not going under 20° at night) so it's not a big surprise
I am just happy we aren't last
Eastern Europeans are magicians when it comes to driving new cars and travelling
A lot of people freelance or work illegally without contracts
For instance I know that a lot of people in IT industry where I work report salaries of 300-400€ gerting the low taxes and some 1000-1500 as we would say "in an envelope". The police here in B&H arrested some guys recently and the trials are yet to begin
Same thing applies for waiters, some private doctors, sports workers, freelancers
Edit: Obviously they earn less money but the point is that unemployment and earnings aren't as bad as they seem, some low class people double shift, collect mushrooms, clean houses or repair bikes to make the cut
Bills and rent are usually around 200-300€ for those people, often in bad neighborhoods
Owning an apartment makes it so much easier for them, one would never guess their income
Accomodation is not that much expensive when going to big cities
Obviously if I wanted an apartment by some swiss lake it would be much more expensive
Food is pretty much similarly priced, a lot of countries have discount stores like Lidl or Aldi, and as for eating out, I guess people do it in cheap in midrange places mostly, the poorer ones may just opt for one or two visits to shopping centres or cook at their apartment
Hvala brother
Agree except for rental house or apartment
I can't either and I don't live around the poverty line
Nor do I care for buying a house
And most people above the poverty line usually don't have a mortgage either
Yes, and later on in life I met lots of British people and most of my TV intake consists of panel shows

Belgrade
You start outside the city in the villages surround the city, and move up to the part of town on the left side of the Danube river in the poorer commie block neighborhoods
Eventually the eastern half of the city opens up and you can cross the bridges to the other parts of town where you get to do more missions
Eventually you get your own villa in the southern part of the city
For a change of scenery there's a mountain nearby overlooking the city for some cool side missions
There's corruption in the municipality, projects get started by dubious individuals or organizations, rich foreign companies want a peace of the pie, there's neverending parties as a source of income and the pop music industry is held by the balls by the mob hiring out the female singers as whores
It's capitalism without oversight on steroids, and criminal behavior isn't punished by the powers that be, they in fact take part in it

Dutch are not blunt, they're honest
What are the countries you're thinking about
Any prerequisites
I always assumed the word to have a negative connotation
But still, it's not like the Dutch are blunt in a simple sense
For example: if someone goes out shopping for clothes and is trying on something and it doesn't look good
When asking the store clerk for an opinion, the store clerk won't say "it looks ugly", but it'd be something like "maybe try something different than that" or "how about something that fits you more".
It's still direct, but not blunt
Hence why I'm saying the Dutch are honest, not blunt
I'd say the Scottish or English are more blunt than the Dutch
But not downright honest (at first)
Friend to friend however would say it's ugly, but I don't see that to be different in other countries
I'm not Dutch myself and within my family or non-Dutch friends, people can be blunt with each other
That's so overblown
Most people around the world form queues

The first year was nice, I learned about travelling and being social with strangers
I gathered a group of solo-travellers and we made our own little spot of tents at the camp site
The next year I teamed up with a few people who went last year and again had a great time volunteering and enjoying the festival
We booked an apartment this time
I also made sure to have the trip be a bit different by flying to a different city before going to the festival to explore, and likewise when flying back
So I went a third year, and again planned different things before and after the festival
I flew to Ljubljana and spent a day and a half there
The weather was nice and I enjoyed myself
I then left for the festival but when I arrived the weather turned really sour
I also decided to camp in a tent again this year, but that was a huge mistake
There were a few small parties the night before the festival started, I remember eating a hamburger
Next day I felt sick, but still okay
I thought I got better and with some friends drove to a supermarket in the neighboring city
At the parking lot I puked, and afterwards felt okay
I thought I got it out of my system
We did our shopping and when we drove back I asked to be dropped off near the city centre so I could do some exploring and take photos
Felt normal, and I took a bus back to the festival site
On the outskirts I felt dizzy, my vision went blurry and I heard this whizzing sound in my ears, so I got off the bus again
I sat down and the feeling subsided a bit
Then felt sick again and walked to some bushes, and puked again
Some festivalgoers noticed when I walked back to the busstop and gave me some water
The bus arrived and I got back to the festival without any problems
Next day, still felt sick, and had to go the toilet pretty much every hour
Went to the medical tent and they told me I contracted some bacteria, and I heard from them and from other people lots of people at the festival somehow got it
At the same time it was raining and thundering so much the organization turned everything off for a moment out of safety
So even if I wanted to enjoy myself in the little moments I didn't feel sick, I couldn't. The doctor told me to to eat only certain types of food, not drink alcohol and I didn't, so even in those small moments of good weather and no sick feelings I kind of felt bored
I could only enjoy myself with potatoes and water
No sugary stuff so no soft drinks or fruit, and no food with sauces
But it kept on raining and thundering pretty much the entire week of the festival, which lasts 7 days
I even heard there were floods in the country and in Bosnia
Most of the time I was in my tent watching movies on my phone, and my friends in the tents around me as well
I only went out to go to the toilet, which was most of the day and in the night because I couldn't sleep
Eventually after the festival we drove back to Zagreb
Two of our group lived there and a third one went to the busstation
I went to a hostel because when I planned the trip, I wanted to explore zagreb for a day and a half
But first a shower and again a visit to the toilet
I felt kind of crappy but okay enough to explore rain drenched Zagreb and it's mostly empty streets
Later during the evening I felt okay and could eat normally again, had some good cevape and drank beers in the hostel while chilling with my laptop
Next day I woke up early to explore again for a few hours before taking the bus back home
While hopping on the bus I realized "wow I feel completely healed
I can finally explore and do fun things
" while watching Zagreb's pretty sunny streets waving me goodbye
They go quite slow
Aren't tons always metric
Honestly, what French food besides baguettes and some cheeses is popular in the Netherlands
I literally do not know any  of their dishes
And Switzerland
Germany is paying all the expenses for all the countries whose patients they hosted
I like raves but Ibiza, Mallorca etc
seem to offer music I don't like
I don't care for house and dance
I much prefer to go to a festival with a varied and more alternative line-up and then explore any big city nearby
Sziget offers great bands and dance music like drum n bass and techno + Budapest is just gorgeous
I planned to go to Exit this year for similar reasons
I'm sure there's places like that in Ibiza etc
but the overall vibe and image puts seems to tell different and it puts me off
Bali doesn't seem interesting to me as well, but for other reasons
If I were to go to Southeast Asia or Indonesia, I'd much rather visit  a big city and the nature around it
I wanna see bustling cities with their old city centre, temples and nature
I'm not sure if Bali offers that

I would argue that nepotism is a form of corruption
I recently moved back to Utrecht
It's the 4th largest city in the Netherlands but not big when compared to other cities in Europe
But it has everything I need
Dutch supermarket chains and lots of Turkish shops are a 5 min bike ride away
The office I work in (pre-corona) is 10 min away, the city centre 15 min
I love concerts and festivals and even during corona there are concerts in one of the many pop venues the city has
The station is also a 10 min bike ride away, and the train to Schiphol Airport takes 30 min, Amsterdam, The Hague or Rotterdam likewise 30ish min
Hmm, how would that relate to the Renaissance
The Classical Greeks demonstrated the Earth was round
I don't think there is a strict point when it started, it's a period of lots of things
And lots of things happened waaay before the discovery of the Americas
The Abbasid translations of Greek texts were exported to Europe, as well as Greek and Byzantine things after the fall of Constantinople
The Greek influenced ideas of humanism pushed aside religion as the centre of humanity's existence
That paved the way for the gradual and eventual rebirth or reimagining/reexamination of art, philosophy and science in Italy which then spread across Europe
Especially with Gutenberg's innovations
His contributions literally marked the dawn of a new information age
Much like how our present world changed when the internet entered our living rooms
For all the knowledge the scientists and scholars gained, spreading it made it actually useful and practical so it could transform society in an actual sense
It's probably similar to Alpina in the Balkans
It translates
I'm sure I don't have this enabled
English
But there were games in a certain setting I wish had native language
For example the Metro games have English spoken with a Russian accent, and Assassin's Creed Odyssey has tons of languages but no Greek
In English, the voice actors speak it with a heavy Greek accent
I don't get why we need accented English instead of proper native
Well you have internet
The games are very well known
We have, but no a lot
There are exceptions like Frankfurt, Warsaw, Istanbul, Moscow and Milan
Nowadays they are built in new business districts instead of in city centres
As for why not as many
There was no need and rules and regulations related to preserving the historical look and feel of old city centres prevented it
Like what words
Ah yes, I get that
We all have some unique words but I always assumed there's more unique words in Croatia and more shared between Bosnia and Serbia
We also say hjleb with the j. But I didn't know you guys say pasulj instead of grah
Those are clean and maintained
Netherlands:
Utrecht
It's in the centre of the country, so it's very well connected with highways, railways and waterways
Schiphol Airport is a 30min train ride
It's also a cultural powerhouse within the country and liberal so open to newcomers
Bosnia:
Tuzla
It's near the Croatian and Serbian borders and eventually it could get connected with highways (hurry up please)
It's also multicultural and liberal like Sarajevo so it should be a good fit
Bosnia, Albania, Serbia and the European part of Turkey have lots of parts with only mosques
And Greece didn't have an aristocracy
No they're not
Either Gelsenkirchen or Zenica
I always thought it was a town of 30
000 or so people
But it's actually a city of 230
000
So big and so empty
It's sad, but I think they will rebuild the wooden parts of the cathedral

The secret is either vegeta or meat juices
Especially the Gent based Eefje de Visser

I don't understand the love for croissants

Flaky bits of thin dough that hardly have any taste and are not filling
And they make a big mess
Give me a kifla any time over a puny croissant
Only Neum, but it doesn't have lots of history like nearby places such as Dubrovnik, Makarska or Split, so I'd rather visit those
Quite bland generic bands though
Here some indie stuff:
* [Eefje de Visser] singer songwriter with dreamy electronic sounds
Live it's very atmospheric with some great choreography of Eefje and her backup singers
* [Blue Crime] dreamy and noise rockish, always a sonically wild show
* [Pocket Knife Army] electronic with guitar, with some rough edges
Live really great
* [Spill Gold] similar to Pocket Knife Army but more psychedelic
* [Altın Gün] Started by Dutch musicians who wished to play old Turkish rock songs
They found a male Turkish singer in Amsterdam and a female in Istanbul
Really great stuff, a big party live with Dutch and Turkish fans in the front jumping around
* [De Likt] Pretty nice hiphop with an energetic live show
Doesn't feature autotune, mumble rap and other bullshit
* [Donna Blue] a couple obsessed with 60s/70s french pop
Smooth and mellow
* [My Baby] blues and funk
* [Yin Yin] Thaifunk
Pretty nice live shows
Cool
Sounds like Death Grips
yeah she's awesome too
I like this song and clip:
>**great** music
Bosnian here
After it started full on, fights broke out everywhere
> Also we do not agree with the Serbs as they say they were the victims and were chased out of their homes
There were definitely Serb villages getting burned down in Croatia and Bosnia, and their population either ran out or killed
Sadly, all those people died because of irrational hate
Just normal civilians
But the  thing here is that the 3 sides all point to the bad things happened to their people, while not focusing as much on the bad things their side did
So all 3 sides downplay their bad deeds
But the problem here was the amount done by the Serb side, which was significally bigger, sadly
That needs to be accepted, not because of the amount (because it's not a numbers game), but because of the impact
But it's the main topic being either ignored by the Serb side or being pushed too much by the Bosnian and Croatian side in discourse online and offline
But I think it needs to be accepted by the Serb policy makers of then and the ones who downplay it now
Not the civilians, it's not their bone to pick
Otherwise you will get a similar situation like the official Turk position to the Armenian Genocide or the Japanese position towards the atrocities commited in Korea, China and Indonesia
Half a century later and due to it being ignored by their media and educational systems, their new young generations don't know much about it
I am trying to bring this objectively by the way
I have no hate or ill will towards Serbs
Mladic and his gang and Milosevic and his propaganda machine were terrible things
I am left leaning and liberal so those are my morals
I got Serb friends, listen to Serbian bands, have visited Belgrade and I will go to Novi Sad this summer
Walked out of a bar in Croatia when they put on that shithead Thompson
All that stuff
I just fill a mug with espressos
Netherlands also has the good ones like DnB and techno
They are gathering in the balls
Kurds getting their own state leaves a political power vacuum in Syria and Iraq too
It's a very sticky situation

Most people learned by themselves
I had it in 2nd year of high school for just a few lessons
I feel like I know both cultures but at the same time I don't care for or agree with certain aspects in both
I like that actually, it gives me a valuable perspective of both inside and outside
I think both cultures have pros and cons, and it gives you an opportunity to objectively look at the cons
Can be tasty with little spots of cold ketchup here and there
As a Bosnian I think it's pointless too
Just call it all burek with xxxx
And might as well keep the specific names too if people want to use those too
It's normal to own your own washing machine, but at the same time, sharing one seems like a good idea too
I use mine once ever week and a half and wouldn't mind sharing it

Pizza slices are not really a thing in the Netherlands

I thought Chernobyl was merely the name of the power plant itself
So the urban area around the power plant is Chernobyl, and the city in the distance is Pripyat

Here in the Netherlands I have had troubles with Moroccans when I was a kid, but never with Turks
They seem to be well integrated and if not, they never make trouble
Is it really different in Belgium
I understand ethernet cables, modern homes have ports in in the wall in several places/rooms
But why specifically hdmi or speakers
Never heard of that, but I would appreciate hdmi cables in the walls running along the ethernet cables
Right now I have my desk and laptop in the corner of my living room and my TV in the other corner, and I run a hdmi cable behind the sofa and desk to the TV so I can always watch things from my laptop on my TV
But I don't get the speakers
Why do you want audio cables in walls
Ah yes
I live with my parents now, but I will be moving out once I have bought all the stuff for my new apartment
Currently I:
- take the bicycle to the train station (10 min)
- take a train to the city (40 min)
- walk to work (5 min)
When I move, it will be:
- bicycle to work (10 min)

You should visit each capital is my advice
I am Bosnian actually
I try to visit each country and city and make friends
Just to see how life is everywhere
People tend to be the same everywhere, and have the same problems is what I have learned
> even coffee and donuts
Even
But these are the least weird ones, quick snacks and  a drink
I met a Belgian woman in a shared dining area of a bungalow park in Bosnia
She said "wooow" for every little thing the owner told about the area
She came off as either a liar or a little child
I worked as a photographer at a festival where I had to share a bungalow with a duo of other photographers, and 3 dipshits from Noisey (Vice's music arm)
The 3 dipshits were just like that whenever I talked with them
They came off as insincere and prickish
On top of that they trashed the place and there was broken glass everywhere
This was a normal, almost timid indie festival by the way
In cities you also regularly get approached by street sellers, trying to get you to subscribe to a newspaper or some charity
They talk in the exact same way
Insincere and you just feel they are not really saying anything sincerely when they respond to what YOU say
But they do wanna talk THEMSELVES
So to me, this is not American thing
In fact all the Americans I met on my trips were genuine and sincere
Hugs are great
Duuude, have you even been to the US or outside, or do you just watch cheesy movies
We do that in NL too, and in my home country Bosnia
I find eating a donut in a car less weird and easier than say, a hamburger from McDonalds

Turkey is the biggest political player in the Balkans, and the saying goes who wins elections in Istanbul, wins Turkey
So by that logic, Istanbul
But within internal Balkan politics I don't know
No one is a big player
Zagreb, and Athens are in the EU but I feel Belgrade has a larger political footprint
I am Bosnian and I don't mind when people ask me if I am Bosnian, Croatian or Serb
It's a perfectly reasonable and logical question
Putting chips in a doner kebab is strange though
It's overkill
I'm surprised British kebab shops do this
The Dutch kebab shops don't.
Wow what an ignorant moron

Hence 'it can fuck me'.

I can't either and I don't live around the poverty line
Nor do I care for buying a house
And most people above the poverty line usually don't have a mortgage either
Yes, and later on in life I met lots of British people and most of my TV intake consists of panel shows
Now I started to use some British words more
But I talk with an American accent
I still don't understand
You wrote 2 chairs and 3 chairs in English with the same word
How do you say 2 chairs and 3 chairs in Slovenian
Belgrade
You start outside the city in the villages surround the city, and move up to the part of town on the left side of the Danube river in the poorer commie block neighborhoods
Eventually the eastern half of the city opens up and you can cross the bridges to the other parts of town where you get to do more missions
Eventually you get your own villa in the southern part of the city
For a change of scenery there's a mountain nearby overlooking the city for some cool side missions
There's corruption in the municipality, projects get started by dubious individuals or organizations, rich foreign companies want a peace of the pie, there's neverending parties as a source of income and the pop music industry is held by the balls by the mob hiring out the female singers as whores
It's capitalism without oversight on steroids, and criminal behavior isn't punished by the powers that be, they in fact take part in it
What more do you want in a GTA game

Dutch are not blunt, they're honest
What are the countries you're thinking about
Any prerequisites
I always assumed the word to have a negative connotation
But still, it's not like the Dutch are blunt in a simple sense
For example: if someone goes out shopping for clothes and is trying on something and it doesn't look good
When asking the store clerk for an opinion, the store clerk won't say "it looks ugly", but it'd be something like "maybe try something different than that" or "how about something that fits you more".
It's still direct, but not blunt
Hence why I'm saying the Dutch are honest, not blunt
I'd say the Scottish or English are more blunt than the Dutch
But not downright honest (at first)
Friend to friend however would say it's ugly, but I don't see that to be different in other countries
I'm not Dutch myself and within my family or non-Dutch friends, people can be blunt with each other
That's so overblown
Most people around the world form queues
You must be one of the few
No one here in the province of Utrecht seems to care
It exists but the person holding it isn't in the news all that much

But the  thing here is that the 3 sides all point to the bad things happened to their people, while not focusing as much on the bad things their side did
So all 3 sides downplay their bad deeds
But the problem here was the amount done by the Serb side, which was significally bigger, sadly
That needs to be accepted, not because of the amount (because it's not a numbers game), but because of the impact
But it's the main topic being either ignored by the Serb side or being pushed too much by the Bosnian and Croatian side in discourse online and offline
But I think it needs to be accepted by the Serb policy makers of then and the ones who downplay it now
Not the civilians, it's not their bone to pick
Otherwise you will get a similar situation like the official Turk position to the Armenian Genocide or the Japanese position towards the atrocities commited in Korea, China and Indonesia
Half a century later and due to it being ignored by their media and educational systems, their new young generations don't know much about it
I am trying to bring this objectively by the way
I have no hate or ill will towards Serbs
Mladic and his gang and Milosevic and his propaganda machine were terrible things
I am left leaning and liberal so those are my morals
I got Serb friends, listen to Serbian bands, have visited Belgrade and I will go to Novi Sad this summer
Walked out of a bar in Croatia when they put on that shithead Thompson
All that stuff
I just fill a mug with espressos
Netherlands also has the good ones like DnB and techno
They are gathering in the balls
Kurds getting their own state leaves a political power vacuum in Syria and Iraq too
It's a very sticky situation
New poster released for bland superhero movie 2, 3000+ upvotes on /r/movies
And it's utter shit
This week it showed clouds only above the North Sea and here in Utrecht when I looked outside it was cloudy all over
Also shows no rain while it is raining
Just start now
Most people learned by themselves
I had it in 2nd year of high school for just a few lessons
I feel like I know both cultures but at the same time I don't care for or agree with certain aspects in both
I like that actually, it gives me a valuable perspective of both inside and outside
I think both cultures have pros and cons, and it gives you an opportunity to objectively look at the cons
Can be tasty with little spots of cold ketchup here and there
As a Bosnian I think it's pointless too
Just call it all burek with xxxx
And might as well keep the specific names too if people want to use those too
It's normal to own your own washing machine, but at the same time, sharing one seems like a good idea too
I use mine once ever week and a half and wouldn't mind sharing it
But is this the norm in Switzerland for not just people in apartments, but also in houses
In the bathroom
>  Are there any towns or cities **in your country** that sound wrong or funny **in your country**?
Fucking doesn't sound wrong to Austrians
In what way would it prevent annexation by France
I would like to find 1080 rips WITH English subs of Sahsiyet
I have the first season with subs I constantly need to sync
Do you know any good sources
Have you read Stephen Fry's Mythos
That church is probably built on the remains of a Roman forum, not that it has anything Roman in it left
Everything about it looks way too new
Any of these
* kebab
* french fries
* fried snacks from the wall like frikandel, hamburger or kroket
Pizza slices are not really a thing in the Netherlands
Except for maybe in the touristic part of Amsterdam, east of the station
> The city of Chernobyl
I thought Chernobyl was merely the name of the power plant itself
So the urban area around the power plant is Chernobyl, and the city in the distance is Pripyat
I always thought the power plant stood by itself with nothing around it
You really should write out An Post instead of an post to make it clear it's a name of something
I always presumed each country has its own preferred webshop(s)

Where do these questions come from
Here in the Netherlands I have had troubles with Moroccans when I was a kid, but never with Turks
They seem to be well integrated and if not, they never make trouble
Is it really different in Belgium
I understand ethernet cables, modern homes have ports in in the wall in several places/rooms
But why specifically hdmi or speakers
Never heard of that, but I would appreciate hdmi cables in the walls running along the ethernet cables
Right now I have my desk and laptop in the corner of my living room and my TV in the other corner, and I run a hdmi cable behind the sofa and desk to the TV so I can always watch things from my laptop on my TV
But I don't get the speakers
Why do you want audio cables in walls
Ah yes
I live with my parents now, but I will be moving out once I have bought all the stuff for my new apartment
Currently I:
- take the bicycle to the train station (10 min)
- take a train to the city (40 min)
- walk to work (5 min)
When I move, it will be:
- bicycle to work (10 min)
There are plans for every scenario though
Just like in Command and Conquer
One building left
Wait while I surround it with Mammoth Tanks so I can destroy it in 1 second

Poached apple with nut filling and whipped cream on top
Try salep in a Turkish bakery or restaurant
It's similar but in drink form
Warm with a foamy top layer with cinnamon
Translation please
I would try vegetarian cevapcici
Us normal people get along just fine
You should visit each capital is my advice
I am Bosnian actually
I try to visit each country and city and make friends
Just to see how life is everywhere
People tend to be the same everywhere, and have the same problems is what I have learned
> even coffee and donuts
Even
But these are the least weird ones, quick snacks and  a drink
I met a Belgian woman in a shared dining area of a bungalow park in Bosnia
She said "wooow" for every little thing the owner told about the area
She came off as either a liar or a little child
I worked as a photographer at a festival where I had to share a bungalow with a duo of other photographers, and 3 dipshits from Noisey (Vice's music arm)
The 3 dipshits were just like that whenever I talked with them
They came off as insincere and prickish
On top of that they trashed the place and there was broken glass everywhere
This was a normal, almost timid indie festival by the way
In cities you also regularly get approached by street sellers, trying to get you to subscribe to a newspaper or some charity
They talk in the exact same way
Insincere and you just feel they are not really saying anything sincerely when they respond to what YOU say
But they do wanna talk THEMSELVES
So to me, this is not American thing
In fact all the Americans I met on my trips were genuine and sincere
Hugs are great
Duuude, have you even been to the US or outside, or do you just watch cheesy movies
We do that in NL too, and in my home country Bosnia
I find eating a donut in a car less weird and easier than say, a hamburger from McDonalds
Someone tells a sad story:

Gee thanks, stranger
Ugly by itself, no matter where you put it
It's like the Neudeflat of Groningen
Why
A sportsman has waaaaay less impact on the world and the course of a country
I think it's the definition of a national hero
hahaha

And the piece of a branch you use to hit your kids with in Bosnian
Alleen wij spreken het dan uit als proet met een lange oe
Zoals "mood"

Turkey is the biggest political player in the Balkans, and the saying goes who wins elections in Istanbul, wins Turkey
So by that logic, Istanbul
But within internal Balkan politics I don't know
No one is a big player
Zagreb, and Athens are in the EU but I feel Belgrade has a larger political footprint
I am Bosnian and I don't mind when people ask me if I am Bosnian, Croatian or Serb
It's a perfectly reasonable and logical question
Putting chips in a doner kebab is strange though
It's overkill
I'm surprised British kebab shops do this
The Dutch kebab shops don't.
Wow what an ignorant moron
I don't listen to stupid pop musicccc
The type of people who think being into hiphop means uttering niggah probably listen to shit hiphop
I would also believe that group correlates with low/no education and poverty
Jede me briga = the worry eats me/the worry can eat me
Jebe **mi** se = **it** can fuck me
oh I bolded the wrong letters on accident
I mean in my head 'jebe mi se' refers to the thing which you don't care about
Hence 'it can fuck me'.
