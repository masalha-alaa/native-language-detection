Something not so historical, but current: we rank 2nd for the amount of suicides (in Europe)
Basically we do have an extreme left
After ww2 the partisans slaughtered people they suspected were german collaborators (My grandfather was one
He was 16, the germans were promising freedom and they were afraid of communism
Most were simply picked up by the germans
) and people they didn't like and some just for sadistic reasons
People still deny this even after mass graves were uncovered
They deny, say they all deserved it or even say not enough of them were killed
We have "anti-faschist" (I am firmly against our current government but can be a part of these people) protests going on and if you even mention Tito (the Yugoslavian dictator) was a dictator in their online groups they loose their shit
No one gets called out for hate and saying people should be killed and those comments receive a lot of likes
I hate living here right now because I consider myself a leftist, yet I have no place in my country
Just don't ever think people who claim to be liberal, moral, educated
can't use fighting agaist fascism to turn in to fascists themselves
I watched a movie about this as a kid
Still haunts me
Seeing Milky way with bare eyes is no real achievment
I live on the outskirts of a population 20000 town and there is visible light polution on the horizon, but I can easily see the Milky way if I only let my eyes adjust
But real dark sky Milky way is really impressive
I'm so sorry for what's going on in Serbia
Have the protests accomplished anything
>Supposedly their concentration camps were much worse than any Nazi German one
I heard that some germans working in concentration camps came to visit one of the croatian ones and they left early because it was so terrible they couldn't take it
If you have such an old and powerful institution it will of course have a lot of dirt
There were also positive sides and my comment in this thread is about slovenia's disgousting secret, where religious people were the ones under threat
It's not an institution or religion, it's people
Anywhere where there is power and lack of control, shitty people will pop up and do shitty things
Not always, but often
Did they flee to Canada
I have some relatives there  because one of my grandafther's brothers made it out alive
Good luck guys
Serbia has not had it easy
You deserve better
I'm not religious
I just see that same shit happens everywhere and religioin is a scapegoat
Like I wrote in my post to this thread, in my country it was the "liberators" that were yhe bad guys
If we don't realise that horrible practices can happen in any ideology, then bad things are bound to happen
In my country the left think they have such a moral highgroung and religion is so hated by them that they feel they have the right to want to kill them
I'm not talking about giving passes, I'm talking about trying to prevent these things from happening in the future and focusing on the root of the issue
The church was extremely powerful and with that represented the good and bad in european history
It was also clergymen who spoke up against witch trials and slavery
I have Irish friends, I know how problematic the church is in Ireland
I just wish you understood my point
Because as long as people are focused on some organisation as the enemy I only see us going in circles and killing each other
Like I said, I have irish friends, so I know all that
It's not the same everywhere so the generalisations are not fair
I know what a far left can be, yet I understad that when people talk about the far left in the US it's mostly blown way out of proportion
We need to be realistic and critical
The religion hate that is spreading has very diferent effects depending on culture
Well, well, well, I guess there is a way of expanding Piran Bay ...
Sorry Croatia
I like sea
Easy, Croatia
I don't want to destroy any country
It's actually a really hard decision though
IDK
Italy
We get more coastline, you get a coastline, win win
Italian diaspora will save and enlighten us with their ancient pasta-making
all the dumb things he said about brexit already make him a complete moron or at the very least an insidious man
Probably leaving yugoslavia and giving everyone a reason to send in the tanks and then thinking we would become slavic Switzerland
Turns out that's pretty damn hard so we became slavic Germany instead
ok, ok, frere moments then
Same here
Living in an old apartment building says nothing about your income
Yep, I'm using internet all the time and most sites are in English
Then there is my dialect which makes it harder for me to speak "clean" Slovene than English
I had better grades in my English class than in my Slovene class for most of the time in school
Pretty much no
I use 95% Slovene when talking to other Slovenes and a small mix of German words (due dialect) and Serbo-Croatian words here and there
I speak English only online or when I talk to a foreigner (or I am visiting a different country)
Managed to stamp out 90% of it, but I still have a bit of that distinctive slavic accent and I don't like it
Through the amazing process of media osmosis, I have learned English from such a young age that I'm probably more fluent in English than Slovene
So yeah I'm fine with it
I generally know how to speak American English, but I may roll back to the hard Slovene consonants when my tongue refuses to collaborate with the brain
It's however obviously understandable and I don't much care, except in aesthetic sense
We don't like it
That's why we speak it only if we really have to
We had a French native speaker in high school
Would trade her English accent for what she did to Slovene words any day of the week
It was also very tragic, she tried so hard and was still incomprehensible most of the time
I think it's mostly because Iphones are quite expensive and the general opinion here was that the price is not worth it (you pay just for the brand)
Of course, Apple fans would disagree, but they are not in the majority
All other phones mostly use Android
Because Android is objectively better and we're less naive
Yeah but also -3 INT when talking to tech Wizards
I don't like Maribor, I don't like the people there, they have that being 2nd complex and I can't stand their dialect
Anything in Prekmurje really
Lendava has this distinctively foreign air that I just don't feel in other border towns/cities
Sadly, it's the capital
Ljubljana
Alot of the people there think they're better than everyone else and that most of Slovenia that isn't Ljubljana are peasants
Honestly alot of them are arrogant
Not everyone though, there are really nice people
Berlin's incompetence is so famous it produced a copypasta
Ach Berlin
txt
Slovenia has some ugly cities like Jesenice or Trbovlje, but they're not really to be ashamed of
Jesenice has just shit geography, Trbovlje even worse plus being a former coal town so it's not too hard to understand why it's falling behind economically
Maribor on the other hand has great potential, being close to Austria, fields, mountains, well connected etc
but unlike many places they never fully recovered from the industiral decline in the 90s and nowadays have persistently higher unemployment than the rest of the country
They have a tendance to elect shitty mayors which keep them behind economically, ending up entrenching the being 2nd complex
It's a shame since in the end it's a place with honest working people, but making bad choices and blaming Ljubljana for all their woes
Ljubljana people are known as arrogant but we mostly just laugh at them since they think they're living in a world metropolis while the city has just 300k people
Edit: This is just Slovenian banter, as a tourist you should defnitely visit Maribor on a day trip, it has a cute, quaint baroque center and nice surroundings
Kaj si mi reko, prokleti peder pofukani
Sao tolko da veš ne, jaz sn najboljši v skupini opravo tečaj za ESD in sn bil zravn pr puno skrivnih operacij na Al-Kajdo
Mam več ko 300 potrjenih ubojov
Natreniran sn v gorilskem vojskovanji in sn najboljši snajper v Slovenski vojski
Ti si meni ena navadna tarča za trofit
Razfuko te bom z tako natančnostjo da je še svet ni vijo, zapomni si to
A misliš da če po neti neke bedarije pišeš, da se neo nič zgodlo
Še enkrat pomisli, debil
Trenutno sn v kontakti z mojo skrito mrežo vohunov po celi Sloveniji in sledim tvojemu IP-ju tak da se pripravi na razfuk, pubec
Taki razfuk da te bo odneslo z obličja zemlje
Delo bom s tebo ko svija s koruzo
Mrtev si, zastopiš. Pričakuj me kikoli, kdajkoli, ker te lahko ubijem na več ko sednsto različnih načinov, in to sao z mojimi golimi rokami
Poleg tega, da sn izkušen v golorokem boji mam tuji dostop do celega arsenala slovenske vojske in ga bom tuji uporabo dokler te nea odfuka s totega kontinenta, auha frdamana
Če bi ti vejo kaj sn vse sposobn bi mel malo več rešpekta
Sao ker ga nijaš, boš zaj gor plačo trotl gnili
Posral se bom po tebi da se boš v mojem dreki vtopo
Gotof si, mali
Well maybe you should ask Ljubljana about their complex
Some of them litteraly think that most of Slovenia, except Ljubljana, are peasants
Full of arrogance
There are many ugly towns, yes, but I wouldn't be ashamed of that
Everything you wrote is pretty much on point, except that I never met those 'arrogant' Ljubljana people everyone on the internet talks about
They are defiant when attacked, but that's expected
People in MB are way more arrogant, especially when it comes to football, but at the same time they're nice
They're just so weird
I would say people in MB are nice, sometimes overly nice and talkative, they're just very annoying with their complaining and ugly dialect
Pubec je ena najgrših besed
Bruhec mi dvigne
Yea, that's exactly what people in Maribor with a complex say
I haven't met a single person in Ljubljana that thought that while studying there
Paisley and Renfrew were scary driving through
I think people from Ljubljana hate other people from Ljubljana
and students from Maribor who don’t know how and where to park
I have lived there for a year while in high school
No joke, most of the people in my class werent all that nice
Really arrogant about "being no
1". Could be I just saw a bad side to the city, but all in all, I think it's wonderful
I just don't like the stereotype that comes from it, and then the rest of Slovenia gets the same stereotype attached to them
Everyone in Slovenia hates everyone in Slovenia
That's just how it is
My personal excuse is 'trash truck blocked my way'. It works once a week
I guess we would be complaining about our office neighbor
We are good at that
Worker in IT or alternatively in construction
Bitches a lot about everything but gets the job done
Not resident beer distributor
Yeah, fuck that guy
Oi i spilled my coffee come and clean it up for me
No that's me now can you please move us to the western side of the building, I just want a new computer and a better office
It's like a national past time
With me it's weird because when i speak some words sound british and other american so it just creates this weird fusion of both accents
Oh yes
When I visited America last summer I got made fun of for using "fake British slang" when I'm not a Brit, and in Ireland where I've lived for more than 2 years I get called out on my "fake American accent" when I should apparently be speaking with either a perfect Irish or a thick Slavic one
I feel like English-speaking folks don't really understand that we don't have an "authentic" or consistent accent and vocabulary in the English language as we learn and build it from many different sources
In clubs, partying, women would come up to you and start a conversation
Happened 0 times in 15 years of adulthood in Europe
Happened several times a night every time I was out in California
Umm, I didn't know Slovenians are supposed to be tall
Is that a legit stereotype/stat
Did his parents know and what was their role in this
This is so weird
Croatia is a member of NATO any you get military aid from the US
Unfortunately you can't rely on us to do much in a war
I don't think that'd happen
Esspecially in europe it probably wouldn't go unnoticed but Hungary is also a member of NATO so I don't know who the NATO would side with
Not our Janša. Listening to him is worse than listening to that mouth smacking ASMR, yet his following is significant
He has no speaking skills whatsoever, not a pinch of charisma, just skills in fear mongering and lying
Yea you are right
As you said I wouldn't be suprised if wars poped up and if this thread is to be believed many things are going to shit now
WW3 leak confirmed
I was joking, but if its a nuclear war then einstein will have been right when he said "I know not what ww3 will be fought with but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones"
Attila

*a handful of unaccountable corporations
Ah, can try'i. Well, this night not'i almost nothing sleep because i most time spent with learning for exam
School not is fun
Not going that well because are words and sentences in Slovene created on completely different way
And now me hurt brains
There is no way in hell slovenians would do this
Even if we did qualify
I guarantee out team does not care, fans would probably be annoyed if anything and other people don't really bother with any activism
We hardly stick our necks out for ourselves and wouldn't do it for anyone else
Plus it's not like anyone gave a shit when dogs were brutally slaughtered and burned to death for the championship
Or eurovision
That being said, I would love it but I don't expect people to for a second give up on trivial fun for others' lives
First we need to qualify
And despite beating Croatia yesterday that will be hard
So if we qualify we shouldn't boycott it, because we usually dont qualify
Otherwise the biggest issue I see with Qatar 2022 is that it is going to be held in winter, which will likely cause problems to both footballers and broadcasters
Also it wont have that usual charm
Summer sports really should be kept in summer
Not to mention the piece of shit who kicked and killed an owl
Yes such good
Football disgousts me with how much suffering a silly game has caused
Animal cruelty
EU should pick four random US states and start requiring visas for them
That's not true
We have a common travel area, so we make our deals together, otherwise it all falls apart
Imagine if half of EU required visas for Russians, while the other half didn't. How would that work
That is not being treated as an enemy
A internal affair between countries in the EU will become an affair between Spain, Ireland (and EU by proxy) and the UK after brexit
Which makes all situations very difficult and de-escalation unlikely since the UK made the first step in alienating itself by rejecting core EU values
I find the current events saddening because the UK was an important and very influential party in the EU
Saying that UK was in this just for financial benefit is a gross misrepresentation of the truth
Many EU institution are shaped like they are today because of the UK
Standardised products, safety standards for consumers and consumer protection we enjoy are UK's great contributions
Even Airbus is a product of cooperation between European countries
I sincerely hope that this is not the end of cooperation between the UK and the rest of Europe
Our prime minister said man made global warming is not a thing, that global warming is actually connected to the activity on the sun
A politician went to the store and stole a sandwich as a "social experiment" to see if he would get caught or not
He didn't get caught but when he told everybody in the parliament what he did the pm told him that he has to step down from his role as MP
"approximately two sons"  holy shit
Former prisoner, vigorous retweeter of far right content, devout communist (even the communist party didnt accept him, he was too radical) who turned against 'communists', he can not explain some of his wealth (hmhm), a part of the Patria scandal, where all of the acters from other countries went to jail or were found guilty and i could go on really
They are leading our country
If everybody at once would stop hiking
I think that even Covid19 won't stop us
Luckily
But only with family members
Yes
I meant that
Of course, we could not live without it
But our politicians and the doctors are so much insisting  that we have to stay at home, that some people were worried that hiking was prohibited too
You got my vote, but firstly Schengen needs expansion
I want a good railroad system so badly I would support any effort towards that
To me it is insane to pay for the annoying, polluting and time wasting airplanes when we have such better options available
Yes
(I'm only commenting for Slovenian presence here)
It is true, particulary Unicef
Although I don't see their ads as often anymore, there used to be plenty when I was a kid
Ye 4 years ago we had 3m of snow and now we get about 0,5m
Well here, when i was like 5 we had snow in Ljubljana, like quite a bit of it
But now maybe for a weekend we get the slushy and dirty one
In my part of Slovenia(Northern Slovenia next to Austrian border) Germans are percieved as positive people
I can say that when I was little and my grandmother told me stories from WWII I always taught that Germans were the good guys in that war and partisans were bad guys
I think she did not know what really happened in the war and had good memories of German soldiers because when they came life got better for her
There really isn't any
I've heard "It's a shame Germany didn't win the war - at least things would be in order" more times than something against Germans being said
Generally Germans are seen here in a positive light
They have the reputation of being hard working and honest people
Yes
If it only weren't for those damn Germans, man
It doesn't come up very often, but yes it is still very common, especially because of Austria's  reluctance to recognize the rights of its Slovene minority
Our issues with Germans go back a lot farther than just 70 years, they go back to over a 1000 years of oppression and gradual assimilation by them
We've probably had these issues for longer than any other Slavic country
Nothing much has changed, the gradual assimilation is still happening, still nothing we can do about it
Not really
We're too busy hating each other and mocking the brits
You must live in very SDS-voting areas xD
Overall the relations between the countries have improved in the previous decade especially on the minority related aspects
That is probably actually the reason for most of the anti-German sentiment in Slovenia
Even the issues during WW2 and WW1 were mostly because of that
Both Styria and Carinthia were originally almost entirely Slovene, but due to Slovenia being unfortunate enough to be the first Slavic nations to lose it's independence to the Germans over a thousand years ago it lost almost all of that land after centuries of gradual assimilation and depopulation due to wars
That and with modern Austria absolutely refusing to recognize what is left of their Slovene minority despite being constitutionally bound to so, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are still upset with them
Why wouldn't they be
Or reading comments of news sites of ill reputation
Haha yeah you could say so
Tell that to the Slovenians, the Germans colonised almost all of their land
Honestly, you Austrians got most of your modern state from the Slovenes
How could you get it back if you never had it to begin with
If I'm being honest, Slovenes did live in all of those areas
Carantania alone consisted of basically all of Styria and Carinthia plus East Tyrol, and southern parts of Lower and Upper Austria
Even the eastern parts of South Tyrol were part of it
Not to mention that the northern parts of Upper and Lower Austria were still originally inhabited by Slavs before the Germans moved south, they just weren't part of Carantania
Carantania was actually relatively ethnically homogeneous, with the vast majority being the Slavic ancestors of the Slovenes and the remainder not being Germanic at all, but the remnants of the Romanised Celtic population
Also Salzburg has only been part of Austria for 200 years so I don't know why it is relevant, it never made up historic Austria
Even as little as 100 years ago both Styria and Carinthia were still more than 1/3 Slovene
Going back 100 more years and Slovenes made up almost half of the population in both
Nowadays the percentage of Slovenes in Carinthia is constantly lowering, I wonder why
Austria basically got their entire country by germanising the Slovenes
Trieste has basically never been part of Venice, save for when it was briefly occupied for a few years
Austria had owned the city for around 700 years
The inhabitants of Trieste were also originally the Friulians and the Slovenes, not the later Venetians who tried to assimilate both
In Slovenia Spar used this in commercials, since we also use the word (although with a slavic twist) šparati
Thanks for the breakdown
It is really much more expensive than in my country (around 2 million people)
Here, employed people pay 6,36 % of their gross pay for basic insurance, which covers almost everything (the list is actually complicated, but suffice it to say that you don't have to worry about paying, especially not for rare conditions, though one notable omission is dental care, which is covered very sparsely)
Unemployed get coverage through assistance for unemployed or through family members or they can pay for it themselves
Minimum salary here right now is around 940 € gross, and healthcare for that salary is around 60 €/month
Just to give you a perpective, neto minimum salary is around 650 € as of this year, adjusted once per year
Edit: one more thing to put costs into perpective
A short visit to a GP costs 7,26 €, a first curative visit 17,42 €.
Specialist care:
Surgeon - 4,09-17,77 €
Cardiologist - 3,85-16,73 €
Dialisys - 176 € (chronic) or 302 € (acute)
CT - 130-300 €
MRI - 200-450 €
Kidney transplantation - 82
768 €
Birth - 1
200-5
600 €
True in a way, but Bismarck began work on that much earlier
And his reason was to make the population of Germany better workers
Those social conservatives were crafty
Yes, that is what I mean
I used decimal commas, points are for thousands
But this the cost charged to the national insurance, you don't pay that out of pocket
Yes, of course
Our tap water is of excellent quality in most parts of the country
We always drink tap water
We even got annoyed that restaurants wouldn't give you tap water and now they have to
I hate it when people buy unnecessary plastic when they have clean water available
In Slovenia I only buy bottled water at festivals and occasionally when travelling (but even them I mostly bring water with me, because prices)
I buy sparkling water in bottles (reusable glass ones), but otherwise tap water all the way
Radenska and home made apple juice, yum
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well :)
Way too often to the point that I feel like I can barely speak Slovene
Ever since 5th grade, I've been a big fan of reading, and, altho I'm ashamed of saying it myself, the majority of the books I read were light novels
These are unobtainable in Slovene, so I always read them in English
In the meantime, I barely even touched a single book in my own native tongue
So while my English vocabulary exploded, my Slovene one shrunk significantly
All the time, actually
Sometimes I have to even use Google Translate to find the Slovene word I'm looking for
I work in engineering and Slovene words for some things aren't really used
I know they exist and I can go find them in the specific dictionaries when needed, but I'd probably laugh at anyone using them casually
A lot of them just sounds made-up
Some are actually quite good
None are common
In general, I sometimes 'lose' words in either Slovene or English
I do a lot of writing in English, but commonly check Google Translate for words I knew yesterday
When I lose them in Slovene, it takes some description games
Imagine trying to describe all the various fantasy weaponry, spells etc
in Slovenian
I think it's actually not that bad with words of Latin/Greek origin though
Actually, would be interesting to think about whether it even ever happens with English words of Germanic origin
Never call a Slovene (or pretty much anyone whose national first language isn't Russian) Eastern European
In the same vein, never call anyone *not* from Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus Eastern European
Also not being a politician or owner of a company and not assuming that all the politicians and company owners are stealing from everyone they can
Is it weird that I'm not sure if esteriotipes was being used ironically or seriously
Wait, I thought we got the idea to serve Wiener Schnitzel with tartar sauce from you guys as a package
O_o
Literally came here to say this
Central Europe is a thing, learn your geography
We may forgive being called Balkans, but not Eastern Europe
Sirov burek
Here are three pics that will also illustrate why the common usage of EE doesn't make any sense:
Only because you always go to war against everyone else except each other xD
You're just Slavs in denial anyway :D
dude you're killing me
As someone from other Slovakia, I can confirm that we too have "Nizozemska" (Lowlandia), which does only refer to the Netherlands though
Ahahaha I love that statistic and am very proud it was not us
I don't know any for Slovenia
Probably because we have an inferiority complex so we only ever talk about the statistics, where we rank well
Well
apart from having way to many suicides and alcoholics
When you say "other race" do you mean only POC
What about a white South African or Latin American
(for example)
True, but we still rank really high
At some point we were second I think after Finland or something
We only ever fight with Croatians, who also happen to be our only neighbor we never were at war with throughout history
But in general, no
Personally, on the off-chance that I encounter some revisionist or irredentist Italian, Austrian, or Hungarian that makes claims to our modern-day territory, I just start poking fun at them that they couldn't even erase our culture back in their glory days, so trying today would probably lead to us taking over Rome/Vienna/Budapest
That's half-hilarious and half-true (I'll let you figure out which part is which), so it usually dispels any tension
And in general, not really
Some of my grandma's cousins were killed by the 3rd Reich
I don't blame modern-day Germans for that, so no reason for things to get awkward
Aye, everything south of Kolpa river is a mess
Gotta watch what you say or you might as well get stabbed by someone
Albanians, bosniaks, croatians and serbians
Dangerous people when it comes to discussing history
In western slovenia we have: "Italijani napadajo/prihajajo
" (The Italians are attacking /coming)
Oh then yall do it only when you come here
It is a common thing that when someone gets stabbed it happeens in a fight between folks south of Kolpa
You were
Now you are just loud guests who drive really slow, but we like you
Our people used to live in harmony for centuries, 2 wars and atrocities on both sides shouldn't ruin that
Can you browse reddit tho
That's like punishing your child for not obeying computer time limits with staying in his room but he could play playstation or whatever
Well that would at least be funny if the police officer would take your phone
I never heard of any one doing it here but i wish they did
There's only [one example I know of] and it's pretty good, which makes sense, since the girl's real life mom is apparently Slovenian, but you can still hear the accent
this has yet to happen but even if the actor had a strong accent we'd still lose our shit
I always say hello to people passing by in mountains, but that's rare for me, because I don't go to mountains that much
Yes, absolutely
It's considered rude if you don't.
Generally yes, but I usually try to read the person approaching, because you can see some of them just don't want to be greeted
I also noticed a big difference in the past few years, since "instagram hiking" became so popular, there are many more "city dewllers" that just ignore people
I think in general the mountaineering ethics has declined a bit since it became so popularized
I was hiking in Wales and got a feeling that it's not common because people were often surprised when I greeted them
Eating horse meat
Not as a speciality, but stuff like burgers, sausages, hot dogs, meat loafs
The regular food
Talked to a Romanian friend as she was completely surprised we eat it as beef or pork meat
That is maybe the biggest cultural shock I had in Poland
It also showed answers from another town who didn't agree with it
We also have it here, but not as big
I saw some videos from yesterday's parade, and that stuff is straight from the nightmares
pancakes are a dinner food here as well
It is a thing
We (Slovenians) still say Ja for Yes
Undo what you have done
In UK people are afraid to see themselves naked let alone strangers :D
Hehe, in all seriousness I prefer saying "ja", it sounds better than "da", don't know why
Actually I love the fact that our culture is really similar to yours in general (if you search up Slovenian folk music, you may be surprised by how similar)
All spas/wellness'/health centers here have saunas
From my experience you have to be naked and use two towels
A bigger one to sit on and a smaller one to wipe sweat
Vesel božič!
"To je kot Španska vas" - This is like a Spanish village to me is a saying when you have 0 knowlage about something
"Ne delaj se Francoza" - Stop acting like French is a saying when somebody pretends to not understand something
We have that too only that it's "like a spanish village to me"
"To je pa češko" - "That's Czech" : it is not particularly well made or it looks off, but generally functional
Russian/Soviet technology - usually old, absolutely unintuitive to use but indestructible; it doesn't matter where it was actually made
Teksas - Texas is referred to a situation that is messy and lawless
Not necessarily negative
Never heard it used positively
Texas meant messy, lawless and absolutely not doing what it was supposed to
In a very bad direction
It's going to be a global 9/11
Kiss your freedom and democracy goodbye
Any country could close their borders/airports and there was nothing the EU could do about it
I mean, if Slovenia could do it, Ireland with its much stronger economy and, as you say, *being an island*, could definitely have done it as well
You're blaming the EU for something it didn't do - that's Brexit-style talk
Don't forget us, your neighbours, we have an Orbanesque government now
The first thing that our forreign affaires minister(?) did was invite the Hungarian one to visit
And the media house of our far right party (15% support usually) is owned by Orban money/people, in coordination with their Slovenian friends
We have a police investigation about funding said television(media house)
And the new minister for internal affairs(the one overlooking the police) is a director in that firm(media house)
Sorry for maybe wrong words, am trying lol
Unless I'm mistaken, they can be stripped of their vote, and then essentially anything can be decided, even a treaty change which allows for states to be expelled, but I don't think expulsion is an option already
Or is it
That says a lot about the Irish government, not the EU
Fuck
> Its the same with the Balkans that may or may not include Slovenia, Greece and Romania
And Austria according to north Germans xD
But yeah, you're right about the east-west question
People with superiority complexes use the borders of the Slavic countries
The rest uses geography or history
I agree about that
Emergency powers aren't inherently bad
They're just dangerous in the wrong hands
Once in school we were listening to a dialect for an exercise and I literally couldn't understand anything
But I don't travel much inside Slovenia, so I don't really get to listen much to other dialects
If you will not learn we will have to change language (while showing cooking wooden spoon- kuhalnica and threatening beating with it)
Same here, it’s either working in McDonald’s or stocking shelves in Mercator (the largest Slovene supermarket chain)
There is also "If you will not learn you will be road cleaner/road (maintenance) worker
so no one was told they will be "stacking sugar on the store shelves"? it was a classic  in my household
I know this comes up a lot and people here joke about it, but in this New Years holidays I had to explain that Slovenia is NOT Slovakia
and I had to explain that to two Germans who are travelers
Idk man
I think that this joke is something that pretty much only Americans (British as well maybe
) use
I've never heard about the France surrender joke in real life and 95% of time I encounter it is on Reddit
That is because Italy occupies the surrender joke position in Slovenia
And the Balkans, generally
Wasn't it also the Weimar Republic that put heavier regulations on civilian firearm ownership
Movie Blades of Glory was translated into Drkajva skupaj
Drkati is very old expression for skating - more then 100 years from its use, but even then expression drsati was much more common
Today, drkati is exclusively used for male masturbation - jerking off
So Blades of Glory was translated into "Let's masturbate together"
Well
The titles of cartoons and shows are fucked up
Like "Lost" is "Izgubljeni otok" which in singles is "Lost Island". This comes on the top of my head
There are probably more but I am on the English stead of the Slovenian internet
House in Slovenian is "Zdravnikova vest" or in English - Doctors Conscience
HAHA
I found out what "drkanje" meant a few weeks ago lol
If you put the Slovenian translation in English you get "Let's masturbate together"
Does nobody in Slovenia look at translations
I guess this wording was used intentionally to rise eyebrows, but as this is movie with very poor reviews it was mostly passed without notice
I was once looking trough tv guide and saw it on tv schedule on one popular Slovene station during the day hours so I was quite sure it wasn't porn but typographical error
But when I checked the description of the movie, the first line of description was from the Slovene dictionary (SSKJ) of what drkati means
"iz Slovarja slovenskega knjižnega jezika: drkati -am nedov
(r) zastar
večkrat zdrsniti, zdrkniti: potne kapljice so mu drkale po čelu
drsati se: gledala je, kako fantje drkajo po ledu; otroci so se hodili na potok drkat
Pojasnilo glede prevodov naslovov filmov: prevod filmskega naslova je izbira distributerja in ne prikazovalca
I know
Still quite dumb
"Drkati" is today referred to as jerking themself
And show "Lost" is "Izgubljeni otok" which that in English is "Lost island". What kind of Janšist thinks of these translations
i actually always thought kazakhstan was a democracy
i mean i never even heard of nazarayev
are the other stans all dictatorships too
SO you're saying that the man who brought an end to the tyrannical USSR communist rule over Kazakhstan and established a blistering free-market free-enterprise oriented liberal democracy, wasn't such a good guy
uhhhhhhh, what
English stags need to be banned in Europe
We are all sick of them
I'm serious
Can you brits fo something about it pleasw
It's about 30 °C here, which is fairly normal for this time of year
Nights suck ass though
I'm too cheap to buy one so I suffer in silence instead :D
Sometimes
This week it was actually pretty chill
About 25C.
I think it has a lot to do with the centralist model around which the french state and the french nation developed
The french territory was more or less unified already at the end of the middle ages with the main centre of power located in Paris
This got even more prominent with the rise of absolutism
When the french revolution came and the nation started to form its national identity and spread it among the people, and when the organization of the state started to develop in the post-revolution time, it employed an extremely centralized and top-down model
As a consequence Paris became by far the most important economic centre where all the population started to move during the demographic rise that accompanied the industrial revolution
All other cities remained far behind
Even today you can observe that France is the only big european coubtry that has one megacity and no other urban centre comparable by its size
If you look Germany, Italy or Spain, they all have at least two large urban areas of comparable size
First of all is that per mile or kilometer
Idk where are you from, you don't have a tag next to your name
Slovenians are born with work as soon as they're born, found on a podcast
That's typically Belgian :o ? I thought we were the only nation this mad
I know a number of people who consider building and renovating a hobby
That really depends on the person
I helped renovate 2 flats now and I vaguely hated it, also now I have to live with what we did
On the other hand, people who hired workers to do it for them admit it is a generally an unmitigated disaster, reliable and responsible workers are rarer than unicorns
If you do it yourself, you at least saved some money and you know anything wrong is your own fault
My father used to say he is Bosnian (not Bosniak), now he proclaims himself as Serb from Bosnia
Jesenice
Although all the images online seem to try and hide it's uglyness
Everyone in Slovenia will spit the name out if you ask them this question
It's an ugly industrial town in the middle of beautiful scenery
La Spezia is alright, imo
Been there a few times, and I've got zero complaints about its looks
Imo, some of the Sicilian cities take the cake for the ugliest city, but that's only my opinion
I was looking for an answer from a fellow Slovene
I agree
I had a coworker who moved from Ljubljana to Jesenice
I would also say Jesenice
Also Trbovlje, Hrastnik, Velenje and Nova Gorica
I was curious if anyone from Austria will have had a similar experience since it's so close to the boarder
The town really sticks out in a bad way
... ...  why
If I remember correctly his girlfriend was from there and wanted to stay near her parents
It makes even less sense if I tell you that he worked (and still works) in Ljubljana
None of it makes sense but I wish him well
Because most European countries are generally more reserved
No shouting in public unless absolutely necessairy, no talking to strangers, even smalltalk is, at least in Slovenia, just a way to make yourself unpopular and annoying
"Slovenia is a democratic republic"
And even that very short statement is now being undermined by our current extreme far right PM
We used to do it on r/slovenia but i got old because we ran out of words that rhyme with dečki (dudes)
This is a bit out of context, but this thread just made me a bit sad I don't speak more languages
So many memes go over my head ;\_;
Danes je sreda, moji dečki
(Well, not anymore)
We tell people to bring their own slippers to a party
It's way less messy, but you do need space for all the shoes
Prekmurje
Poor guys have to live in a flat plains
No mountains, no hills - just flat terrain
Empty horizon :/.
Goričko is pretty hilly (kind of)
Lendavske gorice as well
Well, they still have the Goričko
Its not like when I was traveling trough Poland: 5 hours of train and everything was totally flat
But yeah, as a slovenian I would have a hard time to live in a totally flat rural area like that
Actually I would not live in the Dolenjska region either
Just too many super religious rednecks for my tastes
I've seen pictures of Schwerin and it looks beautiful
Also aren't there a lot of lakes
They could develop some quality trourism there + it's not far from Berlin and Hamburg
Oh, they have a lot of canals and other water features
That makes the landscape a tiny bit less boring
Well, traveled trough western Hungary and it was quite hilly here and there
I remember a town at the slopes of a really funky looking hill, don't know the name of it
I seem to remember plenty of stories about a quite brutal Hungarization in what's today Slovenian Prekmurje, so it's ironic that you'd consider yourself a colony
Maybe "junior colonialist partner" in the partnership with Austria would've been a better term to use
Well we have dual form which is pretty unique for languages in Europe
Slovene doesn't really have swear words
To curse, you either use a borrowed word form former Yugoslavian languages, say literaly 'curses
' or possibly 'damn
' (not sure which is a closer translation), or there are some traditional not really curse words that are just funny, like 'pasja taca' (dog paw) or 'tristo medvedov' (three hundred bears)
We have duality instead of just singularity and plurality in Slovene :
sestra - a sister
sestri - 2 sisters
sestre - 3 sisters
Haha just wanted to say that
I love that we have dual
"Midva" is supposed to be the most beutiful word in our language because it menas "us two". I think a few languages have dual but not many
I love turkish
Such a beautiful language
My ex boss was turkish and it was interesting how many words we picked up from you guys
You were everywhere haha
I actually had no idea ancient Greek had dual
You learn something new everyday
Like how there are separate forms for singular and plural, there's also a form for exactly 2 of a thing
Imagine:
1 Chair, 2 Chairs, 3 Chairs - except the 2 chairs have a separate form
Yeah Slovene definitely isn't completely unique but it is still pretty uncommon
I'd say a more accurate comparison would be a Bosnian with a stick up their ass
Haha I love to hear how others hear our language
My ex said, before he knew our culture, that we sound disappointed
Which was really funny because the stereotype is that we're pretty whiny
I love how this completely ignored that half of the Slavic words are actually Slovene in origin
So, like English where you sometimes say 'you two' or 'a pair of'
In Slovenian it would be:
1 stol
**2 stola**
3 stoli
4 stoli
5 stolov
6 stolov
Yeah that's how dual works in Slovene, too
It changes the end of the word (for example: 1 stol -> 2 stola)
It is, however, mandatory
1 stol
2 stola
3 stoli
Croatian has something different (that is, an alternative plural form for lower numbers), whereas Slovene has a distinct form for exactly 2 of something
I did not know that, interesting
We also have the special plural, but for 3-4 and then 5+ :
4 stoli, 5 stolov
Summer time for sure
In the summer we would keep sunlight in the evenings and in the winter we would have an extra hour of sunlight in the afternoon so you could go for a walk
The only downside is that we would have darkness until about 8
20 in december
Same in Slovenia
It's not unusual for some cafes to open at 6am (before COVID), so people can go for a quick coffee before work
Slovenia as well
We had two who escaped prison few years ago and they wouldn't get any additional years for escaping
Venice, instead of stealing cars you would be stealing gondolas
The Postojna Cave
It's a beautiful cave, but you pay 20 euros (or 25 eur, not sure) of entrance fee per person to have a 30 mins "run" trough the cave with almost no explanation or entertainment from the guide, in a group that is usually too large to feel engaged anyway
Plus stalagmites and stalactites are nice too see, but that's really all you will see
On the contrary in the Škocjan caves you have the stalagmite and stalactite part which later evolves into a massive underground gorge with waterfalls and a magnificent exit in the green dolina
A much more interesting and diverse experience in my opinion
We are supposed to hate our neighbours, alchoholic and suicidal
I barely interact with neighbours, dont drink alchohol and havent commited suicide so far
I sure fit some
I'm an emancipated woman married to a slightly effeminate man, fitting the ex-yu stereotype like a glove
I'm also pretty sporty, love skiing and climbing mountains, and I totally wear the company soft-shell while doing it (but at least it's not Akrapovič)
I spend part of my summer on Croatian coast
I however don't drive a VW Passat TDI, Salomon shoes generally don't fit me and I don't plan on building my own house if I can avoid it
edit: spelling
You could do a beer flavoured mayo though
I have no idea what we did to Sacha Baron Cohen, that he hates us so much, but
First in Ali G he as Ali G proposes a policy to only allow fit women refugees into UK, and sends a ugly looking chick "back to Slovenia".
And now in the new Borat movies he calls Slovenia a "shithole", and uses the story of Melania as a way to frame the story of Borat's daughter
BTW I hope you get, I'm not actually mad at this, it's just funny two of his movies both have a negative view of Slovenia
BTW "go back to Slovenia" was kind of a meme/catchphrase when Ali G in da house came out
It's a heresy for sure, but is it a tasty heresy
How would that even work
Put cheese in goulash and serve it on fresh bread
I suppose the cringiest moment was in the mocumentary Sicko, where the scene of supposed Slovene health system was actually taken from our comedic serial
Wait what
That happened
I feel like I need to do some googling
> Eastern-European
Please, central for about 1300 years
And then 50 years of non-aligned, so neither west nor east
And now 30 years of central again
Also our [median person's HDI] and [median person's net wealth] seem to place us in a quite interesting position
Look at the guy, comes over so innocently and throws the most universal insult you can use on Slovenes :D
I believe existence of Central Europe as a unit is covered in geography as well
Pretty sure whoever put them in just did a mix of exYu stuff
Both Roman and Niko as short for Nikola could be something a Slovenian would do, for example
And we have plenty of -ić surnames here
The tricky part is that he fought in the war, so he definitely wasn't Slovenian
But theoretically, it could be that one of his parents was Slovenian, for example
At the very least that would clear up the naming inconsistent with both Croatian and Serbian
On the other hand, there's no excuse for the most expensive game of all time back then to not have a single person point out that the last name likely doesn't end in "ick", considering last names ending in "ich" is one of the single most common tropes about Slavs
But the one time where they could've generalized, they didn't.
I have two conspiracy theories
The first one is that the real Tito was swaped with a russian spy, who then ruled over Yugoslavia
The second one isn't that interesting, but there is a conspiracy theory about the death of our famous writer, Ivan Cankar
The official cause of death is that he died of disease, but some people speculate he was murdered by some government officials because he said some weird things about slovenian nation and some higher ups didn't like it and got rid of him
Tick-borne meningitis is pretty common in Slovenia and somewhat rare generally in Europe
This is obviously because Germans intentionally infected the ticks to weaken the partisan resistance during WWII
My mom, a firm believer in this theory, told that Tito used to speak slovenian and croatian, but when he came back from Soviet Union, he could not say a word in slovenian
And there were some physical references she believes chaged after he came back
And he came back from Soviet Union because the russian send him to rule over Yugoslavia
Idk, it's weird
I'mma just leave [this] "Map of Slovene Lands" from the mid-19th century here and show myself out
> In Italy we often joke about reconquering Istria and in particular the city of Fiume (Rijeka, Croatia)
There are still some Italians living there
I can say almost the same as a Slovenian (about Istria and a few other islands in Croatia like Krk, Cres, and Lošinj) because there are a lot of Slovenian tourists there
I also need to mention that the most common joke in Slovenia is about Trst (Trieste) in Italy since it was ours in the past and a lot of Slovenian people still live there
We will help you get back Rijeka in exchange for Trieste (Trst)
> Not sure if joking or serious:
> Central Europe
And that's why we're having the most fun =_=
Trieste is Slovenian :P
You mean in English
That's just because we didn't want to scare native English speakers with a vowel-less-looking word like Trst
Well, you may want to read up on the [etymology] of that name
Apparently not
Read the link
Yup, but that just means that you can't use the origin of the name to justify whose the city is, since it predates both
For the record, this entire thing about Trieste being Slovenian is a joke to most Slovenes, so I'm not actually trying to argue that in all seriousness
Federal EU is where my <3 is at
Slavic cultures aren’t western
Surely you don’t consider communism as the defining characteristic of Slavic cultures
How would you view for example Czech culture if not in the context of Western cultures heavily influenced by Western Christianity and Greco-Roman culture
you get here 3 or 2 days of paid leave for moving
for your own wedding you get 3 days off, 2 days for your children wedding
for child birth you get 2 days leave; and then extra paternal (30 days), maternal (105 days) and parental (260days) leave
for your child or husband/wife death 3 days, for parents 2 days, for sister/brother death or grandparents only 1 day
for natural disaster if your life, health or property is in danger 3 days
you also get a paid leave (1 day) when your child goes to school for the first time
> 3 or 5 days per year for caring for sick children (edit; this is a common feat from private companies, but it's not mandatory)
3 days
what if they have a flu or something
They just send them sick to school/kindergarten after those 3 days
Here it's 7 (school kids and adults) and 15 days (kindergarten kids and special needs) everytime they're sick
And if they don't get better in that time frame you can get up to 6 months from your doctor, if you need more then it's decided by a commission
This made me laugh so hard
We share quite a few words with our neighbors in Croatia that are spelled and pronounced the same in both languages, but mean totally different things
For example:
"Truden" in Slovenian means tired, in Croatian it's pregnant
"Vreme" in Slovene means weather, in Croatian time
"Molim" in Slovene means to pray, in Croatian it means please
"Zahod" in Slovene is west, in Croatian it's toilet
I like it here
Maybe Germany or Austria, if i had to choose another country
Malaga, Korčula or Amsterdam
I travel quite a bit, so I have this happen to me quite often
I’ve now come so far that I don’t let it bother me and just tell whoever thought I couldn’t understand what they were saying to try and not be an absolutely disgusting person in public
The first time was when 2 English-speaking girls (presumably American, judging by the accent) were talking about how “horribly” I was dressed and how fat I was in the checkout line at a grocery store
It really destroyed my sense of self-worth for the next few weeks
Walking in the streets of Zagreb, talking in Slovenian with friends, albeit quite fast
2 teenage girls are talking in Croatian behind us "What language are they speaking
They must be German
" We turn around and I say in Croatian "Uh actually, we're Slovenian". They just laugh embarassingly and go away
Oh no no, we have a saying here from the times of the old Yugo, I'm pretty sure you have it too
"Pricaj srpski da te ceo svet razume"
Not exactly Croatian, but seeing as it and Serbian are so similar ^(\*cough\* almost identical \*cough\*) and the huge diaspora between all the ex-yugo countries (about 10M people in total) it's no wonder you found someone who could understand you
Oh damn yeah that is a bit more of a long shot haha
The "other" deck we use here, next to the French, is the German/Bavarian deck, which is also called Hungarian here for some reason
(maybe only locally in my region
i have also seen such an abomination, lmao
Whaat
Are these used for regular card games
I have never seen them before
We don't use Spanish ones, but we use Italian ones for certain card games like briškola (briscola)
At least in Primorska it's very popular
We have them to, of course not nearly as pouplar as french
30+°C hell on earth
15+°C - t-shirt
15-5°C - sweater
5-0°C - light spring jacket
below zero - winter coat
It depends though
Last week I went hiking
It was a cold but sunny dry windy day, 6°C at the top of the plateau
It felt just right in t-shirt
The same temperature with high humidity would probably see me in jacket
Below 5°C is warm jacket cold
Below 0 is coat cold
My car just said it was 2°C outside this morning, I was still in my autumn jacket, and I was lucky i got the parking spot close to the door
I'm entirely prepared to go out in any cold we get here (it's rarely below -20), but the reasons for it must get exponentially better the colder it is
It just takes too much effort to plan and execute the clothing so that I'm not cold and still mobile
Above 20 is hot
0 to 19 is t-shirt weather
-10 to 0 not really cold but I'll wear a coat, coats are cool
My experience of Belgian weather was so wet I find this pretty hard to believe
That was only 2012
I generally vote the party closest to my views, or at least one that has some ideas I find good
It did happen I hated everybody, so I put in an invalid sheet (I did the possibly pettiest thing in the world and drew a penis on it)
I think there was about 2 elections to date that I voted lesser evil, since fear of our current ruling party overcame my convictions
Ah yes, snus master race
The prices increased
I was in Kosovo last september and paid 2€ for a pack, and I saw even cheaper ones
How cheap were they before
We were in montenegro going to serbia on a roadtrip and an idea came up let’s go to kosovo while we’re down here
Hey I got a kosovo passport stamp and now I can say I’ve been to kosovo
Mistaking us for Slovakia
I doubt that
No offense, but I always thought tje Dutch preferred the Netherlands over Holland but these year when i sople to a bunch of Dutch tourists they all said: we are from Holland
And not a single person said they are from the Netherlands
It is less similar in Slovenian - Slovenia is "Slovenija", while Slovakia is "Slovaška". Only first four letters/sounds are the same, the rest is completely different
The languages are closely related and both of us essentially call ourselves 'Slavic' or 'Slav'. You would have thought the words are going to be similar
It didn't exactly depend on us as modern nations
Yes
We have a tiny coast whereas Slovakia is landlocked
On beaches with more families I've seen maybe 2 out of 100 women  sunbathe topless, most of those just laying on their stomach not showing their breasts on full display
I've seen maybe 1-3 women in my entire life walking around with their tiddies out on a beach like that (all of those were older unnatractive ones that I really did not need to see, especially as a little kid)
On beaches with more young adults, I'd say the number is up to 5 out of 100, still I'd say half of those just lay on their stomach not really showing anything
I do
In croatia a would say
3 in 10
But I don't go to super turisty beaches full of families
You could be both right
Overall if you look on beaches there is probably something like 10% average on a given time
But if you look how many women fells comfortable to take off bra at least once on a vacation when sunbathe than 50% is a bit low
Depends on what kind of beach, if its crowded, popular beach I'd say less then 5%, on a more remote  not crowded one it can be between 10-30%
But on an almost empty, smaller, secluded beaches, you would definitely see it more than one or two
No way, I was in spain for months but in Croatia people are way more open to being topless
>an average German made 1
900€ per month
Is the net average really so low
The wikipedia page says the net average is well over 2000€. Slovenia has an average of around 1200
TBH if you can you should always buy of the online lego store, shipping to slovenia is free at least for what i am trying to buy
I got sets of LEGO as gifts all the time when I was a kid and I've still got a huge box of mixed pieces
All bought in stores, not online
The most expensive one was a 120€ truck for my 10th birthday
I'd say "normal" sets are quite affordable here and tbh I haven't noticed any bigger price difference between Slo and D.

Well, after WW2 our government decided to kill anyone that might had something to do with the faschists
So there are valleys filled with bodies
The worst part was that if you came from a concentration camp you were likely to be shot as well as you were perceived as a nazi collaborator
Why isn'y Belgium here
On the other hand, I've yet to meet someone who considers executions and expulsions of Italians and Germans from what's modern day Slovenia a "horrible atrocity". It's usually met with a shrug, which I really can't blame anyone for
Oh absolutely
Slovenian here - I don't think anyone here considers modern Macedonia anything other than one of the Yugoslav constituent republics, and certainly not an entity with any relation to what we learned about in history class about antiquity
Also, the way we learn about history is that ancient Macedons were just one of the various variants of Greeks, so Big Alex is certainly considered an OG - Original Greek
Not really in Slovenia, so we'll keep those if you don't mind
For Slovenia
Tricky, as an independent nation we didn't the time (or power) to do much shitty stuff
I'd guess this might be the worst
"[The Erased] a clusterfuck of beaurocracy that left a few ten thousand people without legal status for decades
Thousands of cases are still pending
I dont have anything for independent slovenia, when we were still part of yugoslavia there were massive after war (II) murders, up until this point they have found 600 massive graves
We had simmilar "cleaning" as USSR under stalin, yugoslavia was hiding all the time, despite local people knowing about the graves
Identification of the victims started only in independent slovenia
After the war, murdering the members of the Slovene Home Guard and their families and throwing their bodies in pits
Seriously
What would the world look like today if he was accepted
We can only assume
We also have bonfires ([kres] on 30th of April but we don't have any witches we just have bonfires and drink alcohol
A Slovenian that doesnt hike and garden and is not in a feud with a neighbour
And doesnt go on vacation to Croatia
I've only met only two people in my life who had a feud with their neighbour, I've never understood that stereotype

My father is bosnian and my mother slovene
Does that make ma Croatian
Can confirm
Moon: (tista) luna - female
Sun: (tisto) sonce - neuter
The sun is neuter (sonce), while we have two words for the moon
One is luna, which is female, and mesec, which is male
Mesec can mean also "month" though
Sonce in luna
The sun is neutral, the moon is female
As a male, maybe
But I don't think many people think of them in genders
edit: although, Luna is also a female name
From what I can find on the internet, it's *Luna*, both linguistically and scientifically
*Mesec* should only be used in a poetic way
I can post a pdf link once I get off the toilet
Andrews tourist hostel in, well St
Andrews, Scotland
Don't be fooled by nice clean photos on the internet and positive comments, I bet they're writting them themselves
I am honestly baffled by the comments
This was the most disgusting place I have ever seen
You enter a hostel from the side of an old house
There's a Mexican restaurant or something at the bottom of the house
Then you climb carpeted stairs that are glued together with blue tape
The whole place stinks of food and old
The room we stayed in had one little window that couldn't be closed because it was literally rotting
Bed sheets looked like they were 70 years old and not washed in a while, beds were old and squeeky
Carpet, that was everywhere, looked disgusting
We had 2 other roomates
We were all sitting on beds, not wanting to move because everything was so disgusting
It looks like there are some homeleless people living there permanently
We went out, came back at 10pm, went to sleep with normal clothes on because no one had the guts to even check the shower rooms and we wanted to get the hell out first thing in the morning
We were supposed to stay for 2 nights
I am not overreacting, this was a horrible hostel
At least the location was really good
And the price was very cheap
I guess you get what you pay but this hostel was rotten and not worth even 0,10€.
One of more memorable incidents on a school trip to Italy:
A guy tried to scam (I guess you could call it that) a schoolmate of mine when he put a bracelet on his wrist and expected him to pay for it - of course without the kid asking for it in the first place
So he said "I don't want that, go away". And the Italian guy went absolutely bananas
"You no say go away to me
You say go away to your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, but you no say go away to me
Luckily our guide intervened and calmed the Italian down before anything worse happened
I always have copies of my ID and/or passport in at least 2 different bags and you can give it to people who you're travelling with as well
That's one of the biggest rules of travelling
Well nowadays it's easier to keep a copy in a cloud or mail or something you can access from everywhere, if you're going to a country with sure internet access
How can E.R. be closed
Same in Tunisia
A hotel employee literally asked my 14 at the time cousin to stay with him at night infront of our parents
And there were so many other incidents targeted at women in our group that by the end of the holiday it just felt normal
Ridiculous
We had a giant scorpion in a bathroom in Tozeur, Tunisia
No one took a shower that day
We threw a towel over it
I can't find the hostel on hostelworld anymore, which is where we booked it from
My bet is that they removed it because it was so bad
I really hope it's not operational anymore
When I got home I wanted to write to St Andrews mayor or whatever they have, that's how bad it was
Hmm, I wonder if this is a thing
We stayed in another hostel that looked like it had permanent 'guests'. But at least that one was clean
Yea I'm not doing hostels anymore either
Unless I go to Japan again
I've seen all kinds of people use them there and they're all so nice and welcoming
I think I was there 2 or 3 years ago
Maybe they cleaned it up
Hopefully
But it's not on hostelworld anymore
No definitely not
But if you lose your passport it will be easier to prove your identity
You moved tents because of a little hedgehog
Have you considered picking it up with a towel or something
For my country Slovenia, it is German and Italian
I have English C1, German B2, Italian A1 and Spanish B1
Spanish
I see a lot of ads asking for it
Germans usually speak english well, spaniards, not so much (no offence guys)
I mean I'm from Slovenia and that used to be common here as well
Was never once considered an Italian thing though
Well, Germany is still brutal when it comes to protecting its interests even with "fellow EU nations" to the east and south, but at least it's not slaughtering people this time, so that's progress
Seriously though, I like Germany in general, but a downgrade on the arrogance towards poorer countries in general and Slavs in particular wouldn't hurt

Getting to a native pronounciation and accent
Basically impossible
Jesus, did you jinx Michael Robinson
Because he reportedly passed away yesterday
Funny how you say that, while i was actually confused as a native a few times
I am not Italian
> the vast majority of people in the UK are quite frankly rubbish at Grammar
So we have Americans messing up "their/they're/there" and "could/would/should of". What's the most common British grammar mistakes
Or is it the same set
Oh boy
If we count different sets of case endings for the "same gender" as a different gender, Slovenian has 12
I'm gonna use this now to scare foreigners, thanks for the idea :D
In case anyone's curious, see below
-e is the genitive ending, "npr
" == "e.g.". Sklanjatev == declension
male
- prva moška sklanjatev (korak, -a)
- druga moška sklanjatev (sluga, -e)
- tretja moška sklanjatev (c, npr
v visoki c visokega c)
- četrta moška sklanjatev (dežurni, -ega)
female
- prva ženska sklanjatev (lipa, -e)
- druga ženska sklanjatev (perut, -i)
- tretja ženska sklanjatev (mami, Karmen ...)
- četrta ženska sklanjatev (dežurna, -e)
neuter
- prva srednja sklanjatev (mesto, -a)
- druga srednja sklanjatev (jaz, mene -i)
- tretja srednja sklanjatev (tri, npr
v tri deljeno s pet)
- četrta srednja sklanjatev (Krško, -ega)
Thank you France for everything
Seriously, great food, great culture, great language
I hope I can live there one day
Germany and Austria for helping us win our independence
Singapore for supplying rifles to us, even is ammunition caused lots of horrible deaths on Yugoslav side
Vatican for starting the wave of recognitions of our independence
Austria during the Habsburg years for developing our country, which is still seen in our everyday life
The UK and the US for supplying our Partisans with weapons and heavy armaments
All good
(I didn't even know we were invited
We're thankful for your generous contribution to our road budget too ;)
Much love :D
So, I came here to cover these things, and now I end up learning some things I hadn't even heard about
Singapore supplied us with weapons
TIL
I'd also add a thanks to Croatia for being the one neighbor we were never at war with, and I can't wait for you guys to join Schengen, so the stupid border checks can be a thing of the pre-WW1 past again
Been there, it is so beautiful
I absolutely loved it
I would prefer to be on the outskirts a bit, a nice house in smaller village or town <3 But first I at least need a remote job
Singapore supplied us with SAR (Singapore Assault Rifle), which were using 5,56 NATO ammo
The gun caused serious wounds, the bullet had enough velocity to tear through body but not enough to break bones
It caused the bullet to turn into a pinball inside human body, bouncing from bone to bone and tearing organs
Doctors were helpless
Yes I do and you can see this "European culture" in threads where we wonder why Americans do certain things and where Americans wonder why we do certain things
Europeans are different but we do have a same view and culture about certain things
I believe in both
I am a European but I am also Slovene
I don't think we should loose our national identities because it enriches Europe
I think it's what makes us great (thanks Trump for ruining that word forever)
It also provides some security I think
Because a huge entity has its issues
I can't help but look at America and be worried
> Millions of men have been willing to fight and die and kill for their national and religious identities, but I have yet to encounter a man willing to do so for something as nebulous as Europe
Millions (well, thousands) of men were willing to fight and die for their feudal lords and gods, but I have yet to encounter a man in year 200 AD who's willing to do so for something as nebulous as the United Kingdom
Hey there Croatia
We just sell guns to yall
Edit: flair slovenia
[A picture says more than a thousand words]
No, that's a brand
You probably meant deciliter
There was one with "Working in Germany" in the middle
The more I learn about Finland, the weirder it gets
Yes
One is in the [shower] and the [other] is outside of bathtub/shower on bathroom floor
Entire Slovenia felt it
I'm in [Celje] and it was bad
It woke me up and I was just waiting if I'll have to hide somewhere
I also felt another one around 7:02
I can't imagine how horrible it felt in Zagreb
Just a bit more perspective:
Nuclear power plant Krško is just 40 km away from Zagreb
No damages here, but it woke me up all right
Everything in my room was shaking
Unsettling shit
2020 _please_. Haven't we had enough
I live 75 km away from Zagreb but I was asleep and didn't feel anything
Friends said that they felt it and woke up
I guess I'm kind of used to shaking now as I live next to a quarry and can often feel explosions
felt it when i was sleeping though it wasnt that bad
Can confirm
I live on the coast and didn't feel a thing
I woke up all of a sudden, didn't know why
i found out later
And yet I didn't wake up
I didn't feel anything in Ljubljana
Lake bled turned red
Several injured, 15 yo girl in critical condition (has already been reported dead but that has just been denied by the hospital) according to the main croatian media
I hope she makes it
Im in Sarajevo as well and there was no shaking
>damn draft
Promaja, the first, second and third cause of death in the Balkans
Same
An asteroid hit us a month or so ago
I got the joke, but who/what is Székely
Is it like your everyman or something
Yeah, Slovenia and Croatia together already had a trifecta in less than a month
Meteor, virus, earthquake
And it also snowed in some parts today
Do you know what exploded
Or at least tell us in which city
That was fast
I thought it was a last name
Thanks

I like it
Small (2 hour drive from the Alps to the seaside), one of the safest countries, solid standard of living, solid education and health systems
Could do with a bit less blatant corruption, but this is sort of a consequence of living in a small country where most people know most people :D
I like life here
Slovenia is safe, egalitarian, fairly progressive, has good infrastructure, good social safety nets and a high standard of living
I, however don't like the political situation at all
Janša is highly corrupt and buds with Orban, fortunately he has plenty of opposition
&#x200B;
If things do go to shit however, I'll most likely move to Austria, or failing that, Croatia
I never feel too far from home there
Move the frick out
No good food like Doritos, we have no Spotify, I don't know were to find Persona 5 royal, no foreign food
At least McDonalds icecream machine works
Good btw
could say so
I'm from here, yes :)
All young (under 40) people speak more or less solid English and a lot of older folk as well
Tourism is good, but our coast, while O.K.-ish is not the best part
That would be the Bled and Bohinj lakes (in my opinon), some spas and Prekmurje region
Finding a "tourist farm" to sleep etc
is quite great
100 %
I love it
Slovenia is very diverse naturally and culturally
On the west we have contact with romance speaking Europe, on the north with germanic Europe and we are a slavic speaking country that has contact with the slavic Balkans on the south side
And all these diverse cultures influenced us
Then geographically we have the sea, we have the Alps, we have the pannonian plain and large areas of beautiful hilly landscape
We have also the northernmost tip of the dinaric mountain range, with a typical karstic labdscape and large plateaus covered with forests
We can grow grapes and olive trees
We have a mediterranean and a continental temperate climate
I think that we really have no reason to complain
Lada Niva was very popular
Lada overall was also pretty popular
But we had our own domestic cars that were cheaper and about as (un)reliable
I think it would be customary here to ask how much we owe
If he was to take the 10% literally he would have given the 1€, but I get what you're saying
Edit: Nope I'm just a little stupid
That's how they do it in Lidl and Hofer here
One reason why I don't like going there if I have a lot to buy
You have to throw everything in to the cart and bag it at the counter
Although they calmed down a bit now
When they first arrived here it was chaos
No, you sit down here and they come and take your order
We also did that in Scotland
Sat down and waited for a long time for someone to come which they never did
Then we saw other people go directly to the counter
Weird
Except when bar is packed then you go and other because otherwise they won't see you
In great Balkan country of Slovenia we do for  quite a long time and [Ljubljana] is really successful
Some Croatian cities are also recycling pretty well
Yeah I just checked my math, it told me I'm dumb
Was thinking of 10% of 10€. Sorry
I don't think it's most
Maybe a few
You even need to buckle up your pets here or have them in a transporter which need to also be secured
Most original Slovenian fairy tales and stories are dark af
My mother had to forbid my grandmother from reading them to me since I wouldn't sleep at night after them
I don't remember too much about them, but I think people tended to get lost to magical entities a lot and only sporadically returned, and there was a mass murder of dog-headed people
Oh we had the same game here
"Kdo se boji črnega moža?" I always imagined this black man as some kind of boogey man and not like actual black person
I formed a theory that the black man is in fact reffered to the Moors
Sailors brought back stories of Moors kidnapping people, hence the game
IDK this might just be my ramblings :)
Exactly, I imagined him as a black fat scarecrow
r/unexpectedmontypython
My friend once had an erasmus student from the Czech republic in his dorm
One day he came home saying that he found a cool bar nearby
After some talk, they realized the bar was 4km away
Not really 'nearby' by our standards
I'm not a native speaker but I can speak English for as long as I can remember
I've always associated cheers with Australian English in the Cheers mate/Steve Irwin way
But then again I grew up watching crocodile hunter on animal planet so that could be the reason lol
Well, I don't really feel 'Slovene' but at the same time I don't feel like anything else, really
Besides, people put too much emphasis on national identity, so I'm not too worried about it
Certainly not seen like that
It's seen as acceptable on certain occasions although obviously not any time
In rural areas it's a lot more common
Aye
In rural aread it is an everyday standard
Lots of people getting wasted at local bars and restaurants
Oh, you mean šnops
We have a similar saying "klin se s klinom zbija".
There is also some truth to that because of how alcohol gets digested/transformed inside the liver
He's probably feom ljubljana
I only know of 1 and I am still baffeled why it is there and how it got there but generaly no they are not
We never had that before
We didn't have religious extremists
Now unfortunately people are copying the US and yes, we actually have jesus loves you billboard that take you to antiabortion sites
Another issue that was never a thing before they started copying americans
there are, actually
They are far more passive and I usually see them when going home from school
Most common theme is 'Jesus loves you'. Honestly don't mind them that much, since they're not as up-front
Never seen one of those here
But we do have some large billboards advertising a certain right wing party
Which is even worse
I know of a couple, but they are rare enough to make you turn and recheck if you saw correctly
One is adjacent to a church anyway and they often put up some motivational quote instead of an actual religious message (it currently reads 'If something is important, you will find a way -  if it is not, you will find an excuse
I saw another just yesterday and it read 'God is the way' or something rather neutral like that
It also looked like the graphic designer did his job for the first time ever
We also have some weird youth organisation that promotes Christian values that sometimes puts cringy billboards up, but I'm not opening their website to give an example
Where is it
I don't think I've ever seen anything like that here
I've also seen one
It is in front of a church but I don't know if it counts because it's usually more like general motivation to be kind to others
I've seen quite a few
It's on this building:
Huh I wonder why google street view cuts out just before that village and restarts after O_o

Every time I hear portuguese my brain goes "ok, this sounds like us, but i can't understand a single thing
Must be portuguese
“Burek”, it’s not Slovene in origin but here you’ll find it everywhere in the major cities, it’s essentially fried flaky dough with fillings such as meat and the like
I don't think we have any that would be typical ours, they're all "stolen". The two most common would have to be Burek and Kebab
That's just a normal hot dog here
No one thinks it's anything special
> Schnitzelsemmel
That's the typical food you pack in your backpack when you go hiking here
Some people hang them up for holidays, and they are also used for sporting events
I think it wouldn't be weird if someone owned one
For Slovenia it's normal to be hung up on certain holidays
It was an
*interesting* experience coming out of the airport in Copenhagen and there were a lot of people at the exit waving small danish flags, looking a lot like what a reception for some VIP would look like here
Too little competition in the market of telecommunication services
If you don't care for a pack of internet, TV, stationary and mobile phones, there is little choice and it is comparatively way more expensive
The housing crisis is real
Housing prices have gone up 15% in 2020 alone
The average price of houses sold in Ljubljana last year was 330,000 € while the average gross salary is 1,753 €/month (which comes to 1,133 € after taxes)
I don't know who is the owner of infrastructure and I don't think it is as much of an issue as forcing the packet deals
I don't care for TV and stationary phone, my company pays for my mobile (if I even cared to have it in the pack, there are better options available), so I only need fast internet
It is something like 70% the price of the 4-pack
Also another issue is that the providers can change conditions like price and force them on you with no repercussions
You can switch 'for free' then, except they are going to make you pay off all the discounts they gave you
You chose this provider for the price, they changed it, and it is extremely expensive to go somewhere else before the contract is up
When fibre came around, they jacked up the prices
When 4G came around, they jacked up the prices
Let's just say I'm not holding my breath for change
If I remember correctly, our history teacher showed us a video where a children's cartoon was interrupted with news of Tito's death in May 1980
Can't find the video anywhere, so no link
Sorry
Now everything is left vs right though
I'm really sick of it
Yes and we're mocking them for it, yet we're gulping up exactly what brought them where they are
We want to feel superior and hate so badly that we'll take everything down
It's tragic because it's so preventable
I haven't been to the the US but what I see online and in the media is awful
People despise each other
I once tried asking lefties (I consider myself pretty left), who were completely against the idea of getting along what the end goal is
They are so fueled by hate that no one had an answer
I think it has a lot to do with their media and how dramatic americans are
They have been led to believe that you have to constantly fight everyone for what "is right" but what is right is very up to interpretation
They mock and hate people who advocate for getting along
I really don't want us to end up that way
~~Jurij~~ Jur, used for a thousand

We use Krigl for beer too, I much prefer the Krigl glasses than the more modern wine-looking glasses for beer
And we use Klaftra/Klafter for firewood as well
Woops, true
I'mma nominate the [Škocjan caves] in Slovenia
> and OFC
Lake Bled, Slovenia
PLS NO
We have so many much better things
Lake Bohinj
Soča river valley, Škocjan caves if we're going by natural beauty
I mean thanks for the nomination, but seriously, Bled is sooo overrated -_-
The music
I learnt to appreciate some of it, like Avsenik and Slak
[This] and [this] are one of the nicest songs ever
I can't even believe I'm able to admit it
Same actually, I used to detest it
I think the main thing that changed it for me was giving the classics like Avsenik and Slak a fair try
I also quite like some of the songs by Beneški fantje, especially because of the clear Italian influence in their music
Rdeči cvet is my favouriet obviously
Not sure what you mean, since there's pretty much 1:1 mapping between Serbian Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, and we could easily represent Russian Cyrillic with Latin characters just as well without requiring any special new characters beyond the soft and hard signs
Mostly countries that we were fully or partially part of
Austria(if that counts as we were basically Austrian for centuries )
France
Germany/HRE
Italy/Rome
Probably Turkey because of Turkish raids
Francia would also be studied quite a lot
Austria, Hungary, Italy for sure, then France, maybe Russia
Also the Roman empire
Yeah, I included that with Italy
nothing has intrinsic value
not goods, not money (which is called fiat money because its value is set by the government/society and is not pegged to a physical good)
virtual goods have "value" because there is a demand for them
that is why there are chinese world of warcraft gold digging bots and league of legends account selling
how is this different from gambling for monopoly money or some such worthless item
because as soon as people spend actual cash on it, that is what its value becomes
really
what is its intrinsic value
thats not a value
those arent VALUES, those are properties
you dont understand
the properties are intrinsic, the value is given to it by people
people who VALUE it are driven to "kill societies for it", its not something the gold does intrinsically on its own
shoes dont care about feet, people do
food or water doesnt care about being consumed, people do
once again, people are giving them values , those values are not intrinsic to the object/item
Slovenians don't post memes
But on r/Slovenia I saw neon genesis Evangelion opening but it was Janez Janša lol
i couldn't stop laughing lol
Noone really, Austria looks down on us, balkan thinks of us like we are part of Austria
Personally, culturally we are very close to Austrians, so I do feel at home, when im there, and Austria is SO beautiful
How is life in Greenland
Wow, that was so sweet, yes many people kinda know how to speak Croatian, because of Yugoslavia, my generation (after 1991) don't really know the language that well, we do have plenty of Bosnians here who really like to talk loudly in public spaces, meaning i do get to learn some words, there isn't a sentence they say, without a curse word lol
The difference is though, that unlike Croatia, Slovenia was basically almost entirely destroyed by Austria
If history had gone just a little bit differently we would have been like the Sorbs
Just look at post WW1, already tiny Slovenia was looking to be half it's modern size and landlocked
Slovenia's history was basically having been almost completely assimilated mostly by Austria to the point of being 90% identical
Southern Austrians, like Carinthians and Styrians, literally are largely just Slovenes that started speaking German
That is why we have so much more in common with Austria than Croatia
Austria entirely defined Slovenia, if Austria didn't exist nowadays Slovenia would basically be a slightly smaller Austria
Croatia is really close to Slovenia, but it's just like I said, I personally see almost no difference whatsoever when I go to Austria
Only the language changes
With Croatia though, while our two countries are similar, once you exit the roughly Kajkavian speaking region, the Mediterranean and Balkan influences are definitely much stronger and more noticeable
In contrast to Austria where the entire country feels the same
We're just not important enough for any of them to realise that though
This is a tradition in Slovenia too, but during Easter, not as a wedding tradition
If given the opportunity, how would you redesign your country's flag
My boyfriend said a lighter blue and green instead of red would make more sense, considering our jerseys tend to be colored that way
Yeah, I love unique flags
UK's is one of my favourites
Japan, Canada and Kenya's are also beautiful
Between all the other Nordic crosses and the other countries with Union Jacks in their flags I fail to see how the UK's flag is any more unique than tricolour flags
Yeah
It's a huge plus
Happy Cake Day
I'm assuming you're trying to turn it into a Scottish flag, but in that case you'd have to remove the horizontal ones
I agree
I think a nice lime green would fit pretty well
I think a flat colour for the background wouldn't work that well
Especially white
I'd say the 3rd one
Interesting note about purple - historically, purple dye was really expensive (why is why purple flags weren't a thing)
Now that we're in the modern era with synthetic dyes, purple is actually a viable choice
Dammit, your pun is better
Replacing the red not the blue
No, definitely not
But it'd be odd if you had a job and didn't help with expenses, like paying some bills and buying food
Not really, no
Maybe baby human fish could be it
One of them, Viktor, lost his leg in a fight but it grew back
I once heard an American describe Slovenian language as "German-Russian language".
Looking at text messages: Where are all the vowels
Actual language: Woah, how tf can words like "Vrtec" or "Čmrlj" exist
Sorry to all the Dutch people but to me Dutch sounds like fake German

99% of people, including busses, don't have winter tires on yet, so it causes a traffic collapse, trees still carry leaves and can get broken, and in the end it just melts and autumn is suddenly wet again, only no beautiful colours are left

In daily life not so much for example you don't need to bribe a doctor to get a proper service in a hospital
But corruption in politics or in major construction projects that is completely different story
[Ansambel Lojzeta Slaka - Studenček]
I'm a big fan of nuclear power and I really hope we get some EU funding for the second block
It might give us the much needed push to get it done
Same
I absolutely hate airports and flying takes so long, that it would be much more efficient to go by train
We really screwed up by relying on airplanes instead of building better railway systems
Came here to mention an EU-wide network of nuclear powerplants to completely replace the fossile fuel ones and give the EU energy independence
Happy to see a fellow Slovenian is thinking the same way (even if just locally)
Sure it does
It goes towards Germany almost killing its neighbors' power grids when it surges
And towards Germany still having a horrible emissions per capita ratio from power generation, because you gotta back up sun and wind
And towards Germany paying ungodly prices for electricity
So it goes towards the worst of all worlds
Well in case mass orders would drive the cost down, sure :D Nuclear is not always the most cost-effective idea, it really depends on available resources and pre-existing infrastructure
That would be a good idea for an EU regulation - absolute prohibition of opening new coal plants to be extended to any sort of fossil fuel plants by 2045
Choosing between 2 and 3 is like choosing between supporting global warming and supporting an irrational fear

Some are quite nice, I would prefer most of them instead of today popular 3 letters names
Whether or not raisins belong in a [potica] I personally think they don't, but according to a recent debate on our national sub, a large number of my fellow countrymen would disagree
Sounds exactly like the Union vs Laško debate in Slovenia
Raisins must be in
Not a big fan of potica in the first place, but raisins make it better
No raisins
The only reason not to put raisins in potica is if you do not like raisins
I think that divides the country more
People who like raisins and savages who don't.
In Slovenia we (colloquially) use both
How those two words are this international, I have no idea
It looks something like [this]
You put them in the nut filling
You can see them clearly at the bottom in the [picture that's on Wikipedia]
We percieve distances differently
What might be a normal work commute in big countries is a pretty long trip for us especially when you cross like 2 or 3 different regions
Also we think that countries that consider themselves small but are bigger than us are big
You basically have to learn another language if you don't want to be stuck in one place your whole life
Also, odds are you're probably gonna consume a lot of foreign media if the small amount of stuff you get at home isn't up your alley
You also typically get used to people from other countries not knowing anything at all about your country (which is both a blessing and a curse)
We get 0 cool bands/concerts
We literally have a company that organizes tickets+transfer to neighboring countries (and Germany, etc)
All of the major concerts I've been to were abroad
>foreigners tend to view us like some exotic animal
I feel that part
Happens to me all the time when I'm travelling, but I find it somehow amusing
People remember you more and it's often easier to find a host on Couchsurfing because they try to colour the map:)
Can relate
Literally no one speaks slovene outside slovenia, bar some minorities sprinkled around the world
There's a joke that Slovenia could win a war against America since they will never find us on the map
Your sloths walk

More as a tourist attraction than serious food
I don't think I know anyone who's ever tasted it
So you're saying the Slovenian minority had all those problems with quite literal Nazi-successors
Well that explains a lot
There is the Markovec highway tunnel, actually in Koper, my hometown
Firstly, I regard this tunnel a massive urban planning mistake, as the highway is just one former regular road that was tansformed in a 4 lane highway that cuts the town in half, a unique example of this kind of genius in Slovenia
It is quite clear that the plans for it were lobbied by politicians who thought they were more intellingent then skilled planners
The initial plan was actually to continue building the highway towards the next town on the sea coast itself, thus destroying its natural beauty and touristic potential
Luckily those plans changed after Slovenia became independent, deciding to do a tunnel under the hill called Markovec
Well, after the year 2004 they finally begun to think about its construction
It took 9 repetitons of the public procurement process to choose the construction company, and innumerable burocratic complications, stealmates, complaints etc, for less then 4 km of highway
Well, at least the construction went without problems and now the tunnel serves its purpose
Another example could be the 6th block of the Šoštanj coal powerplant
The decision for building it was taken in a very werd way, without a large political consensus and based on flawed assumptions
Initially it was meant to cost about half a billion euros
After the construction finished the price more then doubled, to about 1 billion and 200 million I think
It was a complete failure of project management and then of course the whole thing smelled of corruption so much, that the police and prosecutors took a special case of the case
Now a few people (inculding the former director of the powerplant) are convicted
Plus, now we know the initial assumed price of coal was estimated to be too low, it is actually higher
The whole powerplant now operates with losses and relies on imported coal instead of reliying on the coal from the near Velenje coal mine
And, as if it weren't enough, the block has regular malfunctions because of which it has to be taken off grid for several months at the time for repairs
I think this is enough for now
Don't wanna even start to speak about the second rail between Koper and Divača, for which the planning process started in 1995, with the construction (if we will be lucky) starting in 2021
I don't think so
I've been to a shopping center supermarket yesterday and everything seemed normal
I was also shopping for my grandma who has an injured leg and can't go out and I seemed the most 'panicked' if anyone looked into my shopping cart
No, but last weak I seen a guy in a supermarket parking lot wearing surgical mask and corona virus is trough last weak always on the front page of news sites
It's not like water's gonna dry up
I don't understand stocking up on toilet paper at all
Facemasks are gone, same as everywhere, and disinfectants are running low as well (couldn't find any hand sanitizer, had to get 70% ethanol from the pharmacy)
Sales of paracetamol are up too, from what I've seen and overheard
We don't expect to have to drop poo in unison tho, so no rush to buy toilet paper lol
When the shit hits the fan
is you still a fan
Facemasks have been gone for over a month
You can still order Dezikim Derm (65%) on Bent

I’m an etymology buff, so I love words that have a very interesting origin
Here are some examples in Slovene:
**hrepenenje** (desire) - comes from the word “krepeneti” (to become hard), which is related to “krepak” (strong)
No idea how this happened, but it’s interesting as its distinctly Slovene
**mavrica** (rainbow) - it’s a diminutive of “mavra” (word that was borrowed from Latin Maura) which means “woman from North Western Africa” or English “Moorish woman”. In the medieval times women from that part of the world wore very [colorful clothing] as compared to Slovenes
That’s the reason why the old Slovene word for rainbow named *pijavka* (related to piti which means to drink) was replaced with mavrica
**medved** (bear) - this is common Slavic as well
It’s a composite of med- (honey) and esti (to eat)
Bear in Slovene and Slavic is literally “honey eater”. The -v- is part of an old u-base of the proto-slavic noun mȅdъ (honey)
**zdravje** (health) - in Slovene and other Slavic languages the same meaning, often used to cheers by saying “na zdravje” meaning “to the health
”. The word is actually a composite of “sъ” and “dőrvъ”, literally meaning “good wood”.
As a Slovene Littoral that borrows heavily from Veneto/Friuli, I can agree
Depends on which of the fuckton of Littoral dialects you speak, but generally, yeah
perfect name for a turtle
Talking Tom was invented by a Slovenian man
and now he is the richest man in our country
Of course this is not slovenian biggest invention but I find it interesting
But some od the great inventions are:
Tungaj transformer,
ELF EMMIT( digital headband that releases harmless electromagnetic pulses that encourage your brain to work in sync with your preferred state of mind)
And Peter Florjančič who conceived the PERFUME ATOMIZER and AIRBAGS
Probably modern beekeeping, which was pioneered by Anton Janša in the 18th century
Herman Potočnik was also one of the first people to design a theoretical space station
CCS is practically already a standard, it just needs formalisation
I'm however quite afraid that Tesla is going to screw us over like Apple did with charger
They prefer paying fines the EU to using standard chargers
Companies with too much power
What I'd like to see is a standard for electrical safety in cars
At the moment everyone just somewhat believes that everything is going to be fine, because people are somewhat prevented from accessing high voltage parts
I work for a safety testing company and it took us about a minute to expose vital (and decisively high voltage) components
Don't tell me idiots in cars won't do that
edit: typo
Are there different track gauges though
I'm only aware of Russia having a different one than everyone else
Unless you count narrow gauge railway, but those networks are usually small
Standardizing signalling and communication is actively being worked on with various levels of ETCS, but the question is how much the countries will adopt it
It's much bigger of a problem IMO than the power systems, as multi system locosomotives have been the standard for cross border trains for a while now, but it doesn't help if a locomotive supports a power system, but not the safety system used in a country
Platforms though
Those are a mess even in a single country
We had an affair a while ago when the railway from Pragersko to Hodoš here was newly electrified, but the platforms on some stations were too far from where the train would stop, so there was be too much of a gap between the platform and the stopped train
Thus most of the electric trains that were planned to be used on the route couldn't stop at those stations
Allright, I didn't know that
Great to hear
Interesting, didn't know that
Thanks
I would like to thank our neighbouring countries for having an IKEA
Did you just
forget
there’s a whole country between Austria and Croatia
Or did i misunderstand something
Anyways we’re used to it
And we get to invade your coasts every year
It has one under construction currently
Dunno, man
Honestly summers in slovenian countryside wouldn't be the same without lost czech tourists driving around in the middle of nowhere
But yeah the vignette system could definitely be better
At least there are weekly and monthy ones available now (which are still pretty expensive, comparative to austria)
[Cockta] for sure
Yugoslavias answer to Coca Cola, still quite popular today
Also Im not sure if Radler counts since it can have a small percentage of alcohol
In any case [Union's radler] is quite popular, particularly the grapefruit version
And there is also [Ora] which is similar to Fanta
Kvass is only eastern Europe thing
West and south slavs don't drink that at all
Well the Cockta in Slovenia is marketed as original nowadays
But you'd have to ask someone who was alive in communist times if it is actually original
Yep the "original" is definitely a mixture of beer and lemonade
Nowadays its often used just as a generic name for any non-alcoholic beer with a fruit taste
Yes, I do, very very much
But I have my YouTube set to GB because trending videos in Slovenia are horrible
OK, Slovenia is always left outside, it seam that this is again the case or am I just unable to find this function
English
Haven't seen a single game worth playing that had a Slovenian translation yet
Since last year or 2018 i think for the first time in human history more people live in cities than in the countryside
My current language ambition is to not have issues with people from China speaking or writing English
Some formations they are prepared to construct is just baffling, while I have trouble dumbing my writing down to the level I'm reasonably sure they will understand
Apart from that, some German would come in handy (my reason for picking French in middle school was honestly dumb and I just don't go skiing there often enough to keep it in shape), and I could use Croatian enough to become fluent in it
Yes
I speak Slovene, Italian, English and Croatian a bit, but still see French and German as huge lacunae in my skills
Probably WWII bomb disposal would be most powerfull
Wrong country
Tsar was in Russia I am from Slovenia
No problem mate we always get confused with Slovakia and this time it was Russia :D
It is but it's ok we're used to it
My grandma LOVES to tell that joke to everybody new she meets
Thank you Croatia for all the summer vacations, my childhood wouldn't be the same without you
You mean, like, water, from the toilet
We have two, one is a specific place called Rovte, it exists and is a village in the middle of nowhere
The other one would be a nonspecific placed called vukojebina, the literal translation would be "place where wolves fuck".
I don't work in healthcare but from what I heard our medical workers signed agreements they'll be available 24/7, do 12 hour shifts and will take no day offs
They prepared beds in hospitals for them so they don't have to leave and possibly infect others
I also heard they agreed they will keep working even if showing signs of infection but only with patiens who have confirmed infection
Again, this is not an official information
Our government made it illegal to sell desinfectant and other protective gear to anyone but government institutions
I bought a bottle for myself, my grandma and my parents just in the right time
Yep, I definitely agree
I don't think they give a crap in what kind of bottles they get it currently
And no, 500ml bottles are standard in hospitals on tables and in wall dispensers
Yea, I thought about those after I posted my reply
No idea if people bought those as well
I did, but I bought mine for cleaning my car windshield lol
In Ljubljana there’s a law that prohibits building anything higher than the Ljubljana caste(which is 100m)
Kdor ni skrit, naj se gre solit - He who is not hidden, should go salt himself
Speaking of bosnian, serbian and croatian
Most people don't care but because of the wars some people do
For instance my friend was thrown out of a store in croatia because she used the serbian word for bread (unintentionally)
Exactly yeah
Not thrown out but told to leave the store and that they don't sell "hleba".
> peanutsauce on fries
I'mma need a recipe here
for a friend
In Slovenia there was a company named Jogi that was making mattresses
Now we call mattresses "jogi".
Radenska for any mineral water
I believe it is widely exported, but it is only used as general name here
TIL Jacuzzi is a brand
We use quite a number of these as well, but the obvious difference is superga (after Superga, I think they are an Italian brand) for sneaker
We also call a hairdryer “fen” (pronounced very similarly to “fön”)
Actually, most types of screws are called after brand names and sometimes don't even have a different name
Philips comes to mind for one of the variants with cross tip
I didn't know that and imagined that jacuzzi was a type of hot tub
My mind is now blown a bit
It's only a bit more than 2 hours away from me
Yes, in Slovenian we use "zmaj" for both a kite amd a dragon
In Slovene we have the same thing, both are called "zmaj", which means "dragon".
Yup, was there 2 years ago
Teen israeli girls were laughing their heads off, they were starting to get on my nerves, because they were so loud
You dont have to cry there, but be respectful of the place where thousands died
You should educate the pour soul
It wasn't their fault they didn't know it was actually the other way around
The castle was built first and the royal family wanted a private airport for themselves
It wasn't until the peasants rebelled that they were forced to give it up and now they are constantly annoyed by the noise of aircrafts flying overhead
Bloody democracy
Goran Bregović is known in the UK
waw
That should get anyone straight-up deported, following a massive fine
You're not dumb, you just don't understand what it means to have freadom of speech
Ex-yu languages use the same or a very similar word
It is quite magnificent
Do you get people who moved out and can't stop attempting to humiliate you over the fact that you stayed
We get some of that on local forums and it just makes me want to stay a bit more in case I turn into one of them
My local internet community gets it from people who moved to stay
It looks a bit sad, like they haven't managed to create a social circle there and their only source of joy now is putting people down over their choices in life
When I was still living near Slovenian-Austrian border I liked to go driving around Austrian Styria or Austrian Carinthia
But now that I live in Ljubljana I don't do that anymore
We go to Austria everytime a trip to IKEA is necessary
One's being built in Ljubljana, though
It deoends on where you live
I live in a tiny country so I will go to IMAX in Croatia, shopping or skiing in Italy or Austria, for a swim on the other side of the country to Croatia and so on
In Slovenia, having to commute more than 20 minutes is considered cruel and unusual punishment
Driving 1 hour away is considered a day trip that requires sandwiches being packed
Tongue in cheek obviously, but not far from the truth ;)
If I may make a recommendation, take one day for Ljubljana, one day for the trip to the Soča Valley (go rafting if it's late spring/early summer), and one day for the trip to Piran, stopping at and visiting the Škocjan Caves and the Predjama Castle
And if you have an extra day, visit lake Bohinj
You'll pass through Bled on the way to Bohinj (unless you take some back roads)
It's fine to stop and taste their "Kremšnita" (local pastry), but despite it being the most well-known Slovenian tourist place, trust me when I say that Bohinj blows it out of the water (try the local "Grmada" pastry there :)
If you're gonna be spending that long in Slovenia, I'd also recommend a visit to the north-east regions of Štajerska and Prekmurje
The former has two cities dating back to Roman times (Celje and Ptuj) and there are some Roman-related things along the highway as you travel east (well-signposted)
Once you cross the Mura river, you're in Prekmurje, and there I'd recommend you drive to just about any village guesthouse and sample a local bograč (goulash), dödöli (potato thing) and prekmurska gibanica (local pastry)
Also, if you're into "energies", there's Lake Bukovnica that's supposedly quite decent energy-wise, and there's the Grad Castle, which is an interesting one to check out
There's also quite a few historical workshops one can check out here (pottery, basketweaving, blacksmithing etc
), and since this region was quite cut off from the rest of Slovenia for most, a visit to the regional museum in Murska Sobota castle might be interesting
And if you're interested in WW2, there's a monument to the partisans and the red army together with 2 field guns from the time
Anyway, I'll stop spamming you here, but if you feel like you want some more help planning the trip, feel free to DM me when the time comes :)
(Serbo)-Croatian due to Yugoslavia and just general similarities
Serbo-Croatian because of Yugoslavia
Also German, because it's taught in some high schools
For slovenia is german
My mom knows it and they taught german insted of english I think
Probably Croatian/Serbo-Croatian cause we were still part of Yugoslavia 29 years ago and everyone HAD to learn Serbo-Croatian
Balkan languages (Serbian, Croatian etc)
But if you mean official, then Hungarian and Italian
Yes while in schools german is most widely learned
(Probably not in the regions next to Italy tho)
In my experience, there's 2 groups of people who know how to actually use computers:
Those that got their start in DOS or at the very, VERY latest in Win XP
Those that grew up poor enough that they had to pirate games/software
It seems to me that the generations born in the 70s and 80s were the peak of the bell curve and now we're going back towards computer illiteracy
My nephews, nieces, and cousins under the age of 20 are waaay more clueless than my mom when handling a computer, and she isn't exactly brilliant at it either
Not surprised
Parents don't take time to teach kids computer skills because they themselves don't  know how or just seat them in front of the TV
I know so many parents with small kids all proud of themselves that they don't allow their kids to play video games
The person was explaining this when the kids were alone in front of tv for more than an hour with the remote control
In schools computer science is not taken very seriously just yet
Also add the fact that desktops are pretty much obsolete with nontech crowd
So how could they learn
I even met millennials with less then satisfactory computer skills and they grew up with them
I mean, I mostly spend time with CS students, but even my other friends do at least know their way around the Windows UI
> As a side note, they consistently tended to refuse to read error messages which were telling what to do and call me for help whenever something popped up
That is the single most gear-grinding thing EVER
And it cuts across generations
Very
It would be legal but unfortunatelly everyone wants their laws to get passed because they're being paid by diferent lobies
On the right side of subreddit there are comunity options and there you can set your flair
Are you sure you are in AskEurope subreddit
I mean, fair, but is Ukraine really the destination you choose because you can't deal with a bit of corruption
Železna cesta/iron road is a poetic word for železnica
To elaborate on this, železnica means "the iron thing" (female)
That's the general word for railroad
The tracks specifically are tiri (plural, male) or tirnice (plural, feminine), which supposedly comes from protoSlavic, basically meaning the path that someone makes where there was none before
[Not much] no
Even in green areas you'll find people
Or bears
Yes, quite a lot of it
Well you would run in small villages here and there, but generally there is quite some wilderness here
Especially in the Alps and over the vast forested dinaric plateaus
I may have just climbed out of my cave after 2 years of sitting in one place but I am pretty sure that bears don't count as human civilization and I am pretty sure the virgin forests of Kočevje wanna talk to you
One of our previous PM's and current mayor of Ljubljana was born in Serbia
He's controversial for other reasons
I do not care and I think most people over here would not care either
As long as he's not a jerk, it's fine
All that aren't tooting their lies
This only goes for current government
All of them
Because the current right wing leading party controls directly just one TV channel which is small and pathetic (and funded by Orban)
All other media companies are regarded as 'communist' by them, even if they are actually nowadays quite liberal and were just founded in Yugoslav times
Actually the most left wing newspaper is Mladina, which ironically used to employ also the current prime minister 30 years ago
Actually since Janša took power again, he has been engaging in endless twitter wars with slovenian and even foreign journalists
Pathetic
The national one here in Slovenia
Yes, it's that bad
So, you are saying that basically every newspaper except Nova24 and Demokracija
So sad
Sounds a bit like China, but without all the effort put in censorship and survelliance technologies
And Reporter and Družina
And Ognjišče. Probably missing something
Yeah, better comparisons
However, still not a good situation
I wonder what would it take for Orban to get defeated
No matter how unlikely, I hope it happens soon
I hope it happens soon also for the sake of us
Yeah, but I've noticed more women (usually 30-60 years old) who wear tshirts with cringey overused quotes like 'live laugh love' and shit like that
I'm almost certain 95% of women that age own a few shirts with love and/or happiness quotes on them
Yep same here
I just have shirts saying "Generic
at least those mean something
go to zara, h&m or similar stores and all their shirts have some random word and number combination that dont mean anything
i get they try to avoid copyright, but why not make an in-store character or phrase instead of just putting gibberish on shirts
We only just got our first Primark though
Have seen a bunch of boys/young men covered in that stuff since its opening
True
Quotes are still better than nonsense
Haven't been there yet, do you know maybe how crowded it is
I'm assuming since it barely opened it's packed with people
Happened to be there a few days after the opening and it was stuffed with both tourists and locals
Don't know what it's like now
Try-hard cringe said in Steyermark accent
At least that's what popular TV and radio shows keep selling
At a bit higher level, I think satire is quite popular, or maybe just generally teasing politicians and celebrities
There are long running shows with imitators, and I also noted stand-up comedians creating a lot of jokes on this behalf
It's basically boomer humour and "haha man from ex-YU country funny". I think satire is also kinda popular, even our ex PM was a part of a satirical show
It's exaggerated
Nobody actually pronounces Js, so it's Loo-blah-nah
The best part is, this is the traditional pronunciation
The Js got stuck in in 19th century for no better reason than to fuck with kids when they learn spelling, and probably looking more civilized
Well, I giggled, so I guess it works
How would you describe homesickness
Well ask or president Pahor [picture]
This was from Kairo, where he met with Egyptian President Al-Sisi
This type of posing on stairs is now known a Boruting in Slovenia
I started to follow french politics and french news in general, but that is because I'll move there in the near future
I need to be up to date with what's going on
Alps in the middle of the thunderstorm, with no shelter in vicinty
Otherwise pretty much the same as elsewhere in Europe
13-14, but we have a pretty big drinking culture here
It's less common than it used to be
Ohh beautiful Balkans
I donate to local bands doing free online concerts
I almost never watch them, since they just make me miss the live music more, but they need all the support they can get
Given name (only one) + father's surname, or on rare occasions both father's and mother's surname
Interesting
and do woman change their surname if they marry
There's a famous Italian who changed her surname (Marzia Bisognin, Pewdiepie'd wife), now she makes herself call Marzia Kjellberg in social media
Is she just trying to brag that she married a swede
I don't know, in Slovenia it's not like that
I know that in Russia is for sure like that, but I don't know about the rest of the countries
Probably a maid in a local chateau
I have ancestors who were farmers, but they spoke German and were involved in court so i guess beeing the oldest, I would be excused from the army to work the field
But i have no idea whether I or one of my brothers would get the court job
Dead
Cooking and raising the kids
If I survived giving birth
Nothing, cause Slovenes didn't matter in Austria
Probably a merchant or barrista, likely to be married already with one or more children
Well a lot of people from the village I live in actually descend from the help
I think it’s actually how the village formed
Gardners had to live somewhere I guess so the chateau owner build them houses
I was told it was northern Norway
I seem to be a minority :)
This looks pretty brilliant
Now I'm wondering if something like this wouldn't be feasible for motorcycles
Pretty sure the UK is going to be the 52nd state (after Puerto Rico ofc) before Czechia is part of Russia
Any time you go onto the highway, expect a 2 hour ride to turn ibto at least a 4 hour ride
Road work ALL THE TIME
Worst of all, they're really slow
Surprised we seem to be the minority here - no
You can attend religion classes, but they are separate from school and in no way related
We are taught about religion, obviously, but no specific class for it
That's BS
It's left cheek, right cheek, lips
> the east speaks church slavonic
Well, Slavs do actually have an [almost-completely-intelligible-even-without-training-universal-language]
*Realistically*, there's no other option
But me - I would choose the 2nd biggest city Maribor
We don't deserve it, but it would be pretty cool
West Slovenia doesn't have to have everything, let us have the capital
I think Trst would be a better option
We're a country of 2 million
If we got annexed by [Italy/Austria/Hungary/Croatia] nobody would even notice we were gone
Let's see
Slovenia is important because if we in, y'all northerners would be waiting for days or making proper detours to get to Croatia in Summer
Not to mention that Austria and Italy can rest easy knowing that if they ever want to get rid of Trieste, Villach, and/or Klagenfurt, we'll happily take them off their hands
Seriously though
We're net recipients, though just barely and a couple of good years or another low-gdp-capita member would likely push us across into the net contributor range
We're at the intersection of east-west and south-north transport corridors, so it's convenient to have us as part of the single market
Depending on our government at the time, we support the austerity block or the gib monies block, so that's another vote in the Council for whichever side
And we provide Austria and Italy with mid-highly educated workers at discount though not dumping prices
Oh, and for a couple more weeks, we hold America by the balls
Yeah, you'd get all your correct mail
Nah, nobody really cares about Slovenia
Serbians and Bosnians are the ones to worry about when stirring things up
Nobody would care if Slovenia was gone
We were already under Austria in Austro-Hungary, so we've got a lot more western influences in us than all the other balkan countries that were under Hungary
Doubt it
Slovenia is like a miniature version of a lot of countries put together
We have the sea, mountains, rolling hills and lowlands
And everything is accessible by car in more or less an hour from the capital
You don't have to drive for 10 hours or get on a plane to get from one part of the country to the other
That's really cool (imo) when you get it in a complete package, but it would be just one more city with 300k people in Italy which you'll never visit, and another coastal town among thousands, and another ski resort among hundreds
I admire your sentiment, but as someone from a tiny country that's been someone's b**** for all of history up until 91, I share that stance with /u/Eurovision2006
It's actually kind of a compliment to you guys, and I do think how France has been stepping up for the past year or two has been great
You get the cheap brains that improve your economy and you pay for it by providing the cheap muscle with work, which improves your economy but hurts your people
It's unlikely you'll be able to counteract the latter while capitalizing on the former while in the EU
Wait times and the amount of money the state has to direct to it on top of all contributions by the workers
Generally I am happy with the system, however the wait times are too much
Oh and a cherry on top: a lot of doctors actually have a private side business that they do after work at the public hospitals
Their public job is a lot of times used just to get clients for their private clinic
For example orthopedic surgeons are notorious for telling people who come to them in a public hospital that they need a certain surgery or therapy and then they tell them: or you wait 6 months or you come to me in the afternoon and I do it immediately (but you pay a few thousand €)
However don’t be fooled, your situation is so bad that it requires immediate action
Well now it’s up to you ;)
+ longer waiting lines for procedures
+ corruption, money disappearing thru bogus purchases into private pockets
+ lower efficiency and quality, staff is paid thru a rigid pay-bracketing system regardless of the quality of service, they are overworked because there is not enough money for new hiring (see one point above) meanwhile private practices take the time for throughout examination and procedure to insure costumer satisfaction
+ not getting the doctors approval for a specialist appointment, because it costs money, and your condition hasn't deteriorated so far to make it necessary, of course once it has progressed enough, you are further delayed by longer waiting lines, before you actually reach the specialist it may be too late (cancer) or you have permanent damage despite the procedure
+ Your money is deducted from salary regardless, you have no say which agency gets it
On the plus side, it's still a lot better than reading stories from USA where giving birth can leave you bankrupt, but god dammit we have been waiting for too long for a government that would have the balls to clear this corrupted mess of the national insurance agency that is stealing our money in broad daylight
But every ruling party that started to deal with the mess fell apart in a matter of months, literally
In short dear America, do it, but do it better
Several doctors were sent to prison over this about 2 months ago, high-profile orthopedic surgeons ([
As long as you get a fair treatment if you come in on the public healthcare plan, and as long as they pay fair rents, I have no problem with doctors having public & private practices at the same institution
At least the equipment gets used round the clock and the hospital can spend the rent to buy even better equipment
Yeah, we used to be so proud of our medical system
Wow have we fallen
And now that you mention it, it's true: any Slovene government that starts a medical reform is a dead man walking
Well I am a bit sceptical about this because having a public and private practice inherently brings a clash of interest - especially if the private part of it does not represent just a 3 hour a week side job but the majority of your income
However I realise that the doctors working only in the public system are not paid enough and since a significant increase in their wages is not in sight, there is probably no other way than to allow such practices
After all, they enjoy much higher bargaining power - if they all quit their jobs at public hospitals, the system collapses
I would just like to point out that in the specific case that you mentioned the doctors were not sentenced for abusing their job at the public hospitals but because they were bribed in order to secure contracts for the delivery of certain medical materials on behalf of the hospitals
I agree with this
I have the impression that private medical insurance companies are one of the toughest lobbies in our country
They topple whole governments, block reforms and yet they remain somewhat under the radar of the average citizen
In SLO from every worker's paycheque an obligatory insurance fee  is deducted that goes to the public health insurance company
However, if you want to avoid additional charges for certain drugs (actually a long list) etc
you can pay an additional "voluntary insurance". However basically everybody pays it so it is more or less involuntary as it covers a vast amount of additional charges
This money on the other hand goes to private insurance companies
So far so good right
Well, no
From this money only a pretty small amount is actually spent on healthcare (idk the exact % but if I am not mistaken it is below 50%) so what is left is pocketed by the private insurance companies
EVERY government that tried to change this has ben toppled
The last attempt was in late 2019
Hungarian, totally incomprehensible to me
Same for Finnish, but I like the language more because of the elvish flavour
I can't make much sense of the baltics or Albanian either
I've never heard Basque and Maltese
In Greek i know just some basic greetings and in Irish just some basic words, I find both languages beautiful though
For all the rest, if one would speak really slow, i would probably have some low to medium degree of understanding
In Italy, the UK and the western balkans I would probably have higher degrees of understanding, since I speak the languages
Hungarian or Finnish language
Like, wtf even is that
I love the sound of Turkish when women speak it
It sounds super feminine and adorable to me, for some reason
I'll take that over the crazy that is 2342390457 tenses most non-Slavic languages have
Past
Present
Future
Done
And then someone from the west starts talking about a continuous future past
GTFO
-_-
Slovenian
Also, I distinctly recall seeing that in some (wannabe
-)archaic-sounding English texts
Portuguese is either Spanish people trying to speak Polish or Polish people trying to speak Spanish
Not sure which, but one of those
THANK YOU
I keep repeating this to everyone - Either Poles speaking Spanish or Spaniards speaking Polish
How someone can say that Portuguese sounds like anything remotely close to Russian is beyond me
...and Slovenian has that (different for 3-4 objects than 5+) _plus_ dual so three plurals :)
Dis is not juropijn spelink
Bat jur norsamerikn ingliš spelink is rekrsivli brejkink maj brejn
Yes
Slovenian:
pes laja (a dog is barking)
psa lajata (2 dogs are barking)
psi lajajo (3+ dogs are barking)
And about the counting, I assume you meant this beauty xD
1 pes, 2 psa, 3 psi, 4 psi, 5+ psov
My guess it's because Slovene women are strict when it comes to romance and want to know very precisely whether by "we'll have fun" you mean just her and yourself or also her friend
War of the roses and the spanish war
I just know they happened
> In Germany, when we look back at WWII we tend to be very focussed on the holocaust but sometimes we tend to forget the crimes that were committed in the occupied countries to the non-jewish population
Thank you for mentioning that
I absolutely don't want to take anything away from the Holocaust, but while 6 million Jews died, 30 million Slavs died in WW2 and nobody really cares
> What were the origins of Yugoslavia
Put super simply, after Slovenes and Croats were free from the Austrians, Hungarians, and Italians, i.e. post-WW1, they realized that staying solo would likely result in them getting reconquered by one or more of the former masters, so they thought let's join forces with Serbia as kind of equals
The original name was the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs
Well, soon after, Serbia, being the "senior partner", decided to throw its weight around, the name got changed (Slovenes and Serbs changed places), and power started centralizing more and more
Eventually the renaming to Yugoslavia happened
Post-WW2, Tito kept the brotherhood and unity alive through sheer force of his personality cult and secret police, and once he died, Serbia started centralizing power again
Eventually Slovenia and Croatia demanded a more federal system, Serbia disagreed, the Slovene and Croat delegations left the Parliament and that's how the dissolution started
Slovenia was in for 10 days of "war", partly because we didn't go along with the order from Belgrade to disarm and disband our territorial defense force (national guard essentially) and partly because Serbia didn't really care about Slovenia - we've always been the odd ones out in Yugoslavia
Croatia wasn't that lucky though, and Bosnia basically got brutalized by all its Yugoslav neighbors and also in an internal civil war
Eventually NATO bombed Belgrade into submission and 25 years later, here we are with SLO and CRO in the EU, BiH, SRB, MNG, and NMK outside, and with jokes floating around (in Slovenia) that once all the former Yugoslav republics are in the EU, the EU will probably collapse, since there is no force that can keep a union with all of us in it alive
There's probably at least 5 vastly different narratives about that one for every 3 people you ask
So depending on your level of masochism it can be super interesting or super-suicide-inducing
When I was in school it usually started at 8:00
If you needed help at some subject or if you needed extra work if normal work was to easy then you started some days at 7:10
But now I see some schools start at 7:30, some at 7:50 which is crazy and some start at 8:20
So I'm guessing there's no set time to start
One class period is 45 minutes with a 5 minute break
One of the breaks, usually after 1st or 2nd period is 20 min and it's when kids have breakfast/snack
This is provided by school
Then from what I see, 1st 4 grades have lunch after all the classes and 5-9 graders have lunch between 6th ad 7th period
It's also 20 minutes long
Lunch is also provided by school but you don't have to have it, if you don't want to
In that case you just take some fruit or
bread which has to be provided all the time to everyone
This is for elementary school
edit: for high school, things have also chnaged since I attended
I'm just gonna look at the time table of the school I went to
0 period starts at 7:05, 1st period starts at 7:55
After each period there's a 5 minute break
At most there are 8 periods, so it all ends at 14:50
Each grade has a lunch break after different period and it lasts 25 minutes
Lunch is also provided in school, there's 5 menus each day
If you want it, you have to sign up for it each week at the terminal or online
Could be the 2nd of January for Slovenia
It's nothing special but just one extra day you get to be at home after the New year's
24th, in the evening with dinner
25th is a holiday but it's just another day, people usually visit family or do nothing
26th is  Independence and Unity Day so also a work free day
No, Slovenes are too diverse and there is no generic Slovene look
The only way I recognize another Slovene is when they open their mouth
Otherwise I could easily mistake them for almost any other European nationality
I do, however, find it easier to spot some other nationalities, for example Italians or nationals of some ex-Yugoslav countries
The holy tourist triangle of Ljubljana, Bled and Piran
If there's one thing this Corona virus is good for is that you now can visit places that were previously too crowded
I was in Dubrovnik just a couple of days ago
[It
Was
Empty
] Truly one of the greatest experiences
It's kinda overrated the beaches are better in Dalmatia
I know the names of most states, I know their location fairly well too
But fuck the nonsensical state capitals
The fact that the capital of Illinois is Springfield and not Chicago blows my mind
It's about the same as Americans knowing European countries
Everyone knows the best known ones and then there's a ton people wouldn't believe even exist if you told them their names
A similar one I've heard is:
Wir helfen kranken Vögeln - we help sick birds
Wir helfen Kranken vögeln - we help sick people fuck
Yes, have you ever tried learning Slovene
Draft
It can kill according to some legends
It seems that soldiers not talking about war later in life is a reocurring theme here, which i find very interesting as my great-grandfather too fought in WW2 (as a partisan) and also in WW1 for Austria-Hungary, but never talked about his experiences
The Slovene Wikipedia is depressingly barren, being inferior to the English one in almost all articles except for: Slovene places, various Slovene companies and some historical Slovene personalities
Sometimes
I noticed quite an improvement in quality over last about 2 years
Particularly if I go looking for some plant or animal that I don't know the English word for, I start with Slovene article, and more times than not I don't even need to click to English version to get the info
On average, English is still better, but I was in for a couple of pleasant surprises lately
People who drink bottled water are considered weirdos
The only reasons to do that is when tap water is not available, or possibly in the club where you want to use a bottle
I know this is of topic but Ljubljana needs only around 5
000 more people to be on that list
Bochum, Germany
But then after that I'm good again until the last one - Galați, Romania
Łódź for me
Allthough Iwas so surprised by some of the cities being so high up
Zaragoza for example
Hmmm, apparently there is a [city of Brussels ] is inside the[ Brussels region]
I mean, random Korean cities vs cities in the literal center of Europe
While asking Europeans
I'd say don't bother unless you plan to live here for a longer period
The grammatical rules are quite complex and there's always a ton of exceptions
Ah yes, the old die Stadt vs der Staat clusterduck xD
One can easily be understood if they only use nominatives and infinitives though
Sounds funny, but it works
They do to speakers of languages that aren't used to meaning changes due to vowel length
It's like the bitch vs beach thing
That's all correct, but if you can't hear those distinctions, they may as well not exist
It's like when I was trying to teach portuguese speakers to say "cesta" in Slovenian
They apparently couldn't tell much less produce the difference between "testa" and "cesta" (the c in the latter sounding like z in Zeit)
It's funny how brains sometimes (don't) work =)

You wish, my friend
Our word for 'thank you' (hvala) rhymes with 'rolling' (val'a), so if, god forbid, we forget to say thanks, our mums might retort with "What is under the table rolling
" (kaj se pod mizo vala
), to which you're supposed to immediately answer "hvala".
(((Followed by mum's self-satisfied chuckling as though she'd invented the joke herself
)))
"Do you have a tail

A politician is allowed to steal millions of Euros and is not to be prosecuted, but a poor man trying to feed his family shall be jailed for stealing a loaf of bread
Yeah
There are some special cases but in most cases if you hear a wird you can spell it
99% of the time the answer is yes
There are only a few minor exceptions where the letter 'l' at the end of the word is pronounced like 'u'. So for example, the world chair is 'stol', but pronounced more like 'stou'. But such words are very few
Imo Italian is easier than English
While I learned English through shows and the internet I would say it would be hared to learn it through rules the way they teach you in school
I studied Italian for 6 years in school and while it was harder to get a grasp of what sounds right (because I don't really watch Italian tv) The rules had fewer exceptions and the exceptions still adhered to a pattern
I would also say it's easier than German as well (although I never properly studied it) since German has all those long words and my dislexia made it harder

Pešec pešači čez pešišče is a famous tongue twister from Slovenia
***Pešec ščije čez cestišče*** A pedestrian is pissing over the road, it's a mouth full even for us
***Pikčasta ptička v pikčasti kletki*** A spotted bird in a spotted cage, but if they say it wrong, and they almost all do, you get a Cunt bird in a cunt cage

Reminds me of my favorite Swiss word (probably butchered here): Chäschüechli
I tried that out and people weren't able to repeat it even if they never saw it written down, so it is a good one

> Hottentottententententoonstelling
Reminded me of this German gem:
>Es war einmal eine alte Frau, die lebte bei den Hottentotten
Sie war ziemlich trottelig und stotterte auch ein wenig
Daher wurde sie die
Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter genannt
Die Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter hatte auch ein Haustier
Das war eine Beutelratte
Damit die Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelratte nicht weglief,
verbrachte sie ihr Leben in einem Käfig, der mit Latten vergittert war
Dieses Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitter
hatte auch so eine Art Dach, das auch Wetterkotter genannt wurde
In diesem Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotter
lebte die Beutelratte glücklich und zufrieden, bis eines Tages ein Attentäter kam,
die Beutelratte in einen Sack steckte und mitnahm
Damit dieser Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäter
aber nicht einfach so davonkam, versprach die alte Frau demjenigen,
der die Beutelratte wiederbrächte, eine Fangprämie
Diese Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäterfangprämie
war so hoch, dass alle Welt sich sofort auf die Suche machte, den Attentäter fand
und so die Beutelratte wohlbehalten wieder nach Hause kam
Darüber freuten sich alle, vor allem aber der Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäterfangprämienempfänger
A mixed group of exchange students, not sure about all nationalities
Some Spaniards were sure present
One
Slovene quite often adds schwa before r or more rarely l to manage pronounciation of consonant clusters, but we don't use a letter for it
Čmrlj can be pronounced \[ˈtʃmə̀rəl\] or \[ˈtʃmə̀rl\]
I feel honored at your belief in my ability to remember details of an event in a mixed group of exchange students :D
Stari (dude)
brat/sestra (bother/sister)
pobalin (hard to explain, troublemaker
cefizelj (literature origins)
A more literal translation to *Stari* is "*Old* (man/woman)". It's funny to me because it's used by children (definitely not old men) and adults alike
Never in my life have I heard somebody call someone else pobalin or cefizelj
Where do you get that
Out of his butt
Maybe they used it in literature 100 years ago
Never have I heard anyone call someone brat/sestra either
Fine, I don't have friends, so I made it up
Yeah sometimes
Usually when talking about them to someone else
It's more of a teenage slang thing
I used to refer to them as *moj tastar*/*moja tastara* a lot when I was in my teens
Now in my 30s not anymore (i think they're getting too old and it would just be rubbing it in )
Stari in slang between the same generation is considered friendly, but if you say it to someone actually older it's usually more in a rude way like: "stari, daj mi mir" (don't bother me, old man)
We do refer to grandparents as *stari starši* (old parents)
Not really
For fathers we may use "foter" (from German Vater) in a similar sense I guess
Not really
For fathers we may use "foter" (from German Vater) in a similar sense I guess
I think the most well-known one is about "King Mathias" (Matjaž), who was a benevolent ruler and is now sleeping under a mountain Peca, and one day he'll wake up and continue his reign
Well turns out this mythological king is based on actual Hungarian king Mathias Korvin, who ruled over parts of Slovene territory during parts of middle ages, I think 14th century or something
We also have some "invader myths", basically myths about various times we were invaded
In and around the Soča/Isonzo valley, there's loads of stories about Napoleon and his army
And apparently they built loads of bridges there, as there are at least three bridges all named Napoleon's bridge
There's also stories about Turkic conquest
One of the most popular hills near Ljubljana - Šmarna Gora has loads of myths about Turks, as it was used as a refuge during their raids
On the main path towards the summit there's a supposed stone where a hoof of some Turkish's general horse struck, right before saint Mary appeared and turned them into stone
On the other side of the hill there's a a more likely and way less violent story, abut a Turk who apparently decided to stay here and became Christian, he supposedly built a chapel to commemorate this, and it's known to this day as "Turk's chapel".
Another interesting story about the time Turks were invading, is linked to the village of "Hudajužna". Locals have the legend that it's name comes from when Turks were camping near by and just as they were having lunch, all the church bells in near by villages started ringing and (there's a chance I mixed my myths up, but I think people just came with similar stories) saint Mary again appeared and turned them to stone, or destroy them
That's why the name of the village can be interpreted to mean "Terrible Lunch". But in reality it stems from "heavy thaw", as it's in that part of the valley, where snow thaws the fastest
Also for most people who don't know where every small village in Slovenia lies, Šmarna Gora and Hudajužna are like around 60km apart, so the myths probably developed independently
With fireworks specifically we only celebrate New Year, but we celebrate Easter with "Pokanje", which just means "banging" or "popping". It's usually done with carbide
In my village specifically we use old milk cans
You put the carbide inside and seal it well with a lid
You lay the can down sideways
For ignition, we use a long wooden stick, with a petroleum soaked rag at the end
You fire it up, and kind of tap the bottom of the milk can with the end of the stick that is on fire
It creates a really loud bang, and usually when we were younger they sent the kids looking for the lids that flew off when the bang occured
It looks [something like this] Also, this explains [why our goalkeepers are so good]
Our biggest lake completely disappears twice a year
We have the highest density of caves
Funnily enough, for Slovenia it's the exact opposite
Though much fewer people think about our national color in the first place
^(or about slovenia
)^(or know we exist)
Wut
I never expected Italy if all places to be big on kiwi production
I mean yeah it's southern regions are pretty far down but still
No, I'm talking about Cerknica lake
It literally drains out, like a bathtub
From [this] to [this] The water drains through ponors, požiralniks and estavelas into the underground
I don't know if there's any other lakes like this in Europe, apart from a few smaller ones in Slovenia
All I can find is that Cerknica lake is the biggest and primest example of a lake this kind
I mean the land of the Slovenka :P
Well, yes and no
There are plenty of airports with cheap flights all around Slovenia only a short drive away, but it's true that Ljubljana is horribly unconnected with direct flights
No, no, she's all yours, we insist
[This] is how it disappears into the underground
This is a *požiralnik*. It's what's at the bottom of the lake on the first photo
edit: phantom comments still aren't resolved, so to the person asking what these people are doing - they're members of a Fishing family, trying to save fish to move them to another lake
It's a common practice
Compromise - send her to Canada
They'd be too polite to refuse a gift, surely
I feel like I can talk only for "my" group
But yeah what you described is exactly how it works here
We have special scout names (that range from nicknames, to something silly we come up with on the spot)
While we try to teach kids some basic scouting skills, we're not very strict about it
And the main "speciality" of our group is, that next year we'll celebrate 70 years since our establishment, so we think of ourselves as above every other group in our area, and in general
Especially us from the "older" generation, where we considered our group above our regional organisation, and on par with national organisation
And we're not even the largest group within our regional group
Actually I'm pretty sure almost all (with few exceptions) other groups take scouting way more seriously than we, at least those of us from the "old guard". The younger leaders are a bit more open to ideas by the regional organisation
But we're still doing "community work". I personally helped during many "major disasters" that happened in our country last 10 years or so
From floods, to sleet
Also as someone with a political science degree, I try to teach kids how to engage in politics and stuff
But not in any kind of "civic nationalism", or whatever many scout groups are doing (I feel you've noticed that with US scouts), but mostly trying to give them tools to understand politics and the system we live in
That's why almost every game I devise, has a bean-based monetary system, where their power is directly linked to amount of beans they have
I got the idea form one of international camps I attended, where they had this system
And it "failed" or rather succeeded in the most spectacular way
It had everything from money-laundering through casinos scheme, buying your way into politics and position of power, a coup, and spam mail
And I'm pretty sure those were all unplanned side-effects, that the organisers of the camp weren't planning for
Sorry for going down the memory lane, but that's to me probably the best part of being a scout
Well
Scounts are a christian thing
So when we became part of Yugoslavia and became socialist, religion was persecuted, they had to solve the problem of christian things that they didn't want to give up
So instead of Christmass, the main thing was the New Year and we got a new santa, Dedek mraz (Father snow), the christmass tree (literally translated: christmas spruce) became a "novoletna yelka" or new year silver fir and bised the boy scouts there were "taborniki" or campers
Those included boys and girls since socialism did a lot for women equality
They didn't sell cookies or anything like that (neither did the scouts)
Both camped, sang, had older member be leaders and so on
Pretty much what you described for Switzerland
Are you a Tabornik or Skavt
Tabornik
Skavte pod avte
I was planning to mention the difference, but forgot
(this is mostly for people outside Slovenia to get the difference)
Basically we have one "boy-scout" group and one "girl scout" group
They're both "co-ed" though
Boy scouts - Taborniki are part of WOSM, but are also inspired by Woodcraft movement of Ernest Thompson Seton
Girl Scouts - Skavti, are basically Boy Scouts, but openly Catholic
Because their programme was way to similar to Boy scouts WOSM didn't allow them to join, they only allow organisation with different programmes to join, they've joined the WAGGGS which stands for World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, that's why they're technically Girl scouts
Boy scouts, and our group in particular was started by the founder of Boy scouts of Slovenia: Pavel Kunaver - Sivi Volk
EDIT: I think I've given enough information for anyone to actually find out what group (rod) I'm part of
There's literally just one group that meets all the criteria, that I've named in both of my posts
My ex was a basque
It's so beautiful there
Since we broke up I haven't visited but the weird thing is, I feel a connection with the basque people
I miss the basque country more than him
I realised there were scouts in Europe really late as well
I thought is was an american thing since we have our communistic version
Yes
We have them in our capital
A part of a roman wall that people still climb and there is a well still preserved under one of our main squares in Ljubljana
You can see it when you go to the garage bellow
There are other places as well
Nothing huge but still amazing in my opinion that these things survived for so long
There really aren't any here but neighboring Croatia has a beautiful and well preserved amphitheater in Pula, they even run concerts and stuff like that in it
Let me tell you a joke
I got sunburned in Ireland
It was supposedly the nicest summer since about the 70s, but it still rained cats and dogs about twice in a week
I'm fairly certain you're 100% wrong on this one
We have roman ruins and whatnots all over Slovenia, they might not be in the same class as an amphitheater ... but we do have them
We probably do have them but they probably are pretty insignificant imo
Bled is an incredibly pretty place, but it is not the only thing we have to offer, and therefore overrated
And we have chocolate, apple, kebab and kranjska klobasa burek
Kranjska kobasica =/= Kranjska klobasa
Kranjska klobasa needs to have specific ingredients, what you call Kranjska kobasica doesn't and it tastes a lot different
If nobody is home the package is usually left on the doorstep
We have an basement with open door and the postman was told to leave the package there
The whole stealing of packets is not really a thing here - actually crime is not that common here
Not really a problem
They have to give you the package or leave it in the box
If the package is too big and you aren't at home you have to collect at the post office
That's for the Pošta; our main postal provider
The curriers require a sign-off
If you are not home they re-deliver on another date or take it to the collection office (like a gas station)
If you agree they can leave it at a neighbour or a business close to where you live
It might be different if you live in a house as opposed to a tenement building though
I've heard that some curriers just chuck the package over the fence or something, but I've never experienced that
It is technically possible, but extremely unlikely
The delivery guy calls you (you always have to provide the phone number) to come outside, or to get instructions if someone else is going to take the packet
You can also ask them to take the packet to a pickup point, where you get it with ID or with a code they send you over SMS
You can technically ask them to leave the packet, and while afaik they aren't allowed to do it, some might
The post attempts to deliver to anyone at your address who answers the door, so I suppose you could pick something up for anyone in the building
They usually call before delivering
If my parents aren't home they just tell them to leave it infront of the house
Not all packages need a signature
It's pretty random
In my experience, most don't. I on the other hand live in an apartment and if I'm at work, some will bring it to my work the next day or they leave it at post office, Petrol or in the Parcel box
DPD once left it with my neighbour without me giving them permission
That pissed me off
I went through Ženica on my way to Sarajevo this summer
It left a poor first impression, which quickly crumbled after I saw Sarajevo
Gotta say, no country I've ever been to has such good costumer service as Bosnia
Sarajevo and Mostar are both incredible cities
So this is the AFC Wimbledoon beef backstory, this horrific town
I taught you Germans have a form for everything so it is right to assume that you must first fill the form then you can run someone over
Meanwhile your i doesnt have a dot
Does that also work for PhD students perchance
Only nazi gold accepted
I used to like them but after 2014 when our house was almost flooded not anymore
After that expirience if I hear a tunderstorm I feel a little anxious
Depends, if it is after a long period of draught in summer it is very nice to see some rain fall and enjoy the outside afterwards
Mostly I don't really like the storm itself, especially since last year we had some hail damage

It's impossible to translate each word but here it goes:
Zdravo, moje ime je Janez
Me veseli, da sem vas spoznal
Od kod si
> Hello, mine name is John
Me happy (more like 'making me happy'), that I did you meet
From where you
If I try to literally translate from English to Slovenian:
> Zdravo, moj ime je Janez
To je užitek k srečati tebe
Kje so ti iz
Zdravo, jst sm Erazem Lipovina
Me veseli da sva se spoznala
Od kod prihajaš?
Hello, I am Erazem Lipovina
Me pleases that we have realized
From where coming
Brown bear and Wild boar females are probably most dangerous if you encounter them with cubs
Ticks for sure
Apart from that, the only dangerous animal is the bear but even they just mind their own business if you're just a bit careful
Yeah every year there is few bear attacks
Southern part of Slovenia has most of our bear population so it is a little dangerous walking in forests especialy in mating season or when cubs are young
You can hear almost every year how a bear was sighted near Ljubljana
As for boars I have not heard of somebody dying from an attack but I know few people who have been attacked and they barley escaped
I have even heard of deer attacks when they are in mating season but it is rare
This picture encapsulates why I'd like to learn German
Cvetje v jeseni is one of the only Slovenian movies that I actually really enjoyed
For Slovenia i would recomend Outsider
Its about beginings of punk in slovenia and strugle of youth in 1980  slovenia
I'm not German but may I suggest "Der Goldene Handschuh". Especially if you are into true crime/horror genre
What about "Dnevnik Diane Budisavljević"? Didn't it get Big Golden Arena for Best Film this year in Pula
One of my favourite semi-recent Serbian film is "Rane (The Wounds)". Kosturica's films are also great
There are also some older classics from ex-Yu
Ye, it was advertised here like it's Ex-Yugoslavia's Schindler's List, a must-see, etc
Well, commercials always exaggerate stuff, it's their whole business model :)
I'll do Croatia

Which was in 1914 not 1912
I love our dual form:
Stol - Stola + Stoli / (one) chair - (two) chairs - (multiple) chairs
I love how many very different sounding dialects we have
I love how diverse our language is, it's both South Slavic and Western Slavic sounding, there's a lot of German and Italian influence in the language as well
When I was visiting Romania and went to the store, I understood what plenty of food items are, because very similar words
Fuck, we still have that, just different
When you first mention something, you use, for example, nov zvezek (A new notebook), when you mention it later on, you use novi zvezek (THE new notebook)
We have a funny one too, we have Zbogom (sometimes written as Z Bogom) which literally means (go) with god
means goodbye (forever)
The article explains it well, "volk" (a wolf), "volka" (two wolves), "volkovi" (more than two wolves) is a good example
Anytime we reference two of something, there's a slightly different word for it
There's some exceptions, but we generally use it all the time
What about it is confusing
When we count things it gets even trickier, because when you talk specifically about three or four of something this happens:
En volk (one wolf)
Dva volka / Dva volkova (both means two wolves, both are used to my knowledge)
Trije volkovi (three wolves)
Štirje volkovi (four wolves)
Pet volkov (five wolves) - notice no "i" at the end
Everything up until "sto volkov" (a hundred wolves) is simply volkov (no "i" at the end), and then the pattern repeats with "sto in en volk" (a hundred and one wolf), "sto in dva volkova" (a hundred and two wolves) and so on
So generally, counting is a little different than simple plural
Without specific numbers, we say:
"volk" (for a single wolf),
"volka" / "volkova" (this unequivocally means two wolves, even with no number in front of the word),
"volkovi" (for when you know there's more than two, but cannot provide a specific number)
Example: There were wolves on the hill yesterday
"How many
" Probably 5 or 6 wolves
This sentence translates to:  Včeraj so na hribu bili volkovi (with an "i", simple plural)
"Koliko
" Verjetno 5 ali 6 volkov (with no "i", since you've now provided a specific number)
I don't know how relevant this is to your question, I hope it helps

Wow that sounded impossible to me at first, but I looked it up and it is actually true, apparently South Tyroleans were to be relocated to Crimea
In our translation instead of Baggins we have Bisagin
Well at least according to the subtitles from the movies
The weirdest for me are the translations in Harry Potter
Some examples:
- Voldemort - Mrlakenstein
- Severus Snape - Robaus Raws
- Bellatrix Lestrange - Krasotilya L'Ohol
- Nymphadora Tonks - Fatale Tanga
- Dolores Umbridge - Kalvara Temyna
[Other translations] make more sense, well the Voldemort one is reffering to the >!I am lord Voldemort
< part
The weirdest to me is the one for Bellatrix
Lmao we also called him Torbar at one point
Don't know what his name is now, but our teacher calles him Torbar
Baggins is translated Bisagin in Slovenian - its a weird one
In slovenian it is Bisagin for no reason
I like the LOTR translations, since they didn't change too much like Harry Potter translations did, which I think was unnecessary
I love how the characters in LOTR and The Hobbit all kept their original names, but the lands (middle earth-srednji svet; the shire-šajerska) were translated to be very silmilar to their origins
I dislike Slovenian translations for that very reason- they change names and even movie titles way too much
Subtitles are often even worse-they leave out important things, completely miss the joke, and are often overall horrible
It comes from bisaga - a type of a bag
Which is many times better than the previous translation of Bogataj
It's probably because bisaga means bag

I am saddened every time a piece of cultural or natural heritage is destroyed or damaged, no matter where in the world it happens
I am as sorry for the Notre Dame just as much as I was sorry for Palmyra
When it comes to cultural heritage, I don't only see it as European, Asian or African heritage but as human heritage
Picking up women in English (my technically 3rd language) is light-years easier than in any other language I speak at any level and that's the effect it has on my personality
Flirting in German is just weird but I get super-rational, and Slavic languages are great to be pissed, depressed, and negative in, which usually happens
I think Ljubljana is the MOST hated or disliked, but most people are still pretty indifferent
They're just a bit more arrogant, rich and stuck up I guess
Still love visiting it though
I don't think Bosniaks hate Sarajevo
They love it and praise it as their capital, even in the Krajina region(I'm from a village so it may not be true for let's say Tuzla)
But I think they're too busy hating on Croats and Serbs (also vice-versa) to hate on themselves
The hate towards Banja Luka is much stronger in the Muslims

Even when it comes to older population, many will understand at least the basics
Most people are required to learn a third language in high school (most commonly german or french, spanish is popular too), though the fluency in it varies from person to person
Yes, absolutely, you really can’t do anything with knowing only slovenian, as it is spoken in one country, by 2 million people, and a 2 hour drive in any direction will land you in another country
Older people will more likely speak german, and less likely to speak english, while the younger population will almost certainly speak english as it it learned from the age of 6 now
Later in primary school they can also choose to learn more languages, most commonly german, and in about half of high schools picking another language apart from english is mandatory
I think a while ago I saw a statistic that the average slovenian speaks 3 languages, which is a lot, but you also have to consider that most slovenes will speak croatian as the language is very similar to ours
Croatians, on the other hand, mostly won’t speak slovene, as understanding croatian from slovene seems to be a one way street
Edit:
Here is the survey, we rank 2nd in EU, I guess
I think most people near the italian border speak Italian
Styrians and Carinthians speak (to varying degrees) German
Serbo-Croatian (we generally don't notice the diference between Serbian and Croatian) is understood by basically everyone, though I think that younger people understand it less and less and older people speak it, since they learned it at school
I always found it funny when Tarik Filipović tried speaking Slovene on Potjera
He seemed very fascinated with the word for lunch, "kosilo". He couldn't pronounce it correctly for the life of him
I don't really know why is that and I agree with you
I guess older generations learned Serbo-Croatian in school
I know that people who didn't have cable watched HRT a lot (along with ORF and Rai), this must have something to do with it
Also we spend our summers on your coast and listen to your music
I think we have a basic idea of the language, but I think we generally speak broken Croatian
I for one believe that I could hold a basic conversation in Croatian, but I rather just speak Slovene instead of weird Croatian when I'm in Croatia and it works out well most of the time
I switch to Croatian when it doesn't, especially with numbers
We have a glorious law stating that it is up to the bureaucrat taking the name to judge if the name might be morally, socially or otherwise unacceptable
In that case, the parent get a warning, and if they don't change their mind, the name remains and they get reported to social services
This is a very convoluted way of saying you can name your kid anything and absolutely nothing is going to happen to you unless you try something like running for public office
Edit: found out we have a limit at used characters
No numbers or special characters, must use Slovene alphabet + xywq
At least that part is not too terrible
The military museum in Pivka
It has a submarine, fighter planes, tanks, apcs, guns, trucks and other ww2 stuff
Nope, they just talk really quite
But because my parents barely speak any English, I sometimes spoke English with my friends(even tho they were Slovene) hehe
From my experience, not one tourist or non-native spoke to me in Slovenian
It is always either English or their own language (mostly in Italian) because the part of the country that I grow up for some reason the Italian tourists always expect we know Italian, the same goes for people that come from Serbo-Croatian speaking countries they expect we know their language already
But if I ever hear a non-native try to speak to me in Slovenian I'll be pleased to listen but until then I can't say if it's annoying or not, I mean to me it would be awesome
The smell of an alpine forest with some freshly cooked sausage
Wild bears stink, can't really describe the smell
If you are downwind from it, you will definitely smell it before you can see or hear it
The last one is just straight up awesome lol
If you're travelling nowadays that's essentially it
Abandoned guard houses
My dude, that's really weird
To be fair though I used to think Croatia was just a weird place within Slovenia, where people spoke some sort of SUPER version of the Bela krajina accent
I was a weird kid
I'd recommend you continue onwards for like 20-30 minutes from Bled and hit up Lake Bohinj
It's much more beautiful than Bled IMHO and less touristy
[Here you go for the cream cake recipe :\)]
If you visit Slovenia again, may I recommend a trip to the Skocjan Caves and the nearby Predjama Castle
Both of these go double if you're a LOTR fan (not filming locations, but could easily have been the inspiration for some)
I'm not big on baking, I just thought you may have forgotten its name and found one
[Here's one] in Slovenian which might be google translateable (feel free to PM me if any translations don't make sense)
There's also a [companion video] with it, that shows the steps (though the voice and text are also in Slovenian)
If you decide to re-visit and want some more tips on what to go see, also, feel free to ping me, I'm always happy to give people some tips :)
It's Illy and not even close
Second is Barcaffe and after that Lavazza
Lavazza is trash compared to Goriziana and Trieste
Just to say, its a bit arhaic in colloquial but it used more often in some dialects
I think so
We do not have the names for generations
Thanks u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner
Not well known to anyone but some locals
I live in a town that blew up when they have found coal, now the town is a shithole with 100's or even up to a 1000 people moving away to Ljubljana every year
The town had around 50
000 people living here at its peak and when the mines and industries closed soon after the fall of communism a lot of the factories were left abandoned one of the biggest ones being demolished not long ago
These places are now place for teens to explore since there is nothing else to do in this boomer town
In one of those factories someone committed suicide and it was a story of the week along my classmates
There is hundreds of  buildings like that here that just lay there forgotten
But one of my favorites has to be an abandoned graveyard
I live 10 minutes from the old centre, you know the deal: church,... Not far from the center was a graveyard, not maintained for years so the trees grew over it, a lot of the tombstones were replaced, but some are still the original ones
I haven't been there for years but it used to be very spooky
v - in
h/k - to
s/z - with
o - about
a - but
Words
Not that I can think of (unless it's slang)
However particle words what I call them, yes (aka words that serve grammar like preposition or other)
v -> into/in
k/h  -> to/towards
z/s -> with
o -> about
(The two possible ones in the 2nd and 3rd examples are used based on the starting letter of the next word but mean exactly the same)
Amongst people on similar positions in a single company, it generally isn't discussed, since nobody wants any tensions in case salaries are different
I don't think it's rude, just everyone prefers not to know
Amongst people outside your company, it is almost a small talk topic
I live in a bilingual area, where slovene and italian are official languages
Italian is the co-official language because the coastline of Slovenia had a substantial italian population until 1954, after that year most of them emigrated to Italy with just a few thousand people remaning
So, today not much people speak italian at home and generally slovene is much more widely spoken
However, the italian minority is very active culturally and has many rights and institutions in place
They have a whole system of political and cultural organization that is soley theirs (the self-governed italian communities that are joined in a general slovene coastal community)
They have the right to 3 seats in each city council, they have one MP in the national parliament
All have the right to speak italian during mostly slovene-speaking sessions
They have their parallel italian school system from kidergarten to high school
All slovene schools have compulsory italian language, but just 3 hours per week, one hour less then slovene and the same amount as english
However italian starts at first grade, english at third grade
I went to an italian speaking kindergarten myself
They have their own local TV and radio station in italian
Then bilinguism is compulsory in written documents
So, all forms, all written announcments, all street signs etc, have to be in both languages
Street and place signs are perhaps the most obvious manifestation of bilinguism
All the members of the minority speak fluent slovene, also a huge number of slovenes speak italian, but unfortunately not all of them (sadly also many people at official positions have quite a poor fluency in italian)
Usually the italians will switch to slovene if they know they are in public and speaking to a slovene person
They speak mostly italian when they are among themselves at the bar of the italian community or at cultutal events organized by the community
We are very lucky to have them since their events are always higher in quality then other events
That is weird
Doesn't it bother the people that your country's language is not used
Why don't they use it, is it a recent language as a result of secession, or was it rooted out while you were part of Russia
I would think everybody would be eager to embrace it as a monument of independence, it is a big part of national identity, I mean, Croatians even invented new words to further the differences between Yugoslavian/Serbian language and theirs
I think that in Italian mixed area there are seperate Slovenian and Italian schools
In Slovenian schools language of instruction is Slovenian and they teach Italian as 2nd language and vice versa in [Italian] schools
But in Hungarian mixed areas all schools are bilingual which means language of instruction is both Slovenian and Hungarian
I don't know how that works though
The way I immagine it is that they sometimes have math or whatever in Slovenian, and next time in Hungarian, idk
There are also bilingual schools with Slovenian as language of instruction in Hungary, Austria and Italy
Understandable if it were only up to a few individuals in government and education to enforce the language, but what puzzles me is the lack of initiative from the general populace
>  all fur coat and no knickers
hah
what an interesting saying, love it
Well yes, parents are usually at work by then
They only need someone older than 10 to walk with them in kindergarten and 1st grade, so that's when they're 6
The oldest one Slovene manuscript is Freising manuscripts from 10th Century
It could be understand but you would need some time to get "aclimated" and get to know some different letters an phonetics behind it
Most Famoso sentence there is ""[Etjè bi det naš ne səgréšil, tè u weki jèmu bè žíti,...]" which would be translated in moderen slovene as ""Če bi ded naš ne grešil, bi mu v veke bilo živeti"- "If our grandfather had not sinned, he would have lived forever
I once tried reading more than this famous first lines and it gets complicated really fast after that
I'd say I didn't catch more than half the meaning all in all, but the opening lines are really similar to modern language
Later texts, from Primož Trubar in 16th century and later are more or less understandable once you get past the spelling and font
I have a happy gap in knowledge of any texts in between the two
To me it was an embarrassing moment when I went to Munich with my school
We were riding an escalator and I was standing in the middle while some woman wanted to go faster so my classmate said in slovenian "Daj spusti staro burglo mimo" (Let the old hag go infront)
I stepped aside and when she passed us she turned around and said that we are not the only Slovenians there
We were shocked and after the shock wore out classmait was verry glad he did not say something worse
Yes it does and this is a sample card
[Sample]
[Slovene ID card]
Here almost everybody has one
If you cross the border driver's license is not valid and you must have passport/ID
Passport is quite large so if you go to Croatia for a daytrip or shopping in Austria (yes sometimes they check in border crossing in Austria even though we are Schengen) so ID is more practical because you can always have it in the wallet
It looks crazy because they use digraphs for single sounds
Writing it down in another Slavic language it'd look like: Brenčiščikijevič, which probably still looks crazy to nonSlavs but has like only 2/3rds of the letters
Tina is a normal name and "Vzorec" means sample
Another name that is commonly used in card samples is Janez Novak
The name is exactly the same as in Germany
Vzorec translated into German means Muster
So translated it would be Tina Muster
We also use Janez Novak/Marija Novak because Janez and Marija are most common names and Novak is most common surname
General feel of the photo tells me that birth date and photo could match but that photo was made in late 80s or beggining of 90s. And photos on ID cards are just wierd sometimes
Here ID is a bit cheaper and before Brexit we could even go to UK without passport
So basically you need passport only if you travel out of Europe or in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia Turkey, Moldova or in Caucasus
But you [can] travel with ID to Croatia
You can even travel with ID to Montenegro and they are not even EU
For me it's really more about practicality because ID can always be with you in the wallet but passport is too big
Honorary Slav
Trst, Trst, Trst, Ljubljana, Ljubljana
Celovec(Klagenfurt) and Gradec(Graz) were also very important for Slovenes
Celovec(Klagenfurt) was/is also very important for Slovenians
In Carantania it was Krnski grad (Karnburg)
If we can count that
Yes, but Trst is certainly bigger
Yeah, most of the people say Gradec although Graz is also used, especially in Eastern Slovenia
You can also find Gradec on [motorway signs ]
2021*
I started learning it at when I was about 6, I' m 15 currently
I feel like I am at the fluent level, as I am constantly emerged in the language via YouTube, Reddit etc
I started learning it in school in like 3rd grade, but I learned the most out of watching minecraft youtube videos
My speaking is ok but if I speak for a long period of time, it starts to sound like my mouth is stuffed with something
Sorry that this doesn't really answer your question
I suggest just reading and speaking more so it improves with time
You can make a pretty good guess often, but there are many exceptions everywhere and you can burn easily
You can, for example, usually recognise a Muslim Bosnian (Bosniak), because of darker skin and visible Turkish features, but not really Serbian or Croatian Bosnian, because they look more general South Slavic
But at the same time often you can't distinguish between a Russian and  a Frenchman
Also regarding food:
- buy local and seasonal, avoid exotic fruits imported from the other side of the world (s. America, asia)
- buy or make (from old curtains) reusable and washable bags for fruits and vegetables
Same goes in Slovenia
Edit: It's fly instead of flea like my colleague said down below my bad
Oh yeah you're right, my bad
My brain is not working correctly in the morning
Yes
The Fran Ramovš institute for slovene language is regarded as the ultimate research and normative authority regarding slovenian lanaguage
The institute is part of the reasearch centre of the Slovenian academy of sciences and arts
We've got a miniscule 46
6km coast
I'd say around Ankaran or a bit to the north
Or Piran in Fiesa or Strunjan
I love Sango Sands in Scotland
But it's too cold to swim, even in summer
Bele Skale and Mesečev zaliv are nice
Although dangeruous in some parts because of falling rocks
Bohinj lake has beautiful beaches so does Soča and some other rivers, but those tend to be cold
Strunjan is the best spot, if you ask me
Part of the cliff crashed down a few weeks ago, and it's not really reccomended to go there now
However, I hope the situation stabilizes before the summer
Oh yes I always prefer non-salty water
I think it's a vegetable
,right
I 'swam' on a secluded beach in NW of Scotland
It was a hot day, 28-30°C. I only took a dip, the water was way to cold to swim in
I have also been to Sango Sands, a really really beatiful beach but no one swam there
The only place I saw a few people swimming in was in St
Andrews but the water and beach there didn't look appealing
Ljubljana and Maribor, capital vs second biggest city
The two best football clubs are based in these two cities (NK Olimpija and NK Maribor), as well as Slovenia's two biggest universities
Ljubljana (the capital) and Maribor (the second largest)
However Ljubljana has a rivalry with basically any other city in the country
In Slovenia it's very similar
We have a saying that goes "vsaka vas ima svoj glas" (every village has its own voice), meaning that every village has a slightly different speech than the neighboring one
On a scientific level Slovene is divided into app
50 dialects, grouped into 7 regional dialect groups
True dialects are mostly spoken by old people in rural areas, most of other people speak one of the colloquial regional varieties of Slovene, that are more unified, they are closer to literal Slovene and there is less variation between them
But still they can clearly show where one comes from
Slovenian as such is basically the lingua franca of Slovenia
If you learn just Slovenian to fluency without exposure to the dialects, everyone will understand you, but you'll still understand precious little of what natives are saying to each other, if they're all from the same part of the country, no matter which one
We have a saying: "Vsaka vas ima svoj glas" - Every town has its own voice (meaning dialect)
He is not
[There are quite a lot of them]
The difference between the terms "dialect" and "language" more or less always depends on politics
And even that is inaccurate, because Prekmurje (the north-east-most) is split into 4 dialects that differ in vocabulary and pronunciation as well
Not to mention that the Prekmurje "dialect" has historically been a separate literary language in its own right and is still the de facto language of education, business, and everything else in Prekmurje
[This] (PDF) is the best map around
[This one] is interesting
Croatia stealing our sea
Wait that actually was Croatia
for the last time
polish death camps means death camps in poland, not that they were run by the polish
maybe
i mean if there is one historical record even a layman knows about its ww2
since we all know nazis made death camps it just seems like its pointless to talk about if someone would mistake polish to mean operated by poland, they are either ignorant or dumb
i'm more appaled by some poles having such a hissy fit over it that right wing politicians came out to say how 0 poles ever colaborated with the nazis or had no hand in rounding up jews
We don't either
Religion is just briefly mentioned in ethics class in 8th or 7th (I'm not sure) grade
I doubt there is any other country, that would have Slovene for its subject
We also have it in Slovenia
We have it too
In 5th and 6th grade
Here we also learn about equality at home, accidents that can happen at home, hygene, ecology, money, clothes, shopping and of course about cooking and cleaning
We only have that in last year of high school
To prepare for a [matura dance]
We have both 'home economics' and 'handicrafts' in elementary
Handicrafts meaning making stuff out of wood, metal,... technical drawings, electricity
stuff like that
We have Philosophy in gymnasiums
Only one year though
And one year of Sociology and one of Psychology
I did orienteering at Taborniki (non-religious Scouts)
It was so fun
Finding CP's on a map, night time orienteering
I really wish I joined an orienteering club
Ethics class is taught in both 7th and 8th grade
We have it only as optional class and I don't think that even all schools have it
It's called religions and ethics and it's not only about Catholicism
Gospodinjstvo it is called
I know, but I don't remember in which grade religions are covered
I think 7th
I remember we had to do presentation about different religions and in 8th it was more about politics, environment and so on
I don't think many countries have religious classes
Pretty sure most countrie learn about it in the same fashion as you
They learn about world religions from an objective point of view
We learn about world religions in 'Civic education and culture and ethics' class
Curriculum content points:
Important human right - Freedom of religion
Religious communities in R. of Slovenia - all equal, seperate from the state
Big world religions - Judaism, Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity), Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, new religious movements, non-religious forms of worldview
Common features and differences of world religions
Moral and ethical principles of world religions
Cooperation and conflicts among world religions
We do have a few villages where cities are basically divided by two
A good example would be Gornja Radgona and its Austrian side, Bad Radkerburg
A weird case is the towns of Gorizia and Nova Gorica (New Gorizia)
Although they are separate town and Nova Gorica is younger (so they don't qualify), they're just across the border and, if the said border was gone, the two towns would be basically indiscernable on a map
Edit: I messed something up, my bad
Besides the most well known of Gorica/Nova Gorica, we also have Radgona (Bad Radkersburg)/Gornja Radgona and Libeliče/Libeliče (Leifling)
Kind of
The closest example is Gorica/Nova Gorica
When the "old" Gorica (Gorizia in italian) was awarded to Italy in 1947, Yugoslavia decided to build a "new Gorica" on our side of the border
Nova Gorica was built as a modernist and socialist town as opposed to the old medieval one
The towns were never a single whole, but they literaly "touch" each other and are increasingly starting to function as a single urban area as the borders controls were abolished with Slovenia entering Schengen in 2008
Another example is Gornja Radgona on the austrian border, which lies on the Mura river, which is also where de border lies
Gornja Radgona used to be a whole with Radgona (Bad Radkersburg i think) on the other side of the bridge in Austria until 1918
Not at all
Usually there is no one on the border at all, not even on the highway
I've been stopped once, for a quick check when going from Italy to Slovenia
Idk where you've been stopped, but in Gorizia/Nova Gorica you can't even spot the border if you don't know where it is
Fuck, my bad, I mistyped that
Forgive me
No idea what they were looking for, but it is defenitely not normal
On the Slo-At border before the Karawanken tunnel, traffic jam is quite often (to pay for the tunnel) and it feels like you're waiting for a border check
But if they checked you on a bus station, that couldn't be the case
Maybe it was due to Corona anyway, the panic had already begun at the time
Nice, I'm from just outside Ljubljana
Hope you enjoyed your last trip for some time
it was not the best time to visit lake Bled though, the red water was disgusting
Not total, we can leave the house freely, but we're asked not to hang around public places so Lj is deserted
A lot of dumb people've been taking trips to the seaside lately, so from midnight on it will not be allowed to leave the municipality of your residence
There are new people infected every day, but everything looks under control
A week ago a whole retirement's home got infected so we have about 10 deaths now
Hope things get better soon in Spain, I've been to Andalusia 5 autumns in a row
looking forward to come back
Cyanobacteria blossomed, something to do with phosphorus in water
The battle at capporeto
Here in slovenia we call it the mirracle at capporeto(čudez pri kobaridu) but italians call it the disaster at capporeto
I think here he's seen quite positively
He not only made Slovenian an official language he also made Ljubljana the capital of the Illiric Provinces
In Slovenia he is treated as a hero (or at least as a positive figure)
In slovenia he is treated as a hero I'd say, but is a thing of debate
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Otto von Habsburg help out a few thousand Austrian Jews flee to Switzerland
No, but I do have period underwear
Cheap & old
Surprisingly nobody is talking about any of the numerous songs
Now that we are in a civilized subreddit, I think all should be fine
HoI4 - Always Yugoslavia or some LatAm country
I find trying to take over Eurasia with Yugoslavia a nice challenge, and the same goes for the Americas with whichever LatAm country
Sveti Trije kralji v Slovenskih goricah (Holy Three Kings in the Slovenian hills) - 34 letters
Sveta Trojica v Slovenskih goricah (Holy Trinity in the Slovenian hills) - 30 letters
[Sveti Trije Kralji v Slovenskih Goricah] apparently with 34 letters
According to RTV article, it's either Sveti Trije Kralji v Slovenskih goricah or Sveta Trojica v Slovenskih goricah
Yes they are less than 5 km apart
Slovenian hills - Slovenske gorice,  Windische Bühel in Austria, is the region in north east of Slovenia (Styria)
Many small settlements are carrying this affix of the region to the name to distinguish them from other same name towns in Slovenia
Tokyo japan
I love how it looks
I live anime and japanese video games
A saw a car with license plates from Malta a few years ago
"afna" - which translated means a monkey or it can be used for a person who seeks attention
honestly never thought about it having anything to do with a monkey
Opica = monkey ...
Afna = @ or a rude attention seaker
It's an old word for monkey
>**áfna** \-e ž (á) nižje pog
*opica:* afne skačejo po drevesih
Afna its an old word for monkey, my grandmother still used it
Yeah, I hear it often over here
More in context of parents calling their children "afne" telling them not to behave like an "afna", if they're particularly playful/mischievous
"Ne afne guncat" and "ne se afnat" is very widespread
Rarely have I ever heard it in the context of actually calling a monkey that
Usually I root for every underdog country
But if Croatia is competing I root for them
In Belgium, I saw for the first time the really complex bureaucracy working smoothly
The employees actually knew what they were doing, amount of mistakes was negligible, and they seemed to have an information system that didn't need an IT guy hovering in the back the whole time
Really felt I was from a less developed country at that point
It was in 2012 and thank god it improved for us since then, but I'm still reminded sometimes
> Also portions of food were much more smaller
That's just because Turkey's national goal seems to be to make sure every tourist gains like 10 kilograms / week there
It's also why it's one of my favorite countries to visit - dat food
They're too close to the US ;)
I want a sandwich with 10 dekagrams of salami and 5 dekagrams of cheese, and a nice 7 deciliter bottle of water, damn it
Malta is epic, can confirm
Anyone who likes castles can spend probably years there and not see them all
It's brilliant
Wanna trade with Slovenia
We'd rather be called micro-state than Eastern European or Balkan
Well, geographically, culturally, and historically, only Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are Eastern Europe in all three groups
Politically, one could add the rest of the Warsaw Pact, but Yugoslavia wasn't part of that, so Eastern Europe doesn't work at all
#unaligned
As for Balkans - that makes more sense even though it's kind of like being a child of a black and a white parent - not really one or the other but almost always considered black, so it's begrudgingly accepted, but then in most contexts the things that are said about the Balkans don't really apply
Considering Tito smoked Cuban cigars in the White House
Not exactly comparable to Stalin or his followers I'd say
Also ignorance
Much
Ignorance
What was he doing in Baghdad anyway
Italy
Croatia
Because traditions
Yes, nobody expects the Slovenian uprising and then invasion from the south
MWAHAHAHAHAHA
Celovec, Beljak & Gradec shall soon be liberated
That's why the Netherlands should be the strongest proponents of Eurofederalization
Invading the Netherlands is one thing
Invading half of Europe is quite another
Italy or Hungary are more likely to invade because of their national minorities in Slovenia
We literally stole Prekmurje and Primorska has always been influenced by Italians
Our Russia
Slovenia
Yeah agree on that
Maybe a natinalist Austria
But Croatia
Nah
Nobody stole Prekmurje any more than any other region was stolen :P Also, Murska Republika bitches, older than Slovenia
Y'all should've joined us
Oof, hits close
That's because you're Slavs
Western Europe is simply racist towards Slavs, and the Slavic EU member states are not treated even close to equal, even though some of them have since surpassed some non-Slavic EU member states
And Russia is specifically targeted because it's the only Slavic country that can give the western EU trouble
> The bad news is that we're never leaving Poland
This is why I'm hoping for another term of Trump
He actually might stumble into that
Low but nonzero chance
Best thing that can happen for Europe for the reasons you explained
Respond preemptively how though
In a situation where the EU and Russia (and presumably all the countries in between) are bonding this much, the US would literally have to declare war on all of Europe + Russia
I don't see that going well for even the US, even if you can get China to threaten the Russian southern flank enough that they can't dedicate all their armed forces to defending their shores
And I'm not sure China would willingly go to war against the EU either, if they can stay neutral and not lose that market
I also can't imagine the various 'Stans or Turkey attack Russia/Europe, because if they should lose, there's a good chance Russia would steamroll them on purpose and Europe might even support Russia there on principle, since nobody likes being stabbed in the back
Ofc it's not happening anytime soon, but as a thought experiment, if it were to happen through the magic of newly found friendship and trust, I find it highly optimistic to believe that the US could do major damage if going to war against all of Europe + Russia, simply because invading and keeping up logistics across an ocean isn't quite that easy
Not to mention that even on the off chance that the US establishes a territory in Europe, they'd be fighting people who look like them and understand their language
Literally anyone could be a spy
So unless we're talking mass murder even Mao would be in awe of, the US would find out first hand how obnoxious European guerilla warfare can be
But it wouldn't come to that
Europe + Russia aren't exactly some 3rd world country you can steamroll even now where Europe is pretty much asleep militarily
And if NATO breaks down, you'll have Europe arming itself, so by the time this happens, the US have 0 chance of winning
It's a either draw or nuclear annihilation for everyone
> Europe can't arm itself if there's no money to buy the arms and no people to use them
You realize the EU economy alone is as large as the US one
And you'd be adding the rest of Europe on top of that, which doesn't bring THAT much but it helps
Also, 20% are aged 65+ in the EU
Finally, you don't need nearly as many people to defend as you need to attack
Especially with modern weaponry, which a combo of EU + Russia would definitely have
Also, you're forgetting that the world would take sides
I could see plenty of the world siding with Europe + Russia here, which would be a major blow to the strength of the Dollar, which can utterly destroy the US economy
The US debt-to-GDP ratio is 106%. For the EU, that's 80%. We'll see about the Eurozone
The only reason why the US are safe-ish is that the USD is the world trade currency, which would change in the event of such a war though, so the US is in a riskier situation in that regard
No young people in Europe can easily be fixed
Hell, I'm pretty sure if the EU relaxes immigration laws, we'll get plenty of young Americans come over
Y'know, free education, no worrying about going broke over a broken arm etc
And if we create a program where you get citizenship for going into the army for a bit AND actually use our own military-industrial complex to prop up the economy like the US does, well
The US exports to the EU make up 18% of US exports
The reverse is 21%. Not a major difference, both would be comparably hard hit if that ceases
The US can have 11 carriers and the 2 largest airforces on the planet
But that still doesn't make it allpowerful
The rest of the world doesn't NEED navies that can compete in the event of such a war, because everyone would simply be fighting a defensive war and waiting for the US to exhaust itself and for its morale to break like it did in every
Single
War
starting with Vietnam
Not to mention that being the instigator of WW3 wouldn't make the US popular with anyone on the planet, and I'd bet that even Canada would stay neutral, which means you'd have to leave its shipping alone
As for trade - there is no way the US can control the Mediterranean
Even just getting in would be suicidal, considering all entry points are literally chokepoints easily covered from Europe
And with that secured, the EU can continue trading with 7/10 of its top 10 trading partners
A bit more inconvenient, since it would go by land, but in a scenario where the EU and Russia grow that close, it's reasonable to assume that land infrastructure between them has been vastly improved, and China is already building its Silk Road 2
0, which is just that
Seriously, there's no realistic scenario in which the US can defeat a united Europe + Russia + all the traditional enemies of the US who are in the middle east and elsewhere, who'd join that alliance by default
Remember the war games where the US invades Iran
With its resources, Iran could sink a carrier already
You know what America's biggest weakness is
Y'all aren't used to losing
So when something isn't going your way for long enough, you "bring home the troops" instead of finishing what you started
On the other side you have a continent which is historically known for slaughtering each other until the whole continent burns
The start of our discussion actually says it all
The US would do everything in their power to prevent an EU-Russia alliance, because it's clear to everyone that if that happens, it's down to 2nd place for the US
No, but we have lots of restaurants that serve so called "malica". These are daily menus that are only served between 10:00-14:00
They are normally cheaper than regular food and mostly for workers who work close
All employers need to pay "malica" to workers
So normally workers get additionally 3
81 - 6
12 euros per day only for "malica".
I mean, most of Oliver Dragojević's music is really good
Plonkec/plonklistek/plonkceglc or švinglc/švinglceglc or cetelc
Plonkec (v. plonkati) probably comes from German *blank sein*
cetelc means *piece of paper* in probably some dialect
No idea where *švinglc* comes from
There could be more words in different dialects that I don't know of
makes sense
Yes, I think now most schools do
When I was in elementary school we didn't. You just hung your coat on a hanger infront of your main classroom and left your shoes under a bench
I think in first 2 or 3 grades we had a locker room
Just a big room where we all left our things
In high school we had lockers but we had to share with another person
We have lockers, but we usually use them just to keep shoes and umbrellas there or winter clothes
What you had lockers I never had any locker not in primary school or high school
In primary school we had only a place to leave your coat an shoes and that was it
In high school you had to carry all your things with you all day I went to SERŠ in Maribor
First 4 grades we had a shared space for coats and shoes and seperate drawers for notebooks, inside the class
From 5th grade on, we had our own drawers in primary and highschool
Ljubljana btw
People from other countries find wearing slippers for school funny, but it's very nice
Halls and classrooms were clean and I think wearing winter boots in heated classroms is not too comfortable
In highschool we kept out shoes on though
It was just big white lockers in the basement
I went to [GCC] (Celje)
I think they have better ones now
But damn, it was a good school back then, looking at their Instagam profile now, the new principal is killing it
I wish I could go there now
We had lockers in primary school (from grade 5 onwards) but we were the first generation to have them
In highschool we needed to opt in to have lockers but everyone decided to get one (it cost a couple of € per year)
While you could leave books at school most people didn't since you usually needed them for homework or studying
Most people kept their PE clothes there and "berilo" (not sure what the english word for it is lol)
This was ŠCPO in Postojna
To feel more comfortable
Who wants to be in their shoes all day
Especially little kids in snow or rain boots
That's just not normal
I think high schools here had different rules
Some allowed shoes inside, mine didn't. We had lockers but we only used them for coats, shoes and p.e. stuff and carried all our book for the day with us
They have different lockers now but idk how they use them
I guess it's up to each individual
But if you leave your books in school, how do you study at home
If you're talking about the narrow grey ones, they're still here but the only ones using them are the 1st years
Small kids wear slippers, similar to the ones on the first pic
In the higher grades everybody has  [those]
We had [this kind of] closed wardrobes, and never had lid desks
Have you ever heard of slippers
Do kids in kindergarten wear shoes all day as well
Yikes
Having visited my girlfriend in a kindergarten she works in, I can't imagine kids playing in their classrooms and climbing over gym equipment in the same shoes they wear outside
Hallways are always full of dirt and sand after they come in from the playground
But kids still jump and play and roll on the ground inside
It also rains and gets very dirty outside
My girlfriend works with 1-2 year olds and they climb everywhere and put things in their mouths, shoes included because that's how they learn
They have fabric and leather furniture and a comfy carpet in a calming corner and fabric toys and that all gets dirty even without dirty shoes all over it
Well 4-5 year olds still jump and dance and sit and play on the floor
And then it's raining outside, a whole bunch of kids comes in with wet shoes and then they go and play on wet and dirty floor
million = milijon
billion = milijarda
trillion = bilijon
quadrillion = bilijarda
etc
It's in the shape of a chicken
Not really
Especially in city buses where the exit door are in the middle/end of the bus
You ain't gonna tell across the whole bus
Nope, you almost always exit the bus through the doors at the back of it so you’d have to yell for him to hear anything, on the rare times you exit through the door next to him the most you’d say is bye
You’d get a lot of wierd looks from people if you said thanks
We are [chicken shaped]
I'm just going to put this here
**Slovenia because we look like a chicken
Italy would be my second best
> Croatia is also unique, but it's shape "makes no sense"
[dragon]
Prekmurje is entire head, Goričko is the brain
Don't you see the chicken
Coughs in Spanish
Are ISIS in your mind the oppressed party
I say, that would be a stretch ...
Pretty much most of the time unless they english is very good
You can usually hear an accent
We don't bite anything
We have: "Iti po gobe" meaning: "to go get mushrooms". And the other one is:"Iti rakom zvizgat" which means: "to go whistle to crabs".
In Slovenian, we say *iti* *rakom žvižgat* (literally to whistle to the crabs) or *iti po gobe* (to go mushroom picking), but I'm pretty sure we don't have any phrases with biting
In Slovenia, 'Culture day' also celebrates a poet: France Prešeren
[Prekmurje] is quite distinct from the rest of Slovenia in pretty much every way
History - They spent most of their history under Hungarian rule, while the rest of Slovenia was under Austrian rule
Language - They speak a famously difficult dialect that could almost be considered a separate language
They even codified their own alphabet that was based on the Hungarian alphabet, but it fell into disuse after WW2
Religion - While still majority Catholic, they also have a strong Protestant presence and are considered to be the center of Slovenian Protestantism
Geography - It's the flattest part of Slovenia, which together with different architecture, town design, etc
makes it visually distinct from the rest of Slovenia
Understanding people from Prekmurje is just so difficult it's ridiculous, I really appreciate them talking in standard Slovene when around others
They're basically what's left of pannonian Slovenes from before the Hungarians came, pair that with living under hungarian rule for centuries separate from the rest in Italy and Austria and you get a very distinct region
We can't sing but we do it [anyways]

Such a catchy classic
holy shit i remember guys like that walking around and sitting in parks when i was really young and living in Limburg
Why is there these wannabe ghetto kids in mostly rich european countries
There aint anything like these down here
I like ours
It's about friendship and peace, not about a single nation's patriotism, which is a rarity
Here are the lyrics:
God's blessing on all nations,
Who long and work for that bright day,
When o'er earth's habitations,
No war, no strife shall hold its sway,
Who long to see,
That all men free,
No more shall foes, but neighbours be
It's a drinking song
What else is there to say
Not to mention it talks about a free-thinking Slovene, who's politically aware, which I think fits well for a national anthem
What also fits well for Slovenes, is that it's also a drinking poem and a carmen figuratom in shape of a cup
Super prevod
What about the other lines in the poem
[Hrvatska do Tokija
In my area it's 4-7 usually
Idared, Jonagold, Granny smith, Braeburn, Cripps pink (Pink lady) and Fuji are almost always available and others rotate around
Depends on your taste and where you use them, I love pink lady but for some stuff it can't compare to Granny smith
Yo we used to have one of thise waffle makers
We also have extra pairs of slippers for guests in different sizes
Yep
It took me a while to start using 'what' instead of 'how' in cases like these, and I sometimes still make a mistake when speaking if I'm not paying attention
Could you share your edit, please
Thanks for sharing
If you don't mind, I'd like to read your version of the text
You can send it to me via a PM if you want
I work as a translator and I like reading texts like that in hopes of improving my language skills
:) It's been a long time since I worked on academic texts, but the one you posted seems to be too complicated and it doesn't quite get the message across
Thank you
It is still better than east Europe
Exactly my thoughts hahaha
At least he brought flowers
I see what Vitaly is doing in parliament

No making, no having, just doing :D
over here we are "sexing"

>used exclusively in sexual context
It's a romantic way of saying having sex, sure, but the phrase itself is not exclusively sex related
On the contrary, it's main meaning is to deeply love someone, completely nonsexual in meaning
Like food
For example: [makovka] or [makova potica]
Poppy seeds are food, primarily for sweets, but also found in savoury bake goods
While I don't think it counted as drugs, more as herbal medicine, there are recipes around for brewing tea from poppy flowers or unripe pods to help with insomnia
Does [this] beautiful glorious thing answer the question
These poppies are most probably *Papaver rhoeas*, the field poppy (could also be some other *Papaver* - not so familiar with flora of Spain, field poppy does grow there and it's probably that)
Poppy that is used for food (and opiate production) is *Papaver somniferum*, the opium poppy
That certainly isn't it
(Also if you come to Central/Eastern Europe, do try some poppy pastries
They're just yummy
> Mákos bejgli
Please tell me "bejgli" is the Polonized version of bagels
I feel like I need to give the recipe for this makowki thing to my pastry dealer
Oooh thank you
I hope to try it next weekend =D
If I look widely at the history of Slovenia, history of Slovenian poople, and history of the territories that Slovenians inhabit today in the wide sense
there are two such things
It would be really interesting to know what would happen to central european and balkan history if Ulrich the II of Celje would not get assasinated in Belgrade in 1456
If the house of Celje survived, it would probably lead to some of them getting the title of kings of some kingdom, at a certain point
Ulrich was already regent of Hungary at that time, had control over many lands in modern day Slovenia, some parts of Austria and especially in the Balkans
It is possible that the house of Celje could have stood at the front of the fight against the Ottomans and thus gaining advantage out of it like the Habsburgs did
Maybe a separate kingdom that could have included modern day Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia could have formed, thus completely diverting the way these areas developed from the 18th century onwards (under Habsburg supremacy)
But this is total speculation
Even if he survived, probably some of his followers would have succumbed to the Otomans or the Habsburgs anyway
It would be really interesting to see if in the 80's Milosevic would be ousted by some more progresssive part of the Serbian communist party and if an agreement about confederation would have prevented the breakup of Yugoslavia, leading to democratic and market reforms and Yugoslavia joining the EU in 2004
I just wonder how would this country look like today and which role it would have within the EU and more widely in the world
I would make it that Ivan Kramberger wasn't assasinated
He was running for parliament and I think he could have been a really good pm and he might have actually won
I don't think that the Samurai play the same cultural role in Japan as the figure of the cowboy or the concept of the Wild West play it for the US
And I don't think we have anything similar in Europe
The United States built their national identity upon the concept of colonization of "untamed land", of expansion into the wild nature and its subjugation to the will of men
The figure of the cowboy is at the forefront of this process, its main ambassador
Europe has been inhabited continuously since ancient times, at least since the Roman Empire has been filled with with a pretty complex entrenchment of civilizations and cultures
Here we are all aware of the continuity and slow evolution of human habitation and culture and there is no cultural concept of "wild natural area" that a society can colonize
Of course we have narrations about men who strive to survive in the nature or independent of civilization in various areas, or men that behave traveling warriors etc
But none of them has the same cultural role as the cowboy figure has for the US
> Some are strangers that come and go
Others are established lawmen seeking to tame a chaotic land
They survive on their wits, skill with guns, and the friends they meet on their journey through the vast expanse **now** known as the ~~Wild West~~ **United states**.
That's easy
We call them Americans
*sighs and flips open Krško self-destruct switch cover*
It's the Slav way
Also imagine if there were rewards paid out for reporting legal loopholes, financed by fines paid by those who failed at it and with the provision that loopholes get automatically plugged by an independent commission

Same here, they don't even want to take out things they were supposed to learn in schools right now
Their excuse: exams have already been printed out
High school 4th graders are going back to schools after 1st May holidays, which are next week
We don't have a national liquor
Maybe borovničevec, which is schnapps with bluebberies
Then there's viljamovka with Williams pear, tropinovec made with grape pomace, Brinjevec from juniper berries, Brkinski Slivovec (not Sliwovitz)
we're not really big on these things
Sadjevec
It's similar, but we use all the fruit mixed together (apples, pears and plums) not just plums
> bear’s blood
I have no idea what that is
edit: ok, I googled it
It schnapps with berries
Maybe it's local lingo, I don't think I have heard it here in my parts
I don't think English is hard language to learn, but it's not easy to really, really master it
There are a lot of rules in English that I still don't understrand, even after 10 years of speaking it
But it's definitely easier to learn than German language
I still can't hold a conversation in German, even though I am studying it for 5 years now
You do make a big deal of veterans
You even have a Ministry of War Veterans but I guess it's still not such a deal as it is in USA
Nicely sumed up
We're not big enough for our cities to have english names
But everyone does get very creative with their pronunciations of Ljubljana
Only one that I can think of that's still used (disregarding ethnically partially or formerly Slovene cities) is Vienna - Dunaj in Slovene
However, there's two more that I can think of, Munich and Cologne which in the past were called Monakovo and Kelmorajn, respectively
There's probably a lot more that I can't think of right now
Interesting, Slovene name for Venice is Benetke
There are also Kelmorajn for Köln, Draždani for Dresden, Lipsko for Leipzig and Kodanj for Copenhagen
Yes we have [Geopedia] It's way better than google maps or anything of that sort
The only gripe I have with them is, that they (just as our military/government mapmakers) transitioned from 1:250000 to 1:50000 scale, so it's not as detailed as it once was
But still if you plan to go hiking in Slovenia, I can't recommend it enough
Both
Cursive in the 3rd grade, the others in 1st and 2nd
I started school in 2002
Firat grade we learned printed then in second we learned cursive amd we had to use it throughout elementary/primary school
In highschool they didn't care as long as they could read what was written
I went to school in 2011 and we were taught cursive, I actually prefer it to normal letters
First they teach you printed like (grade 1 and 2 for me) after that it’s cursive all the way
For most of primary school you’re required to write in cursive and even in secondary school most people are used to writting in cursive so the majority still use it then and even later on in life
both actually
In 2nd grade we learn printed-like and then in 3rd grade we learn cursive but most people i know use printed because its easier
How much are we talking here
Learned a costly lesson in Bratislava
A local showed us 2 euro beers during a happy hour (Serbia vs France at basketball)
Combine that with the French starting to sing the anthem out of nothing, it was a glorious night
In Portugal is the tradition of Christmas Eve
I mean I'm sure 80+% of our population ate it at some point in their life
Squid is a lot more popular here but octopus is not unknown, especially in a salad form
I find it normal
They are quite easy to catch when dive fishing (or whatever the word it, snorkeling with a harpoon gun to shoot fish with), which is a favourite seaside pastime for a number of people I know, so I remember getting nearly sick of them every summer
I still quite like to have it about 5 or 6 times a year, but not more often than that
Slowly roasted with potatoes and onions is probably my favourite
Society be individualistic as fuck
Also I'd have to make roughly 10x more there to be able to afford the same level of security and comfort in life as here
Oh and forgetting all the social welfare and helthcare issues: Americans are literally full fash now, locking people up in concentration camps
And the 'normal, decent' majority just goes along with it
The bigger net salary is bull ... u still use the money on healthcare and education and pension, but the service is much worse
While I wouldn’t move to the gulf states, when I finish my engineering degree, I would sure as hell love to work there
Then I’d move to serbia and be rich
But the pay is sky high
Saldy in US 'liberal' means the opposite
Much is opposite in the usa
Like dying in the street because no cash for hospital is liberty and freedom
Us media and politician usually use 'liberal' as in for gay rights, not being religious, pro abortion etc
So conservative media paints everyone not a conservative religious asshole as 'liberal'. Even though republicans are also liberals in the normal meaning of the word
China - Kitajska
Hungary - Madžarska
Germany - Nemčija
Netherlands - Nizozemska
Montenegro - Črna gora
Croatia - Hrvaška
Germany -> Nemčija (land of mutes)
Montenegro -> Črna Gora (black mountain)
Hungary -> Madžarska (I don't know the translation, but it's most likely something historical)
Netherlands -> Nizozemska (the low land)
Croatia -> Hrvaška (again, don't know the translation, but it most likely has something to do with history)
Finland -> Finska (the land of wealthy or "fine" people)
Denmark -> Danska (the land of day)
There's probably more, but these just came from the top of my head
is Kıbrıs island of Cyprus
How do you call northeren part
Or just Engleska
Czech is funny for all Slavs :P That was Slovenian though
which word
No worries, honest mistake
At least you didn't mistake us for Slovakia
Actually, there's lots of schwas that aren't written (anymore)
The word "čmrlj" (bumblebee) in Slovenian usually trips up foreigners, because it seems to have no vowels, but in reality it's pronounced as čmǝrǝl (colloquially sometimes čmǝru), and 2-consonant-clusters aren't anything special for Italian either (e.g. "st" in "stazione")
Krst pri Savici(Baptism at the Savica river) written by France Prešeren, is our national epic
It is set during the violent christanization of Slovenes in the 8th century and is depending on who you ask, very pro-religious or anti-religious
If I remember correctly, a national epic or something (not certain about the translation) is considered a genre and most nations have it
Ours is technically not an epic, it only has some properties or it
It's Krst pri Savici (Baptism at Savica fall) by France Prešeren and tells a pretty tragic story about Christianisation of Slovene area
Apart from the tragedy, it's actually a very easy read with great rhythm
I used to know the Introduction part of it by heart for years after we considered it in school
Hell I forgot about this religion sentiment, that is pretty genius that it can be interpreted either way
Also I believe it's Savica fall
The river isn't really mention worthy for that couple of kilometers it has, but the fall is pretty neat
We actually took lessons on development of English language on example of Beowulf
Worked on it like idiots for at least a week
I also learned that if there is a word for something in the landscape that I don't know, it is almost certainly another word for a bog
It was slightly traumatic
We have deer, rabbits, hedgehogs and whatnot small wild animals living in the forest that doubles as city's main park
It is rare to see them just wander around residential areas though
Hedgehogs will do that the most, some people have them in the gardens in a kind of a symbiosis
There was an uproar a couple of years ago when a juvenile bear got into the park though
They closed off all access points until they managed to put it to sleep and relocate it
My grandma lives in a heavily forested part of Slovenia, and multiple times while out tending to her fields she has seen a brown bear
One time he came out of the forest, within 15 meters of her and her dog
luckily her car was right there so she and the dog quickly got in
Myself I have seen and heard wild boars while out on runs or walks many times
I've been listening to hedgehogs infront of my apartment building in Celje for a few weeks now
They are soooo loud they wake me up because I have a window opened at night
Unfortunately there's also many dead ones on the streets
Yesterday morning I saw 4 when I went to work
Its just dumb
Some things should be kept within its normal time frame - regardles of how much somebody pays
The main problem for general audience is, that the world cup will interfere with the wintersports broadcasts - which are, at least in my country, very popular
So yeah, will be very bad
It's "funny" how they didn't even try to hide that Qatar WC was bought
Very small, desert country, monarchy, barely any big stadiums, no football tradition whatsoever, human rights violations
But they got €€€.
There’s a great video on YouTube about this:
“German nation”
Not a movement but a real thing
Slovenian words are replacing many foreign words
At first i thought it was a joke
But it is making slow progress because many teachers are replacing their foreign words with official Slovene words
Some words sound really stupid
CD - zgoscenka
PowerPoint slide - zdrsnica
TV or computer Screen - zaslon
Example is the word 'kavnik'. It is supposed to replace the word 'džezva', for the pot to make Turkish coffee in
What's so stupid about it
Kavnik would mean a pot to make coffee in
If it would refer to all pots to make coffee in (like a cafetiera for example), then it would be good
But a džezva is a very specific coffee pot, for making a very specific form of coffee
But they didnt care about this
Most of our gramarians are people who stayed with their heads in the 80's. They still think that Serbo-Croatian is the chief foreign influence on Slovene, while English gets more and more influential every single day for 50 years
For me it is use of: Costumer instead of Customer, college instead of colleague, paid instead of payed,
I ofter mix up the english "mine" and german "mein"/or "is" and "ist".
Yeah, maybe we should declare Lizzy the Queen of Europe so there will be less things to be confused about
I have the same "problem" when discousing on Askmen
They are also very afraid of being accused of rape and partying culture and dating culture
I think I seem much friendlier and more outgoing
I don’t really think that my personality changes as much as I just appear more that way
I think it’s just that when I speak Slovene I seem colder and show less emotion
Yes, my voice gets deeper, I become more self confident, also a tiny bit more hostile
I forsee the same status quo as now until a new economic crisis hits and finally shakes politicians minds enough to make reforms that are long  overdue
If the EU federalizes, there literally won't be any "much bigger entities". There'll only be 2 equals - China and US
Slovenia has more dialects (which are the primary use of communication locally) than EU has languages, and some of the dialects are further apart than some EU languages
But everyone just uses formal Slovene to talk to each other and it works fine
Unless we're gonna make the case that Germany can't possibly succeed because someone speaking Bayerisch can't possibly be in the same federation with someone from the north, this argument should be laid to rest once and for all
They should be given a fair referendum in the relevant region though
Self-determination should always be respected
Well, no overlord ever willingly grants the right to self-determination, unless they're certain of the "right" result
I just think refusing to grant a referendum to the relevant region shows that the government is afraid of the result, which probably means that the ref-proponents are on to something
which is perfectly fine, if incredibly stupid
the UK, yes
CH and Norway aren't. I don't know enough about the exact deal Greenland has
If I remember anything from my childhood literature is that -ix means they are from modern day France ;)
Well -nig(g) is the germanized version and so not common in Slovenia, but the original \`ik\` very much still is
I know a Blatnik, Hribernik, Potočnik and a Veršnik personally (more than one of each actually), the rest are probably more common in some other region but they "sound" correct :)
Many of the Carinthian surnames you’ve mentioned are common in Slovenia but spelled differently
E.g.  Blatnig - Blatnik; Goritschnig - Goričnik, Koričnik; Hribernig - Hribernik; Lutschounig - Lučovnik; Pototschnigg - Potočnik (very common)
I’m not sure about that, there are still many common surnames that are describing a place but could be
However, some of the ones you’ve mentioned are indeed not very common any more (e.g. Glančnik - Glantschnig, don’t think I’ve ever heard it)
Probably because in each slavic language there are different surnames

[Vrag naj vzame]

[Stay forever]
[Nanana]
These were terrible
A song called "Narodno-zabavni rock" in 2010
Makes me cringe to this very day
Oh man, it would be easier to ask which song was actually good
Man I actually like the real Slovenian version of Nanana
it's an upbeat pop song
It doesn't have the usual eurovision syndrome out songs have where they make everything overly heavy and dramatic
Though I prefer if they didn't translate it
Tbh, most of the songs we send are trash
That song was good
First time hearing this so no and I haven't seen anyone wearing it ever
I don't think our soldiers fought on the western front
We were part of Austria-Hungary and mostly just fought the Italians
There's very little remembrance of WW1 here
Probably because we technically lost
In Slovenian it sounds fine (Češka), but Czechia in English sounds atrocious
At first it seemed slightly off, but I find it normal now
Especialy cuz we already use short "Češka" in Slovene
To me it's kinda funny, because in slovenian it's called Češka and everybody calls it that
Yep
I have never used the shortened English version and I never will
I just write Czech R. Shortened version makes me shiver
Same here
I'd sooner accept Canadia for Canada than this unnatural "Czechia" concoction
Čehija^ohgod No
i think something like check-ia or check-ya
Is it only to Slovenians that it sounds terrible or what
Not many others seem to be bothered as much
Canadia sounds fine compared to ... I'm just gonna go and say it sounds disgusting
I never wanted to admit it because I felt so alone in this lol
Definitely this one  [
We only have one lol
I actually like the current one more
The simpler, the better
Actually, hasn't croatia considered anytime adopting just a red/white checkboard for its flag
I think it would be beautiful
In Slovene, *revnost* is scarcity or the state of being poor
I checked etymology and it doesn't seem to be related
Theres also favšija (informal version of zavist)
And nevoščljivost which means you feel the other person doesnt deserve what they have/wish they didnt have it
38 dialects in seven main groups, which is a lot for a country with 2M people and 20
000km2 of area
About the differences: Usually dialects depend on the neighboring countries
So some dialects have more Italian words, others have more German words
There are other differences as well
For example: Slovene language uses also the dual form (in addition to singular and plurar), but the Litoral dialects don't use it
Up to 52 dialects depending on who you ask, Kajkavian Croat being a dialect or Prekmurščina and Rezijanščina being separate languages entirely
We're one messy place
Yes, 78% of Slovenia is considered mountainous
Also, Slovenia is a Slavic country, that borders Italy (romanic language), Austria (germanic language) and Hungary (Ugrofinnic
laguage), which means many different influences
Yeah
Every village has its own dialect
No, that was Slovakia
Yeah, that didn't end well when the Czechs told us to pump up a pool float
This exactly
Speaking your dialect (almost language) in other areas is often times "unacceptable" so we tend to use a mix of standard slovene and dialects
In official manner, standard slovene is always a must
No dialects are allowed when conducting official business
I for one come from westernmost part of slovenia, do our dialect includes a lot of Italian, Friulian and German words
When we speak it no one can understand us outside of our municipal borders
When we leave our municipality we keep the dialect but combine it with standard slovene
Our dialect is different in cases, sounds, sentence formation and words
Examples :
Kje si
- > Kod si
- > where are you

Czechoslovakia and Checnoslovenya, got it
In Slovenia that thing is pretty much easy to define:
Ljubljana = everything
Everywhere else = nothing
There are some big industries still in the smaller towns, such as Velenje, Novo Mesto, Kranj etc
but they do not operate as attractors of new population
It is almost incredible how centralized we have become after the completion of the highway system
Ljubljana is pretty much the only and undisputed economic, financial and cultural centre of Slovenia, where a lot of people go to live and which attracts daily commuters form most of the country
This is totally wrong
For example :
- Ljubljana is not the tourist centre; there are way more tourist sites outside of Ljubljana than in it
- Maribor is without a doubt the sports “capital of Slovenia”
- This could be somewhat offtopic but the worlds oldest grapewine (Stara Trta) is also in Maribor
- Your culture theory is also wrong
I think that  the fact that Maribor had the title of European Capital of Culture in 2012 speaks for itself
- The head office of the Slovenian Postal service is also in Maribor
- The biggest brewery in Slovenia and also the most popular beer brand (Laško) is brewed in Celje (and is also the better one)
- Anything that would be related to transport and transport industry is not in Ljubljana
The biggest centre for that in fact is Koper where our biggest and only commercial port is located
- As far as technology goes I would also give this title to Maribor
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FERI) recently developed and withe the help of ESA launched the first Slovenian satellite
This is a big technological advancement
The fact that  nor FRI nor IJS managed to do this speaks for itself
Just because Ljubljana is the capital does not mean that it automatically becomes the centre for everything
Sure there are things that can not compare to it but still you have to give credit to the rest of the country
Koper is definitely the center of logistics and transport
Novo Mesto probably holds the top spot for pharmaceuticals
Sea transport
Thats just because it has the sea
I'm sure if Ljubljana in Koper both had sea access there would be no competition
Btw, I'm from Koper and the port is not a big attractor of new population (at least not from Slovenia xD), It keeps beeing a stable employer though
Novo Mesto, yes, partly
But Ljubljana has Lek + chemistry and pharmacy faculties, which Novo Mesto doesn't have
It would rather be a carmaking centre (Revoz, Adria), but thats about it
Mate, it’s not just sea transport
the cargo that arrives to the port has to leave it somehow
There’s a small ocean of logistics and transport companies in Koper - TPG, Intereuropa, GMT, just to name a few
while I cannot think of any in Ljubljana
It’s true that Koper does not attract as much new population as Ljubljana, however, that does not change the fact that it remains the hub for logistics and transport
Yeah Koper has a port because it’s by the sea, and Ljubljana isn’t, I mean that’s just fact and you cannot change it, why would we talk about hypothetical situations
Ljubljana is what it is
Both, interchangeably or as a synonym to emphasize which vaccine you're talking about
Hmm
Seven, I think
Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Polish, Italian, Spanish and English
Edit: lmao forgot I can speak German
The anwser is eight
I've been to Singapore and the first 2 things I associate it with are:
-Your absolutely gorgeous architecture and incredible development that resembles what a modern city should look like
Definitely Dubai of SE Asia, hands down
-For some reason, the Petronas Towers from Kuala Lumpur (when I was 4 and 7, me and my family went to Kuala Lumpur from where we went to Singapore and from there to either Indonesia or China
I believed we were only in Singapore until later when I saw the date and place under the family photos on the travels) are something I always something I associate with Singapore
Sorry
The last battle of WWII in Europe was fought in Slovenia at Poljana na Koroškem, on the 15 May 1945, a whole week after the capitulation of Germany
Also, the Slovenian war of independence (also known as the Ten-Day War) was the first armed conflict in Europe after WWII
Thanks for correcting me, I didn't know that
This is what I remember from high school history, looks like we were taught wrong
Putting each other down
While I believe it is a generally popular sport in the Balkans and east of them, man we are great at belittling each other
Freediving since we currently have a world record holder in that
Competitive blaming of events in the 1940s and 1950s for the modern-day economical, social, and political situation
We have a joke that Hofer cashiers go to work at other shops for their holidays
Actually, I think it would be more fun to first watch them agree on the rules :D
Otherwise, I know a number of great fencers from Italy, and you have your own traditions
You could totally rule any discipline that doesn't contain too many Poles or Russians
No, I'm thinking HEMA
Most central and east Europe countries have strong clubs, but from what tournaments I've seen, Russians and Poles seem to do exceedingly well
Might also be skewed perspective, since I seem to have mostly seen the tournaments held in Czech republic and Poland
edit: spelling
> Slovenia much smaller
I feel attacked
It's getting bigger isn't it
No, I didn't know that was a thing
Now I would like to have them in Slovenia as well
It must be said, though, that excessive noise on our trains is only a problem during peak hours, other than that people usually keep to themselves
It would be quite hard to make quiet sections, since our trains sound like The Battle of Kursk
True that, I'm hopeful that the new trains will be better
I agree
They were not that bad
I actually expected they will be worse than they were actually
From 6 trains (4 were intercity, 2 were regional) that I took with CFR only two were delayed for 20 minutes
Others were on time
In Slovenia it's Ljubljana, in Belgium (second home) it's Leuven
Kinda so so
I think the height of it was a couple of years ago with a bunch of dank memes on instagram
The memes here on Reddit are usually literal translations of english memes and everyting sounds super cringy to me
I feel like the whole Slovenian sub is like a private party with people having inside jokes I don’t get
Obligatory "Trst je naš"(Trieste is ours) and "Hrvat je tat"(A Croat is a thief) memes
Usually used in an ironic way
Oooh and we also like salamanders
for some reason
We had some sex-ed in primary school somewhere at the age of 14, but before that it was mostly trough TV (no PG ratting at that time yet) but no parent talking
Nurses came to my school for sex ed in 6th and 8th grade
We are thought about it in schools but you just learn somehow
I actually technically learned about 'how children are made' quite early, from an illustrated encyclopedia which was the favourite book of my childhood
However, the concept of sex remained unknown to me until puberty
I remember those sex education hours
I was embarassed as fuck
No parent talking here either
Just joking or does this really happen
I wouldn't be surprised honestly
I like a lot of Slovene names for villages
Some are quite impressive, like Jeruzalem (there is some legend that the crusaders loved it so much they called it that when they passed the place, but I've no idea how true that might be) or Nebesa (Heaven)
I don't think any Slovene city has an official English translation, although Ljubljana almost deserves one
It seems to be impossible to pronounce for English speakers and I'd prefer they made up a name they could say
Actually Graz or Gradec as it’s known in Slovene means “small castle”.
Probably somewhere in the forest-covered south of the country
Which is also a much less popular wild zone then the Alps, which tend to have a bit too much of hikers and tourists sometimes
Every small village that isn't near a city
I guess Eastern Poland could use some investment
We have bohinj and bled in the north in the alps so that pretty much assures it not being in the middle of nowhere
I'd reckon the stuff between Idrija,Vrhnika and Škofja Loka
People live there
but there isn't anything major
Pretty much yes
Still if you find yourself on Kredarica you can't claim to be in e very popolous area
Yeah
But there you still have many small villages and highland farms
Around Kočevje you have just pure wilderness for kilometers in every direction
Only bears, no people
That's true
The population of the municipality I live in went from 4741 to 4977 in the past 18 years
And I would say that my municipality can be considered rural
> People usually move to “bigger” cities for their studies
And then they usually stay there
That's not true at all or there would be few people outside Lj and Mb
Mb population only grew for less than 500 in 10 years and Lj 14860
The "burial grounds" signs that you find near some forest roads in certain areas of the country, and they signify the burial grounds of mass killings
Mostly from WW1 and WW2 and it's aftermath
Not sure if it qualifies, but maybe the [dangerous road sign] Most of the time a variant of this sign with an exclamation mark appears
Only saw one example of this one with black crosses on route 409 near Planina
Not popular at all, it gained slightly more fame that one time we won a division or something
Our national team has some players that are from the UK, but are of Slovenian descent, so we are probably much better with them than we would be otherwise
Not popular, but present
I used to live next to club with playing field
We have 2 types of milk, sterilized under high temperature which is good for months and can be stored at room temperature or fresh which last 2-3 days and has to be stored in fridge or it will get soured
Eggs are always stored in fridge but they are sol in stores outside of them
I have a privilege of living in small town/village so I buy both of them from local farmer and store them in the fridge
The most common milk here is UHT pasteurised so as long as it's unopened it can stay at room temperature for months
After opening it goes in the fridge
Fresh milk is always in the fridge
Eggs are stored at room temp in the store
But I put them in the fridge when I get home
They last longer
We refrigirate our eggs and 1 milk at a time so that it is cold
Yea, same
Fresh milk goes bad one or two days after the date even in a fridge
And 4th day after opening is on a limit as well
In Slovenia it does happen
Especially if there is a bigger celebration and there were plates of food and not an individual portions
Then normally they pack you remains of these food plates
I mean if you already paid why would you not take it with you
Completely normal and happens on daily basis
They even ask you if you want to take it with you
QWERTZ with Š, Đ, Č, Ć and Ž on the sides
I remember i was thete 2 years ago
It is wonderful museum with alot of great things to see
I read about that and found it hilarious
I sure would have been one of the party goers
I'm actually surprised that we don't yet have gas stations in every shopping centre so that they could work
But it is true that it has not been even a year yet
I'm not sure what rules we got about gas stations, except that they work and are crazy busy on Sundays now that almost everything else is closed
Even a lot of small shops opted to close, I think there is about 1 on every road leading to the city centre in Ljubljana now
Complimenting is pretty broad and it's the same as in any language, but funnily enough, you would very rarely say "I love you" aka *Ljubim te* in Slovene
It just sounds weird in my opinion
What is used most often is "I like you" aka *Rada te imam*.
Destroying our economy for few years, getting our credit rating into low B, just in hopes to get Troika to force us to keep his party in power
It didn't help
But it did crashed our economy for years to come, and we're still trying to get out of that mess
Mostly by just selling everything to anyone, which meant we sold our biggest retail chain to Croatian company, that also imploded, and now one of the biggest employers and it's chain of linked professions, that by some accounts employs, or rather has people dependant on it (farmer with exclusive deals, various smaller industries, for whom this is their biggest trade partner) around 40% of all employed people is in a "limbo" between going under or being sold off to Russians, who might just sell it off to get back what the Croatian company owes them
Well all speak in certain dialect, some people from Ljubljana sometimes think that some of the dialects are too villagey
Indeed
Proper Slovenian (and it's bastardized form in Ljubljana) are just the Esperanto for people from all over this huge country to communicate, since without it, most people wouldn't be able to understand each other
Prekmurska gibanica from the northeastern Slovenia
It's even hard to find a good one elsewhere in Slovenia, much less abroad
[*Mavželj*] or [*Mežerli*] from Upper Carniola and Carinthia
It's ball shaped, made out of beef entrails and/or minced pork head meat and brain
It's an Alpine dish, called *saumaise* in Bavarian German
Some people in some regions also still eat [edible dormouse stew] which is a dish from Roman times
Wait, is polenta obscure
It's one of the most common baby foods all over Slovenia
Or it used to be when I was a kid anyway
> Bubble and squeak (England), rumbledethumps (Scotland), colcannon (Ireland)
Is it just me or do all three sound like they wouldn't be out of place going on an adventure together
Good to know palačinke are a thing of the whole ex austro-hungary
Change it to Slovakia and change Slovakia to Slovenia
Maybe then the US could get it right
"Horvejša" - interesantno
I like Valuk
He was a duke of Alpine Slavs
I think Lars would work
I know a Slovenian Lars
It works
Typical Slovenian surnames end with:
-ar
-er
-ič
-nik
-ec
You forgot -šek
also -cl and some -a.
or -ak
-ič is the most common ending of specific endings but it's not nearly as common in Slovenia as in other countries
-ič is not that common
The most common is probably -ar
Interesting, we use “Novakova” when your trying to say Novak’s daughter/wife/mom but not as a surname
There is also “Novakov” which means Novak’s son/brother/husband
Yes, but that is only Italianized version of Slovenian and Croatian surnames that end with ič in Slovenia or ić in Croatia
It's easier to learn than the other possibilities
I visited Slovakia last December and could get by with Slovenian only
It was a similar experience in Czechia
It takes some getting used to, but generally it works
At first I wanted to use English at the Slovak border, where I purchased the vignette, but the teller heard my brother talking in Slovene with my brother and he just spoke Slovak to me
From then I didn't even bother with English and stuck to Slovene
It works quite well, even after a couple of beers when I reverted to my dialect
But since Bratislava is on the Austrian border and I'm from Styria, where dialects generally use many German words (I sometimes joke it's like German Creole), it went just fine
Which brings me to another story where an Austrian understood (well, got the gist of the conversation) me and my friends talking in heavy dialect, meaning many German-derived words
Its nearly the same language lol
Cajt - Zeit - time
Cajger - Zeiger - clock hand
Bremza - Bremse - brake
Ek - Ecke - corner
Fertik - fertig - done
Ksiht - Gesicht - face
Flaša - Flasche - bottle
Lampa - Lampe - lamp
Mašina - Maschine - machine
Bek - weg - away
Ohcet - Hochzeit - wedding
Žleht - schlecht - bad
Hozntregerji - Hosenträger - suspenders
Župa - Suppe - soup (though this one may be french)
Žajfa - Seife - soap
Tepih - Teppich - rug
Bademajster - Bademeister - life guard
Talar - Teller - plate
Cimer - Zimmer - room
And many many more
We may also use serbus (servus) as a greeting, everything car/engine/tool related (kuplunga - Kupplung)
Some words are not even dialect specific and are understood across Slovenia (tepih, žajfa
Until, I think, the spring od nations in the 19th century, Slovenian was full of German and slovenianised German words
Influence of German can be seen in standard Slovenian even today
We say nasvidenje or izgled, which are direct translations from German (na-svidenje - auf-wiedersehen, iz-gled - aus-sehen)
Since when do you require to need to speak English in France to succeed
I have plenty of French friends who tell me nobody learns English in France just because it's unnecessary
I've even been to France myself a couple of times and nearly nobody spoke English
oooof hit a weak spot haven't I? How dare I compare the all mighty englishman to a filthy american
Slovenian and Croatian are both slavic but barely the same, some people have told me that our language sound arabic to them
Cohabitaton will do that, I guess
It goes both ways too, but to a lesser extent
Germans who lived in the slovenian part of Styria and Carinthia (I think also Germans from the southern part of austrian Carinthia) also use(d) some bastardized Slovenian words
Klutsch - ključ - Schlussel - key
Kua - krava - Kuh - cow
But these dialects are to my knowledge lost, since the Germans either don't use German any more or, more extensively, moved and were moved to Austria
Oh and I use the pre 1918 terminology here for clarity
Back then Austrian meant anyone who lived in the Austrian part of the country, including Slovenes
I mean im really not sure, but judging by my experience in three very big and influential non-English speaking European countries (Spain, France and Italy) and their lack of the English language I have series doubt that even at the professional level that a few are capable of speaking English
In comparison, in Slovenia a country with 2 million people, we are introduced with English and French/German as soon as we hit primary school
For us to succeed we must learn important languages
I guess the big countries have a form of autarky while the smaller ones just cannot have
you are right your majesty, we do understand Croatian and Serbian quite well, but they cannot understand us whatsoever
Just Hungary
With Austria and Italy we have generally friendly relations, deapite some issues here and there mostly regarding our minorities
We have a border dispute with Croatia, but that does not represent a threat
While on the other hand our current prime minister and the hungarian president are good friends, and Janša gets his media and his party financed from Hungary
He fancies Orban's model of illiberal democracy and wants to introduce it over here
Plus that, Hungary had a serious bet to invest in an important rail link between our only port and the hinterland which would give it de facto control over our port, which was luckily prevented, as we are capable to invest in it without foreign help
And of course Hungary is the one that most openly talks about its irredentism (wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary)
I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but Orban scares me a bit
I feel you
Corona is not a threat, Janša is
The narrative in our country atm is that our PM (Janša)  is practically a Hungarian vassal, Orban's puddle
Most of the media here are left-leaning and current PM is on the right, so one should take these allegations with a grain of salt
I do not have information about any administration houses
Our media continuously reported (for a few years continuosly) that Hungary will directly invest in the new rail link between Koper and Divača (I think the contribution was intended to be around 300-400 million euro out of the total 1,2 billion cost), which is currently under construction
It was continously also reported that informal talks were put in place about how could we "return the favor" to Hungary
At the end it was revealed that Hungary had been promised a large plot of land near Luka Koper, which lay outside its concession area, but inside the area that is aimed for the port to enlarge in the future (designated by a national planning act for the port)
Thus the enlargment of the port could have been serioulsy hindered
There was initially also talk about a potential sell off of a shareholder slice in Luka Koper, but there was no talk about this later on
This, however, is anathema to us as a local community that depends on the port as the largest employer and actually a very profitable state owned company
About the irredentism; I am aware that this is just part of his nationalist discourse
But also the holocaust began just as a bunch of stupid prejudices, that someone started to exploit for political gain
And if you keep reading continuously news like this [one] you just start to worry
It might seem stupid, if you take just one piece of news in consideration, but if many come repeatedly, it's obviuously a pattern
Most of our media is liberally oriented, with Mladina being the only one really left-leaning
Since I still consider liberalism as a "normality" in a liberal democratic political system (that we supposedly still have), our media is just actually normal western media with many journalists doing a good or average job
Janša is trying to portray all media that arent't Nova24 (TV station owned by Janša's party), Reporter or Demokracija (right-leaning newspapers) as left-lening, which is just not true and which is part of his political discourse aimed at discredt anyone who tries to criticize him
When I read how Orban and Kaczinsky behave towards the media, their discourse sounds strikingly familiar
Yes, besides slovene I speak italian too
Italian is a co-official language in the area where I live, sice an italian minority lives here
They have also a parallel school system in italian language
I went to an italian-speaking kindergarten, then later i continued my education in slovene, which is my motherthongue
A lot of people here speak and comprehend italian, but not many actually speak it at home and in their everyday life
Oficially the minority counts about 1000 people in an area of 50
000 inhabitants
The poeple who are part of the minority mostly speak fluent slovene too
So there is a lot of us who are completely bilingual regardless of which is the motherthongue
But the people of the minority mostly tend to adapt to the majority, sadly
The heavieast blow to the italian speaking community however, was that most of the italian speaking population left our country after WW2
The number of those that remained has stayed somehow stable in the later decades
Too bad
I love the language
I really hope that Irish gets revived somehow in the future
It's beutiful really
There is a large number of them, in all generations
But I can't really tell if it's a majority or not, but if it's not, it' close to a majority
Most of my generation learned by watching the italian TV
Nowadays children mostly grow up with Cartoon Network (I channel I always deemd as stupid) and they speak better english than italian
In my generation it was the other way around
I actually grew up by watching italian synced anime, which made my childhood kind of multicultural, a weird slovene-italian-japanese blend

Post WWII kilings [example] probably NSFL
Officially it is not yet determined, but there are indices that put the blame to at least local authorities although direction was supposed to came directly from top leaders of Yugoslavia  [Dispatch from Kardelj]
Well not all of them, some were:
Homeguards - whose primary object was defending villages from "bandits who plundered and rape", Fore sure they did not fight Nazis who provided weapons for them but most were young boys brainwashed by catholic church and school
Chetniks (name originates from before WWII as member of the četa - regular army company unit of the kingdom)- They flighted firstly for the king against Nazis, after they saw what Nazis done to retaliate (like burning village, shooting villagers) they called ceasefire with them at least until partisans would be destroyed
Ustashe - Army of Independent state of Croatia, Nazi puppet state
A lot of them were Nazi supporters, but many were dragged in all of this
And then there were their wife and childrens who are also in those holes
I feel a bit familiar with Morocco, since I had a friend who has been there as a tourist, another one who has been a surf instructor there, and I met a couple of people from Casablanca/Rabat at an exchange
I also know a few people from Egypt, but I feel the country much less familliar, If I think beyond my childhood infatuation with ancient Egyptian monuments
Otherwise I feel the Maghreb countries very unfamilliar, especially Algeria,  which has a huge population and covers a large part of the area, but I have never met anyone from there or anyone who visited it
Čefur -  typically an immigrant from ex-Yugoslavia (most often Serbia & Bosnia) who likes to wear tracksuit, loves to drive with open window and blasts very loud turbo folk music
Girls have normally black hair, hair extensions and like to wear a lot of make up and trashy looking clothes
Čefur is a state of mind, not every immigrant from other ex-Yugoslavian Republics is a Čefur
Prekmurci - people from the region of Prekmurje, often stereotypized as uncivilized and uneducated
Čefurji - immigrants from ex-Yugoslavian countries
Tracksuit in the streets, sweatpants with tanktop, white socks & knock-off sandals (Adibas and the like) in the sheets
Limka/buraz - vapid, superficial girls & boys, usually highschoolers but sometimes young adults aswell
Dudes only care about getting high, buff & having sex
Girls only care about their appearance and being popular
The terms “Chad” & “Stacey” probably come closest to this
This term is specific to Ljubljana & the surrounding region AFAIK
Isn’t a klošar just a homeless person
Still love yugo rock even today
Some of the songs from 70s/80s still remain hugely popular today, and are heard in clubs regularly
Peronaly I can understand Slovak and south slavic just enough so I can travel but, can't hold any meanungfull conversation
But Polish, Bulgarian, Russian
Only every 10th or 15th word I can make out but it could have different meaning
Example otrok means child in Slovene and if I remember right in some slavic languages it means slave
I can pretty much understand any of the slavic balkan languages to some degree
Depends which one
Slavic is a big family and understanding Russian is a lot harder than Croatian
Slovenian here
Cro/Srb/Bos - 90%+ understandable
The rest of the Slavic languages range between maybe 15-25% understandable (Ukrainian, Polish, Bulgarian) to up to 50% understandable (Slovak, Czech, Macedonian, Russian)
But the single most epic thing are the two Slavic esperantos - Slovio and the more modern Interslavic (Medžuslavjanski)
Those two are probably >80% understandable without any prior exposure

Throwing people in karst pits
Ah a fellow nation of culture I see
Actually it would be quite ridicolous for such a small country like us to divide even further
Prekmurje used to have its own language standard derived from their dialect, which is really specific and very different from standard slovene, but this hasn't evolved in a true national movement
In my region (Istria) we have jokes sometimes about putting a border on Črni Kal (a village at the Karst edge, the natural border that divides Istria from the rest of Slovenia), but those are just that, jokes
However, both regions are so small, that they would be probably considered microstates and their independence wouldn't really make sense
We're very far away from a true separatist political movement
How are the thinks in Tetovo, looking trough census in 2002 Macedonians were already minority there
I guess this gap has increased
Eggs and testicles are both jajca
Bratranec (male) and sestrična (woman) are both cousin in English
Same in Slovene, both are “zmaj”
Another fun one: *Danka* is both a rectum and a danish woman
Both
If I’d speak with Slovenians or Austrians, I would tell them that I’m from Lower Styria but if I‘d speak to other people, I would say that I’m Slovenian
I'd say that I identify myself as a Slovene first, a Styrian second, a resident of Slovenia third (since my parents are all Slovene but come from Trieste and Klagenfurt)
I don't remember writing this comment

They were the best shit
[Rakov Škocjan] is one that springs to mind, but generally anywhere where there is karstic topography, the environment is quite interesting
Ritoznoj (ass sweat) I think is the funniest, and their wine is called Ritoznojcan
Bruhanja vas (puking village)
Lepa njiva (pretty field) or Dolge njive (long fields)

There's a lot of funny village names here but most of them are pretty innocent
There is a town in Croatia called Pofuki
Roughly translates to fuck it
Črnci - meaning black people (yes plural)
Črnci
Directly translates to "blacks". All fine and dandy until you reach the end of the town
I gotta visit
I was looking for the correct translation for that but yours is perfect
Purely human error
The worst is probably [Britannia Airways Flight 105] September 1, 1966
Controlled flight into terrain due to the pilots forgetting to set the altimeter to the right setting, 98 fatalities
The deadliest I can think of since we are an independent country is the [canoe accident near Blanca] July 3, 2008
A group of people including the local mayor decided to traverse the Sava river before the completion of a hydroelectric dam that would permanently prevent such an activity
In the meantime, water had already been redirected from the riverbed over the spillway
The plan was to avoid the unfinished dam by exiting the boats upstream, carrying them along the bank and continuing downstream
However, two boats decided to continue through the spillway despite warnings and the fact that the construction site was off limits for unauthorized personnel
They broke up upon crossing
13 people drowned with only one survivor who was lucky enough to be washed clear of the torrent
Now that's some serious shock and awe
Well, he certainly had it scratched anyway
Props to your dad and I'm happy the bouncer wasn't a total dickhead

Meh, just a dent
A bus and a fucking *ambulance driver* out of all people
Quick question - what is it with Polish truck drivers
Why do the repeatedly try to drive me into the divider when I attempt to overtake them
Do they do that to Poles as well or is it just in foreign countries
I most often get asked this by Americans who are visiting Croatia/Slovenia
I usually answer that I'm from here
The next question is almost always "And when did you move here
". I empasize that I'm *from here* and they always look shocked cuz I sound (and honestly look) super American
It's either that or they ask if my dad works for the military/the embassy
I personally find it funny
It has only snowed once in December where I live
Entire January without snow
It's the coldest winter in a while and temperature only goes above 0 for about 2 hours a day but there just hasn't been any snowfall
Over the past few years where I live there’s been a snow early in winter (dec, jan) and then one in march and almost nothing inbetween
Still exists here, but I'm not sure how popular it is
Exactly
What about [Juwelo TV]

I didn't correct them because by that time I'd grown tired of the inaccuracies and just facepalmed internally
The second one still rustles my jimmies when I remember it and I wish I'd said something
To me this is pissing on the graves of those young men
Edit: Changed "grammar school" to "gymnasium" because apparently the term is valid
Also keeping "grammar school" for Grammar Nazi jokes

It was clear from the context that she did not know its purpose
Nah, she was shit regarding history in general
Never mind the bombs, there are almost 4 years of brutal fighting in the Pacific and 2
5 years in North Africa and Europe that she brushed aside
Not to mention the US taking on the role of the so-called arsenal of democracy
Both viewpoints are wrong
Neither the Western Allies not the USSR were not sole victors of WW2
Whoever claims otherwise has an agenda or is ignorant
>But to be fair, the Americans did nothing for you in particular
The claim was "did nothing". Not "nothing for you", "nothing".
>One could even say they betrayed you (giving Stalin reign over you)
One could say that but they would also be wrong for several reasons
First, Yugoslavia wasn't alligned with Stalin
Second, it is silly to think that one of the main victors of WW2 would be denied a sphere of influence
Third, the Western Allies didn't owe us anything
They already came to help against Nazis and to insinuate that even that wasn't enough is outrageous to me
Fourth, another war with the USSR right after the cessation of the greatest global conflict is hardly a good outcome
Fifth, what kind of mental gymnastics must one perform to blame Americans for us having to endure communism
Blame the communists
The ones we had weren't "imported" from the East, they were our own
You are not retarded
Oh yes, arguments from authority are always the best
Can't fight that, right
\*Nazis
Oh, shit
Thechnicaly correct, but it just so happens that in Islam that happens far more often than with any more religion
*Far* more
We learned the term in English classes
It is possible we just took the nearest equivalent we could find in the British educational system and used the name for our school
I'm not familiar with their system enough to give an opinion on whether it is appropriate or not
Anyway, it is a high school you go to after primary school at 14-18 years of age and gives its students a general education
Edit: Well fuck me, apparently we *can* use the word "[gymnasium] for it even though our English teacher said it was incorrect
How appropriate for this thread
Oh I know, I just added to your point
I apologise for my harsh response
From the way you wrote I assumed you held those views and got a bit triggered
I love your username
The number really nails it
I understand
Would "grammar school" be an appropriate term
Funnily enough I was going to write "aquaduct" at first but checked the spelling because I wasn't sure
It seemed more natural because "water" is "aqua" in Italian and the spelling is "akvadukt" in Slovenia
That's good enough
Thank you for the explanation
As for Americans, a user replied that in the USA grammar schools are elementary schools
The confusion is complete
Not really at least in my part of the country
Maybe its different in the eastern part
Oh wait, it’s “Sveti trije kralji” day
Maybe some minorities in Prekmurje but I don’t think anyone else celebrates it
National Anthem itself, it was written by our greatest poet France Preseren
"Ne vrag, le sosed bo mejak
" (not devil but friend will be neighbour)
From anthem Zdravljica (the Toast) - France Prešern
Probably you are right, yes
Although my first idea was the first verse of Povodni mož:
*Od nekdaj lepe so Ljubljanke slovele*
*al lepše od Urške bilo ni nobene*
I found the translation for Povodni mož [here] and for Zdravljica [here] Scroll down in both cases
Just came here to say this
It's probably just me, but in my circles people always preferred the Baptism at Savica (also by Prešeren):
"Manj strašna noč je v črne zemlje krili, kot so pod svetlim soncem sužni dnovi" - "Less terrifying is the night under Earth's dark wing than days lived under the bright sun as a slave" (my translation, predictably terrible, but I couldn't find one online)
..goes better with our history, like white wine goes better than red with fish :P Also less idealistic, but useful in way more contexts than the anthem :)
&#x200B;
EDIT: ah, found a more "official" translation [here] "Less fearful the long night of life’s denial Than living ‘neath the sun in subjugation
" It's a Wikipedia article about Ivan Hribar
As a respected person and ex mayor of Ljubljana (our capital), he was asked by fascist invaders during WWII to become mayor again and help them pacify the rebellious population
Already 90 years old at the time, he instead commited a public suicide and left that verse in his farewell letter
Apparently, like me, he also found it more practical :(
There is an urban myth that this verse in translation was graffitied onto the building of my high school for some years before I attended
This
In Slovenia we have at least one piece of news a year describing a group of tourists (mostly Czech) hiking in sandals or a similar bizzare thing
Are you Felix (PewDiePie) and Marzia
To be frank, when I went to Transilvania there were many hungarian signs, for a moment I thought we did a wrong turn and went east instead of west from Oltenia
We need them gone
I feel more unsafe with them on our continent than without
I've just looked at the map of lactose intolerant people and it seem like white population has least trouble with that, anybody knows why is that
Maybe because of the recent conflicts, but I find especially interesting the countries on the eastwards borders of Europe
So namely, the Middle East, Turkey, the Caucasus, Ukraine and Belarus
I also have a friend of Ukrainian and Georgian origins and she makes me think about these places a lot
Some historical very strong empires and kingdoms were located there, of which we learned quite few things at school, even if they had quite an influence on us
for example the Byzantine and the Otoman empires
And, of course I find also the Balkans very interesting, being the part of Europe that was an intermediate between the Middle east and continental Europe
Does it exist online
Do you have the link
Either in 8th century to [Carantania] because it would be interesting to see how our ancestors lived
It would also be interesting to see a Ducal integration on a [prince’s stone ]
The second option would be to 14th century in the time of [counts of Celje ] I could warn Urlik II
from his assassination in Belgrade or convince him to let his son Friderik mary Veronika and with that continue on with the blood line
Who knows maybe Slovenia would be as big as Austrian empire at that time if they succeeded
Sometime before mass population and pollution, to enjoy our natural gems to the fullest and in peace
Probably the week around July 19, 1906, when the railway through my region was opened to public
If not possible that precise, then any week between 1850 and 1914, as I think late 19th/ early 20th century (before 1914) was a nice period in history
Our country was a part of Austria-Hungary then and I believe that Austrian rule was better than what we have now
>Our country was a part of Austria-Hungary then and I believe that Austrian rule was better than what we have now
Can I ask you why you think that
Not trying to be mean or anything just curious
I know Russuan, UK, German, Italian, Slovak, Polish, Croatian, French, Spanish and Slovenian
And well our European
I only know the italian one (not the words though) and spanish one because of Moto GP
The italian one is easy to recognise because it just sounds so italian
If the communists were half as good at economy as they were at composing, we'd be begging for the EUSSR
Wait, does that mean that communism is just a Big Music conspiracy
Why that's simple: a big house, multiple cars, a goddamn yacht, the usual FLEX
Slovenia is culturally divided into 6 regions: Prekmurska, Stajerska, Primorska, Gorenjska, Notranjska and Koroska
And let me say, not only does each of these regions have their set of slang, Primorska is notorious for an accent that is pretty much impossible to understand to outsiders
So yeah
Absolutely
Most spoken languages that are even considered dialects are ok-ish, I usually need explanation for some words, but nothing too bad
However some are just too close to neighbouring languages for me to process, or the pronounciation too far off the one I'm used to
Dialects from vicinity of Idrija come to mind
Also fun fact: I work 20km out of the capital city and the local spoken language is already considered part of a different dialect group
I understand them, but there really is an obvious difference
I find it sort of amazing and sort of scary that a language with 2mio speakers can have such variety
Hah, I've seen this, I think they actually show this video at some point in university here, or maybe it is just really popular with English students
We have 7 big dialect groups, all with distinct accents, that can differ not only between dialect groups but sometimes also between neighbouring towns
Not only that, if you go few km outside of town, you can already hear the difference between accents, to a point you can almost pinpoint a village
I won't even start talking about differences between Primorska and Koroška or Prekmurska
Did you mean prekmurska, not primorska
>  Prekmurska, Stajerska, Primorska, Gorenjska, Notranjska and Koroska
RIP Dolenjska
Oh that explains a lot lol
Can you tell me Ljubljana, Maribor and Koper's region
Yeah, sorry
Ahh Dolenjska, never even knew thee
Ljubljana is Osrednjeslovenska, or Central region (historicaly part of Dolenjska, Lower Carniola), Maribor is Štajerska or  Styria, and Koper is Primorska or  Littoral
Ljubljana is a lot more gorenjska than dolenjska
Historically everything south of Lj grad was said to be dolenjska (Vič, Rudnik), the rest was gorenjska (Šiška, Bežigrad, Jarše, even Polje)
I noticed some accent differences between people from koper/litoral and Ljubljana/Maribor
The difference wasn't that notable between the two major cities
You can actually tell from the accent in English from where in Slovenia someone is
Parts of Carinthia and Prekmurje have very typical pronounciation that is hard to shake off, and for some of them English is second foreign language (German being first)
Oh there is a very big difference between the Ljubljana and Maribor accents and especially their dialects
>and for some of them English is second foreign language (German being first)
If you meant Carinthian Slovenes by any chance, German isn't their first foreign language, but their second language
I noticed that some people in s-love-nia sound like they are native English speakers but their slovenian accent is perfect
It's amazing the combo
Usually people that speak slovenian as their first get the accent when speaking english but this people I've met they don't. I'm not sure where they are from
I think it depends on the school
It is not general, certainly
Oh, I thought you meant Slovenes in Austria
>I think it depends on the school
It is not general, certainly
I think about 3% of Schools in Slovenia choose German over English for the first foreign language these days
German being mostly in the northern parts, as you said earlier
It varies from year to year
Last two winters were quite mild, but during one before that we had serious snow and cold for the whole February
What I noticed is that we commonly get a flash of cold and sometimes snow already in the autumn, but then December is somewhat lukewarm
Depends on the region of course and altitude, but in general winters are very mild last 10 years or so
Snow lasts for days now, not weeks or months
As a kid, I remember jumping from balcony into snow; I wouldn't recommend doing that now :)
There are predictions that a lot of ski centers will have to close in a few decades if thing continue this way
Same as with other religions, as long as you are not forcing your belief to other you are fine
Quite normal, at least I have not been in any weird position because of admitting it
Actually I have the feeling that if someone young admits that is religious, he gets weird reactions
But then again, I'm a young adult with an urban lifestyle, there are parts of the country (especially rural ones) that take religion much more seriously
Still, in general, being atheist is ok, nobody feels ashamed of it over here
He goes around doing regular people's work like picking up trash and working on fields instead of doing his actual job as a president
But we still love him, its just jokes
Our prime minister used to be a popular comedian
That's funny enough on itself, no need for jokes
in Sloveve, I say Budimpešta (š being sh in English, you could say), as that is the Slovene name for Budapest
but in English, I say it with an s, could be wrong doe ( [buːdəpɛst/] is the pronunciation according to Wikipedia)
Basically this:
Albanian, Welsh and Basque for me
If it's instant I'll go for the ones where I have no other connections to
German, because why not
Then Mandarin (which would also give me rough knowledge for reading other languages which use the same characters),
And then probably Dutch, for no other reason, then I like it
Mandarin
Turkish
Russian
All the other European languages are quite manageable
From similar pathways you have
Portuguese
Spanish
French
Italian
Greek
Then you have like slovenian, and most of southeast countries come from similar grounds (Russian)
Then you have Mandarin which is probably the most amazing language out there, with simplified/traditional chinese having years of culture and huge number of dialects within Mainland China and it's Independent regions
Also it has come to my attention that Mandarin speakers who also speak English have an easier time learning Germanic languages
Turkish because I kinda like their overall culture and their food is extremely good
German- because I already know some basics French- it might be useful
Dutch- just cuz it’s kinda cool
We are a bit of an odd one out here
The regime in Yugoslavia wasn't nearly as oppressive as the regime in USSR and satellite states
As a consequence we kinda just left a lot of the monuments in place and I don't really think we renamed that many streets or other named public things
That being said, the theme of most monuments is fight against fascism and remembrance of fallen partisans, with a few statues to politicians and Tito
I don't recall us having random busts of Marx and Lenin all over the place
We never really distanced ourselves from the previous country and we never got over it and most (if not all) of our political debates devolve into Partisans v Slovene Home Guard (left vs right, but like we're perpetually stuck in 1945)
I was thought that North and South America are separate continents
There that there are also Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Antarctica
Slovenia, 15-20 years ago: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, Central America (mentioned as kind-of-but-not-really a continent), South America, Antarctic
It's pretty decent in Ljubljana
We were lucky that our designers took inspiration from Copenhagen during the urban expansions in the '60s, so all the major intersections and underpasses got cycling lanes very early on
Most of the city center is now closed for motor traffic so cycling is often the best method of getting to/from the center
The cycling network is big enough and the city small enough that you can comfortably get pretty much anywhere with a bicycle
However, the quality varies a lot and some sections were clearly designed by people who've never ridden a bike
This things, at least in my area, are usually held at farm tourism places (kmečki turizem) or a 'gostilna' (a family owned type of restaurant)
You sit down at the tables, you talk to people, they bring out beef and mushroom soup
Then they bring out plates with food and salad bowls
Then comes the band, usually 2 or 3 people that plays oberkrainer/pop folk music and one of the guys tries to be funny
A few people dance, most sit around and talk
Then they bring out a cake some time later
And then sometimes there's some terrible games and even more terrible skits and some more music and few people dancing and the rest sitting around and talking
edit: I forgot to mention, before the official party, family and friends come to the persons house on the day of his birthday and put up a may pole or a giant flower with a sign saying how old the person is
And often times they put a weird human sized doll next to it
If the person is 50 years old, the may pole has to be up for 50 days
The putting up celebration is organised by family and friends and removing celebration by whoever it was put up for
edit2: This is for major (round) birthdays or round wedding anniversaries, nor normal 'family gatherings', obviously
A normal family gathering is just close family members for something like Christmas or easter, gathered around the kitchen table, that's all
I have a smallish family cell - there's 8 of us, all on maternal side, plus my husband
We meet for holidays and birthdays, we usually share food preparation duties, have a dinner, and happily yell over each other
You can tell we are related by strength of our voices, and I married a fitting guy for us
The only outlier is the grandmother, and my mom has to shush us all to let her speak
Most of us keep cats, so we talk about cats
We get an instant unbelievably loud argument if anyone mentions daily politics, so we steer clear of that
Yup
Every round birthday ever

Ivana Kobilica - though I must admit, I knew of her mainly because her portrait was featured on the 5000 Tolar banknote, our currency prior Euro, otherwise she'd be more or less just another name on a long list of historical figures we needed to learn for school
Nowadays I wonder if youth still knows of her
I just realized how much not having your own currency affects the cultural, national individuality
But what about the Spanish inquisition

If i want to learn something, I learn and understand things better in english then in my own language
Also i can read it faster and easier
soo i enjoy it
I'm more afraid of of weird and ineffective "corona rules" that are taking place since new laws are made overnight and are getting weirder and weirder
I have an hour long commute to school every day and I take a train
In response to corona they closed 1/2 of seats so people just stood shoulder to shoulder next to the doors, they basically made already full trains even worse
Depends on how things go with the second wave, but we had 2 months of school via internet before summer vacation so odds are, if isolation will continue into September, it'll be like that
If we do have to go to school right away, I'd put a high chance of other precautions being taken (similar to precautions we had right before schools closed down: hand washing, disinfection & masks)
I'd understand if they limited the overall capacity a train can have but just saying 'lol don't sit together' is kinda ridiculous
Well Transylvania with the castles and forests is seen as a nice travel destination
The first thing that comes to my mind about romanians tho are truck drivers, people stealing gas at the station and their orphans from the 90’s. Not the best image bit, I know they are making progress and I’m happy for them because it’s a fascinating country
The average Slovene probably knows Dracula, wonders why there are so many vans with Romanian license plates crossing Slovenia all the time, and I'm pretty sure it stops there
Personally, I loved visiting Cluj Napoca - friendly people, good food, pretty girls
And just photos of the country made me start planning a road trip around the country in late spring
I love your language
I speak Italian and started to learn Romanian as well, it fascinates me how these two languages are similar and totally different at the same time (at least to me :))
What Romance influence
If any, Slovene was mostly influenced by German, however, many germanisms have been removed from the standard language due to the efforts of several linguists in the 19th century with the aim of “purifying” the language
Also I have never heard about any Hungarian influences on the Slovene language
That's right, there are no such influences in our official language as far as I know
On the other hand, Slovene language has around 50 dialects, many are influenced by German, Italian or Hungarian - maybe that's what they had in mind
Although the dialects are so different, sometimes I wonder if it even is the same language because I barely understand people from another part of the country :'D
[The castle] is the main one
[Roman road] and other Roman remains would be next
We also have a frescoe on the scale of the one in Pompeii but I don't think it's available to the public eye yet, it has been discovered quite recently
In my city theres an iron mine thats now closed but they say its been used since roman times
Kladivo in Slovene
Doesn’t sound very bad-ass to me lol
We also say kladivo and nakovalo for anvil
Well, *macola* is also a hammer
Hehe “palice” means sticks in Slovene
That’s interesting, in (Istrian) dialect we call hammer “bt” and my grandpa always called the sledgehammer “macola” - however for the latter it might not be a dialect word but rather a word  that he started to use when he was serving in the Yugoslav Army in Beograd
I earn around 1450 EUR/month after tax
I live in second biggest city
I live alone (since I was 25)  with two cats, support myself financaly and I'm paying off a loan for the apartment
Loan per month is similar for whar I would pay for a rent
I save around 400 EUR per month and we also get Christmas benefits and "regres"- money paid by your employer so you can go to vacation, amount differs where you work (this year I got 1000 EUR)
I save around 5000 to 6000 EUR/year
Savings depends on person's lifestyle
Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
If i remember correctly, I was saving about 200€ a month
I was sharing a small flat with my boyfriend, we both had regular (but entry-level) jobs, and our combined income was about 1800-1900 €.
You are an exception and you have very high earning, esoecially for your age
Most live paycheck to paycheck
Agreed my dad which is going to be 47 this year with 25+ years of experience on the job(civil engineering) and has been working at the same company for the past 17 years and makes a tiny bit more than him, he is a big exception imo
Most of my friends have similar paychecks and their boyfriends too (some even play football in Austria after work and that means around 1000 EUR extra money a month)
But I am well aware of low paycheck problem in Slovenia and how hard it is to get a job
I don't spend a lot of money on food or expensive items (no iPhone for me)
Cost of living depends where you live
In Ljubljana paychecks are higher, but everything is a lot more expensive there (rents are crazy)
Average paycheck is around 1100 - 1200 EUR
Cost of living (small 2 rooms apartment 50m2, not in a capital): summer 180 eur, winter 240 eur (cost of internet and cable tv included)
Meal in a restaurant per person is around 10 EUR
Rent for 50-60m2 apartment would be around 400 EUR, maybe a little bit more
And he says he does admin work
I'm slightly suspisious or he's extremely lucky
Well you are in very good company then
because I'm 30 and only developers have similar paychecks from the people I know
And I know quite a lof of people
Well he could be including lunch and transportation in that
If he lives in Maribor and works in Ljubljana he'll get like 300€ for transportation alone
Yeah this is after taxes(which are bigger than USA's) so before it would be like 2200-2400 I think
There are smaller leagues and clubs
They play for them
Extra money
In Slovenia most clubs don't make a lot of money (even in the 1st league), so sometimes it is better to have a job in Slovenia and play for some club in 3rd league in Austria, if you like football
Oh no I gotta wait a week for the winter holiday
Slovenia is literally too small so nothing significant would happen
plus people mostly live in the center of the country, around the capital
Nothing, really
Benefits of a small country, like ours, you can walk from south to north in a week or less
We get both, very cold and dry and not so cold but humid
Very cold and dry is way better
Who is dumb enough to think Italy is a third world country
No we don't have anything like that
I have always tried to figure out why americans do that
Maybe english spelling is less intuitive than slovenian
Or you just have more words
Yeah same here
How do you spell Šta, K-A-J
That's a very interesting system
So, if I understood you correctly the Italian people directly vote only for national MPs
And how is the President chosen
Do the MPs offer one of their own or a party member or do candidates apply themselves and the Parliament votes on them
Not really
It's notmal to settle down in your 30s and some who want that feel the pressure but it's not that big of a deal I think
I guess it depends on what you mean by settle down
My god yes, and not just by elders or family, my peers who are already settled are strangely even more annoying, as soon as a topic turns to marriage, kids, house/apartment or owning land they will always single us, the unmarried or single, childless girls, out
Like it's a race, or they have a need to validate their life choices
I think its pretty much the same for boys
It made me wonder, since when is this an acceptable topic, to pry into my personal affairs and plans by a relative stranger from work or a hobby group
I'll never forget a conversation I had with a Canadian tourist I chatted up on a train a few years back
She was traveling alone through Europe before she settles down, a woman in her early 30s. She was amazed how the people viewed age differently in Europe, she was considered old to start a family whereas in Canada they considered it normal, young even
Here, the pressure is real
On the other hand, living at home is considered normal, even majority of houses are build to support 2 to 3 families
It's a remnant of a time where one of the kids stayed at home, took over the farm and took care of the elders
Putting a parent to a nursing home was considered disrespectful not so long ago
Still is in rural areas
- Gorenjska: Rude, stingy people, they love everything that is free, they always hike or do extreme sports
- Primorska: Laid back, outgoing, charming people, they hate Italians but cook their food amazingly
- Štajerska: Always drunk, farmers, inberds, however generally happy
Subregion of Zasavje: Poor, miserable, they swear the most
Subregion of Savinjska: Stingy, farmers, probably drunk when they are working in their forests, for some reason the worst drivers
- Prekmurje: Totally non-understandable accent, poor, nobody knows what is going on there, they are also called "Hungarians".
- Dolenjska: The drunkest region, probably from their awful wine called Cviček, gypsies
Subregion of Bela Krajina: They speak a funny dialect, almost Croatian, drunk farmers
- Notranjska: Bears, people with funny accents
- Koroška: Funny people, but remote, can't say the letter R.
- Ljubljana: Arrogant assholes with too much money, corrupt mayor
They live in the swamp where is always foggy
You guys don't recodnise Graz as a city
Shit, when we talk about Graz we might as well be talking about New York
I live 1 kilometre from Italian border
Nothing special, really
And actually even before Schengen if you lived close to the border you would normally just be waved through (you had some special passes)
People usually went to Italy to buy stuff that were not available in my country
This was especially true during the time of Yugoslavia
Nowadays, we usually go through Italy to reach certain places faster
For example from my house to Nova Gorica you take 3 minutes less if you go on the Italian side
Going to Koper through Italy saves 15 minutes
The nearest beach is 50 minutes away in my country, but only 10 on Italian side
We dont go to Italy to shop anymore
It is the other way around
Italians come here for cheaper gasoline
Apparently 45 cents per litre
Also, there is a town of Gorizia with 34000 inhabitants just behind the border, yet it doesnt have a shopping centre
Residents of that town go over the border to a much smaller Slovenian town of Nova Gorica with 3 shopping centres
Also, Nova Gorica has 6 or 7 casinos and the same number of night clubs - mostly aimed at Italians
We have it too although I've seen it in this [version] more often
We use it for puree
We wear it in Slovenia
We don't have big cities and actually many people live in villages where you are not always enough visable for other vehicles
We get "[kresnička/firefly] in lower classes and they teach us in school that we have to use it
Kids in first grade also get [reflective thing ] that you put around your neck so they are more visible on the street
This thing for meat it's really common in Slovenia
Finding parking lots can be hell, but other that that and driving through extremely narrow streets, I love it
I am not really living in an old city, but my house was built around 1650 (at least the 'new' part, the old part was there at least 200 years prior) and the municipality we belong to, is basically just one ancient house after another (houses were mostly built in 15th to 18th century)
Also as mentioned above, WWII bombs literally everywhere, but we're kinda immune to it now
> One day you find out that that one barricaded doorway in the basement of your secondary school leads down to an uncharted 16th century cellar system that runs the length of the town centre, but noone's been down there in a century
Story time
I would soooo love to be a part of such exploration
Sounds super interesting
There is dissent in the historian ranks over whether Aldi is related to the very similar yet oh so different deity Hofer
Oh hell yes
I think since 2008, we have a new party formed  for each election just so that our current PM wouldn't win
They generally don't rule terribly well, there is a generaly lack of foresight and ideas with them, also they get themselves into scandals pretty fast, so for the next electrion, a new party is formed again to take him on
He hasn't actually won since then, but still managed to form two governments because the other guy failed or resigned
I think I voted 'against the guy' twice during this time and it is likely I'll do it the next time, since the leadership during the pandemic is above even his average for absolutely atrocious
I admit I can't judge the actual width of that road from the photo
If there is space enough for 2 cars on the tarmac (or maybe even if the edge is fine), I'll go the speed limit
Depending on conditions of course, I won't overdo it in fog or heavy rain
I never had any issue
It happens sometimes I meet someone suddenly behind the corner, but it was never even close, we might just steer more to the edge once we see each other
There is time enough
If there is only space for 1 car and I can't see far enough ahead, I'll probably go 40 as well
I think I'm the minority
Most people look to me like they are scared of bends in the road
Yeah, same
And usually I'm the one who reverses because people that somehow end up in our area are already afraid of driving forward XD
You're speaking the highest forms of truth
Novo Mesto (meaning New City) is one of the oldest settlements in the region but it got its name in the 14th century
Moravske Toplice (Moravian Spa), is a village that is nowhere near Moravia
At least it has a lot of spas, tho
Those are the only ones I can think off from the top of my head
In Slovenian a river is Reka and we have a river named Reka so we have "reka Reka". Then Castle is Grad and we have a Castle named Grad that is in town named Grad that is in municipality named named Grad so we have a Castle named Castle that is in a town named Castle that is in a municipality named Castle
Muff means what i think it means right
Yeah afaik languages and dialects still have no support in France or at least aren't nearly as supported as in other countries in Europe
I work for 8h (with rare exceptions) and spend a little less than 1h commuting
I sleep for about 7h per night, which is not as much as I'd like, but good enough
I have time to cook and eat with my husband daily, to do some sports or hobbies, and socialise in some limited way in the evening
I'd have much more time if I browsed less internet, but it is pretty pleasantly recharging to do along with a coffee after lunch
Probably [Velenje] it’s full of work immigrants from the Balkans and they usually speak very poor Slovene
The most Slovene is probably Ljubljana
Slovenian
Nobody speaks it as a first language - everyone in Slovenia has their dialect/regional language as the first language and some of those are more different from Slovenian than e.g. Croatian is - and it's a living language, unlike e.g. Latin
Best of all worlds
Also, super simple to learn
Only has 3 tenses, no definite/indefinite articles, and the spelling is reasonably consistent
Easy peasy
Do you say 97 in worse way than the French say 98
Because I really hated the French 98
I 100% absolutely don't get it
French require math, this expression I expect requires some history knowledge
ČMRLJ says hi
You have letters in latin alphabet available, like ČŽŠ and similar
I can't even why they decided against them
Celjski grofje not procreating
You're not a painter, are you
Look up, you might be in some good company
It's relative, it depends on wind and humidity
Although generally speaking, i'd say anything above 35° is very hot, 30° - 34° is hot, 26° - 29° is warm, 20° - 25° is nice and perfect, 16° - 19° is also very nice (just not t-shirt and shorts kind of nice), 10° - 15° is chilly, 1° - 9° is cold, and -9° to 0° is very cold
I have never experienced a temperature below -9° C, but its probably really bad
Edit: to clarify, i live on the Slovenian coast, which is by far the warmest part of the country, especially in winter (on average more than 5° warmer than the rest of the country)
In other parts of Slovenia this scale might be different
\<0 cold
\<10 chilly
\<21
5 cool
5 perfect
\>21
5 warm
\>28 hot
In other words:
\<1 wouldn't ride a motorcycle
\>42 wouldn't ride a motorcycle
Cold: <0
Chilly:1-11
Nice: 12-17
Warm: 18-24
Hot: 25<
For me it's exactly as you said about those 5 degrees
I live in central Slovenia, Zasavje and I'd shift your whole scale 5 degrees downward for me
I've also spent a fair bit of time in Sweden at -10 to -30 and didn't really find it bothersome, I might just be a winter person
Reading your comment:
>  10° - 15° is chilly, 1° - 9° is cold, and -9° to 0° is very cold
What the
> I have never experienced a temperature below -9° C, but its probably really bad
WTF
o.O
>  i live on the Slovenian coast
Ohhh :)
To clarify, I live in the north west, in the Alps, and boy do I miss my winters with -10 in November, with piles of snow by mid December and a winter breeze that feels like litle razors caressing your cheeks
Heh
We only get a few cm of snow every 2 or 3 years- and even then it only lasts a day before it all melts :)
Also, happy cake day to you
>Also, happy cake day to you
Thanks, totally missed that :)
Care to explain
[HK Olimpija] for me

Nobody cares what color you are as long as you respect the culture and language
Of course
We have Styria too, you know
that is very nice of you as a society :)
Hence me putting it forward =)
I think I have been to most major tourist spots in Slovenia, but Bled island maybe doesn't count since I swum there in the summer and didn't want to linger
My school took us to all major museums in Ljubljana
I feel like I spent half the childhood in the Technical museum in Bistra
The school also took us to some less well known places like the Roman necropolis close to Celje
I've also been making a point of visiting some part of Slovenia every year for part of the annual break, usually some 4-5 days
Prekmurje was my favourite to date, but Bovec is another fantastic destination
In Slovenia we start counting at 21, so enaindvajset, dvaindvajset, triindvajset, štiriindvajset…”
21, 22, 23
(enaindvajset, dvaindvajset, triindvajset
This must me the correct way
Same in Slovenia
E-nain-dvaj-set, dva-in-dvaj-set, tri-in-dvaj-set ...
Chemistry, pharmaceutical science, biochemistry and medicine
You can't go wrong with any of these in Slovenia
Pay isn't the best mind here no matter what you do, but you will find a job fairly easy
Computer degrees (at least here) aren't as useful as actually being good at coding
And chemical engineering - probably more than pure chemistry and biochemistry
Sheldon, is that you

And the Slovenian littoral where Italian culture has a strong influence

I've never managed to find it outside of Slovenia
Shall we do a dark rye bread exchange, bred-fren
You haven't travelled much then
As someone living 30 min from the Hu border, AFAIK they're "normal".
You should venture outside of Western Europe to the Slavic lands
I feel like Slovenia or the land of current day Slovenia is mostly innocent
We dont even have regions
The first (and only) level of subdivision are municipalities (212 of them with population ranging from 500 to 300
000, most of them less than 5k)
If some of these were autonomuos, it might be chaotic or even local dictatorships (in the smaller municipalities, some mayors dont get changed)
Why would I have problems with local sheriffs
Because of username
Here the larger version more suited to sewing and opening packages is the more prevalent
I do possess the small precision pair as well, but they are much rarer
Frexit
I am not a teacher but this was repeated many times on TV
Kids motor skills worsened for more than 13%. Especially in kids who were very active before the lockdowns since all after school sport activities were also closed
Subcutaneous fat rose for an average 20% in 50% of kids
In other words, they got fat
This was a first in history of Slovenia
And we have this motor skills measuring programe for decades
The research was done on more than 20000 kids
The plum ones are more popular here as well
We generally use the bread crumb and sugar topping with a bit of cinnamon on top
My grandmother makes these in bulk, freezes them, and hands them out to everyone in the family
We call them češplovi kneldi (meaning plum dumplings)
Both words are derrived from German (knedl - Knödel and češplja - Zweschpen)
Zweschpen in an old Austrian word that transformed over time to Zwetsche and to češplja in Slovene
So I guess it's all connected
Quick question
What region are you from
I'm from primorksa and we call them "cmoki" but I'm not sure if that's just my circle
"Knedl" is what we put is soup
> The plum ones are more popular here as well
Are they
We only had apricot ones at home
But maybe that's because I don't like plums and would throw a fit as a kid if I saw a plum inside instead of an apricot or a strawberry
Styria
We use knedli interchangeably with cmoki
Primorska region here
We say češpovi njoki as in plum filled gnocchi
This is mainly cause we use the same dough as for ordinary gnocchi
It's the same recipe as OP's.
>a breadcrumb and sugar mixture roasted in - ideally - clarified butter
Not just plain breadcrums
Though we don't call it Brösel
Your grandmother's version sounds tasty
Perhaps I could try to make that sometimes
Ok, it's only my family then
I guess it's the same as in Austria then
You just use what you have and/or prefer
Marelica in Slovene
I personally don't eat after beers, they kill my appetite for some weird reason
I like some small snacks with or after wine though, like olives or a bit of cheese
I did go along with people for things like burek (particularly the pizza style filling seems to be popular at night), pizza slice, fried chicken or different forms of kebab
Well, we have a church on an island
in a lake
Lake Bled is probably the most well known attraction in Slovenia, but everyone recognizes it by the church
Maybe Ljubljana castle as well
Good point
The only natural island, that still exists
Around Ljubljana, I ride an old Rog Turist (a well known brand in Slovenia)
The bike does not have any gears and it is a bit rusty which is a good thief repellent
It is not perfect but at least I always find it after parking it on the street for a few hours :D
Yeah, as you wrote, Ljubljana is quite flat around its centre, so it is possible to drive around without any gears on bikes
In fact, a lot of my friends also use old rusty bikes without gears since new shiny bikes are frequently stolen
People who ride shiny new bikes are usually locals, who keep their bikes inside their sheds/ garages overnight
During the daytime, bikes don't get stolen so easily, but a good looking new bike will probably not survive a night unsurveilled on any public space
I ride an [old Rog bike] as well, but this one has gears
Overall it works very well, but mine looks quite unattractive, so I can leave it anywhere without concern
I attached a huge basket at the front of the bike, mainly for the groceries, I also have a smallish trailer in case basket is not enough
It's a bit (a lot
) controversial and disputed, but I'll put down two:

Personally, I wasn't impressed by Prague
Also Paris, I think it's just super overhyped so I didn't know what to expect
Funnily enough, Palermo is my father's favourite city
He just loved how quickly we passed from a "shady neighbourhood" to what is to him a stunning city
Edit: Just remembered, my biggest disappointment: Berlin
A lot of history, but I just didn't feel any excitment going through the city
It wasn't a very memorable trip
Probably Paris or Amsterdam
Both weren't too great
I was there after several years and I must say now it's much prettier than it was before
Lots of greenery and walking zones
I'm talking only about center of Belgrade
I was in Bratislava in early August and i stopped at Meštiansky pivovar too - good food i must say, first time i ate non-savoury meat
I was in the city only 4 days, but it was great
Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Indus, hettits, greeks, Phoenicians, Carthage, Rome, Celts
Mesopotamia and Egypt are extremely specifc (have to know all Egyptian dynasties and their achievements)
Rome and Greece even more specific (have to know periods, battles, leaders, government types)
Carthage just relations with Rome
The rest are just general, when, where, what
We also learn about mesoamerica but that's not an ancient civilization, Mayas, Incas, Aztecs are thought in relation to the New World discoveries
When it comes to battles and wars, we must know the date, opposing sides, their leaders, cause of war, triggers and also the results and consequences
Yes treaty of kadesh is also taught here, but why was it signed, who did it, ehat were the consequences
Then we are sometimes challenged on exams on who was at the right and why etc
Like this  , H pronunciation is the same in all Slavic Balkan languages
Well I'm a bit vulgar and use "v pizdi" which would be "in vagina" in english
We tend to say "Nekje Bogu za hrbtom", which means "Somewhere behind God's back".
I may be wrong with the translation or the example, but I grew up saying that
For a faraway or a remote place, we use the phrase "behind God's back' (Bogu za hrbtom)
Yea but you could say it more politely "bogu za hrbtom", behind God's back
Indija Koromandija also perhaps
We also have "rovte" which is a remote place
We also have "španska vas" - spanish village, a bit old fasioned
Oh yeah
The time when some american tourist bumped into my classmate
Our class was in Florence (we are from Slovenia bdw) and we were in the gallery, when some american tourist bumped into my classmate, jumped away shocked and with this really obnoxious american accent said: "God bless America
My classmate was like "???", while I was laughing my ass off
Nothing special, but it shows what americans are like
Imagine their faces when they realize we also have freezers
oida
Now that's what I call a sensible law
We only have police
And they are mostly concentrated in urban areas
In rural areas, you wont see them often
We do have MP but they have almost no jurestiction over civilians, only military
They do have same jurestictional training as civilian police though
Nothing
The Spanish state showed that totalitairan practices (beat the shit out of people that wanna cast a vote) work good and that people just stop when they're beaten the shit out of
And the Catalan parties just wanted some attention, not actual independence
> Some other EU countries would never let it happen because they are afraid of similar referendums happening to them
Like with Yugoslavia
The right of self determination of a people is higher than any constitution, especially one that limits such a fundamental right
And especially a fascist-written constitution which was written without the consent and participation of said people
And the "legality" argument is quite nonsensical
The holocaust (gathering a group of people and sending them to a concentration camp to be gased to death) in nazi Germany wasn't illegal for example
I live in a small town of Slovenske Konjice
The Slovene name comes from the word “Konj” which means a horse
The legend says that a dragon lived inside a local mountain and would often threaten to destroy nearby villages by flooding them with water from an underground lake
After an agreement with a noble the dragon promised not to flood the villages, but only if he was given six virgins to devour every year
For many years, the terrible sacrifice ensured peace in the land
One year came the turn of the nobleman’s daughter to be sacrificed
Even the noble realized that there was no way to save his daughter, Marjetica
But just before Marjetica and the five other virgins were handed over to the dragon, St
George miraculously appeared on a white horse and killed the dragon with a sword
The nobleman was so grateful to his daughter’s savior that he had the Church of St
George built not far from the dragon’s hideaway and a town was soon built around the church
It became known as Konjice
The term “Slovenske” was added in Yugoslav times to not confuse it with Bosnian town of Konjic
A white horse is still on [coat of arms] of the town
Yeah it comes from Slovene and we actually still use the name Gradec
We also say "prede" which would be translated to spin, like spinning wool
We've got like 3 in total lol
Wait what
Haven't heard of this
I've heard of "povodni mož", some kind of a water dwelling man, who'd steal people (women) and kept them in his underwater palace
But I don't think he stole souls, as he needed them alive as to keep him company
> Vodník
Damn you're ugly
Most American ones
Like Breaking Bad
Kids going thousands kilometers from home to study
Having a 'college fund' as a family
Jocks and cheerleaders
University and high school sports being a thing
Some parents do have savings especially for their kids college
Or at least a savings account that kids can use when they are 18
And also if you sign up for the international highschool graduation you probably want to leave the country for college
Yes
The savings accounts are like 30 € per month allowance
But hey, I am not in the millionaire circles
Neither am I. I only see this in kids with rich parents
"Proper" / literary language is taught in all schools here and everyone will write in it, many people will also speak it in highly formal occasions, but otherwise they will speak in their local dialect
The one difference are the people from the NE region of Prekmurje - their dialect is so out of there (influenced by Hungarian perhaps, I'm really not sure) that most people don't understand them, so they will usually adapt
I chuckled a bit when we visited friends and their younger daughter, still in kindergarten, started happily chatting with me and my wife in their dialect
Her sister, who barely started school, corrected her all prim and proper: "You must speak Slovenian, they can't understand you"  (she WAS speaking Slovenian, but in their dialect :D)
~~Safety~~ Emergency corridors on highways
Some countries have it in the middle and others on the hard shoulder
During the year when there's not a lot of tourists, safety corridors are made well but over the summer tourists just don't get it
Euros
I'm pretty sure that's already planned
We implemented it for trucks last year
If it's the same in Germany as it is here, it's because a hard shoulder is designed for broken vehicles, not to drive on
Therefore it would be a hindrance if there was a broken down truck or something on a hard shoulder while it was being used as an emergency corridor
Emergency corridor has to be made as soon as traffic starts slowing down and there are signs of a congestion
Most of the time it works fine, except in summer when tourist just ignore what everyone else is doing
It's normal here to move to the sides if you see an emergency vehicle behind you, on a highway or off it
> probability of having a broken down vehicle on the shoulder is much smaller than the probability of a vehicle not moving to the sides enough
There's plenty enough space if those on the left move to the left and those on the right move to the hard shoulder
The biggest problem are truck drivers and people towing caravans and boats
Back in the day you would only move to the side if you heard an emergency vehicle approaching, which is obviously not very effective when there's shit tons of trucks that have nowhere to move because they stop 10cm behind another truck
But now the law says you have to form it as soon as there's a congestion even if it's just construction work because you never know, especially in hot summer months, if someone stuck will need an ambulance service
You move back to the driving lane when there's no more congestion, at least that's what my logic says
> And how do you deal with exits
No idea
Whoever wants to use an exit just has to wait, I guess
If you know there's a congestion on the highway you use an exit before the traffic stops and use regional roads
[Here's] something about it by ETSC
We only have classic Central European potato dumplings (or as we call it "cmoki" or "knedli" in some dialects) filled most often with plum or apricot
We also have dumplings made from semolina (zdrob or "gres") which we put in the soup
I thought germknoedel is floating in vanilla sauce, not just butter and sugar
At least that's how they served me the only one I ever ate
Well, we all know the correct answer to this one

So literally ID or passport
I don't think any police officer anywhere in the EU would let it slide if I got stopped traveling with just my driver's license, even though that's a valid form of ID in Slovenia
`za slavo zveze` => `Za slavo Unije` in Slovenian with those caps pls

Idk man, a lot of other EU countries can actually speak english at a very decent level across all ages
Italy and France are notorious for having very poor english knowledge overall
True, its annoying to have to talk in english just because of that one non-speaker
Gives incentive to learn I guess
> It's sad
I hate to say it, but studying something like East Asian studies is like shooting yourself in the foot
If you wanted a secure, well-paying, high education job you shouldn't have picked something like that
The amount of people who have that degree for such a niche field is way too high (at least here in Slovenia)
On the other hand, having a technical degree, law, pharmacy, medicine, etc will basically guarantee you a job
They are quite a bit harder though and certainly not for everyone
Or, considering it's now Germany vs France, Spain, Italy, and Poland, when it comes to major EU states, how about y'all just band together and force the ECB to devalue the EUR to the level that works for the average EU state
Germanic states wouldn't like it, but why should everything always be suited to their liking and not everyone else's?
France especially now holds all the cards, considering they're the last and only EUMS with a military worth a damn
Get to it
> What is needed to solve this is a healthy dose of foreign investment from the EU and a fair amount of regulations (or protectionism) to help create nascent, sustainable industries
The only other option would be for the EU to federalise and implement internal transfers like in the USA, covering for the deficits of those states, essentially turning them into sources of human capital for the industrial north and warm holiday places for northern pensioners to retire to
If only people in the poorer half of the EU would realize this
Instead, there's paranoia about Germany taking over
No, Germany is in charge NOW, where they write the rules and LOAN you money
In a federation, nothing would change about writing the rules, but the money wouldn't be loans
I'm sorry to hear that
Like I said, it's not for everyone and it looks like you did your homework with employability after all
A lot of people here don't and study obscure courses, end up without a job in their field and blame the world for it
According to the Slovenian statistical office a 2 person house hold uses 219€ per month on food and non-alcoholic beverages
I would agree, my boyfriend and I use about 50€ per week on groceries although when we were really cautious and frugal and mindful of all special offers we managed to get that to 30€ per week

The UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt called Slovenia a former Soviet vassal state
Since most people likely don't know - Yugoslavia was never a vassal and for most of the 2nd half of the 20th century not even a friend or ally of the USSR
It was one of the founders of the Non-aligned movement of countries not obsessed with the nuclear and/or space dick measuring contest (because they couldn't afford it)
Heey I’ve heard that somewheeee
druga Švica
most US presidents have said a lot of dumb shit about Europe, Trump isn't all that special in that regard
O_o Now THAT'S quite a few levels down the road
I wonder
If they have permanent residence in a country they should be able to vote as people who would be elected also represents him, while citizens of the country that permanently live somewhere else also have voting right even if affairs in the country have much less impact to them
No way
No offense but I don't trust people who aren't citizens to vote
They could be persuaded much easier because they don't have to understand the language, so they wouldn't have all the sources available about who they're voting for
Most importantly in a small country like our, god forbid someone like our current crazy PM brings in a bunch of people from conservative country
We're small enough for that to influence elections
Those five years didn't feel that bad tbh
And everyone older than me, tells me it was pretty much better in almost every way than it is now
So yeah
Yes, exept there was a lack of gas, inflation, empty stores, shitty cars, ugly buildings, undemocratic governmet
We were a poor county
The things that we experienced back then would have been totaly unacceptable today
The only people that enjoyed Yugoslavia were the communists themselves
They had fancy apartments in Ljubljana, paved roads, new tv-s, nice cars, send their kids abroad to study
Every else was poor
Thats why 90% of the people wanted to leave
They were unhappy with the sistem
We went thru the shitty 90s but now we live well
I think we have it 100 times better now
Thank you Ivan Janša, very cool
Just that, 1) only one of my grandparents was actually in the party
2) The gas crisis was universal in the 70's. and 3) until the "young-economist" took over and destroyed our economy our model was basically just updated version of Kavčič's from the 60's.
I'd recommend you to watch a bit less Nova24tv, and actually read some history
Bruh, i dont watch nova tv
But only a fool can say that we lived better in yugoslavia than now
You are in denial
Yugoslavia could not compare in any way to the west
All the people went to italy or austria to buy clothes or some material, because you couldnt get it here
All these things and problems that we had during socialism is obvius to me, but aparently to you everything was better
In what way is driving a yugo better than a renault or macedes
Yugo was a laughing stock in the west
Much like other cars (trabant, škoda)
And the wage gap is still visibe now, 30 years later
It was ridiculous, my great grandfather ended in prison for a few days because he told a joke about Tito in a pub
I'm just saying most older people feel it was better than now
Like my grandma, who says something "How far have we fallen, that things were better under rotten communism, than now".
I mean sure GDP, purchases parity, GINI coefficient are all way higher than they were then, but back then we actually had our own economy, now it's  just empty husk of a thing, after we sold all of the most important parts of it
Also the fact that we could go to Austria and Italy to buy things is actually a plus
In most other communist/socialist countries, you could only dream about going to the west
While we went there to get some diapers and a better Hi-Fi system, than one you could get here
The more I look at other (western) nations history, the more it's clear to me, that until like 70's there wasn't a very much big difference between Yugoslavia and any other western countries
The biggest difference was how both sides bounced from oil crisis of the 70's. The west got it's "reaganomics" (the first step towards current neoliberalism) economic boom, while the east including Yugoslavia slowly stagnated
Sure the Marković years, when our economic policies were set by the IMF (basically the same thing that happened to Greece with Troika), were really really bad, and obviously socialism seems like it was doomed after the end of oil crisis
- I could go into detail, as it wasn't just the oil crisis, it was a huge number of events that broken Soviet Union: war in Afghanistan, Chernobyl accident, etc
and all its satellites
And Yugoslavia was a the collateral damage, as Soviets had debts to repay us, but couldn't any more, which meant that Dinar got devalued, which meant that IMF got involved, which lead to austerity measures that ended in total collapse
Also the way Yugoslavia was built, it probably wouldn't survive death of Tito either way
But still compared to other socialist nations, Yugoslavia wasn't that bad, or dare I say it, maybe it was even the best
For me Italy, France, all German speaking countries, the Netherlands, all of Balkans and some Eastern Slav countries
If my Bosnian would be better, Turkey would be easier too
English would just be easier though :D
I live on the border between Italy and Slovenia (former Yugoslavia)
Thus I speak Italian, Slovenian and am very familiar with Serb/Croatian/Bosnian
As a consequence I would probably have no problems to communicate all over Italy and former Yugoslavia
Slovenians didn't flee from the war, since ours lasted only 10 days
There are other reasons why you could get by with German here
There are still some Germans living in Slovenia and German is tought as a second language (instead of English) in some primary schools, at least in Styria
Many people watched Austrian and German TV in the nineties
People have relatives in Austria, especially in Carinthia
But you can get by with German only in northern and eastern parts of the country
In the west, people tend to be fluent in Italian rather than German, due to proximity to Italy
Someone wants to sneak some drugs through europe
I mean Austria put up checks on the Slovenian border and I personally that's a betrayal of the values of the EU
Well, Austria is technically still controlling the AT-SLO border, though the controls are pretty random at this point
Not so
Austria has "temporarily" suspended the Schengen regime on its border with Slovenia in 2015
Ronde van Vlaanderen

Oh no
Currently live in Ljubljana
I've walked home many times at 4am from parties wearing short skirts, heels etc
and never felt unsafe
I think in general the biggest threat is getting your bike stolen
In Koper, my hometown of about 30k people, I’ve never felt unsafe
I’ve studied in Ljubljana and very often went home from a party between 3-5pm
Never have I felt unsafe walking alone even when walking through some “dodgy” streets
Basically I’ve never felt unsafe at night anywhere in Slovenia, however, females might have a different experience
Never felt unsafe even as a 12 year old walking home from friends birthday parties
Although that was 11pm at the latest and it was usually at least 2 of us
But now there's aparently 2 gangs of kids 11-16 year olds, patroling some nearby neighbourhoods and a pump track that are intimidating kids and elderly
Started happening now during corona lockdowns
The chances are very low
I feel safe walking alone anywhere
As a woman there are perves anywhere in the world but overall Slovenian cities are very safe
Yes, bicycle theft is probably the most common kind of crime in Ljubljana
Otherwise it's a very safe city and violent crime is extremely rare
Well, we have become kind of a cycling superpower in recent years with Primož Roglič and Tadej Pogačar
Diatonic button accordion or like we say [frajtonar'ca]
Well, surely the diatonic accordion is the most omnipresent in our folk music (usually also called "Oberkrainer music", if anyone is familiar), but it actually got popularized just in the 20th century
I find this kind of music dreadful, but too bad because I think the accordion is such a beautiful instrument if you just allow yourself to play it differently, not according to the oberkainer standard
Otherwise also the Zither used to be popular in alpine areas and the Cimbalom in pannonian areas
Even before the accordion started to dominate, the fiddle was popular too, but today it remains mostly associated with Roma people and with the music of the Resia valley, which is extremely specific
I guess the obvious answer is [Styrian Harmonika] Zither as well, since it's an older instrument
It's said that every Slovenian home used to have zither
It has such a beautiful [sound] way nicer than an accordion
In Slovenia its Zither and Styrian accordion (we call it frajtonarca and its my fav instrument)
Might wanna listen to [this] Its a tune from a really popular Slovene movie and Zither get associated with this tune here all the time
Beautiful instrument
It is, but after the break up of Austria-Hungary, [Duchy of Styria] was split between [Austria] and [Slovenia ] at that time)
Slovenia and Austria have 2 same regions, Styria and Carinthia
In Slovenia we say Austrian Carinthia and Austrian Styria just so we know we are talking about our northern neighbours

The white skin thing and beauty stuff in general is so true
This friend of mine is a registered nurse, as is 3/4 of their population, but now she has a beauty salon where they do skin whitening, botox and stuf like that
They get an IV with whitening stuff, they call it Cinderella treatment
She says people are obsessed with it and she gets a lot of money
They're also obsessed with fame, money and looking all fancy and rich

I think Americans consider any restrictions on firearms equivalent to a ban
The main difference is that in most European countries it is extremely difficult to acquire a firearms with the purpose of self-defence and that is what most Americans are talking about when they say "guns are banned". I'm sure, however, that many uninformed believe a total ban is in place and that a civilian can't obtain anything more than a slingshot
You are right, I should have written "any restrictions more severe than the ones in Texas/Kansas/other firearm owner-friendly states".
Swedes can definitely own handguns and I believe Norwegians can too but with many restrictions on calibers
May someone correct me if I'm wrong
Talking about historical divisions, 45 years of the Iron Curtain didn't undo the influence of several centuries of the Habsburg Empire
But the HRE did extend beyond the Alps and a bit into the Balkans
Some people on Reddit have said that they carry concealed even in places like shops or restaurants declared as "gun-free". Could you do so with a reasonable level of impunity since police can't search you without probable cause
Edit:
>Food for thought, the crime rate for concealed carriers is lower than it is for police officers, we're an extremely low crime demographic
You wouldn't happen to have a source for this
Not that I don't believe you, I genuinely wish to see the data
Here many people believe law enforcement should be the only ones to be trusted with firearms as if they are somehow better than the rest of the population
I live close to the capital and the prices have shot up like nobodies business
400k€ gets you a huge house (200m\^2) with some land (< 500m\^2)
Or a huge apartment (< 200m\^2) with no land
That's about it, since the market is so small there is almost nothing for sale regardless
Or like, a 100-120 sqm flat within the Ljubljana bypass if you are lucky and you get one

can confirm on Bran, of all the castles seen in Transylvania this was the most meh, it seemed artificial somehow, like its made of cardboard, and the museum was poorly stacked
If I wrote in Slovenian and auto translated everyone would know immediately because flow of the words in sentences is very different and it is extreamly hard to translate automaticaly
Even if I write English myself I sometimes fall into a trap of wanting the words follow Slovenian rules for what comes before and after
And that is why we always laught at some spam email that was auto translated
So true, when i tried to copy my book assignments (domače branje, če se slučajno spomniš tega haha) i tried to use an english source and translate it with a translator and it would sound so bad i gave up and wrote it myself

There is a Wiki article about floor numbering standards
Slovenia like rest of Europe uses Ground floor
In Slovenia, the floor at street level is called 'pritličje' and it means 'floor on the ground'. 1st floor is upstairs from that
Nothing that I know of :I
that would be france
We have a village called Village
We also have a city called New City
The town Vodice (meaning waters) is not near any body of water
Novo mesto (meaning New City) was settled since the Early Iron Age (though it's name was given to it by Rudolf IV
Murska Sobota means Mur Saturday
Make whatever you want of that
Also, Rijeka (or Reka) literally means river, though that's in Croatia
I've seen various other Slovenes naming the more well known places
But we have loads of small villages and towns that have the most boring names imaginable
My personal favourite is probably Gozd - Reka, which is a very small village created from two even smaller settlements, One named Gozd (Forest), and other Reka (Rive)
You can guess that forest part is near a forest, and the Reka part is near a river, or rather a stream, also named Reka - river
Then we have loads of villages, that are just that village
So village in Slovene is Vas, and we have everything: Upper/Lower Village (Gornja/Dolnja vas), small village, but in outdated spelling - Vesca, village be with a different name - Selo, or just New Village (Nova Vas)
Back to Gozd - Reka
As naming villages Forest is incredibly popular
We have loads of just Forest - Gozd, or Under Forest - Podgozd
And sometimes we mix it up, and use a regional word - Hosta and Podhosta
Also sometimes we just name villages after one particular tree: Poplar (Topol), Maple (Javor), Birch (Brezje) and Linden (Lipa)
In slovenia we have a town named Novo Mesto (new city)
We also have new town- Novo mesto
We have Nova Vas too
Many of em
Here one as well, also some in Croatia
There's "New villages" too
Brilliant
Nothing will change for a while
The it depends how member state will implement it
And even then, let's not forget that new EU elections are just around the corner, so if you're worried about it, just don't vote for MEPs and parties that supported it
Also to me it seems that both sides are just different parts of huge industries trying to get better deal for their side

Probably 2014 ice storm
The photos were all over the internet
Probably the Easter earthquake of Ljubljana on 14th of april 1895
One out of every ten buildings were destroyed
Afterwards, when it was rebuilt, architecture and the city drastically changed
Hurt I don't know
Probably higher than usual broken bones and injuries due to falling branches
There were 13 deaths directly connected to the storm (interventions, restoration and rehabilitation)
Following year they estimate 3 of the forestry deaths and 20 injuries were connected
It wasn't a deadly disaster, it was a natural disaster
Corruption
It's definitely the coastal region with Koper as the main city
Even on the internet I haven't seen anyone poke at their accent
Central Slovenia with Ljubljana definitely not, if people talk shit about eachother's regions the heat is usually between Upper Carniola (Kranj) and Central Slovenia (Ljubljana) or between Central Slo
and Drava (Maribor)
It's kind of 'meh'. Nationally I'd only consider Eurospin worse
In my area maybe also Jager
Although Jager has a lot of good quality local products
Some things in Lidl are OK quality, some not
Hofer is better
Both Lidl and Hofer are seen as low tier shops almost Wallmart like
I only buy cheap alcohol there
The food is too processed and tastes like plastic
lidl and hofer may be cheap/budget but we dont consider them low quality
but im the type of guy who rants having to pay more than 10 bucks for a shirt and lidl has good clothing prices
In Slovenia, it is considered on the lower end in terms of quality
The good ones are Spar, Tuš and Mercator (the last two are Slovenian retailers), who all offer a wide variety of well known international brands and local products
Lidl has just cheap stuff and the knock-off versions of the well-known brands
Vesel tortni dan (happy cake day)
Agreed
I'd call it as Mercator/Spar - Aldi(Hofer) - Lidl - Eurospin
The latter three sell random cheapo stuff from everywhere except Slovenia, which many see as lower quality
Too often it feels like these shops offer leftovers, stuff that they couldn't sell in wealthier countries
Not impressed by their meat and prepackaged food sections (esp
Eurospin, ohgodwhy), but am not mad at their produce nor baked goods
Small lasagna with spinach is actually quite good
I never buy pre-prepared frozen food, except cmoki and štruklji but that's one item I always have in my freezer for lazy days
Merkur is selling groceries
Are we talking about the same Merkur
O, hvala lepa
Hofer has some nice bio stuff and Slovene products though
Lidl has 'Lojtr'ca domačih' but that's stuff's expensive
Lidl has great wooden toys for kids, electronic and home improvement stuff is shit
As well as any sort of shoes and hiking stuff
And yep, baked products and fruits and veggies are good
Eurospin can fuck off
Ja, drug Merkur

There was a guy asking in r/slovenia about this
Basically his Slovenian gf (he was foreign but I forget from where) went to lunch with a guy friend
He thought it was a date and she kept telling him that slovenians can hang out with a different sex just fine
He decided to ask our subreddit if this is really normal here
So to answer your question it's very normal to hang out with a different sex
You can go out drinking, for coffee or lunch just as friends and it isn't really considered that you are a couple or whatever
Also I recently talked to an exchange student from Hungary about our student dorm situation and she was shocked that our dorms were mixed
Your roomate will be the same sex as you but everyone out of your room is mixed so the next room could be a different sex
She was quite horrified since she was expecting an all-girl dorm
Informal calls with family/friends I say “ja”? For unknown numbers I say “prosim” which can be translated to please (not really the most accurate translation as the context is important - means more like please, I am listening)
If I am at work I say the name of the organization I represent
In Slovenia same (Prosim) but if its like a friend or family member or something I just answe with "Ja = Yes" or "Ja reči = Yes go ahead"
Well, technically in 1991, but Slovenia first became an entitiy in 1918 with the founding of State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which then joined Kingdom of Serbia
Those two (and some other areas) formed Yugoslavia
Some Slovenes argue that Carantania from the 7th century was a Slovene state, but that is complete and utter poppycock
Since 1991
We have been wanting independency for a long time but only in 1991 did we actually achieve it
I disagree
The constitutions of the SHS kingdom and Kingdom of Yugoslavia were both heavliy influenced by serbian centralism, thus they did not want to divide the country in administrative divisions that would represent nations
First the created oblasts centered around the main towns (MB and LJ in our case) and then banovinas centered around rivers (Drava in our case)
In prtactice their territories corresponded with our language area, but those were not meant to be national divisions
I think the first political unit to materializw slovene nationhood without any constraint was the People's Republic of Slovenia
We could argue about the date of its creation
I think the 19th February 1944 - the first congress of the Slovene national liberation council (SNOS, some kind of first parliament, the slovenian equivalent of AVNOJ) could be a good candidate
The PRS later evolved in the SRS (Socialst republic of Slovenia) and in 1991 aquiring independence from Yugoslavia in the process of its breakup
Yes, some nationally aware individuals (mostly students) theorized about a unified land of Slovenes within Austria, but not much came of it
We learn the history of the territoriries that Slovenia covers today
From the archeological eras until the modern times
Slovenia an independent country is just the final small chapter
Good point
As a slovenian I feel ofended
Our history is very rich bur it's hard to rebel against austria when you are so small
There are plenty of WW2 monuments to Istrian battalions all over Istria, I wouldn't say they didn't participate in any wars
They're delivered by companies you buy it from
Drywall is bought and deliverd by whoever you hire to fix/build stuff for you
When I was renovating my bathroom most things were delivered by the people renovating my bathroom and some by a company I bought things from
We had a subject called "gospodinjstvo" where we did learn something about cooking
I remember us doing pancakes
But it was not just about cooking we learned about general household stuff
Considering how many ppl in the West are overweight, some practical exposure to efficient and/or healthy food prep would be good for kids
The average adult cooks regularly, yet hardly ever gets into logarithms or quadratic equations
Useful knowledge should one end up in prison
I guess German schools really do prep you for every scenario
If you don't speak our language, then you have no business getting citizenshipn
Learning the language of your host nation should the most basic requirement
What is it with Turkey and cats
Sounds like my family from mum and dad's sites
There was a bigger area but eventually every child got a part of that land and built the house in their part of the area
That is why most of neighbours are actually related to me
I now want to move to your street
Around 20min by car and 1h by bus
A 3 minute walk to the train station is followed by a 10 minute train ride and then I walk for another 5 minutes to get to school
an hour by bus or bike or 20minutes by car
unfortunately my bike was stolen and im too broke to get a car so im left with unreliable bus services
Arne and Sven, both present here for a few decades
Arne sounds like it could be a stereotypical Slovenian name
Agamar sounda dope
Like something from a Tolkein novel
It's Russian, not Slavic
I doubt there's many names common in all Slavic languages
That does not make a name a Slavic one
We apparently have very different concepts of what 'moving out' means
People here also 'move out' for univesity, but we don't call that moving out
Could be because most students still go home for the weekend or every other weekend and consider that their real home
Yep
Yes
A lot of them do pay for themselves
Our student housing is subsidized, if you stay in a student dorm you pay around 70€ or even less
Beside that, if you register a temporary address and live required km away from home you get extra 80€ government help
But your parents receive child benefits until you're in school and majority goes home every weekend
Edit: idk if you get those extra 80€ if you live in a dorm as well or only if you rent a private room
I'd have to check it later
Yes, that's probably a huge factor
If you live 5 hours from home you probably won't go home every weekend
Yes, but also students themselves consider that a home
But I guess it really is a matter of how you define moving out
Is it just staying somewhere during week to study and coming home during weekends
Imo moving out means staying at the place all the time (incl weekend and holiday breaks) and taking care of household
Month
Average dorm room rent in Ljubljana is 72,08€. There's also some duty thing that costs 21,58€ but I don't remembered paying that
I paid around 63€, same dorm now is 68€. You usually get a 2 person room, if you want a one person room you have to ask and pay a bit more
Most dorm apartments have 3 2bed rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom
Beside that we also have subsidized meals
Most expensive meal is 4,37€. With that you usually get a soup, main course, salad and fruit
I do not know how strange it is this, but it is definitely unusual
During the 19th and early 20th century, when Europe experienced the so called 'European population explosion', the population of most European countries grew by a factor of 3 or even much more, the growth of the population in Slovenia was very slow, only increasing by about 30%  (from ~1 million to 1
3 million) in 120 years
This disparity is due to the unfavourable economic and political situation the Slovenes were faced with as a small, rural nation ruled by the German uper classes
It resulted in the second largest emigration movement (proportionaly) of any ethnicity in Europe, only behind the Irish, with up to 400,000 Slovenes leaving their homeland between the years 1860 and 1910 alone
Yet this fact is still largely unknown even in Slovenia
Source
That number seems an exaggerated upper number
The max I heard of was up to 300k.
I will put it here when and if i find the source again
However, i do have at hand the data about the birth and death rate for Slovenia between the years 1857 and 1910, as well as the population of Slovenia for both of those years , from which it is not hard to calculate what the increase of the population would be if there was no emigration
Of course, this calculation comes with a few caveats, such as that without the massive emigration, the birth rates would be higher and death rates lower, meaning a higher overall population, as young people would constitute a larger proportion of the total population
But nonetheless, i did calculate it, and the result is at least 363 500 people missing in 1910 on the territory of present day Slovenia, due to emigration that happened between the years 1857 and 1910
Slovenia was already experiencing a not insignificant amount of emigration before that, and emigration was also very high during and after WW1, up to the 50s. With the exception of Ireland where population actually fell, Slovenia was the slowest growing European country in the 19th and first half of the 20th century
Took me some time, but here you go:
Page 2 (88), second paragraph:
"....At the same time, this was also a period of the large Slovene exodus when almost half a million people left Slovene territory between 1870 and 1914
The number is even higher than what i first said
The vast majority went to the USA (~250,000), some 50,000 to Germany, and the rest in France, UK, Austria proper, Brazil, Argentina, etc
Egypt, particularly the city of Alexandria was also a common choice for young women who went there ti work as house maids
But does it work if you try
So I wouldn't say that this is racist
It's nationalistic maybe and definitely a type of discrimination but not really racism
They are easily distinguishable but it's not so much about skin colour as it is their behaviour
and they tend to cause trouble
The appartment above me has 3-10 roma people living in it (no one actually knows how many)
Yesterday I brough up that they are parking on my parking spot with one of them
After some arguing the guy said that they beat up the guy who lived there before me for the same reasons (implying they could beat me up too)
Let me stress that I only pointed out that that is not their parking space and they thought threatning someone for this is acceptable
For reference I'm a 23 y/o 60kg girl
How safe do you think I feel
While all racism is discrimination not all discrimination is racism
Racism is based on skin color it literally in the name
I take your point and I agree
No matter who I met in life (or served since I worked in the service industry mostly) I gave them the same level of respect
No matter were they came from
From my experience most people in Slovenia are like that too
When it comes to day to day interactions to most it doesn't matter what you look like or where you come from
I'm sure some people can be jerks but for the most part i think people can act considerately to others
I did however point out where this prejudice comes from
It's not just because they are from another country and not because they look different
It's because at the slightest hint of disagreement they start threatening violence
So when I meet another roma peron will I think of them violent
No, i know one person isn't representative of everyone else
But right now if I had the chance to move to another apartment where I wouldn't have roma for my neighbours I would also do that
Ok but i still stressed that I don't care where they are from it's the way they act toward everyone in their community
Where did jews come into the argument
Either way I stated from my own example how my prejudice doesn't stem from their country of origin or their skin color but rather from the way they choose to present themselves
I see you are having a knee-jerk reaction as soon as discrimination was mentioned
I'm not sure what your issue here is
I never said discrimination of any kind is ok but to pretend that you hold no prejudice against anyone is lying
It's how you treat those people in day to day life
I would dare say that I don't treat people differently based on my prejudice in my day to day life
But is it wrong for me to say that I would prefer not to have roma neighbors since they literally threatened to beat me up over a fuckin parking spot
I would think not
I also realise that one shitty neighbor doesn't reflect on their entire population
Edit: also discrimination against jews isn't racism it's anti-Semitism
Again not all discrimination is racism but all racism is discrimintaion
Every year
It's a tradition
Me, every year
We have Germanised to the point where Ja has replaced Da (Yes)
No going back boys
You remember when Tresckow tried to kill Hitler but a wooden table protected him from the impact
That table was apparently made in Slovenia
Also, one of our oldest settlements is called Novo mesto (New City), though that name was officially recorded first by Rudolf IV or Austria
Speaking of Austria, we've been subjects of Austria for about 1000 years until we became Serb subjects for 30 years, then the Serbs became our equal subject for 40 years (god bless Tito), then we went back to being Serbia's bitch for 10 years until finally getting independent
Isn't that called defenestration or something
Oh, so that's how the term 'throwing someone out of the window' came to exist
It's commonly used here to describe someone losing their job
I wouldn't say exactly germanised, since we lived with the germans for several hundred years
Our languages influenced each other due to cohabitation
There was of course germanisation present, that's why german influenced slovenian more, but styrian german was also influenced by slovenian
The south styrian german dialect does not exist anymore, that's why it's not as appearent
A nice example of slovenian influence on german is, in my opinion, the name of the city of Gradec (Graz in german)
The german name is derived from the slovenian name, meaning little castle
I know that Styrian Austrians use words like klutsch (kljuc/key) and le (only) but lets not forget who was who's subject
The German language influenced all of Slovenia, the language and culture, while Slovenian did little to influence all of Austrian German
Yes, of course
All I wanted to point out was that it wasn't a one way street
People groups then didn't exactly live seperate from each other and influence each other, but also evolved together
It was a layered process between the nations that lived in the slovenian lands
Ah, sorry I missinterpreted your comment
We don't have that but every building has 3 different trash bins and one of them is for packagings and plastic bottles
I don't know if it's the same thing, but we have *kroketi*. They're usually made out of potatoes
I'm pretty sure only Spanish speaking world (and maybe France) see it as one continent
not really, i saw locals abusing this system by instead of fighting littering , they would just flip a trash can , take all the plastic bottles in it for deposit and leave all the other garbage on the ground
They're longer here, not like a ball
Same shape as a chevap
It's mashed potatoes mixed with flour, I think
Yea I read bellow they're made out of bechamel
It sounds delicious
[Over-Mura Moving Cake]
Sweet, rich, with a bit of everything
If you are ever in Slovenia, Prekmurje region, you need to have it
Bled cream slice
Not something I'd like to prepare at home, the custard is fussy and loves to remain too soft for cutting - but on the other hand, home-made usually have more intense yolk flavour, which is absolutely delicious
We also have mulled gin
I think that's a thing in most (colder) countries, no
Same here in Slovenia
A lot of houses use wood as their primary source of heating, it's more common in rural areas
In cities they mostly use other sources I think
In Slovenija it's very common
Not just in villages, but also in small towns
I think it's the most common form of heating
Yes
Pretty common I would say
Especially in rural areas, where people also own forests, and they cut wood for their own use or for selling
Lately are popular also other types of heating with wood like woodchips or pellets
Tokyo, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Suzuka, Osaka, Fukuoka, Yokohama, Nagoya
Not that many
tokyo,
kyoto,
sapporo,
osaka,
hiroshima,
nagasaki,
blanking out after that, all i can think of is famous tokyo centers like shibuya, akihabara etc
In Slovenia that honor would go to Ivan Lotrič.
Documentaries in here only have a narrator, not really a presenter talking to the camera
Lotrič has probably the most iconic voice among all Slovenes
Here's a trailer for a random documentary where you can hear him
Janša definitely
Not just right now
He also has that loyal 20% that always love him though
I would say our prime minister, Janez Janša. There are big protests right now against his goverment
Janez Janša, our current extreme far right PM
We've been having **massive** protests against his fascist-like power grab, his extreme anti-environment policy, his anti-democratic constitution amendment and his illegal pandemic profiteering (and also against capitalism in general) in many cities across our country for weeks, and the number of protestors is only increasing every week
For sure it's our prime minister
Basically our originl PM stepped down right before corona came so we ended up with an extreme right government most people did not want, just as corona hit
While obviously an early quarantine is necessary, they took advantage if that for their personal gain and to wage war with the press
They're funded by Orban and there was supposed to be an investigation in to that but of course they sabotaged it
Not even hiding any of this really
Then there were a few whistle-blowers that exposed corruption, which started huge protests which are still going on every friday
The PM is insulting the protesters, trying to minimise their numbers and so on
He's a much more thought out speaker than Trump but is basically copying the alt-right rulebook insulting, lying, playing victim, etc
If he is the most hated, could we guess that PIS will lose elections soon
Or not
What is the zeitgeist there
Are there enough people fed up of them
He has way less than 20% supporters but they are die hard voters
Problem is overall low voting turnout which enabled him victory
Dealing with latest COVID-19 crisis also brought him some positive points but not enough to not remain the most hated
Well that feels a bit weird because in Slovenia we have this kind of social measure (called "children's addition") since when I remember, probably it existed even in Yugoslavia
Not sure how much is it, but parents get a certain amount of money per year for each kid younger than 18
Maybe just people have to get used to this being a normal social right, then in the long term they will start seeing the bullshit that they are doing
P.s. I'm very worried about the election frauds you are mentioning, this is not something that should continue on uncontested
Oh, now I pretty much understand why are they so powerful
Thanks for the insight
Well, in Slovenia after the breakup of Yigoslavia we adopted capitalism, but our early governments took a very gradualist approach to the transition
I still think that much too many excellent things for communism were dismantled (especially the healthcare insurance system, the urban planning system and housing system), but we actually did retain a solid social security system all over this period
Ironically, here it was the opposite, more the parties leaned to right-wing and catholic, more they were neo-liberal
At least until recently
Now now, that was a common Balto-Slavic endeavor, and Romanians and Hungarians helped too
Everyone does that
I meant dumping people, who aren't wanted locally anymore into Brussels
Ideally, nobody would fear the EU because we'd use military might to crush them
Ideally, they'd fear the EU because we wouldn't HAVE TO use military might to crush them, because a crushed economy is every bit as painful
When I saw the Norway flair I didn’t even bother to read the comment
The language between places like Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia is the same, or at least super duper similar
If you asked me what the difference is, I wouldn't be able to tell you and if you speak one you speak the other
Slovenian is the least similar, because its influenced by German and even Italian for a bit
And if I had said that in public I would be beaten to a pulp on the very spot
(If someone wants to correct me, fell free

Yeah, bread is eaten with everything even things like pasta
Edit: not in Slovenia tho
Slovenian is different than Serbo-Croatian for the same reason Polish is not the same as Czech
It's not the same language, not because of foreign influences
Our closest language relative is the kajkavian dialect found in Croatia and we have much fewer problems understanding it compared to standard Serbo-Croatian
What
Slovenian isn't different due to German and Italian influence
Some parts of Slovenia use many words borrowed from German and Italian but that's not the same
No, not us
Our hard liquor is called žganje or sometimes  šnops in colloquial Slovene
nope
We say it "sirov burek"
I went for čevapi last week and saw zeljanica on the menu
I thought it was burek with cabbage but it's actually burek with spinach
Does burek with cabbage exist
Yes
> even things like pasta
that can't be true
Perhaps, I've got no idea how Croatian varies region by region
But I imagine that North-Eastern Slovenian, with a heavy country accent, would be very hard to understand
Hell, even I have a hard time understanding it
We also dislike the Turks, that one's pretty true
Making "žganje" is still very popular
I've never heard anyone coloquially say just žganje, except if they meant hard liquor in general
Mostly we have šnops
But you can also have travarica, borovničke, limonovc, medica ect
But then again, I'm from Savinja valley, so I can speak just for us
Serbia has one of the largest civilian firearm ownership rates in the world
Many people like weapons and there is nothing wrong with that *per se*.
I believe there is much more love but hate is something that sells at better price, being in the politics or on media
Wait aren't you in Argentina
My classmate in high school (his parents are from Bosnia I think) once brought burek with cabbage to school but said it's called pita
same for us, same for us
I think here in Slovenia, when couple is arguing, it is quite similar to Albania, man has the last word, although here the last word is "Yes dear"
It is
You are normal
Bread does not go with anything
Well nor does it go with filane paprike or sarma, but oh well
Why exactly do we dislike Turks
I never even heard anyone mention Turks in this kind of way
But so is in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia
Žganje is not the same as rakija
Žganje is official word but like you said šnops/šnopc is colloquial or even more precisely you call the liquor by the name it's made which what you said
In Bosnian bakery I received odd look with sayin "Pečen je bolji" baked is better
That's why I was confused
Zelje here is cabbage
The menu said 'špinača' which is 'spinach', maybe it's blitva (chard)
Yes, my co-worker who has family in Bosnia told us we have to order 'pita' not burek when we went on a trip to Bosnia
And in some places you have to order 'domača kava' in others it's ok to say 'turška kava'.
Turkish invasions in the 14th century made them a traditional bad guy in folk tales and bedtime stories so it carried on
Martin Krpan is a classic example
And what exactly is the difference
The user you replied to is Serbian so "who likes guns" sounded like you were trying to imply it wasn't widespread
Do you dislike gun culture or "American gun culture" (for lack of a better word, most Americans are responsible with their weapons)
Switzerland also has a rich gun culture and so does the Czech Republic
I feel like its more of a meme among young people, because we actually have nothing to do with the past politics
But some elders are still very sensitive when it comes historic events
Yes
But this is 21st century
I have never heard anyone say they dislike Turks because of what happened 5-6 centuries ago
How it's made and strength I think
I don't remember Eurokrem from when I was a kid but all chocolate spreads were called 'eurokrem'. We had Viki krema, with a little Indian
I have no idea what that is
It's not like we rationally hate the people now, obviously we moved on from it but I've personally never heard anything good about the Turks growing up
It's always "the guys who raided us" or "the guys who enslaved hundreds of thousands of our people" and so on
Hence you get the affinity to dislike them even though you've never met one of them
It's basically the same thing
It a broad term for alcohol beverages from different fruits
Oh, I missed that part about "we all". I understand now
I disagree on the last part, though
My co-workers stock up on rakija every time we go on a trip down south
My friend who has family in Bosnia insists rakija is differnt and stronger than šnops you get here
But I don't drink alcohol so can't speak from my experience
Rakija also has more tradition attached to itself than šnops here in Slovenia, I think
But what kind of bread
Garlic bread
-Sure, just regular bread
-Hell no
And what kind of spaghetti
With ragu sauce
-Hell no
Aglio e olio
-Yes
Just no
I haven't really had a culture shock while travelling inside Slovenia because it is so small
But I mostly am shocked by some phrases people from Primorska (the sea region) say
Like we say it is half seven (like in German, it means at 6
30), and they say at six and a half
I know it's really minor but it's fascinating to me
There are also some other words, but then again you could say that for any other dialect here aswell
Maybe
But also I never noticed that and I go to the sea side in Croatia every year, guess I don't pay enough attention
Really
In German class we learned that 6
30 is halb sieben
I just checked in my German book just in case I was wrong but that's how they taught us
Also like that 6
45 is Viertel vor 7 or something like that
And 6
35 is fünf nach halb 8
Well yes in English it would sound very weird to say half seven but in Slovenian to most Slovenians it sounds weird to say 6 and a half
Depends on the language, like in German you also say halb sieben, not sechs und halb
Pretty sure that's the influence of Italian, since Latin languages do X and a half IIRC
That could be it yes, our Primorci are influenced by Italians a lot
Yes, I'm sorry, I missed the also when I read your first comment, my bad
I meant half past seven yes, I'm sorry for the mistake
Yeah in some more inland places it's like that as well, but always in regions that were under Italy before
Suppose this mystery is cracked heh
Ministrstvo za obrambo (Republike Slovenije )
Ministry for Defence
I don't care about ski jumping
I'm revoking your Balkan pass
arent you known to be deathly quiet in the saunas
None of the Turks I know are muslim
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
That has never stopped anyone
"You stand between the doorway like an Italian
Didn't know why Italians until I met 2 different groups of Italians at a diffrrent time, blocking the exit of a bar, just chatting there, with plenty of room anywhere else
"Govorim kitajsko
" - "Am I speaking Chinese
Meaning "Are you listening to what I'm saying
In Slovenia also
Horse burgers are a thing
Extremely common here too, unfortunately
But
but babysnatchers
The only thing I know of is [this] [Here's] another link, if that one's geo-blocked
[This] is not a ducumentary, but it's all you need to know about Slovene's.
edit: there's also [this] but it can't be found anywhere online and it's only in Slovenian
We learn the quadrille dance as well
It's part of matura dance performance we do for parents in last year of elementary and high school
I remember a similar nail game when I was a kid attending 'village games'. But there was no drinking connected to the game itself as they were already drunk at that point
They had to hit the nail with the narrower part of the hammer
We have this [doll shit] as well but for every round or 18th birthday
Also putting up a [may pole] for any gender or a [giant flower] for women
There's a 'surprise party' when they come to put the pole up
Then it has to stand for 50 days if the person is celebrating is an Abraham, 40 days if he/she is 40 and so on, before they come clean it up with another party
Well, is the matura dance really "for parents"? I thougt it was more like a fun last evening with your schoolmates
But yeah, the quadrille is insanely popular if you think about it, I danced it on like 4 seperate occasions the year I finished high school
My mom almost got strangled by a drunk parkeln (krampus) when she was a kid
Četvorka
It's just a translation of quadrille, I guess
We also sing Gaudeamus igitur
Yeah drunk krampuses can act like a bunch of hooligans since they are masked and thus unreckognisable
I know a guy whose car and frontyard got destroyed by a bunch of drunk krampus guys
We sing it at the beginning of 'maturantski ples' in high school
It kinda is but they can get very scarry because they kinda grawl and whip heavy chains around
Also because they are masked and braver they sometimes try to i guess flirt with women but in an agressive way
like I’m gonna take you away missy cuz you’ve been very very bad
you get the idea
I don’t know for me it’s a silly tradition because the little ones are very scared of them and I don’t know why they should be
Kralj Matjaž
I like Austrian ones, especially the one from [Graz]
Our Slovenian plates are rather boring, but our military plates I find really cool
They're white text on camo background: [Example one] [example two]
Oh yeah hehe
Here in Slovenia, it has happened before that hooligans from Ljubljana intentionally scratched cars with plates from Marbor(and the other way around)
I mean, I agree but how exactly would Venice benefit *financialy* by curbing tourism
Due to greater exclusivity (and thus price) or what
decent politicians
How do you pay now with Corona
They keep repeating here to us to use contactless cards when paying
Most companies disabled 'pay when you get it' option when ordering on line
Never seen one
Janša save us
If I remember correctly, I was taught Z with line in primary school, but we were told you can do either
I believe I gave it up as soon as we got a different teacher
I kept the line over 7 for longer though, because it was better for making it obviously different from letters
My handwriting is nothing to be proud of
Almost no one has a second name in slovenia
For example in my class of 32 only 3 have a second name
However lately a lot of wanna be posh people give their children 2 names, as if they were of blue blood, though their parents most likely still live on a farm
There's a difference
People in Slovenia can have 2 first names, but it's not an actual middle name
Lately
2 first names aren't a new thing (Example: Ana Marija was *very* common around 1940) and it's not a "posh" thing either, it's just a thing
I would know, I have 2, but am quite far from posh (we also don't live on a farm)
What's the point of having two names , when usually people with 2 names only use 1
None of the people i know with two names use both
Bolting out of restaurants/cafés after 2 hours max
In Slovenia, we can stay at a café/restaurant for *hours* and the staff won’t bother us
The longest I spent at a café was about 5 hours
My town doesn't have much
[this little tourist info center] got some international award
[Celjska koča] ) (Celje hut) is nice
And then there's [this Space center] in a little nearby village
In Slovenia I think the nicest buildings are kindergartents
I would forcibly move people from different countries into different countries
So you're saying everyone wins
> Education, definitely not
If you mean elementary and secondary, I agree
Tertiary is already pretty much there, though, with mutual recognition of degrees
> Tax havens would be eliminated by a minimum tax level everyone has to pay
Already exists
Check Ireland's corporate tax rate to find out what it is :P Also, I'd be against raising that minimum
As for personal income tax rates - I'd agree, however the limit should be based on the GDP / capita of the state
Thus, Bulgaria would be able to have a much lower minimum tax rate than Sweden, because otherwise you kill poorer countries with the brain drain even more than already
> Welfare would be member state level but work enforced minimum levels, backed by transfers bwtween member states when necessary
I agree this would be nice, but it wouldn't work
What's considered welfare in Sweden is higher than the minimum wage in Slovenia, and Slovenia is right at the limit of becoming a net contributor to the EU budget, so many countries are waaay worse off
What we'd need is for the richer countries to help make poorer countries places where people don't want to leave instead of throwing some money at them and attracting all the especially high-skilled workers
Is that a hard proposition
Absolutely
But that's the only way
> Corruption would have both member state level and EU level courts to hold both states and individuals accountable
Just EU level please
I don't see a problem with the monarchy actually
The Queen would just be the representative of the UK state instead of of the UK member state
Same thing
Random thought - is the Queen actually a citizen in the strictest legal sense
Because I know she doesn't have a passport or driving license for example, since they're issued in her name
Would citizenship work the same
And by that logic, if she is, is she also a citizen of Canada
> and a federation of regions rather than countries
This ^
People use the word federation because they think it sounds cool, but they don't really understand the meaning thereof
That's why you get paradoxes like claims that an European Federation will be ruled from Brussels, everyone will be the same, culture will vanish etc
I mean, Brexiteers are proven right in 1 out of all of their points - not sure that would heal the political divide, but at least they'd get 1 thing right and have that bit of moral justification to drag the UK out
Finns are similar to Danes, who are similar to Germans, who are similar to Austrians, who are similar to Slovenians, who are similar to Croatians, who are similar to Serbians etc
It's all a continuum, based on which border of a country you're standing next to
Also, if you travel outside of Europe at all, you'll know that once you're coming back from Asia, landing in London, Athens, Lisbon, Warsaw, Frankfurt or Vienna all feels like coming home
The differences between European countries are negligible
We have dialects that are more different from each other than Slovenian is from Croatian, for example
And the average Slovenian understands English better than plenty of our dialects
The food between the northeast and southwest of Slovenia is as different as the food between Italy and Poland, and we're tiny
If you're talking differences in mentality, however, the major difference I could spot while traveling all over the continent has been that only Germanic nations have this major superiority complex towards everyone else
But we still love you, so, see, anything can be overcome ;)
> The EU they wanted to remain in wouldn't exist anymore
Well, the EU the Brexiteers want to leave has never existed either thus far, and yet that doesn't seem to stop anyone on that side
Serbians and Croats (or US and UK or the various nordic combos of former empires) not working out just goes to prove that differences and similarities mean nothing
It's all about what people want or don't want, and those wants and don't-wants often have nothing to do with similarities
That's true, but the point is that their point not really existing usually doesn't stop believers in whatever
No, it proves that propaganda is what means the world
Variety can be society-enriching or society-destroying, depending on which side has the better propagandist
But what both sides have in common is that it's not their stance but rather the propagandist's skill which determines if their stance is deemed right by their audience
> This is why, as regards peace-making, the singularly most effective piece of construction is not, and has never been, the bridge
It has always been the wall
The EU itself is proof that that's not true, considering we're living in the longest period without a major war in Europe in history
Also, what you're saying is precisely the point
Little city states of what was essentially the same people from our modern point of view fought over trivial differences, throughout history, and it was because the leader of one managed to convince his followers that they're better than the other, which made them want to conquer the inferiors
On the other hand, comparative megastates like Germany, which were historically a bunch of bickering little kingdoms, are now one people, which even YOU treat as a "uniform" people, which is not even close to true in this conversation
It's all about propaganda
Always has been
With the right propaganda, you can split the same people down the middle and amplify their differences to the point where you get a civil war
On the other hand, with another kind of propaganda, you can unite everyone, despite the huge differences
I guarantee you, that if China were to somehow manage to invade the US, gangbangers and the police, blacks and whites and everyone else would quickly set aside their differences, to go fight them
Unless the Chinese propaganda managed to convince one side that they came to liberate them from the oppressors, for which there's plenty of precedent as well
All
Propaganda
Yugoslavia went from brotherhood and unity to genocide in 40 years, just because the propaganda machine changed
Africans went from "fellow unaligned" to "unwelcome immigrants" in former Yugoslavia in 30, because the propaganda machine changed
The best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist
And the best thing propaganda ever pulled is making people believe they are immune to it
We already have a Disney princess
Twitter princess:
We did, in primary school already (not a lot though, just basic info)
There was a picture in our student's book: a long line of guys on the skis, in white clothes and guns which said "Finnish rush to the front". I really enjoyed the pic for some reason
Teachers, kindergarten teachers, police, those municipal people who give you parking tickes (I don't know what they're called in English),
public administration
basically all public services apart from nurses and firefighters
Even doctors are disliked when they want higher wages
Lots of backslash against teachers and kindergarten teachers atm, because they're staying home right now, even though they're forced
Office workers as well
When a bunch of Viola fans some equipped with plastic toy guns established Stajrska varda
In Slovene media they went mostly as a joke
but in foreign they took them more seriously
They're a joke, a bunch of too fat or too thin bored old men but there's nothing jokey about their mental state and what they're doing
Exactly
How many people heard about the recent kidnapping of a Gypsy girl in Serbia
Not so many
But they are fueled by foreign news agencies as ours mostly ignore them
If it would remain with only first report about them, joking them, I doubt they would still exist
where is cheese spread
Idk, they're not very bright people, all logic fails with them
I think them feeling important and tough is enough to fuel them
Ah we don't have this brand :D . those guys are football club supporters, the name viola is from color violet, color that players of FC Maribor are wearing on home matches
Insulted people from other ex-Yugoslavian countries (as a joke, of course)
Been envious of my neighbours
Been absolutely thrilled when a foreigner tried to speak Slovene (and butchered it royally)
Gotten drunk at a wedding and got into a fight
Could't be prouder right now
Keep up the good work, prjatu
I'd probably have to say Russian
Somehow always seems poetic in a very strange way and just sounds beautiful
Italian for me
English, but the northern dialects like Geordie or Scouse
the only ones I hear run this joke in the ground are usually 4chan nationalists
I tried it to learn German and and the beginning it was fun and I learned some basic vocabulary but then it just kept repeating so it got boring and I didn't see I would be learning more
It was kind of focused on the articles and not much else
I think if you really want to learn it, Duolingo will take you ages to do so
A lot of commenters said cigarettes but no one said alcohol which is just odd to me
Alcohol is almost or even just as bad as cigarettes, and I bet most of the people who said cigarettes should be illegal drink alcohol but wouldn't want it to be illegal
Yes, cigarette littering is an issue, but drunk people driving is an issue aswell
In Slovenia, you are allowed 0
5g of alcohol per kg of blood (i hope i said that right) but that regulation imo does nothing
People still drink and drive, thinking they're okay to drive but then cause accidents
Smoking is prohibited in public indoor spaces, and should be more regulated outdoors aswell (special spots for smokers separate from non-smokers) but alcohol should be completely prohibited for drivers
Alcohol also does a lot of harm to your body (just like cigarettes) and therefore they are likely just as bad as eachother
I am a smoker and I drink alcohol on occasion, but I think both should be more strictly regulated
It would also result in more black market activity-esentially giving drug lords a new task-selling tobacco and alcohol
Exactly my point
Everyone has so much problems with us smokers but no one would like to admit how awful alcohol is
That's exactly how it is
Haha i met an older guy from Scotland in a hotel who told me his name was "Wallen", after three days i realised his name is actually William
Hold up
You congradulate the family as well
Does this end at some point
Like when the "kid" is 18 or does it go on forever as long as the family is present
Thank you for the explanation
Yeah, the cat version is popular in Slovenia as well
Yes
Hiking is very popular in Slovenia
We are not that organized as you are and our parkings are not so neat and full of information
Our parkings close to hiking trails look like [this] although in some popular places there might be [official parking]
No, no official signs
In some cases there is only a sign for parking in others nothing
We actually have amazing page hribi
net where many hiking trails are described and you can see photos from the trail from start to finish with parking included
In Slovenia we mostly have UK or Scandinavian films
Also very common are Czech or Slovakian films
But we also have movies from other countries
There are not so much Slovenian tho
From the last decade
I find the baguette, wine and stripped shirt stereotype kinda funny in a satirical way, but that cheese-eating surrender monkeys stereotype is insanely stupid and makes anyone spewing it look like a bloody idiot
If you were surrendering, cowards, [this] nor [this] nor [this] nor [this] would happen, and the list goes on
Hell, I'd say French involvement was decisive for the Allied Victory on the Western Front
oh man, I love German
Hearing some nice German song gets me in the mood for learning it
We sometimes call you gypsies with a passport
That one counts
I like czech porn
Haven't heard this one about Slovenes from foreigners yet, but some of us do think of Slovenes as serfs (a writer Ivan Cankar wrote about it in a satire "Hlapci")
If it's sunny and no wind even 10 °C can be enough for a T-shirt, although I feel more comfortable if it is at least 12
If it's windy or cloudy then about 15 would be enough
As for shorts, 4 °C is enough - usually you don't get that cold in legs as in arms
About 20 degrees at the lowest if the weather is nice and sunny
The leader of yugoslavia in ww2 who was born in our country
Josip Broz Tito
No Vlad Tepes
Edit: oh yes he is there the Impaler
He was born in Kumrovec present day Croatia, but to many he is still our hero
The other hero would be [Rudolf Maister]
I would say we also consider our poets and writers as heroes
> Ante Pavelic ... Josip Broz Tito
Interesting choice from the same poster, I would understand Gotovina and Pavelic, or Tito and Gotovina but not all three on the same time
He is more famous as that guy from Transylvania
Well
now you know  ^we ^need ^more ^land :)
Cmon man he was half slovenian
We have nobody else
Yea but as far as i know he was half slovenian
Mostly yes with nostalgia but there is still huge part that considers him as a villain, it is more on a family division in WWII
Jap that's the one, you know the Balkan no blood no fun
Well depends on the point of look for us he was a hero for you he probably wasn't
I would disagree
I questioned multiple people who were alive in his times and all of them jump to the answer "yes, I respect him", but talking further a lot of people admit he wasn't really an admirable person
It's true though - many people are nostalgic about Yugoslavie, but they do know it had it's (many) faults
Mostly
I'd say we are neatly divided into two halves over this issue
> with equal rights
not what we are thought, but every story has multiple points of views
> a kind of mini federalization within a federal state
At that time it was decided that Maribor would be part of Germany (Austria), so this federal state would most probably be inside German sphere, as Maribor was predominantly German town
The problem was that surrounding area, villages, were exclusively Slovenian that Maister tried to include in Yugoslavian land
Bloody Sunday, that is called in Austria, was never thought here in school happened 2 months after liberation/occupation of Maribor when "angry mob" supposed of 10
000 people tried to take control of a city hall while there were talks inside about drawing the borders between two states
Exactly
Here he is a hero through and through who won us half of our country
Living at home for long periods of time, proper healthcare, indoor smoking, public drinking, traditional music, tiny shitty cars
What more
Aldi (Hofer in our case) is much much better than Lidl
I don't understand people loving Lidl so much
Eh, we have farmers who like to shit on us "city folk" and talk how better they are then people who live in cities and how stuck up people in cities are
For reference the "city" that I live in is a town of 10k people
It's a thing in Slovenia
If you pass your driving exam on an automatic you are only allowed to drive automatics
If you pass on a manual you can drive both
Ohh sorry, didn't think about that
Yes, definitely however, to imply that we were that much different is stupid considering the town was 10k pop
All the kids grew up playing in the mud or in the woods and most kids helped tending vegetable paches
While you didn't need a tractor for that you still experienced how nature looks like
There were also pastures all around and famers would still say that we don't know how a cow looks like which is silly
If you have a bigger city those arguments could make sense but in a town that small literally everyone has ties to some sort of farming, even if on a smaller scale
In Slovenia, the Ljubljana dialect sounds so ridiculously anglicized to everyone else, that the stereotypical parody phrase in it is:
"Sem dogija na wok v siti tejku"
Sem - I have
dogija = doggie (phonetically + case ending)
na = for a
wok = walk (phonetically)
v = in to
siti = city (phonetically)
tejku = take (phonetically + past-tensified the Slovenian way)
Realistically though, the one word that's omnipresent and confuses many a native English speaker who stumbles across it - "full" meaning very
"Full cool" would be an a bit outdated but standard example of that (means very cool - epic)
The rent
Having a dedicated "workbook" next to a normal textbook and a plain book for many subjects
It is just an extra book that is often not very good at all and many teachers almost didn't use it even though we had to buy it as a part of our lessons
Most of the stuff that workbooks have can be easily done in normal plain books and with help of powerpoints and internet today I think they are obsolete
- In my opinion and from what I know too much homework
Especially for younger kids who have to be kids after school, not sit behind books
When I was growing up I felt that we had just a right amount, but I think things are different now
- All the books, handbooks and other equipment (including school bags, notebooks, pencils and so on
) is what parents have to pay and every year children have to get new equipment
It gets really pricy
Of course children also have to carry all that to school - not good for their backs at all
- Otherwise I like how students can chose from many languages beside English
Therefore many learn German, Italian, French, some schools have Spanish and Russian too
We loved planting [drawing pins] on each others chairs in school, extra points if you planted it while everybody stood up when the teacher entered the classroom
When the class started we made shooting tubes out of pens, and made loads of tiny paper rolls for the ammunition, for the improved version you rolled them in your mouth and then shoot from the mouth and they sticked to the surface
In between classes knuckles was a popular game, thanls for reminding me about the rules (spinning the coin, if you blew it you got slammed from everybody in the circle)
I usually go with tounge twisters, because then our language sounds very hard to learn (which it actually is) and it gives them a perspective of how it sounds
Some tounge twisters is slovenian language:
"Pešec čez cesto, v stož'ce, po rož'ce
"Pikčasta ptička v pikčasti kletki
"Če čebula ne bi imela če bi bila bula
There are a lot more, but I can't remember them now
That won't work with us, hehe
>:)
Pešec pešači čez pešaško cestišče got them like: Holy shit say that again
Oh my God, I can barely even say that hah
>"Zanimljive geografije" (interesting geography)
We call it *črkarija* which is hard to translate directly, but would mean something like "the letter game". It's great for kids so they can learn about countries, cities etc
It's also a great game for young adults to play at 3:00 in the morning when they are shitfaced
Or maybe it's just retards like me and my friends
My girlfriend says they have those snails in kindergartens here as well
And a board game where you have to pick up fruit from trees and some others, possibly by the same brand
Brno was a popular new year party destination a decade ago for many Slovenian students
I don't know, Brno is the second town when I think about Czechia, right after Češke Budjevice
I probably can’t compare us to other foreigners as we are your neighbors and Klagenfurt(or Celovec as we call it) is very close to the border but pretty much everybody knows about it
Villach(we call it Beljak) is also very known here(beside Graz)
And there is a bunch of [motorway signs ] it all around Ljubljana
> he would think of Prague
I don't know why Prague, as a capital, is not first think when thinking about Czech towns, could be because I had never visit it, even if someone ask me what is the capital of Czechia I would need a second or two before answer Prague, while Brno and few others I could fire in a sleep
Avstro-Ogrska
Avstro-Ogrska (Ogrska reffering to another name for hungarians- Ogri, coming from tribe of Avari that settled Hunagry)
Avsto-Ogrska
> keisarikunta
I can't be the only one who read this as Kaisercunt
Veverica
Veveritsa in English I think
Same in slovenian -- Veverica
Considering that EU member states can't handle their own trade stuff, I wonder what would happen if an EU MS did just that
Would PoC break trade relations with all of the EU
Private tutors normally just help students with bad grades and are normally just some university students or older students from higher classes
Special entry test before university are only for certain faculties like architecture, film, art and for these faculties some students visit classes to prepare for entry tests
They're sold on normal shelves in stores but pretty sure everyone puts them in a fridge at home
My grandma keeps her fresh eggs from her chicken in a cold pantry room but if she brings them in the kitchen she puts them in a fridge
I've always wondered why they have them on the shelves outside of fridge in the stores-maybe that's where the rep comes from
I always keep mine in the fridge
WWII partisans or home guards
Gay marriage
Stupid because it shouldn’t even be a topic
Why should people have the power to prevent marriage between two consenting adults
Everybody here writes about silly food names or tiny linguistic details, but Slovenians still have too much WW2 baggage
It is a political divide
SDS our currently largest party with most seats in parliament, is always in opposition, members are mostly descendants of WWII home guards and Nazi who wants justice for post WWII killings, condemning the post WWII government etc
While other side are mostly pro partisans, as it brings more votes, but are divided in smaller fractions
Well I agree with them that mass graves should be investigated and mortal remain buried with dignity but then history should be left to historians
It is to much smaller degree than in Spain
Our right wing SDS has probably support of less than 10% eligible voters while central and lefties are fragmented
So with low voters turnout those 10% are enough that they become winner of election but still without the possibility to go into coalition with any other party to form a government they are doomed to be in opposition until voter turnout fails even more
Now in corona times I travelled across a good part of central Europe by train
I travelled a few times from Ljubljana to Prague (about 14h), from Prague to Krakow (about 8h I believe) and even from Prague to Gdansk (14h) and every time it was cheap and comfortable
At least from my experience, the Czech Railways are a great and cheap company so whenever I will go back to these countries, I will go by train
In the future, I hope I will still be alive to see a huge transeuropean rail network of fast trains
If that existed, I think a lot more people would rather pick a train than an airplane
Happy cakeday
You learn it as a kid
We even had to bring bicycles to kindergarten because we had a booklet with activities we had to do
I think they still do
Usually by the time you go to school you're supposed to ride without those little wheels
I figure it still depends on the town/village and on the family
My nephew (a more recent addition to the nation) started with one of those pushbikes that don't have pedals and was confidently tearing up any terrain with a proper BMX by the time he was 3 and a half, whereas I learned at 9 or 10, I think
Didn't have a bike to learn on till then
That was a few decades ago, however
My schoolmate could kinda drive a tractor by then :D (I grew up in the capital, she did not)
Don't you have to get a bike license in like 5th grade of school
I know our school did it
I mean yes, it's national
Everyone does it
Austrians - Jodlarji - Yodelers
Italian - Makaronarji - Macaronis
Croatians (HRvaška) - HRčki - Hamsters
Hungarians - nothing - no one cares about Hungary
Less a nickname, and more outdated names: Italians are Lahi (I don't know etymology, sadly)
And Hungarians are Ogri (also Vogri in various dialects), this is even reflected in our name for Austria-Hungary, which isn't Avstro-Madžarska (Madžarska being our modern name for Hungary), but Avstro-Ogrska instead
I think that Ogri comes from bastardisation of German Ungarn, which is just German for Hungary/Hungarians
I'd add Švabi for Austrians/Germans and Lahi for Italians, though these are a bit older
Don't you call them serbs
Pederi
Hmm
What happened to alpski Srbi
Bećki konjušari
C'mon, no need to keep those silk gloves on neighbor, it's all for science
We call the germans "Švabi" as well
> Slovenians: outdated "Windische" because of a) the hill range "Windische Bühel" in the (back then) Inner-Styrian language border/language mixing zone and b) Slovenian was called "Windisch" >100 years ago)
Nowadays there's no nicknames afaik, maybe "little Austria"?
Just as a bit of cultural/historical knowledge - the term "Windisch" was used by the Nazis during WW2 to mean Slovenian the same way the N-word was used by plantation owners to mean black
Plenty of connotation there, so if by some weird coincidence you're ever around a really old Slovenian person and the topic comes up, you may wanna skip saying that one
Most people <40 would likely never have heard of that though, if their grandparents weren't ww2 storytellers
> Slavic people in general: "Tschuschen". It has a south Slavic origin
Either from "čuješ" ("do you hear
") because of gastarbeiter in the 19th century on the A-H railroad or from "ćuš" which was an incitement word for pack animals in Bosnia(?)
The origin through "čuješ" would be super interesting, considering the word for Germans in Slavic languages derives from "nem" (mute)
I have only heard Švabi used for Germans
But yes, I only used less derogatory nicknames
There's also 'tati' or 'Hrvat je tat' for Croatians
I have never heard anything ill said about Hungarians
As soon as you stop lumping us together with the rest of 'Yugos'.
I've heard it used for German-language speakers, so technically even some Swiss would qualify
I've never seen anyone make a distinction between Austrians and Germans, when using such phraseology, TBH
Isn't the "Hrvat je tat" thing just a /r/Slovenia meme
O_o
Now I'm curious how come you guys need to have a special word for people who fucked the same woman
I mean, just how common is this O_o
Ščurek
Possibly since they don't walk with nationality written on their forehead lol
Possibly also true
I don't think I have heard that phrase in real life
Said the Hungarian to the Slovenian
Not even we need a word for that, and there's way fewer of us
We were supposed to go through the entire historical timeline both in primary and grammar school
Both times we spent so much time on Ancient History, the Middle Ages and the early modern period that we had run out of time by the time we reached the 20th century
In primary school I remember we had to know the three decisive battles: Stalingrad, El Alamein and Midway (even though it's bullshit)
It wasn't much better in grammar school for the regular part of the curriculum as we barely touched WW2
The exception were those of us who chose history for our *matura* (*Abitur*)
We had expanded classes
Two of the ten themes that year were WW2 in Slovenia and the political situation in the late 20th century so the curriculum was adjusted to that
We focused on the political aspect of the war both in Slovenia (the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation with its political structure, Dolomite Declaration, formation of AVNOJ, collaborationist units and *de facto* civil war
) and worldwide (Atlantic Charter, Casablanca, Tehran, Yalta, Potsdam
Military operations and even the Holocaust were dealt with superficially just to give us a basic overview of what was going on
You could cram it all in one or two lessons
The Pacific Theater was barely mentioned
I believe it is telling that our teacher knew next to nothing about the military aspect or at least not much more than your average person
I remember learning about the Atlantic Charter, Yalta, Potsdam etc
in primary school but I was that kid who took part in competitions
What I absolutely didn't understand, though, is why we didn't learn more about the way the war had affected people
Why didn't teachers tell us about Slovenes who were sent to concentration camps
Personally, I think that's more important than the dates
Because someone decided ancient Sumeria and Babylon are more important than 20th cenutry history
Edit: We mentioned Rab and Gonars in grammar school
We don't really have much of anything else tbh :P
Battle of the Golden Spurs
The phrase was used to distinguish the Flemish from French but that was supposed to have happened before the battle
Pigeons really fell out of favour
You can find recipes to prepare them in old cookbooks, but I've never seen anyone prepare and eat them in my life
Ducks are common in the autumn
Geese are somewhat less common, but not unheard of
Quails are rare, you can only get them if you know someone who grows them or in some specialised shops
Quail eggs are quite popular though
Edit: just remembered - there is a running joke that you it's pigeon's meat in burek in Ljubljana and that is the reason they are not as common as they used to be
That would probably be [Trbovlje] hate to people from Trbovlje)
Very industrialized city
I can't think of many explicitly ugly cities, but Jesenice is the worst I've seen in Slovenia
[Here's an image i found online]
Jesenice, Velenje (although they're doing a lot to make it nicer), Nova Gorica
Metlika and especially Črnomelj haven't had any work done in decades
I've been this summer and I was extremely disappointed
Črnomelj is a hell hole, Metlika at least has some potential but it's still one big ruin
It's such an ugly sight driving towards Karavanke
Funny enough, [Nova Gorica ] was the “nicest” medium-sized town in 2018 and [Velenje] was the nicest bigger town in 2019
> najlepše **urejena** mesta
So - tidy
Still ugly imo
Velenje has a nice new promenade and the lake part is nice, I heard
But the last time I was in Nova Gorica there was nothing
Ugly commie blocks, casinos and nice looking houses
Still nicer than Črnomelj and Metlika though but those are a lot smaller
there is the dreaded dual female form
(slovenian has singular, dual and plural)
most people dont know if its correct to say "ali sta prišle" or "ali sta prišli" (did you two girls come)
a common mistake is writing "ne" (not/non/un
) together with "bo" (will be)
ex: danes me nebo (i wont be back today)
using "s" (with) incorrectly when there should be a "z" .  ex: grem s dvema prijateljicama (im going with two friends)
People don’t know how to use dual and just use plural instead
Pretty sad since we are one of the few languages that actually have dual
Also very common: *vredu* - meaning *good*, even though I know the right way to write it is *v redu* it would feel odd to do so in nonformal texts
Additionally, the literal translation of *v redu* is *in order*, so it shouldn't be that weird to write it like that (but it still is)
Also
Svoj/tvoj or svoj/moj (“svoj” is a reflexive possessive pronoun, used to stress when something is your/one’s *own* instead of using the regular tvoj (yours) or moj (mine))
So, saying “bring me your pen” should be “prinesi mi *svoj* kuli”. Your own pen
Using “kateri” instead of “ki”. Meaning “which”, “kateri” should only be used when “ki” makes the sentence ambiguous
But it sounds fancy and people like to use it
“Drevo, ki je padlo
” (a tree which has fallen) is correct
“Drevo, katero je padlo
” is wrong
Remember this shit, people
One example of ambiguity is “Srečal je prijatelja, ki mu je dal darilo”. (He met a friend who gave (had given) him a gift/whom he gave a gift”)
If it’s that person who gave the gift, use “kateremu je dal
”. If it’s the friend, use “kateri mu je dal
Another thing, making grammatical cases with foreign words
People like to put a dash (-) and put the (albeit correct) Slovene noun suffix after that
“That of Sydney” would incorrectly become “Sydney-ski” or “(I gave it) to John” “John-u”. We have rules for these
Correctly it’s “Sydneyjski” and “Johnu”. It’s not “Ferrari-ja” but “Ferrarija”!
Another case thing that grinds my gears is not properly declining foreign male first names and last names
So, so many people would say "Videl sem Chuck Norrisa" instead of "Videl sem Chucka Norrisa" (I saw Chuck Norris)
I saw this happen in a variant of BCS but I can't say BCS directly influenced this mistake in Slovene
Yet another bad mistake is people using the wrong pronouns: "za njega" (for him specifically) instead of "zanj" (for him), claiming they have never heard of the latter form
How they graduated high school is beyond me
Drkajva skupaj - Blades of glory
skupaj means together while drkati means to masturbate while less known meaning is to slide/skate on ice, the more common expression to slide on ice is drsati
So imagine my expression when looking trough TV schedule to find a family movie around noon called Let's masturbate together
Wait drkati also means to slide on ice
They don't teach us this in school
I looked it up in the [dictionary] and well, they could have used a better example
Sport commentator Stare when he heard that drkati is skating/sliding started to excessively use it, I remember something in this line "Look at Peter Prevc how beautifully he masturbates on in-run" or comment on football tackle "How great was this masturbation"
Stare is a legend but isn't ski jumping commented by Andrej Hofer
I'm quite sure it was Stare but could be someone else
It was few years ago when Prevc was on the top, I'm not sure if it was even Prevc or someone else from Slovenian jumpers, but he was really looking for every situation to say drkanje
Stare is 15 year old trapped inside a grown man's body
I remember now that Hofer is for Eurosong not for skiing
But I think there's 2 commenting
I know theres a woman and Stare perhaps
I think Jerkovič also comments but he's more serious and mostly for football
I see you've met the Bear Jew
Those windows are pretty much the norm everywhere in Europe
It's been this way more or less since I've been alive
Even in Slovenia, just a few years after getting our independence from Yugoslavia, those widows were already pretty damn common, though not as much as now(now, 99% of the widows are like that, in every house and institution, unless it's a REALLY old, non-renovated building with the original windows or something)
I don't think I've ever seen a window that doesn't open that way
Not all of them had a lever
Ours didn't but my school windows did and I was very confused at first
So how do you clean it
Smidi plays & tristano
What does Agadmator stand for
I remember him saying he will explain it eventually but I haven't seen every single one of his videos
Has he ever answered that question
Here it's very common
You normally greet someone you don't know with it
But for close friends its a bit different (at least as teenagers)
It like a hybrid between a handshake and a high five
We use it everyday
Hello there kindred spirit
I do the same, but I make it a bit more interesting for me by telling myself that I'm playing "god" and affecting their evolution with this
I like to imagine a snail giving thanks to "something" (me) for teleporting them across the road
Does Gotschee German count
We're barely even aware of it ourselves, I'd guess most don't know about it, and I wonder if anyone still speaks it
Then, there's a case for Prekmurje Slovene being its own language and not just a dialect, but that's rather disputed
It is however extremely different from standard Slovene and basically unintelligible
We do have Hungarian, Italian and Roma minorities as well (excluding recent, ie
last century immigrants from ex-Yugoslavia and elsewhere)
We only have one language (Slovenian) and it's pretty unknown to the the rest of the world, so I guess that counts
But Galician is, it's just not the same as Portuguese (anymore
There actually still is a small german minority in Slovenia, scattered around the country
But it is not officially recoginsed
Many Germans who lived in the slovenian part of Styria emigrated to either Austria or Germany between world wars, were forcefully moved, killed, or they slovenianised (I'm not even sure this word exists)
That's why you can still find a lot of german sounding surnames in Slovenia
Oh, and about the Gotschee Germans
They were moved to Germany during WWII by the Germans, because Gotschee region came under Italian rule
Some of them, who didn't want to move also joined Slovenian partisans
I really don't consider Turkey to be balkan or greece for that matter
Half of Zagreb is not even in the Balkans
If you're ever talking with a person from there, best stick to SE Europe
Westerners usually use "Balkan" in a derogatory manner, so it can trigger some nasty reactions
But other than that, as we say here in Slovenia, "Balkan" isn't a place, nor is it a thing
It's a state of mind
I think we're waay more balkan than turkey and greece though
Maybe I'm biased but I see us all being slavic and having cultural similarities
So I see Balkan as ex-Yu + Albania and Romania
Turkey and grece are I think not balkan at all
We are both way closer to let's say serbia, than I think we are to Greece
Romanians have slavic influence and it's heard in their language
So I see them as much closer to us that Greeks for example
Romanians have slavic influence and it's heard in their language
So I see them as much closer to us that Greeks for example
Most of my friends and family know only that EU exists and that is it
In person I maybe know 3 or 4 people that know anything at all about EU
As for general population I have no idea probably they do not know much
There are things we have to learn about it in 8th grade of *domovinska kultura in etika* (it gets renamed every couple of years and it's mainly about various religions, the workings of the government, courts, presidents, national assembly etc
but it also covers the EU ) and in High schools during sociology, but I don't know which specific parts are covered
In Bosnia you just jump on a tram or a trolley and pray that a controller doesn't catch you
Heh, I'm quite certain that people from Bosnia and Herzegovina will gladly specify on their own if they are Serbs or Croats
I, for one, haven't been to Prague, did visit Sedlec for the ossuary
Fascinating place, really
Most timezones
You sure russia doesn't have that
Edit: nevermind
My mind is blown and I regret saying anything
Also, celebrating New Years is a Scottish invention, apparently
I went for a trip to Edinburgh right on Jan 1 this year and people wouldn't shut up about that
Paddington it is then
Eh who cares, as long as I have pasta
Bread with pizza
Nooo
Bread with pasta
Ok, if there is a lot of left over sauce and the pasta is already eaten
Ski jumping is very popular here and a there’s a big fan base that is very passionate about it
Things can get pretty wild especially during the World Cup in Planica but there’s no violence
The only other sport that I can’t think of where things get pretty heated and violence may occur is ice hockey
For us Slovenes no matter what sport it is if we are good at we go crazy about it
But the only one that can turn violent is football and even that its because of the hooligans
I don't think people ever turn to mention-worthy amount of violence, but international winter sport events are big around here
Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and ski jumps all draw drunk and loud crowds
Other sports generally get popular whenever someone or a team gets good
It cycles, there is cycling, basketball, handball, volleyball, hockey, sports climbing, athletics, gymnastics etc
We manage something attractive more or less every year
I actually hate the sport but really cringe when it's not called FOOTBALL
To answer your question, un alpine countries are pretty obsessed with skiing
#tinamaze
Oh got I never got that
Slovenians love it to but what is there to watch
Excuse me
Tina Maze
Sitting with the other Balkans, but not feeling very welcome there, therefore trying desperately to join the conversation with the other countries
Also failing to do that succesfully, so we're drinking a lot to compensate
This comment is still the most infuriating thing I have ever seen on reddit
Gay propaganda seems to be really strong there
A girl who went on Erasmus to Russia said she met a medicine student while she was there
He was almost done with school, like 4th year or something, and he believed homosexuality is a disease
It's not a pop song, but probably the best example for me is Hands Held High by Linkin Park
I started listening to them when I was 11 or so and I liked the song a whole lot even then, but my appreciation of it has gone _way_ up with age and as my English got better
I find it very relevant right now, too
For me it was Pink
I was listening to her when i was like 6 and when I looked back at 10 to songs like Clown House or something similar i was really suprised
I started learning English back in kindergarten, so most of song lyrics fall under "[mondegreen] and it sometimes took me years to finally realise what the lyrics actually are
The most egregious example was probably Blue Bayou, which my father titled on his mixtapes as Blue By You, and it took me like forever to realise it's not that
But I did have the similar experience to OP's just not with English
I was listening to Peste Noir, and while I don't agree with Famine's political leaning I really like his music
And the first album I really got into is entitled L'ordure A L'etat pur, and because my knowledge of French is like non-existent, I thought this meant something like The order of pure state or something, while it's actually something like Boils and zits (someone who knows French can correct me)
Also once I started reading the lyrics, it kind of turned out that they're pretty shallow and not as "deep" as I assumed they were
Taborniki (campers) and Skavti (scouts) were pretty popular in my youth
i occasionally see people wearing scout cloths around their necks so its definitely still a thing
Once per year dentist, once per year hygenist is the norm
For last two years, my dentist asked me to come more often to exchange the old fillings that were beggining to lost function
More or less all of our history
We do have some interesting bits that could be mentioned somewhere
Like aforementioned first anti-fascist movement outside Italy, or the fact our language is the first Slavic language to be written in karolingian minuscule (I know very specific)
And on more general history that we learn and others don't, I'm always wondering why isn't the HRE interregnum and the rise of Hapsburgs more widely known
Like there's tons of books and shows and stuff about War of the Roses, but I have yet to find one based on that, especially when it's even more "epic" and complex
Really
Cuz in slovenia germany/hre is talked about more than any other outside country
All of what you noted here we learn
We learn them (tho Venice mostly since it was here)
World cup tho
Thats true
It was officially abolished on constitutional level when we got our independence in 1991, but even in socialist Yugoslavia it was rarely practiced
The last execution was in 1959 and the last death sentence was given in 1980 (to the infamous serial killer Metod Trobec) but was later changed to prison time
I was referring to Slovenia only
I don't know the data for the other republics or Yugoslavia as a whole
In Slovenia, the less the locals have to think about what they're doing when you're around, the more accepted you'll be
Try pushing your culture on them, however, and there could be trouble, regardless of where you're from
Also, by pushing your culture on them I don't mean e.g. wearing a religious headdress or ethnic clothing but rather expecting them to change their behavior to be in line with what your culture demands
In a city, meh, you'll get a some glances if you're not a typical white dude/gal, probably occasional remarks, other than that, nobody cares
But in rural districts, picture that silence when a suspicious character enters a bar in a movie
That silence will follow you around until you meet and greet, better yet, buy a couple of rounds
But the village I grew up in, the entire region for that matter will never fully accept a stranger, even a fellow Slovene that moved from a different region
I mean, they won't shun you or make your life harder, but you'll always be a stranger
Seems to me that in Germany, black people are less looked down on than Slavs are though
Or at least comparatively
Or perhaps it's just that nobody wants to seem racist by using derogatory language for blacks but with Slavs it's normalized
From what I hear from a bunch of black Portuguese I trust, they're quite adamant that Portugal is racist AF towards people from former African colonies at the very least
I haven't spent a ton of time in Poland, but I did some, and as a Black Slovenian, I must say it didn't feel xenophobic in the least, save for some nonsense at the airport in Warsaw with the border police, but those are probably 50:50 to happen in just about every country
I'm curious - how do Slovaks view Slovenians
Since thinking about it, there literally isn't any stereotype about Slovaks we have here that I'm aware of
> Eastern Europeans, especially Poles and Croatians
Please don't use "Eastern Europeans" for those groups and in general for any EU country
It comes across to many as offensive and "othering" since the term itself doesn't fit in a cultural, historical, or geographical context and is usually used to delimit subjectively "better" vs "worse".
> but you'll always be a stranger
And this holds true regardless of whether you moved from one village over or from Timbuktu
> Eastern Europeans
Unless you're talking about Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarussians, please don't use that term to refer to anyone else, since they likely consider it offensive for a host of historical and cultural reasons and because it doesn't really make sense either
Sure, but I wouldn't consider that a negative or racism
Sometimes annoying or tiring, sure, but unless there's a feeling of superiority on their side, all good, and that I've never experienced
I won't speak for them but my guess is that they wouldn't consider a 50:50 Dane+Pole Danish either
> If you picked a Slovak a put him somewhere in Slovenia, if people were not taking, he wouldn't know he is in a different country
That (in reverse obvs) is precisely my impression of Slovakia
> Because let's be honest here for a moment - it's not a different country, it's just a trick we play on Hungary and Austria
Just a very-long-game pincer attack to encircle and crush them
It would actually be hilarious for Slovakia and Slovenia to start a joint tourism program where we'd confuse people into whether it's one or two countries and then have them visit both
> Czech Corridor
How have I never heard of this
Would've been neat if it had happened
> So almost like brothers
You might enjoy our linguistic brotherhood as well =) These are always interesting to read for the various Slavic language combos
Oh, please, do not apologize
I'm sorry if it came across that way, but it wasn't intended as chastising, just as pointing out something that isn't well-known in "the west".
For example that Yugoslavia was never behind the Iron Curtain, that it was invited to join NATO in 1953, which was refused because it didn't want to be too dependent on either side, and that the Yugoslavs could freely travel to both sides and the rest of the world and everybody could visit Yugoslavia, it having been one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement
Or that Finland spent more time in history under Russia than e.g. Czechia did
Or that using Eastern Europe in general for most European countries that actually were part of the Eastern Block is kind of like using colonial names for modern-day countries that have long-since changed those when referring to them
I've created a series of maps that shows the various versions of what is/could be/should be considered "Eastern Europe" and why it doesn't make sense, so if you're curious, feel free to check them out [here]
Again, none of this is meant as a critique of you as a person, most people just never think about this, so I thought I'd start spreading awareness
Have a great Sunday evening
That's just the curse of being mixed with "lesser/better peoples" you aren't accepted in either group
/r/mixedrace understands
> What the hell is going on with vienna
City, river, potayto potahto :P
> otroci na cesti
I've heard about that one, it's always hilarious to hear xD
Our reverse is "fukati" - though that might be with Czech, I'm not sure
But I hear it means sth like to blow air up there and here it's, well, straight from English
I'm not sure about "jed" - it seems to me it could have a relation to "jedek/jedka/jedko" which means corrosive I think, basically which can hurt living tissue
That seems to be a sensible connection
Ahahah, dark, but hilarious :D
Do you know where šukat in Polish etymologically comes from
I can't seem to relate it to anything we have nor any German or English I can remember
In Croatian, apparently it means to row hard and fast, but that's the closest I got
Unfortunately no, both holidays fell on weekend this year, and they don't get transfered
Lmao, we have May 1st and 2nd as a May day holiday
We also have January 1st and 2nd as New years holiday
And then October 31st is Reformation day and November 1st is All saints day and December 25th is Christmas and December 26th is Independence and Unity Day
So we have 4 two day holidays
If I took a shower, let alone bathe, more than once a day in winter, I'd be as flaky as a flaky pastry
Gorenjska - jokes about stingy people
Dolenjska&Štajerska - jokes about drunk people
Prekmurje - jokes about how nobody understands their dialect
Ljubljana - People from there are known as Žabarji (frog men)
Primorska (litoral region) - I don't know about any jokes (but if they exist they must be weather related), but we are looked down on (especially northern part)
Koroška is also looked down on
These two last regions have bad roads and even worse railways, no highways (except south part of primorska) and are mostly very mountainous and have low population density
So probably not weird that we are looked down on
Primorska looked down upon
I've heard of us being lazy but more than anything we look down upon all others
We have the weather, the food, the wine, the sea, the mountains and a very good quality of life
Y'all wish you were Primorska
I also don't know if Primorska is looked down upon
I'd love to live anywhere in Primorska (Vršič -> Nova Gorica for the mountains and Soča, Vipavska Dolina for the vineyards, nature and the weather, and southern part obviously for the sea) and think the people (that I know) are just awesome and northern Primorska dialect is the best sound ever
Edit: I'm (sadly) not from Primorska, so not much bias there (I don't think)
Well, as far as I know, we were always considered to be provincial
Generally, everyone outside of the larger cities gets looked down on :(
Ljubljana: 286 745 (municipality: 295 504)
Maribor: 96 211 (municipality: 112 682)
Kranj: 37 941 (municipality: 57 065)
Celje: 37 872 (municipality: 49 540)
Ljubljana (290 000) - the capital city of Slovenia and basically the central hub
Unlike in many other countries (like the UK) where the capital has a reputation for being expensive, unfriendly and cultureless, Slovenia holds up only to the first point
It receives a lot of Slovene immigrants since other areas aren't doing that well
~~Trst~~ Maribor (96 000) - the second largest city
Although I know little to nothing about it, what I hear is that most people there are depressed
Can't tell doe
Although ot has a university, it's apparently not that great but, once again, can't say for sure
Kranj (38 000) - recently surpassing Celje, Kranj is the industrial city that every country has
Major factories like Iskra and Sava are located here
Most people there are generally quite friendly
However, the area is also full of immigrants so people there are quite
diverse
Idk, basically just a lot of Albanians and Bosnians
In Slovenia we have a mandatory vaccination program
The only optional one is for girls for HPV I believe
Historical ones, yes
- John Lackland = Ivan brez zemlje
- Richard Lionheart = Rihard Levjesrčni
- Charlemagne = Karel Veliki
- William the Conqueror = Viljem Osvajalec
- Henry VIII
= Henrik VIII
- Mary of England = Marija I. Tudor
- Phillip II of Spain = Filip II
- Charles I. = Karel I.
- James I. = Jakob I.
But we do not translate the recent ones
Prince William is not called Viljem, instead wr just use the original version of his name
Same with Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Charles
Nice list
But don't we say *kraljica Elizabeta*?
Agreed
Russia is awesome
The people are some of the nicest in the world, even if they don't speak one bit of English you will be able to have amazing talks as long as you're willing too
Also amazing history, tradition and just the huge scale of everything
Very safe as well - once we were approached by some drunk gopniks in the middle of the forest in the night, they wanted some beef at first but in the end we shook hands saying "Hello friend"! Awesome guys haha
Either Solze or Krst by Brezno
I personally prefer Solze but Krst is based on a famous Slovene poem (by the sam guy who wrote another poem that would later become the Slovene national anthem) which talks about the war between pagans and Christians during the expansion of Christianity in Europe
I spent some time in Belgium and I'm continually impressed how a government can be this complicated and still work
It was probably the hardest thing I attempted to understand during my exchange program (I failed, but I also didn't try very hard)
I mean, the organisation seemed pretty impressive
I got bureaucratic thing done in a day that would take weeks at home
Locals seemed above averagely happy with it (which is not a lot, but something)
That's close enough for the definition of 'works' I think
This is pretty impressive, true
But on the other hand, we spend a couple of months without a government every two years or so when the previous one managed to trip itself over and a new one hasn't formed yet
It gets old pretty quickly
God, I just want a reasonably stable government with only some small corruption scandals and possibly a minister who has to resign due to discovery that he was a swinger
I can do with constant responsibility dodging   and zero principles
Yes
Singular: Hvala ti
Plural: Hvala vam
And a bonus dual option: Hvala vama
Edit: seems I misunderstood
Yes, you can thank people as a group
Sing
Zahvaljujem se ti
Zahvaljujemo se ti
Which would translate sort of to
"I thank you" and "We thank you" but without the first pronoun as it's reflected in the form of the verb
Hvala
- Thanks
Hvala ti
- Thank you
Hvala vam
- Thank you
(plural or formal)
One better
We also have one for dual (when referring to two people) which is different than the plural form
We have it in singular, plural and dual
'Hvala ti', 'hvala vam' and 'hvala vama'.
Aha
Right
Sorry
In that case
Zahvaljujem se ti/vam
Zahvaljujemo se ti/vam

Flajšmašina yes, vešmašina no
Yes, it's "karjola/krjola". I don't know where they use it though
Possibly Slovenian Carinthia
I think it's "karola" in Slovene Littoral
Other words I can find for it are kedrjola, tolige/talige/telige/tulige, talička, tačke, kolica, kolečka, somovoznica, samotežnica, karla, denper, trogarca, grodek, [kankole] The proper word for it is "samokolnica".
Here in Slovenian Istria we say ˝karjola˝. It comes from Italian
How do you call a mantis in your country
Exactly the same
All the Slavs reading this - I understand that one word
Well sure, standard would work too, and so would magyar at least for south Slavs
It was a joke though :)
Na Golici by Ansambel bratov Avsenik
Supposedly the most played instrumental song in the world
That we're part of the Balkans, probably
Švedska and Švica in Slovenian
it is even more similar in pronounciation "schwetzka" and "schwitza"
Just google Barbara pit
Threw them in pits aand that’s it, they died there
There is thousands of dead people lying in our caves, ex mining tunnels, pits etc
Men, women, kids, old people, everything
Most of them probably innocent, specially kids, women and eldery people, but commies killed everyone who didnt agree with their regime/ideology
They simply tied their hands, shoot them and bury them in ditches, caves
Extrajudicial executions
It's still a topic of great debate and controversy
> Queen Juliana granted pardons to some of those sentenced to death
What was the rationale behind that
I do not think the situation in Macedonia is comparable to that in Slovenia
> to help Europe
HA-HA-HA
The US spent $1 trillion in today's money to prevent the Soviet Union from taking over the rest of Europe eventually, be it ideologically or by force, which would most likely have tipped the balance in communism's favor
The idea that the US (or any other country for that matter) have ever done something big out of the goodness of their hearts is hilarious
Firstly, Macedonia was the most peaceful region during the war
Just comparing the Macedonian and Slovenian deaths will give you a good picture of that (\~90,000 Slovenian and less than 7,000 Macedonian)
Secondly, Slovenia was the only part of Yugoslavia that was directly annexed and incorporated into the German 3rd Reich and Fascist Italy
Thirdly, Slovenia had both ant active independent partisan (not under the command of Tito) and anti-communist fighting force, both home-grown and composed entirely of Slovenes ([Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation] [Slovene Home Guard] Next, unlike in Macedonia, many Slovene civilians were deported into concentration camps in Germany to make room for German settlers
And this is only scratching the surface, really
Yes
Croatia was still
well
"worse" also bosnia and serbia probably
And also to Yugoslavia but that help was outside of Marshall plan
> Then why did we feed, clothe, arm and supply the Soviet Army for the entire war
Because having the Nazis win would've been the same result except with Germany in charge, which would arguably have been even worse
> The Marshall Plan was specifically designed to jump start European industry
Because hungry people are much more likely to turn to communism, i.e. invite the Red Army for a visit
> we wanted Europe to be able to stand on its own and feed its own people so we wouldn't have to anymore
This we agree on
The US wanted as much of Europe as possible to be able to stand on its own and be well-off enough that communism would stop being appealing
And since that's expensive, it's much better if Europe can do it alone
Seriously, it's nothing new
The balance of power calculations and propping up other nations as buffers, vassals, allies etc
is something European empires, kingdoms, and later countries have been doing for centuries before the words United States of America were ever uttered for the first time
It doesn't mean the US are bad or evil
It just means they act in their own self-interest FIRST, which is normal and expected
We agree that the US did the stuff
We agree that it's good for Europe that the US did the stuff
What we apparently disagree on is my claim that the US didn't do it out of altruism but out of pure self-interest - that not being a negative thing but simply realpolitik
Or do we agree on that as well
> The country isn't one person with one belief
Many wanted to help Europe for altruistic reasons, many didn't want to help at all
That's all true
I'm talking about why the country did what it did, and countries don't do stuff out of altruism
> This was shortsighted and it's good we became involved and then stayed to help after
It's good you became involved and stayed to help after
Nobody's saying it was a bad thing
It likely saved a couple million lives that would've been lost if you hadn't. But you didn't join and especially stay after to save lives
You did it because if you hadn't, the old French and possibly even Spanish and Portuguese generations would still understand Russian today, possibly even live in a still-existing Soviet Union
> Roosevelt was idealistic though and he was our leader
Yes, but the leadership as a whole stayed pragmatic
A lot, including castle ruins, since if its a ruin they usually dont charge entrance and after ww2 most of our castles got abandoned and or destroyed anyway

Being part of Yugoslavia
People are still torn by it
Many people on the left don't admit it was a dictatorship and that many people suffered
They expect people to just casually get over everything they went through
The people who did suffer or are future generations of the ones who suffered on the other hand sometimes use that to fuel hate
It's a mess and those of us who see both sides are enemy of all
Seen as stupid or naive
Something called “[segedinar] originally from Hungary)
I hate it, it’s too sour for me
Pasta
To me it's just bland, tasteless quick eat-stuff :)
Usually accompanied with some oily, fatty sauce to hide its taste
I know, it's cheap, easy and quick to cook (and this is imo the reason for it's popularity) but it has so many alternatives which are actually edible that it's almost a crime to cook that shit
Get me a whole grain bread, or maybe some dumplings or [baked potatoes] as a side dish and I'm a happy man
Probably my favourite museum in my country is the [WW1 museum in Kobarid] It is showing about a front that is often ignored in history and in general
There is 1 KFC in the whole country so pretty much non existent
And its location is in the middle of nowhere, not even in a city
Everything is in Ljubljana, why can’t Maribor have something as well
But it would be nice if we would have more of them and in other cities as well

In Slovenia there is only a special 5€ newyears' scratch ticket, and all win at least 2€. Unfortunately, the top prize is only 10
000€, and only 3 of 400
000 win that
Furthermore 96% win 5€ or less
In some years there was also a Super-Loto on January 1, with a top prize of 1 million (odds of winning are as in our regular loto: 1 in 15 million)
If the jackpot was not won, it was split among other prizes, multiplying them by 4 or 5 times
The most likely one would probably be [Lower Styria ] it has a strong ideology and connection with Austria(Hitler referred to them as Windish)
There are also some idiots that founded the [“Styrian Ward”]

Stray dogs not really
I would say stray cats are more common but more in the countryside
There are about 10 stray cats roaming around in our village
And also other animals sometimes (wild boars, foxes, deers, shakals, there was even a bear situation ones)
We don't have stray dogs but there are stray cats
It has gotten a lot better over the years because of spay and neuter programs (mostly done by charities)
Unfortunately while you won't see many stray cats in the city, there are plenty in the countryside and even semi-rural places
Farms are especially bad and people in many rural areas still rather kill each litter of cats instead of takimg care of the mom
Males are neutered even less frequently
In Bosnia and Serbia it's unfortunately not like that
A few volunteers from slovenia go down there and take care of stray populations in garbage sites
There are new dogs dropped there all the time
Mostly pregnant or hurt
And people go visit these populations to abuse them
Often it's kids who do that (kill puppies, even cut of parts of dogs)
The volunteers usually get laughed at for helping them
Obviously nkt everyone is like that but it is a huge problem
You guys really do have a great relationship with dogs and they are super friendly
The shelters are so sad
I've see photos of dead decaying dogs among groups of dogs still housed there
I don't judge the people for not being able to care for the animals but it is so sad and I hope it gets better
We have special pens for left-handed here
I think ink for left handed pens dries quicker but it's been a long time since I was in school
The pens don't have the same tip as regular pens
Normally people drop off their kids and then pick them up at the end
If parents are really close friends they might stay for a few minutes but not much more than that
Mostly it was just kids, but I remeber a few occasions when I was still in the kindergarten that some parents stayed to help with the party, particularly if it was a larger one or if parents knew each other anyway
It also depended on company
I grew up with a group of friends that I had because my parents and their friends had kids at approximately the same time
Obviously at those parties, our parents were present and hanging out themselves
I remember we mentioned some specifics now and then, particularly in context of phonemes and a little about vocabulary
For example, there are Slovene dialects that use diphtongs, but standard language doesn't. Standard language knows tonal accents (although they don't change the meaning), but some dialects don't. Dialects use a lot of borrowed words from neighbouring languages
We didn't study them systematically though
Here in Slovenia, we dedicate a significant chapter in high school Slovene to our dialects
We have between 7 and 52, depending on who you ask
Dialects and dialect groups that are geographically close are usually mutually intelligible but still sound distinct
On the national scale, some dialects are so far apart that some call them different languages entirely
Imagine the entire English language along with Scots and various creoles, squeezed inside just 20 thousand km2 - roughly 4% of Spain
[This article] describes it better than I ever could
There is an official/standardized version of the language that most everyone can understand and speak
The vast majority of everything written is written in "standard" Slovene which is also taught and analysed in school
However, nobody speaks this "variant" outside of very formal situations, be it speeches or the news
In school, we learn of the dialect groups, what makes them unique and what the differences between and inside each group are
My high school was in an area that speaks "Rovte Slovene", so we did a deeper dive into the differences inside the group
I'm sure they do the same in other regions of the country
Austria of course
It is close to home and it has similar culture
It's a great country
Germany
Unlike the other two, they speak German
Well, in some regions at least
Probably Austria as it's the closest and i wont spend to much money getting there
Austria over Switzerland every day of the week
Sadly such help would come too late when you're left alone on a train trying to figure whether everyone has got off due to an undecipherable announcement or simply because that was their station

thanks for reminding me
Most people in my age group is putting some small amount away for retirement, since we're seeing the government retirement scheme drop lower and lower every few years
Apart from that, people prefer to keep money on hand to buy stuff they can use
Real estate is for own use and maybe some renting is probably the most common investment
Older people all got some money in this or other kind of bonds as handout during denationalisation, and while I got the sense they are all somewhat disillusioned with what they managed to make of it, the market for binding the money still seems quite strong
A lot of time
Sometimes I find myself looking for a word in Slovene but know the exact translation in a language I'm not even fluent and do use google translate to reverse translate it so I don't think it is only because of extensive use of foreign language (It may be age ;) )
It happens
For some reason I can often think of the Croatian word before I can remember what the Slovenian one is even though I don't use Croatian in my everyday life
TV SLO 1 is first on the list and the most popular one is POP tv
1 TV SLO is from RTV Slovenija and its a national TV
Yes, but goverment managed to change RTV management, things might change in the future
Yes they also want to make their Nova24tv (crazy nationalist propaganda) much more popular and obligatory on all tvs or something idk
I'd rather unite with Slovakia and become Slovenkia with them and end the name confusion once and for all
Austria would be fine, too
For a nice connection in the middle, between Slovenia and Slovakia :D
Been there, done that
Trieste was and is ours already :)
although this doesnt apply for the example you posted, its because even "i dont know" is an answer
i know i always want to contribute a unique slovenian perspective to the questions, but if i dont know the answer it at least tells you that slovenians probably dont know or dont have X in their culture/society
Is it rude to ask how old are you
I'm 21 and I'm very suprised you didn't know anything about other currencies
EDIT: Or better, how old were you when you found out
We got Euro in 2007 so I still remember the times we used Tolar
For you it was probably different
Ah ok, makes perfect sense then
Kids don't give a shit about money and many 7 year olds probably don't even know much about foreign countries
In my family it was only when we had family gatherings because there was no place for all of us to sit at one table
Sometimes we did that in the first round eat children or "the young ones" and in the second round all the adults
I sure hope not
I need to save time walking to the station
There are 30 judges at the Supreme Court and they are divided between the Civil Chamber, the Criminal Chamber, the Commercial Chamber, the Labour and Social Chamber, and the Administrative Chamber
The Slovene Supreme Court is not equivalent in power to the American though
The Court is the highest instance court, meaning that it is the highest court you can appeal to after your case was decided at the district court (first instance) and then the higher court (second instance)
However, we also have a Constitutional Court that deals with constitutional matters and there are 9 justices that are elected for a 9 year term
In some cases it could be said that the Constitutional Court is the de facto highest court, as you can lodge a constitutional appeal if your constitutional rights have been infringed even after your case was decided at the Supreme Court
In this case you’d have to argue that the supreme court’s decision infringed a constitutional right (which also proves you have a legal interest) and that you have exhausted all other remedies
Moreover, the Constitutional Court also deals with constitutional review proceedings, disputes regarding competence between the different branches of government, among others

We were hundreds of years under German rule, there had to be some consequences
Most of those built by Yugoslavia are still in use
The big change is that few "military secret" bases that were closed to public are now opened
Most notably the entire village and huge area around Kočevska Reka, which I'd highly recommend as it has some of the most pristine and wild forest in Slovenia, and the mountain Krim, which has become a popular hiking destination for many
But the more interesting (at least to me) is the fate of Austro-Hungarian barracks, at least those in Ljubljana, which many experienced different fates
Two are still standing, one on Metelkova street and one on Roška
The one on Metelkova was squatted by various youth movements back in the 80's and has become a hub of counter-culture ever since and is one of the most recommended tourist destination behind only Bled
The one on Roška was used as military prison all the way up to 90's. And back in late 80's it housed the most "influential" political prisoner and Twitter-shitposter that is our current PM
But after our independence it was vacated and left to disrepair
But it hasn't been demolished yet, probably because of its historic importance
Other two Kolizej and one on Topniška street (named after the artillery that was housed there) were back under Yugoslavia social housing
The first to be demolished was the one on Topniška, as it was to be replaced by a new modern "fancy" buildings
That was in late 90's early 00's, it has yet to progress from there
Kolizej was the one that was most well preserved and was used as housing up to 00's. But in late 90's a badly planned renovation caused a small part of one wing to collapse, so it was also later demolished, even though many architects were against that, as it was a important historic monument
There were ideas to at least conserve the outer facade, but in the end the deal was made that it will be replaced by a "cultural hub". But this project also went nowhere, and was recently replaced by just fancy apartment building, with no cultural value
I'd add "Pekarna" (The Bakery) in Maribor
Former Austro-Hungarian military warehouse and bakery, now a counter-cultural centre of Maribor
It includes an excellent used-book "shop" *Bukvarna Ciproš* (I really doubt they get anything more than to break even on expenses since "contribution to book preservation" is really low - they just quickly look at what you collected and charge as much for the whole pile of hard-to-find-anywhere-else bok as you might pay for one or two of the books in an actual shop selling used books), residing in the former flour warehouse
Ground floor has books in Slovene and textbooks+technical books in all languages and first floor has foreign-language fiction, biographies etc
And books are everywhere
Literally
Full bookshelves, tables completely covered, piles on the floor
I sincerely recommend anyone who finds themselves near Pekarna in Maribor Mon-Fri between 17-19; Wed 9-13 or 17-19; Sat 9-13 to visit Bukvarna Ciproš. It is completely worth it

I remember hearing both on Serbian, Croatian and Ukrainian radio stations
Well, I was going to write that
One of them is actually a Slovenian
We don't have the same language like Slovaks, but
if I drive in Slovakia with sign "Otrok v avtu" I will get attention of local police as this in Slovakian means "Slave in the car" while in Slovene it is "children in the car"
Other way around is driving in Slovenia with "Hasič", in Slovenia it would be understand as "smoker of hashish" while in Slovak it is "Firefighter"
> sprostý
And sprosti in Slovene means relax
OK so now I know I should not say "sprosti se" to Czech or Slovak when trying to extract them from car crash
Or sirov burek
> "Pozor, policie varuje"
And in Slovene "Pozor, policija varuje" is "Attention, police is protecting"  :D

Plus I despise these competitions and fans who put up with horrendous behaviour just to enjoy a sport
There are a lot of English words that are used in slang and with new generations this number just increases so yes I am a little

We've been waiting for one for almost a decade I think but the building still hasn't started lol
I kind of don't want it, since it will badly affect our furniture makers
the largest amount i see is some slovenians using the N word because they dont really understand how inapropriate it is
they hear it in songs and see it in movies too much
I mean it's not like there's anyone like that to offend here, so I guess it doesn't really matter
4 groups of people who use it
Friends who know it's fine to go "yo yo my nigga
", people who're crazy about hiphop subculture, people who're genuinely clueless, and racists
The last group also tends to correlate with low/no education and poverty
So the vast majority of times (first 3 groups), the usage is perfectly fine, unless the (semi)black person in question is offendable like an Afro-American
You'd have to get extremely unlucky to experience actual racism in Slovenia beyond the retard group mentioned above
Unless you meet a black person who just wants to play a victim, saying black is perfectly fine
I don't listen to any hiphop but when I hear it played, 90% of the time it's nigga this, bitch that, and hoes something else
It's irrelevant if you consider it shitty, it's what's most-played in many places
As for education and poverty, the former generally doesn't correlate with any kind of hiphop and the latter is relative
Still, not considering the context of word usage before getting offended IMO correlates with either low intelligence or ulterior motives
Well that's what I mean
If someone is offended by being called black, they're just playing the victim and oughtta be handled like that
Affirmative action in Russia
Just who do you mean by you
Considering I'm Slovenian
Well, IDK
I was advised by some Russian friends to not necessarily pick SPB as a trip destination because of potential neonazi love for blacks
Mixed info
Most of Slovenians agree that we are Central Europe
We’re culturally and historically very close to Austria as we were part of it for centuries
Ljubljana is also very similar to cities like Graz, Vienna and Prague
Generally we’re the closest to Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and Northern Croatians
* Never part of the east bloc - check
* Higher [iHDI] than many of the old empires - check
* Median person's net [wealth] > $50k - check
*  In the Mediterranean - check
* 1300 years as part of Central European empires - check
I'll go with Central Europe, which coincidentally is what most people in Slovenia also agree on
Most people also don't differentiate between someone from NI, Scotland, Wales, or England and just call everything together "England" and everyone "English". I seem to recall the other 3 "countries" not being huge fans of that
Ask around how many languages in Europe use "England" as shorthand for the UK in colloquial speech
It's by no means just Americans
And in general, calling former USSR colonies "Eastern Europe" is the same as calling the "countries" (regions really) of the UK England
It would be done only by ignorant people, since it makes LESS sense than calling Scotland England
After all, England STILL rules those three "countries" in a large proportion, while Russia has indirect influence at best on "Eastern Europe".
So yeah, whenever you feel the need to say "Eastern Europe" to refer to anyone that's not Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus, keep in mind that you sound about the same as someone seeing a guy in a kilt in Edinburgh and calling him English
Slavic is a linguistic group more so than a cultural one
A random person from west Slovenia has much more in common with Italians than with someone from east Slovenia, for example, and we're tiny
And someone from anywhere in Slovenia has much more in common with someone from anywhere in Austria than with anyone from Russia
If you go by the extent of the differences, then you still have to keep the former Austria-Hungary together
Common sense would already tell you that a millennium in the same entity would have more of an effect than being colonized for 50 years by someone else who just happens to have a related language
Why would language matter in this case
Apart from geographical proximity these countries also share their culture and history
I mean they were part of the same country for centuries, almost a millennium (Czechia and Slovenia were even part of the Holy Roman Empire, moreover, Slovenia was part of the Frankish Empire)
Even though language can be considered a part of the culture, it is one of the very few things that Central European slavic speaking countries share with Eastern Europe
For example, as a Slovene I feel much closer to Austria, Bavaria or any other Alpine  country than Russia, Ukraine or Bulgaria
> I will be sure to ask my Eastern European partner that tomorrow morning, although I already know what the answer will be
So, Duden is a reasonably big thing in Germany when it comes to language
The [entry for England] says under meanings:
1) A part of Great Britain
2) Great Britain (colloquial)
I'd also bet it's reasonably common in Slavic countries (at least in the South Slavic ones)
Not sure about Latin languages
> England does not "rule" the rest of the countries in the UK at all
Just look at the former and the current Socttish referendum movement
I have been looking at it ever since Brexit
They're more ruled by England than Slovenia or Croatia were by Serbia in Yugoslavia
> Yes there are a lot of political shenanigans that aren't ethical or right, but England does not "rule" or "control" the other countries in the Union
We have very different definitions of what it means to rule and control, apparently
> I didn't say that the Baltics were Eastern European due to former USSR rule, that didn't even come into consideration
Russia's previous control had/has no bearing on the general consensus IMO
Russia's previous control is the one "argument" the vast majority of people throws around (even though it's also explicitly wrong for a chunk of what they tend to classify as "Eastern Europe")
Everybody speaks their local dialect/regional language, Slovenian, English and a mix of Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian
People that live close to the border also tend to speak that language, so Italian, German, or Hungarian
And the same goes for e.g. foods - Western Slovenia lives on pasta and olive oil
The East swears by pumpkin seed oil and potatoes
For music, if you don't listen to the lyrics, what's considered the typical Slovenian and Austrian national music is virtually identical
Etc
edit: mixed up east and west - it's late -_-
> I'm pretty sure it's common opinion
Just like NI, Scotland, and Wales are commonly England
I never argued that it's not common opinion that some countries are called EE
I'm arguing that the common opinion is nonsensical at best and racist at worst
> they have distinct words/phrases for the UK and its constituent countries
That was never the argument
Of course they have distinct words/phrases
So do we
Everyone does
Just like English has Central Europe, South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe etc
What I'm saying is that in colloquial usage, people use England and people use Eastern Europe, not that precise words don't exist
> democratically the other British/NI countries are not ruled by England
I was under the impression that devolution means that Westminster yields some of the power to the parliaments of NI, Scotland, and Wales
And IIRC, Westminster recently tried to pass a bill that would remove some of those devolved powers from the parliaments back to itself
Also, AFAIK the NI parliament isn't super functional and thus Westminster effectively runs things, and Wales isn't super devolved in the first place
> in a union someone has to be the strongest member
That's called an Empire then
In a union, ideally everyone would be of equal power
Now that's unfortunately not realistic, but the members of the union should at least treat each other with that kind of respect
The EU tries to do this with the vetos
Scotland and NI combined couldn't veto Brexit
Now, if I ask a bunch of Scottish people, do you think they'd say they feel that England has way too much control over Scotland or that England doesn't have control over Scotland
> another referendum
And this is where you can see who's genuinely in charge
Scotland has to ask England if it may hold a referendum on its own future
That by definition means that England is in charge
When I worked as a special needs assistant the school I worked in had Czech exchange studentS and they had fricking Crocks, sandals and even foam sliders as slippers
It was funny
edit: students not student
When I was in elementary scool you'd be ridiculed if seen in foam sliders
Same as with white socks
I guess that's one of the reasons we call anything unaesthetic 'czech'.
Not just younger, prettier also and better surgeons
I was surprised to see top chefs serving polenta
I remember being a kid and hated when my mom made polenta but now it's apparently a delicacy
Probably [Na Golici] It doesn't have lyrics though
It's a pity you guys aren't more into Auferstanden aus Ruinen
That one is beautiful
Id say: “Slovenija od kod lepote tvoje” cuse of the lyrics
That is an option too
Probably also Kdor ne skače ni Slovenc
Lets keep that one to the sports halls and football fields :D
Normal but not everyday meal
People are more shocked that we eat horses
Not an everyday meat but nothing unusual
We had rabbit quite often growing up but I think most people get it from someone they know, not buy it in a supermarket, at least that's my experience
We always got it from a neighbour at our weekend house
Same with deer and boar meat but I think it's usually eaten in restaurants, not prepared at home as much
No one would bat an eye or be surprised hearing you ate those kinds of meat
yeah and it is extremely good, if you ever come in Slovenia you should try it out :)
>Leberkas
you can prepare it on many different ways, as a steak, pate, "fast food "horseburger"", you can cut it on tiny pieces and fry it otgether with onion
tbh i dont really cook i just like to eat, so i can't tell you all the possible ways it can be done :D
Happy cakeday
Phew, a few more minutes and I'd have missed it

It looks like there's two of them
The Italian one you linked is comming out in 2019
But there's also [Guillermo del Toro] one that's supposedly comming in 2021
Elements like W for volfram, K for kalij, Na for natrij make more sense, but then O for kisik, C for ogljik and N for dušik make less sense
A rule of thumb is that more recently discovered elements are more likely to make sense, while older don't.
I will cheer for Finland, Croatia, Austria and Germany
You have Europe's support, Scotland
Good luck
"Are you having a boy or an abortion
So true
If you go to a kebab(döner) place
And you order without onions does the guy ask you if you are gonna kiss anyone
Here this is very common
I think this is exclusively a Slovenian thing
Still, the weirdest such exchange I had was at a horseburger place in Ljubljana (Trubarjeva, where Šeherezada is now) that tops all the kebab conversations:
Us: *order*
Dude: *takes order*
Dude: *leans on counter* "What's up, do you fuck
" ("Kvaj zj, a kej fukate
" for Slovenian Redditors)
Friend: "That's why we went to eat, to have strength for the evening
Dude: "Fuck that, you're gonna vomit all over her
I miss that place
hje hje hje a se boš ljupčkov
A se bos lubckou a?
Well that's a šiptar for you
Anything for a kebab tbh
When I was in Celje, they used to talk to us like that as well
And of course, the onions and kissing exchange was always on the menu too
Nah if you want something with yogurt just order burek
Lowkey homo
Probably because of kebab
You kissin anyone later
You definitely have to try it with ćevapi or any other kind of grilled meat
Geography mostly
Ljubljana is at the centre and all the roads and railways meet there
Plus, when Trieste (where most of slovene speaking burgeoasie lived) went to Italy, Ljubljana's status was undisputed
We say: "boli me kurac", which means: "my dick hurts".
I love the circus/monkey expression
I'm surprised how often this is used

Some personal choices:
- A Minuet for Guitar
War novel
Personally, I think it's even better than All Quiet on the Western Front or For whom the bell tolls; if you're into that
A movie was based upon [it]
- A Game with the Devil's Tail: Almost mundane stuff about married life
Think Charles Bukowski
Hilarious but tragic at the same time
- Mountain without Prometheus: Prison, crime novel
Think Oz or maybe The Wire

Exactly, we only deposed Khaddafi because a lot of countries owed him money for oil, and making him a tiran was the easiest way to justify it
We have that too
For singular you you have:
* informal 'ti'
* formal 'Vi' (same as informal for more or equal to three people)
* super formal 'Oni' in which you talk to the person in front of you in the same way you would talk formally about about a person who isn't there physically
The last one used to be used when talking to parents or grandparents up to 1940 and is still taught in schools but only because it's in the grammar
As an European, I don't mind too much
Besides, that just brings room for alternatives to crop up, making it a healthier market

Despite knowing that structures can be reconstructed and rebuilt, this is still loosing a precious piece of history
Seeing this has made me incredibly sad
Its lucky that they removed pictures and all before renovation and that 3/4 of the building is made out of stone
Still really sad it came to this
it survived so many changes and wars yet renovation destoryed it
I wonder what will they say
What started it
Was it Shrek
It's made out of stone and restoration is a thing

The solution is obvious and simple
Three referendums
First referendum: "Do you want to have another referendum about UK leaving EU
" If no -> no deal Brexit
If yes -> continue to 2nd referendum
Second referendum: "What should the question on the referendum be
" Voters should then write or draw the answers, or questions rather
After the answer (question) is known, proceed to the
...Third referendum: Question above

Cries in Slovenian
Why would you remove Slovenia from good results
> we remove Slovenia
reeeeeeee
Ah yes because Slavs = shit lifestyle and poverty
Definitely hasn't gotten to do with corruption and politics
It's the genetics
All I know is that weed is dirt cheap
And the ice cream is rumored to be legendary
Yeah, I think we're usually quite on par with most of the countries that should stay in the 'good results' bit per OP's rearrangement
But we're also Slavic, so we get -2 points for being 'Eastern Europe'.
It really depends on the metric
If it's things like safety and suitability for children, we're on par with Scandinavia
If it's anything regarding money, we're at least two shades redder than them
If you can pronounce Ljubljana, we'll forgive you

They're not the same person
They don't speak the same language

According to the internet, i have feeling that half of the world had their first day of snow today

What an irony
Same in our neck of the woods, smooth-brains are convinced that we would surely be the exception in their eradication plans and that his praise was not at all a strategy to pacify locals into not joining local resistance groups
Since we know the Nazis would never go back on their word
Lol
Based and blackpilled
they were an exception when the Nazis needed collaborators
they would have probably received the great honor of being among the last Slavs to be gassed, had history turned otherwise
but hey, at least they defended their country against communists /s
I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, sounds like a great film
A lot of pundits have said the same thing
We are living in an age of loneliness, especially impacting young boys/men
They often find solace and male camaraderie lacking in their daily lives in online communities where they can quickly get radicalized
The content on YouTube even has this intimate, domestic setting with streamers: "instead of hanging out in person, here is my friend Ted on YT reading me an FBI crime statistics report proving blacks are inferior to me".
It's the anxiety, frustration, lack of opportunities and defeatist attitude that pushes them into these radical beliefs, inceldom or similar and all as a result of the way modernization changed human interaction for the worse
Haha, my old part-time job we had a semi-ironic nazi and weapons collector who was the butt-end of the jokes most of the time, he surprisingly laughed with us most of the time
I still remember that I almost died laughing when my boss told him one day: "If wehrmacht had people like you leading, the only way they'd reach Istanbul would be with the index finger on the map
" Sounds less funny when translated, but the whole crew was cry-laughing
Imagine how liberating it must feel to have a pearly pebble rolling around your skull, never doubting your reptilian instincts for a microsecond
All you need to do is move towards where you are pointed at
Brilliant
Where are your slutty posts, liar
there’s a great article from Francis Fukuyama on identity politics on the left, but I think the logic applies to the political right as well
he argues that western liberalism, by explicitly abstaining from prescribing you any sort of meta narrative, is essentially leaving a huge emotional void in people’s lives
this void used to be filled by religions and empires
today, those are largely or completely absent in the West
that makes many people desperate for a higher purpose
for individuals who are for any reason unwilling or uncapable of reflection and critical thinking, and perhaps unsatisfied with their own place in society, this mix of circumstances makes them very susceptible to ideologies such as nationalism, racism etc
now again, he talks about the left, but I think the parallels are obvious
the article was published on American purpose
edit: grammar
I wholeheartedly agree and I'd also like to add that neoliberalism and austerity measures (trickle-down economics, anyone
) have effectively worsened working class welfare for decades now in the developed world, where small communities were nuked from the orbit with trade deals that exported all major industries to the global south or China
It's pretty easy to see who profited from these policies
On a global scale the same system failed spectacularly in addressing climate change, causing human-driven global extinction event, climate refugees and more
These facts and the terrible and corrupt governance is what causes populism to rise and extremism to thrive
yup
austerity basicly tells you that you’re alone and can fuck off and die
if resources are limited and essentially a zero-sum game, everyone’s an enemy
good luck telling the rabid we can grow the pie if we continue to collaborate
this ideology of austerity goes against so many economic lessons from the 20th century: that you need a strong demand for economic growth; that you need a big middle class to drive that; that infrastucture, public healthcare and school system, and social security create opportunities which in turn create wealth and well-being which in turn strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law; that for that, you need high and progressive taxes, etc
so many lessons which led to the best world we’ve ever seen willfully ignored that it’s hard to believe this destabilisation of democracies accross the western world was a bug rather than a feature
Agree but some countries have really bad train tracks and connections
A carbon tax would do a good job of accomplishing that
In Slovenia we need 30 years to agree where the trains should go
To actually build the tracks, it will take another 100 years
At that time we will not need trains anymore, probably
&#x200B;
We still have the tracks build from Austro-Hungarian times without much improvements
And who pays for it
Should the cost be placed upon everyone or like it is now onto those that use the train
We will all be able to travel for free across EU very soon :)
WW3 is coming anyways :(

That's english's thing
Listen, I would imagine it was very difficult to have a legal abortion in Poland even before this, so I assume the vast majority of abortions are illegal or made out of country, which means this doesn't really change much
Apparently there were 1110 legal abortions in Poland in 2019
The context is entirely lacking here
People are posting statistics like "50% want to keep abortion as it is, only 15% want stricter regulations". That seems to me to mean, that 2/3 of the population do not want to have more loose regulations regarding abortion
Seems to me like a clear majority
Reddit is being incredibly reactionary again
Not to start "who has it worst" contest but I think Malta is stricter

This is after he was the first one to congratulate Trump on his victory 3 days ago
The only thing that sunk Trump was his Covid response and even that just barely
Let that sink in, without it enough Americans would think he is doing a bang up job
When Bush the younger was elected Americans kept saying how he was a fluke
When he was reelected it was because you don't change presidents during war
When Trump was elected it started to look less of an aberration than actual representation of values of big segment of US voters
As a born American citizen and a somewhat recent Slovenian citizen through my family, Jansa can fuck the right off
You're either extremely gullable, or extremely misinformed on who biden is
He is a right-wing politician who agrees with most of the views Trump had, even though they were extreme by EU (and Slovenian) standards
The voting base is also quite similar in demographics
Luckily even other party leaders from his coalition congratulated Biden and accepted the results
To be honest, I am sometimes relieved that almost nobody outside of Slovenia speaks Slovene, as our politics are sometimes even on a lower level than those in the US
Don’t get me started on the social media comments, those are even more batshit crazy
Distraction
Government fucked up response to second Covid wave, deaths are climbing, government is replacing people in all sorts of services and governmental bodies
Best to throw people a bone to pick and have them outraged over this then over other stuff
That's what we keep asking ourselves every day
So sorry, Europe
He knows not what he does, the Twitto
He, his ministers, a lot of prominent party members, and a few rich hungarians are majority shareholders in right-wing media houses like Demokracija and Nova24
It's in his political and economic interest to propagate his own media
Don't blame us
We didn't vote for this asshole
He has a hardcore support group and his party receives a certain percentage of votes on every election but it hasn't been enough to form a government in a while, however he got his break when the previous PM stepped down in a dumb headed attempt to win more seats in an election but instead, the president gave Janša an option to run for the position and all the wishy washy selfish centre/centre-right parties formed a coalition with the right wing SDS party (which Janša is the leader of) and formed the shittest government in our history
They all talked about how it's on thin ice and they have values and standards and demands, and of course Janša has broken all of them and yet not a single party has left the coalition (which would be enough to dissolve the government) since they're all too pussy to do it and lose their comfy government positions
>One of the first reforms in order is getting rid of the EC:
LMAO
Last two republican presidents won 2/3rs of their terms and what did Democrats do about it
Fuck all, that's what
Only change in past 20 years was that one of states decided to split their EV according to popular vote in their state
Fact is EC suits both parties because it creates safe red and blue states both parties can ignore because they are foregone conclusion and so both can focus on couple of swing states
Both ignore Texas and California because they know how they'll vote
Both ignore smaller states because victory is not worth the effort (and expense)
Which is why complaints about EC quieted soon after elections
Slovenian son-in-law
The real big brain move is always in the comments
Why
Well yeah Biden's not exactly a saint by any measure but definitely the lesser evil of the two
Be it casual racism, warmongering or whatever, but if you guys hate him then it's a plus for that in my book
What's wrong is that he congratulated Trump on Wednesday, when there were no official results whatsoever
It just makes him look like a hypocrite that sticks his nose in other countries' elections
Please support them
It's a tough time for us right now
Well, Slovenia is actually a Central European country
But in general, yes, we are doing better than other ex Yugoslavia countries
We had some scandals, but they were contained inside the country
But that was before Twitter, the go-to platform for every right wing politician
You're more right (no pun intended) than you know
But he's also not a stranger to corruption and other shady deals
From what I can gather after multiple visit to Serbia and knowing lots of Serbian, the thing you hate usually are the good things that happen for everybody else
So I'm in peace with that fact
It was horrible, but the alternative to that would be much much worse
And the fact that all Serbia politics do are blaming every other foreign nations on how shitty they run their country is also pathetic
Wtf its been 5 years already ?
Until the russian army steps in
Maybe we're seeing start to another civil war in Europe

It's a shame, because Norilsk is a pretty interesting city, and there's a bunch of really interesting articles out there that look past the clickbait-y garbage, and talk about how the city population crashed in post-Soviet towns, why it's growing again, and how people there actually live
Americans be like: "We don't care"
..and our stupid government is in cahoots with PL and HU
Lovely
Not to mention our PM is the only one (!) that congratulated Trump on 2020 victory
(Yeah, I know he didn't win
Abolish electoral college and then it will be much better
Also: how far to the right a country is
the result are exactly what you’d expect: Poland, Hungary far ahead (or maybe behind is a better word)
So happy Slovenia didn't make it to the list
Thank you

We'd have flying cars and useful cold fusion by now, if we did that :D
Its funny cuz its true
If all the lines of "jebem ti mater", "pička ti materina" and "nabijem te na kurac" in comments sections were lines of code instead, Balkan would be an IT superpower xD

I'm from Slovenia (actually near the border) and Zagreb is a 100 km drive from here
I was still asleep, but this woke me up
At first, I thought neighbors were doing some work outside and using some heavy machinery (as they have been for the past couple days)

Was up like 15min before it happened because my cat woke me up to feed him
I went back to bed and didn't feel a thing  friends told me it woke them up, that their furniture was trembling etc
Holy shit, I was awake on the computer and thought I was dying of a heart attack or something
I've never felt an earthquake that was this strong
I talked with a friend and his grandma started packing up and leaving as soon as it started
and meanwhile my flatmate thought her cats were playing with the closets
Just felt another aftershock, wtf
Woke me up and spooked the shit out of me

There are two kind of countries in the world: those that use the metric system, and those that peaked in 1969

We call this a "krof" in Slovenia, but the word "paczek" amuses me much more

We calls those korfi in Slovenia
You'll find the best ones in Trojane
Here in Slovenia we call these krofi, so I suppose we got the word from you guys then
We also apparently kept the hard k, unlike how we turned "Kirche" into "cerkev".

My fellow Slovenes, plz
it's not THAT bad, is it guys
I guess we just need to go to Portugal then
I guess I wanna die
Oh no Slovenia, oh no
How do I die
Nice
How do i die
Am, Slovene, can confirm
Im kinda sad and not really surprised about slovenia
In short, Slovenia was the shit back in the Yugoslav days, but we can hardly compete with the rest of western Europe
Also, a general disappointment with independence, I think
Slovenes actually had some semblance of unity in Yugoslavia and Austria-Hungary before that

In Ljubljana, Slovenia, the city center is closing for cars, but there are new big parking lots outside of the center, right next to the highway exits, where you can take a bus or rent a bike
Also, new undergound garages were and will be build near city center

Bees and Butterflies are definitely important for our produce, but not all crops are insect pollinated
Corn, Beets, and Spinach are all wind fertilizing for example
Additionally many plants that are somewhat insect fertilizing can also self-fertilize
this includes tomatoes, legumes and peppers

We had that on [May 20th]

My dad NEEEEEEDED a fucking hose for 10€ from Lidl
I told my mum I'm not going outside just for a fucking hose and she said that if I'm not going, she is
My dad has a chronic illness and I don't want my mum to be bringing viruses to him, so naturally I got dressed and went to buy a damn hose
I doused it with disinfectant before leaving it infront of their house

Perhaps I favour Russia because my country has no bad blood with them, or I'm still clinging to the old 19th century idea of Pan-Slavism, but I'd sooner appease Russia, which is basically in our backyard, than continue this unhealthy relationship with the USA

I'm Slovenian and I can confirm that this representation of us is 100% accurate
Lmao we just playing our folk music in the background
We are not and don’t want to be
Can confirm, I don't understand a single word of Polish
Slovenian is unintelligible to Slovenians
If we talk in dialects at least
In language we are unique among Slavs with similarities in both south and slightly less west Slavic languages
Another problem with language is Germanic and Romance influence
When I came to Slovakia, I could understand most of what was written or what the people were saying
In Czechia a little less so
"Politicians not as curruopt"
We are getting there with Janša as PM, ok
>  It's another thing their politicians aren't as corruput as ours and that they prospered in the last 30 years
Hey, our politicians are also very corrupt
You are both kinda right
slovenes are like 30% west and 70%  south
Source: studying the early middle ages, slavic migration and shit like that
Edit: grammar
Well Slovenia is on the border between [Central Europe and Balkan] and even though the majority of geographical land stays in central Europe we are still mixed into Balkan and that's the main problem why people dispute about it
From the recent history, you can easily say we are part of Balkan but that only goes for 100 years or our nation's existence while through most of the history of Europe we were always part of either the [Austria-Hungary] or [Holy roman empire] and the first kingdom that people who migrated and that lived here were part [Samo's Kingdom] Not to mention a lot of german writing which describes us as [Wenden] which means "western Slavs" or Slavs that lived near german settlements
And that Balkan comes from Ottoman times because the ottomans gave the land of south-east Europe when they had it under control the name [Balkan] which in Turkish means "[mountain chain] (if I'm not mistaken) and we were never part of the [Ottoman empire] So I would always rather say we are part of central Europe than Balkan even though some will say language or last 100 years makes us a Balkan nation but that is more or less a political view which is a popular but not always the right view anyway
What if I told you Croatian and Slovenian are also pretty dissimilar and it's sometimes hard to understand that too
Yeah, but if something is more similar to A than to B, couldn't an argument be made that it should be classified as A instead of B?
Yes, you are right about it
I think there's been a misunderstanding
You are right that linguistically, slovenes belong to the South Slavic group
But culturally, they have much more in common with central europe, akin to other West Slavic nations
Is it because of the German influence
Yes
But that doesn't somehow nullify their entire culture
Good
Maybe they should consider a blanket ban on social credit scores and more substantial regulation of mass surveillance

Eh, I feel that that one is true, but it's mostly because it's americans that are popularizing it, because they have a huge history of Italian migration, and because of their status as a cultural hegemon
So it's more like that the American version of Italian cuisine is popular

In Slovenia it's the same under a different name except it bans the right to adopt or for lesbian couples to get medical insemination
In many other countries there are even more rights "regular" marriage gives couples that aren't given to people in "special partnerships". From 2006-2016 in Slovenia before big reforms were made there were a bunch of stupid and glaringly discriminatory elements
Like straight couples could get married anywhere (hotel venues, parks, castles) with an official present while gay couples could only get "same-sex registered" at small dingy local administration offices
There were even more problematic sections that didn't allow for automatic hospital visits etc
The law was so worthless that in those 10 years only something like 60 couples actually made use of it
You won't be surprised to find out the 2006 law was written under a SDS/Janša government because of EU pressure to improve gay rights and they deliberately made it as bad as possible
I imagine this was the case in many other countries and that most of those laws written in the mid 00s are still standing

Let no one say Europe and the USA don't perfectly complement each other
lol Slovenia, nothing changed in 18 years and we keep promoting our country as green, just sad
Croatia is definetely wrong since it shares the nuclear powerplant with slovenia
Also the Slovenian nuclear portion is most likely overinflated then
Hydroelectric shouldn't be considered "renewable". It's really destructive to environment
if only radioactive waste would also be split in two
Only a few regions are windy enough for wind turbines to be efficient, and even then this is such a small contribution that wouldn't really help much
Well similar with solar, maybe there are more places for solar but  the output would negligible
It is quite complicated
Well yeah, but it's not "green" as in environment friendly
Also AFAIK there were some studies that show, that dams don't only affect micro climate, but also on the wider scale, so they're not reducing the green-house gasses
But I might be wrong, or I've interpreted things in a wrong way
seriously
No offence, but that is not really good argument
You can't pay for bread with hypothetical money
why a problem
If you have a 50% stake in a company then have a 50% percent in its expenses or in this case, radioactive waste
Vem, ampak ne obstajata samo Zagreb in Ljubljana
Potem bi morali plačevati tudi Bulgarom, Srbom, Romunom, če upoštevamo vetrove
Ali pa jim subvencionirati njihovo električno omrežje, glede na našo grožnjo
Sicer sem bral, da bo hrvaški delež odkupljen s strani francozov ter, da so se dogovorili za skladiščenje radioloških odpadkov v Krškem in sicer do datuma prenehanja obratovanja elektrarne ( mislim, da 2043 )
Tako, da bodo tile odpadki še 20 let 100% v naši lasti
Če si 50/50 lastnik plačuješ vse pol pol
Tudi skladiščiš odpadke
Common sense
which was only agreed upon in 2016 I think
Like one said Croatia low and midtier til 2023 and high tier when decomissioned
Lovely fact is that the plant is operational since 1983
How much nuclear waste from 1983 till 2016 was taken by Croatia
Also when the plant shuts down 24-25 years from now, who is to say that they Will change their mind
Nothing against Croatia but is unfair having a 50% stake and have nothing but gains
free energy so to speak
A comparison between the UK and the US would be nice
Italian cuisine is not healthy in the sense that a nutritionist would prescribe it as the optimal diet
It's healthy, because it's balanced, with a high emphasis on fresh, non processed ingredients, lots of vegetables, healthy fats and seafood
And most importantly, Italians in general seem not to overindulge in the unhealthy stuff and value quality over quantity
In my opinion, Italian cuisine is overdone outside Italy and nearby influenced regions
Giant portions of pasta with very fatty sauces, an entire pizza, worth 2000+ calories and many other examples that have mostly been popularized by "Italian" Americans
Deep fried "mozzarella" sticks are not really Italian food
Cheese stuffed pizza crust isn't either
And this is clear from Italy's obesity rate and life expectancy
EDIT: LPT: If you're searching for restaurant reviews online as a tourist, sorting by language and selecting Italian is generally the way to go -- Italians know good food
Well, umm, yeah

We also have something very similar in Slovenia
It’s called Wild Lake (Divje jezero) and it is about 160 meters deep
It's also a source of the Jezernica River, which is the shortest river in Slovenia (55 meters)

I'm very pacifistic but I'm not naive
Since NATO was basically formed to oppose the Soviet Union, which disbanded over 17 years ago, its a bit puzzling why it has only expanded since
They're the only credible positive version of the future that I've seen proposed
There's absolutely a lot of negative versions which might win out instead
I know you guys basically first experimented with democracy, but let's not forget how that experiment ended
It was not the Delian League that won the Peloponnesian War, but the Peloponnesian League, with support from the Persians
We certainly need allies, we can't exactly defend ourselves alone
But as Melania's husband showed us recently, NATO isn't exactly a stable alliance anymore
Honestly, I'd prefer a nice regional alliance over NATO
Out interests aren't the same as the USA's, or Turkey's, or the UK's, and I wouldn't want us to be dragged into another war just because someone went and poked the bear
Oh I agree, I would love that
Unfortunately until we have that option we should stay in NATO

I'm sure this will be part of any deal US and post brexit UK will sign
I'm pretty sure EU food safety regulations don't allow chemically washed chicken or other meat
The problem is not chlorine itself, that gets washed out before you eat it
The problem is that washing it in chlorine, or any other acid really, allows much worse farm conditions
Also it kills bacteria in the meat, but doesn't remove existing products of said bacteria, which can be toxic
Depends on price
And whether business that sell food will use and whether they'll be forced to disclose that
And of course price of such food
I suspect a lot of health, safety and workers protection regulations will change
With party that blamed EU for all sorts of problems and complained about excessive regulations and made that one of reasons for Brexit in power
Not likely

you mind giving some snow to Slovenia  i’m sick of 10* + weather
All has an end, even our heroes
Lots and lots of respect for this man, may he rest in peace
We have this in some stores in Slovenia as well
It's reuse bottles for same type of shampoo, but maybe it will spread
I remember that something like 30 years ago there were stores where you could buy liquid detergent and softener this way, you came there with your own bottle and they poured predetermined amount into it
It was discontinued because it was old fashioned
USA is in 45th place
and they always praise their country as the only freedom land, pathetic
Even here we can't get rid of Slovakia
Slovenia'a press freedom is going down since Janez Janša is prime president
What's the deal with Singapore
Considering it's often painted as quite a progressive country, it's pretty shocking to see them just barely ahead of the likes of Iraq, Somalia and Libya
I am pretty sure that kind of porn is illegal in the UK
There is not enough flats in Slovenia or they are expensive as fu\*k for young people
I also stayed away from parents for 4 years when I was studying
In a student home but I would never call that a home or moving away from parents
Well well well, don't I feel vindicated
65 down-votes and counting over my defending Russia being called a "terrorist state" in yesterday's thread about this supposed assassination
I think there must be something really wrong with you to do something like that to your wife (if she really didn't know)
Is that some kind of a proverb
It doesn't make any sense to me
The mental gymnastics going on in your comment is amazing
From my understanding, it was Russian-backed and directed revolutionaries that shot down a civilian airliner due to some sort of mix-up
Still, this whole situation with the journalist seems too suspicious
Was this a failed attempt by Russian-contracted Ukrainian veterans to murder a Russian journalist
Possibly
Was the whole thing falsified to further harm Russia's standing
Also Possible
I'm not denying Russia does some shady shit, I'm just saying they aren't that much worse than our "allies" to the west
True, the Slovenian army is incapable of defending the country, even our own airspace is guarded by Hungary
Still, Slovenia is one of the few EU member states that is willing to be cordial with Putin's Russia it seems, it does certainly help that we've had very, very limited contact with Russia throughout history
Here is how I see things: Russia not only is a super power (terrorist state or otherwise), but is the one super power in our backyard
Fear of Russia may be the one thing keeping NATO and the EU together in the future and as soon as the discontent of its members is greater than that fear, then the whole thing comes tumbling down
The state we are currently in, supposedly as bad as the height of the cold war, is in no way entirely the fault of Putin's Russia
It takes two to tango
And as far as the situation in eastern Ukraine is concerned, the Russians are protecting their interests after the revolution backed by our so-called allies, protecting minorities and the like
Sure, Russian troops are there, but they certainly aren't the only ones fighting
You guys have legitimate grievances with Russia, I'm not denying that
But considering the situation the revolution put Russia into, this was the only possible outcome
Hungary's finally happy I guess
Now we are ner France and uk now
Hell yeah
At least we got a longer coastline now
And we appear to be in the vanguard
Thankfully the Germans moved away
Even now that they dont have your 17th state
Bruh you guys aren't even in the WTO, how crazy is that
Wonna trigger turks and armenians
Because thats how you trigger turks and armenians
Oh no
I've said it before and I'll say it again, Garda lake is one of the most underrated places in Europe
It's like Como, but much less expensive, and in my opinion a lot more charming

Dunno, I've been  there during high season, and it still seemed pretty empty compared to other touristy spots in the area
Western Slovenia stronk
What the hell
West europeans say, slovenia is part of the balkan, while balkan people say we are european
I dobt think a map was ever as accurate as this one
Less developed part of Slovenia reporting in
\*happily looking at map to find Maribor under developed regions\*
&#x200B;
JAZZ MUSIC STOPS
This map feels off, though
I'd put eastern side as transitional region, there's no way it's on same level as freaking entire Bulgaria
I live in the east, it never feels like west is that much better when I visit
Maybe the border regions are pulling the rest of us down
I feel like Savinjska is pretty well developed
Absolutely agree
The industry
On the west is more likely high-tech, service-based and export oriented
While on the east, agricultural, manufacture and labor intensive
But, correct me if I'm wrong
One factor to consider: Commuters to Ljubljana count as residents of the east but contribute to the GDP of the west
Half of Notranjska and practically the whole of Zasavje are within Ljubljana’s commuter belt
Podravje is 4th out of 12 regions by GDP per capita
From the bottom
They butchered our beautiful city
Developed in consideration of all the countries in the world
This map shows development compared to other EU countries
Could be, yes
East is definitely more suitable for agriculture
Although Novo Mesto and Kočevje are in the red here
They should be pulling us up
I hope Celje starts growing again
No idea about Maribor, it's a failed town
Why is Notranjska less developed
I don't know much about that region at all
They would have made Ljubljana a seperate region, like other countries do with their capitals, if that played any part
You also forgot Krško with our only nuclear power plant, Gen I and others
I could be mistaken, but Posavje is one of the most important arteries of the Slovenian power infrastructure
I don't understand why it would be considered under developed
By gdp per capita it went like this in 2018:
Osrednje slovenska
Obalno-kraška
Jugovzhodna Slovenija
Savinjska
Goriška
Gorenjska
Posavska
Koroška
Podravska
Primorsko-notranjska
Pomurska
Zasavska
Sometimes when I drive around the country, I really wonder where people in some more remote regions work
Like fucking Baška grapa
It felt like eternity to drive through and roads were super narrow
But all the houses were nice and all was beautiful
Same in many other places
Higher up the hill, more remote, nicer the houses
We have 2 cohesion regions
only Croatia and Blatics have 1
The point is, western region is probably not blue because it has Ljubljana
They would have made Ljubljana a separate region if that would mean more money
Interesting, is this from surs
I'd like to further research this
Yep
stat
Bruto domači proizvod na prebivalca (EUR), statistične regije, Slovenija, letno
I don't know, I'm under impression countries decide these regions by themselves
I read an article pointing to this same issue, how countries manipulate their regions to get the most money possible
This isn't that accurate
There are many missing, for sure
Just in Slovenia we have 16 Roman settlements and towns, while only one (Emona, present day Ljubljana)  is listed on this map
The missing ones are: Ad Malum/Ad Pirum, Aegida - Capris, Atrans, **Carnium**, Colatio, Castrum ad Fluvium Frigidum, **Celeia**, Longaticum, Metulum, **Nauportus**, Neviodunum, **Peotovio**, Praetorium Latobicorum, Pyrrhanum, Romula
*Perhaps you could argue that some cities were founded as "an order" from the empire as military settlements, while others sprung up spontaneously as civilian cities*, but that's not clarified in the case of this map :)
Missing Petovio and Celeia in Slovenia
In Slovenia I think there are far more than just Ljubljana
It's also missing a bunch of cities
I can tell you about 5 that are missing in Slovenia, off the top of my head
Depends on how you define a city
It would be perfectly reasonable to call all cities in Slovenia except for Ljubljana towns
Also, this map is about cities that were *founded* by the Romans
Celje, for example, already existed before the Romans took it over
But I'm sure that some of the dots on this map represent cities that are also small or were not actually founded by the Romans
Are they all so chill there
Apparently socks and sandals are the new hipster thing
Seriously
just no
TIL the colours of German and Belgian flags actually aren't in the same order
Never noticed it before
I guess I'm dumb
Its going to be trash
YUROP STRONG
We have a yearly [March along barbed wire] to celebrate liberation of Ljubljana
It goes along where Italians set up a [barbed wire] during WW2 when they occupied the city
Am I missing something
Looking out of my window in Slovenia and there isn't even 1cm of snow
At least you seem to be having fun with yours though
In Ljubljana, we have about half a bottle of snow
Yeah man i wish it was 4m of snow here
We do not have 4m of snow in Slovenia
Wow thanks, that's clever actually
1 room for pre WW2 era and couple of rooms for WW2 era so nobody can say they completely ignore them
Yeah but you have to consider that's *on top* off all the nations' own bureaucracies
I see he's taking a picture with a group of Portu-gals
The entire world population at the time is estimated to be around 5 million people
I wonder how many lived in Europe
You don't know that
Have you been there
Having family from Belgrade Serbia and Sarajevo and Tuzla in Bosnia, reading threads like this is really hard
First using the term 'Serbia' and not the 'Serb government and/or military of the 90s' is actually branding the whole nation as killers and terrorists
Drawing comparison to ISIS is especially distrurbing and sick, especially if you consider that 99% of the people didn't know what was happening on the front lines, as each republic was spewing hate and concealing all information which would tell its citizens what's actually happening
It was always the other sides fault
Slovenians caused the breakup if you ask Serbs
Croatians conned Slovenians into a referendum if you ask Slovenians
Croatians were mass murderers (due to ndh) and wanted to kill all in Knin just because they're Serbs
Muslims and Croatians are ganging up on Serb minority in Bosnia and we have to defend them
Slovenians were embargoed by Serbs just out of spite (according to Slovenia) and had to leave the federation or they'd starve to death
The list of BS goes on and on, and normal citizens didn't have a clue what's actually happening
Most people to this day don't know what happened
All 3 government sides in the war benefited hugely from prolonging the war, and was disregarding any human casualties or impacts as long as it helped their interest
I know objectivity is almost impossible in threads like this but some people really need to think before they post
And the fact that so many people here are explaining historical events with such authority and are rewriting half of it is a darn shame
Especially as Europeans with no knowledge of the Balkans wars take these things as hard facts
As the title says
Never forget
Edit: formatting
Because it happened 20 years ago
A portion of people just as a portion of Croats support Gotovina and a portion of Bosnians are totally fine with mudjahedins and Wahhabis fighting and supporting their cause
But that sure won't keep you from talking further nonsense
>Which 3 sides
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia
First of all, I think you can't put Bosnia in there because I doubt there wasuxh profit from us, considering that Serbia was much better equipped than us
I also don't think that Croatia or Slovenia would profit from prolonging the war (perhaps attempting to gain more land
), but I don't know much about that, there are probably some Croats or Slovenians here to comment on that
Serbia also didn't profit from having 3 wars simultaneously, but it was in their interest to keep Yugoslavia together and stop the republics from gaining independence
Again missing the point
The profit and interest was with individuals running the countries and not countries in general
And yes Izedbegovic had a massive interest as his rise to power was done by using the war to make the running president seen incompetent, and Alija's second term was forced in a similar way as Bush Jr
, which was telling people that no matter how bad of a president he was, it would be a disaster for the security of the country if the president is changed in the middle of the conflict
Believe it or not, he could have ended the war before his second term was up, but he would have lost the position if he would
So he decided to screw the country for his benefit
And Ahtisati and other EU big boys supported Alija in his plans as they knew how to work with him, and any new person is a potential risk
yes loads of bad and sick interests on all sides and absolutely no regards for human lives, even their own countryman
Similarly bad was Milosevic excuse to defend Serbs in Republica Srbska in Bosnia, but when he realised they don't care for him, that they have their local politicians and aligences, Slobo pulled all support and let them rot
He would have lost his majority if Republica Srpska would have joined Srbija
Politics are nasty business and anyone that thinks any of the leaders cared for the people is insane, and any of the generals were not looting and murdering phycopaths is delusional
Slobo didn't care about Yugoslavia, Alija didn't care about BiH, Kucan didn't care about Slovenia, and Tudjman about Croatia
They all wanted all the power for themselves and being in a federation is the opposite of that
They all wanted to control everything they could
Please tell me how our students in highschool learn about independance war
Plot twist: they don't.
At least we weren't. Probably because main actors are still alive and beeing part of politics

I might have been cca 5 years old, but I still remember how this went down here (in Slovenia)
People of Catalonia: don't forget that there are others who support your fight for independence and remain strong
People also thought that Slovenia and Croatia will never become recognised and that Yugoslavia will just fix its problems, well that never happened
Same goes for Spain
Also a country that has a suppression of regions written in its constitution shouldn't be considered democratic at all
If supposedly totalitarian Yugoslavia had in its constitution the right for nation to self-determine, then Spain is truly a totalitarian state who never dealt with its fascist roots
I support this 100%
The Spanish, the Catalans or both

u/a-soul-in-tension can you please the provide the source for book sales though
I tried to find the numbers in the [document that is supposed to contain the source data] but sadly my rudimentary knowledge of Turkish and google translate have not been enough
Maybe some Turk can help here
However, I *have* thrown together a rudimentary [comparison of % of 'No' votes and number of books read per person in region in Turkey] and I see no significant correlation to confirm this hurr-durr-stupid-people-are-stupid circlejerk going on is at all justified
Again though, I might have misread the data ... but see for yourself
Sorry, I don't think OP's map has much to do with anything
Likewise
I'm not saying the connection isn't likely, but it should be compared with book sales per capita per region
Edit: and obviously not treated as some kind of first-past-the-post system
*I see a red-blue map and I want it painted purple*
Edit 2: and the percentage of books sold, while at first it appears to indicate education levels, probably has more to do with wealth
of books read per year per person would be a much better indicator, imo
Thanks
Time to brush up my türkçe :D
Edit: Sorry, but, I don't see any data on book sales or anything like that, just reading habits and library membership
And this data doesn't seem to corroborate the posted map ( [see my other comment] )
I think I'll take the map with a metric ton of salt

> Article 5 is only for defensive wars
On paper only
Yugoslavia, Libya are both NATO wars
Turkey was also invading Syria when it shot down Russian plane and NATO stood by Turkey
Who cares whats written on toilet paper
NATO went to war because France got a small dick complex and wanted "military glory". And Libyan gold
NATO wages wars when important countries order it
Articles are there for gullible fools so they can lie to themselves how its defensive alliance only
Libya literally was NATO war under NATO command
Syria is war with NATO members and their bff's like KSA
You misunderstood me
Im not arguing about invoking article 5, im arguing about NATO being defensive in nature - as stated by its articles
NATO does attack countries, even as an entity, not only its members
Articles are there so in case someone dares to actually hit back as in counter invade
Libya was prime example were they didnt even need to counter invade, it was enough for France to fail to topple Gadafi on their own
All of NATO was not involved because it simply wasnt needed
Same as Armenia not invoking CSTO because they dont see the need for it yet
If Armenia invokes CSTO and Russia sees a need to pacify Turkey, in order to defend its ally, you can bet your burger ass that NATO will be mobilised to defend them
NATO already sent SAMs to Turkey when Turkey was attacking Syria
When Turkey shot down Russian plane, that was attacking Turkish headcutters, NATO publicly declared they stand behind Turkey
So you already have an actual precedent of that happening
Yes, the important countries made a decision and others followed

As a slovene boi, Im excited about being in the same region as Trieste(Trst)
Do ypu guys think there are regions in Europes future or will we remain as countries
Croatia can finally into West
No, Slovenia is both beer and wine
Yes, Slovenia is a central power
But eg
Slavic Europe is no better at describing things than Central Europe
Okay, the language has similar roots, but the culture
It really isn’t that similar
Slovenia is Central European
Yes, we are Slavic, but culturally we are much closer to Austria and other Central European countries
>But I don't think eastern European is an insult
Not an insult, but definitely derogatory on an international level
If it weren't, then there wouldn't be such a big deal about it
>Despite the mental gymnastics some of these maps do to not call some countries eastern, I've never been ashamed to call myself an eastern European
It's mainly a geographical term
There are 4 types of Eastern Europe; political, cultural, religious, and geographical, in decreasing order of usage
-Political Eastern Europe is East of the Iron Curtain, or everything that was under the Soviets
-Cultural Eastern Europe is mostly similar to political EE, it being Slavic countries
-Religious Eastern Europe is Orthodox Christian
-Geographical Eastern Europe is harder to define, because it depends on which regions one uses (East/West, East/West/Central, East/West/Central/North/South, East/West/Central/North/South/Southeast/Southwest,...), and because there aren't any geographical markers to go by (like the Ural mountains for example)

Corona
We have some heavy measures and political tensions because of it
I agree, but the problem is the cases are *still* going up despite the measures we have
By all accounts, they're already pretty heavy and I am not sure what more can be done
We have to wear masks everywhere, we're on complete lockdown and people are also breaking measures because they're just sick of them already (how many people still disinfect their hands at stores
) and outright break curfews as well as travelling to other counties
Check up r/slovenia of people outright suggesting to a guy who wants to visit his gf what excuse he should give in case he is stopped by the police
Imo, it's not the measures that are the problem, but the people
its our premier, wannabe trump, shutting down news agency and we still have ~26% positive rate for more than 2 weeks, going nowhere
I wanter to write cool until I saw this comment
Why are people mad
Have they forgotten what happened early to mid 20th century
The UK leaving implies that a strong unified peaceful Europe may not be able to exist
That's why I'm mad, because the project is slowly falling apart
People say that the EU is fucking them but trust me, when the project dies and war breaks out again in Europe, people will remember the EU
You might think "The chances of war breaking out in this day and age are close to 0
No way it would happen
" but trust me it certainly can
Yes it is but instead of the member countries trying to help fix whatever bs is going on, they're leaving, that's the problem, there's no unity
Might as well call it the Broken Empire of Europe
fuck yeah

Pisses me off to see France getting constantly attacked for past years, on top of domestic instability
I wish my country would help in some way, now is the right time to show EU solidarity
Kick all the extremists out
France is for French values
Of that I have no doubt that we are united
I'd say though that overall we have more solidarity than US does
And of that I am proud
What's on Slovenia
France
Ustaše? What does that have to do with us
It's not about bad decisions the EU made, but decisions **I** don't agree with
Like there is a system where everyone can agree with everyone

We were in Poland just two weeks ago for new years and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised
Our apartment was in Krakow but we took a day trip to Warsaw and I loved the architecture there (as we don’t really have that many skyscrapers back home)

Should be that we are part of the Balkans or eastern Europe for Slovenia
Nobody would take the "Alpine Serbs" thing seriously
Can confirm the one for Poland
Very effective when I want to trigger Poles on reddit
You'd annoy us by calling us Eastern European
Alpine Serbs just makes me chuckle a bit

The missing data: I'd say Slovenia is dark red as well
(source: myself, a native)
They have data for Croatia and Serbia but not for Slovenia
Alright, I see how it is

Slavic languages are related, who knew
Well, it's still kinda different in slovenian, isn't it
Because Slovenia is strange and whatnot
"Nadaljujemo
Basically derived from the same word "dalje", which means far
"Nadalje" can means further/continue
"-ujemo" in the end just means we would make/act (on it)
We can also instead say "gremo naprej", which mean we go on
Someone please correct me on this, Slovenian is not my native language
It's like some sort of hybrid between Yugoslavia and Austro-Hungarian Empire

Living in Slovenia I remember crossing into Austria or Italy and border controls there on both sides
Driving through those crossings after Schengen it was weird seeing those buildings empty
Not entirely abandoned because there was still activity there but no controls
Then starting few years back Austria and Germany reinstated them due to migrants so I was thinking "are we going back to square 1
" and now it's even worse with borders actually closed
I live close to Austria, and it feels so good, to just go through the border without any stopping
I was visiting Prague this weekend for Metronome festival, attended the protest spontaneously today
Full support
I got a badge also, what does it mean
T-55 has max speed of 51km/h. Unless she was going snail mode there's no way it was following her let alone aim at her
I would stop
And the idea that someone would bother to even keep a tank gun pointed at some random car for 20km at snails pace is idiotic
Even more so when you take into account that there was no auto tracking at that time
More likely she saw a tank driving with gun pointed front like it normally is during travel and it became a story for her grandchild
Thats not what he said
> Trabant
100km/h
> Polski Fiat
113km/h
With alleged tank following you at alleged gun point for 20km
What reason would that be
Freshly done lobotomy
If you see a tank driving behind you with a cannon pointed at you, what do you do
Intentionally slow down to match its speed and stay on same course, stop and move out of way or speed up even if slightly
Anyone picking 1st option is either a moron or has different agenda from merely going to his own destination
Or perhaps she just wasnt threatened by a tank that likely didnt even bother pointing a gun at her
Making excuses for unlikely scenarios doesnt lend any credibility to OP's story
UK Parliament seems to be like a sitcom at this point

Yes and how many of you know the isses Germany is causing because of this stubborn no nuclear approach
How many of you know that  a few months ago we had to start up and disrupt normal operations of our power plants to "save" Germany or they would have been without power
How many of you know what Germany is doing to tha Balkans to keep up the sharade of them relying on unreliable power aources

Wheres in war some idiot with ATGM can ruin your day
Also depends on countries in question
They have a lot of common points that are not nation-specific, such as anti-immigrant, sexual minorities, liberalism/left wing policies, women's rights, vague anti-EU sentiment, racism/xenophobia
Then there are points where some care for them but others are indifferent, such as role of church
Where they are in conflict weaker ones pretend they are not in conflict
For example Italian revisionism and "we were victims
" attitude to WW2 and immediate post war period
Slovenian far right parts is close to Italian far right otherwise and when it comes to this they pretend Italians aren't saying anything rather than get upset and ruin otherwise cozy relations
Same with Hungary only Orban is more subtle about it

> That's despite events like Chernobyl being the result of a lot of human error
While I agree that dangers of Nuclear are way overblown in public perception, I don't think that is really any consolation
Human error was and will always be present
Coal contains a small amount of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes
After the coal is burned in a furnace, the non-flammable isotopes are concentrated in the ash that is left
This ash is typically dumped in the environment, contributing much more radiation above the natural background than any spent fuel from a nuclear power plant
Grinding spent fuel into a fine dust and then dumping it in the ocean would actually be a viable way to get rid of it since the volume of the ocean would dilute it to completely safe levels
Of course this would not fly with the general public
Completely agree with you
However, to get the new technology to mature and to actually build plants with that technology it would take decades
But we need to solve climate problem NOW
Slovenia has that many christians wtf
It's probably all old people

It’s quite rare for a Slovene to say “prekleto”... “sranje”, for example, is much more common
Prokleto

I don't know about you, but Bosniaks aren't culturally almost the same as us
Not that it matters, we got used to it
Agreed, there's a big cultural difference
Nope
81% for Slovenia
(page 24 [here]
I don't know
Having a relationship of any kind is taboo now
Familiarity with a culture doesn't mean the same culture
They're definitely closer culturally than Afghanistanis (if I give an extreme example), but still not the same
Habit is not the only component of culture
Well you got a point there
Perhaps
The largest minorities are immigrants from ex-Yu countries and their children, Albanians, Roma, Italians and Hungarians
I think it's mostly how the question was phrased
> how comfortable they would feel if one of their sons or daughters was in a love relationship with a person from a different ethnic group
This would be taken to mean "anyone but Slovene". In this light, the percentage makes sense
Slovenes may not be nationalistic, but they can be quite xenophobic
Especially towards the people from 'down south'.
Music
Religion
Traditions
Ring a bell
I'm not talking about uniqueness, I'm talking about non-similarities with Bosnian culture
YOUR habits do not equal Slovene culture
You're diminishing all the cultural aspects of all European cultures and making them all the same
Bosnian culture is NOT almost the same as Slovene culture
It's like saying Slovene culture is almost the same as Norwegian culture because YOU don't listen to Slovene music and follow religion
You make no sense
Culture is culture

In kaj je za tebe kultura

Why are you bringing integration of migrants into this
The talk is about Slovene and Bosnian culture
Heritage is culture
Religion is culture
Music is culture
Tradition is culture
All that is different in Slovene and Bosnian culture
**Integration** of migrants has to do with teaching them laws and social norms, not **assimilating** them into our culture
Ne vem, a niste imeli Etike in družbe v šoli, kjer ste se učili pojme kot so nacionalnost, državljanstvo, narod in podobno
Očitno ti živiš v eni popolnoma drugi državi al pa imaš zelo izkrivljen pogled na svoje sonarodnjake
"Podeželje, kot ga jaz vidim"
Kakšna očala pa ti nosiš :)
Ker je kar malo čudno, da glede na to da se tile planšarji vsak dan pijani tolčejo malone do smrti, uradna statistika pravi da je kriminala in nasilja veliko več v lj in drugih "mestih".
Ja, najboljš, da kr vse prebivalce zemlje posplošiš. Drugje nimajo prometnih nesreč in družinskih tragedij
A potem imajo tudi v drugih državah 'kmetavze' in 'frajerje', ki dirkajo in se pretepajo vse poprek
Res zelo žalostno razmišljaš.
Glej jst sem iz Posavje in tukaj je takšnih in drugačnih ljudi, ampak velika večina je povsem normalnih ljudi
Ni treba iz enega posploševanja na drugo skakat
Ne bom trdil, da nimajo te občine svojih problemov, ampak je pa daleč od tega, da bi bila večina prebivalcev teh občin "kmetavzov
Moj oče se ukvarja s kmetijstvom in jaz sem mu (in mu še danes) velikokrat pomagal pri tem, ampak nisem zaradi tega postal kmetavz, čeprav sem bil bolj v stiku s kmetijstvom od mladih let, kot pa je večina ljudi danes v Sloveniji
Neumne ljudi najdeš v mestih in podeželju, večina prebivalcev pa je povsem normalna
In kaj naj bi tile podatki povedali
Link ki si ga prilepil kaže statistiko po upravnih enotah - nič pa ne pove, koliko so te enote urbanizirane - torej koliko je več kriminala na podeželju
Ampak tudi če vzameš te podatke in malo posredno sklepaš: regije ki so bolj urbanizirane (recimo lj, maribor, celje, novo mesto) v vseh kategorijah izstopajo navzgor v primerjavi z redko poseljenimi up
enotami zahodne slovenije
V vsakem primeru gre za bulšit
Iz riti vlečeš neke predsodke o podeželju, kjer se baje kmetavzi vsak dan, takoj ko zjutraj pomolzejo kravo in zvrnejo litr šnopsa, usedejo na kros in se gredo mortal kombat v lokalni beznici dokler eden ni mrtev

We're too small even for a number
It seems like the smaller the country is the more they like the Euro
I like our strange European monopoly money
At least we have more coast now
This poll is fake, there is no way 91% of Slovenians support the euro
Kuna is pinned to the euro
So if the euro goes down so does the kuna
Otherwise people here feel nostalgic for the old currency
After adopting the euro the purchasing power dropped
And cluntries like czech republic and poland avoided the 2008 crysis way better because they kept their own currency
They are not richer, but they avoided the crysis better than some eu countries

I have never said they are not good to eat

Its a sad reality that slovenia is in such a bad spot because people simply dont want to pay their bills and other shit like that instead of not being able to pay bills, but hey, at least every 2nd slovenian has a fucking mercedes, audi or bmw, gotta get them loans

Really
IIRC we're so neck and neck it's considered a tie
At least in overall quality of life
Could just be a cultural thing, I'm not sure how this data was collected
For example, I always pay my phone bill with a 3 week delay, if it's due on the 14th, I'll usually pay early next month
I pay the rest on time, but not always, I could definitely be counted in this statistic, even if financially I am not that bad off
My mom's household also pays bills late, especially water, even if she is doing well financially
I reckon this common behaviour could amount to quite a swing in the poll
I am, Croatia *has* to be better than this
Here in Slovenia it's mostly pensioners raising the stats, the situation for the large majority of the people is much better
Would't be suprised by something similar down south
We get taxed that much and get shit pay on top of that (Slovenia)
Not surprised we're so high up
Yeah well, half of the shit written in most EULAs is like that but cannot be enforced because it's illegal in the first place

A tale of the demise of Nokia is a tale of grave incompetence
Really
I was not that long ago
I remember it
There is no mystery to it
We were watching a train wreck in slow motion
We were shouting to the driver to stop
But HE knew better
Nokia laughed at iPhone
They laughed at Android
When Samsung, HTC & Co
overtook Nokia with their Android phones, Nokia knew better: There's no money in Android
Why should we make phones and let Google take the profits
They were saying this WHILE their market share was in freefall
We'll just stick to Symbian
It's good enough
The deal with Microsoft was just the last chapter in this awful tale of incompetence
Again
There's no mystery to it
Go, read the articles of the era on specialized internet portals
Everybody knew, what is going to happen, if Nokia won't adopt Android
Some commentators begged them to do it
They had the biggest market share
People trusted them
Were they to make Android phones at the time of HTC Desire of Galaxy I, Nokia would remain the biggest  (smart)phone maker to this day
A tale of Nokia is a tale of suicide by incompetence
Something else I forgot to mention
This whole Nokia thing always makes me mad
I mean, we had it
Europe had the biggest phone manufacturer in the world
At the time, that smartphones were getting big
We had the right processor architecture (ARM was British at the time)
Europe could have f***ing rule the smartphone market, spearheading the next technical revolution
But we squandered it
Again
At least we have the cars, right
For now
We still have SAP
Maybe not directly harmful
However the state and church should be separate to prevent potential harm to the democratic process
No organized religion or institution should have power over the state and people’s rights
Just look at the Middle East where secular and democratic nations of 70s turned much more authoritarian and religious
And if you’re going to say this thread isn’t about this, it kinda is because the fact that a priest comes to inaugurate the opening of a hospital is indicative that the state and church are not separated
Shit we bless everything from horses to warehouses
TBH, Servers need a blessing
Everybody forgets to bless their printers, that's why they always turn to evil
That what happens when you have laws protecting consumers
Unfortunately this happens
But I'm sure that supermarkets would sell spoiled food to the consumer if they weren't in place
I dont know in poland, but in slovenia they cant do anything
At least most of shops have discounts on things, that are going to go out of date
There are some organizations that collect that food, but as i know that is kinda illegal

It's complicated, but Janša is still galaxies away from Jorg
He's pro anything that seems to be currently in vogue with the right because he isn't actually a true right-ish person
He's actually a leftie by heart, but the left was so stacked in Slovenia that they renamed the party from *Socialdemocrat party* to *Slovenian democrat party* (shorthand SDS in both cases)
The fascist portrayal is from our mostly left media that can still stirring up antifascist sentiment in the people from the left of the yugonostalgia
Though, I must say that pro-Trump tweeting blew up spectacularly with the Capitol debacle :-D
In Slovenia we watch home alone (guess all slavic brothers do as well lol)

Slovenian here
In my elementary school there was 25 to 30 kids per class
The average is scew tho since we have a lot of schools in villages where they have like 10 students
We try to make it so kids don't have to commute far to school (at least in the early grades untill kids turn 10 or so) there are literally 2 schools 10km away from my small town of 10k people and my town already has 2 elementary schools
The class above mine had 3, but gained one because one of my classmates was allowed to skip 1st grade since she already knew how to read, write and do basic math
Lol best flair by far
I remember these comics being the first thing I was reading after learning to read

The optimistic forecasts put the temperature at 37°C, the more pessimistic put the temperature at 40°C. Worth noting that the highest temperature ever recorded was 40,8°C. It's gonna be hot hot hot
You misspelled Central Europe
Seriously though, the weather here isn't usually that hot
I think the average temperature is something like 20°c in Ljubljana, comparable to Warsaw (i think the average is 18°c, not completely sure about that)
Nothing to see here, move along

I’m guessing Slovenia would be mostly in the pink as well lately
Our previous prime minister stepped down in February and a new government was set up by the president and the parliament without any elections
The new right-wing ruling party (especially the prime minister Janez Janša) is very polarising - it either has a sizeable cult following or is hated
Ever since they came to power in March, there have been weekly protests in Ljubljana, demanding the government to step down
Since March there have been many allegations of corruption, allegedly exploiting the corona crisis for their personal financial gain
The prime minister is a good friend of the  equally scandalous Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who even previously sponsored their political campaign
He is very Trump-esque on Twitter, demeaning virtually all media and harshly criticising Slovenia's socialist past (although it was the left-wing partisans who liberated the country during WW2 - a sentiment which is still very much alive)
What he has been saying recently was very much in line with the Polish and Hungarian governments, instead of aligning with the rest of the EU and the more progressive nations
His latest hobby is trying to pass a law which would dramatically cut funding for the national TV and radio, while also trying to make them more obedient and supportive of his party
In fact, they (SDS party) even unofficially run their own TV station (Nova24)
It is basically our version of Fox news, spreading a very biased, far-right, nationalist and conservative sentiment
He pretty much refuses to appear on other stations, accusing all other journalists of spreading fake news and collaborating with the deep state
Almost immediately after taking office he/they(SDS) appointed their own people to the heads of police, army, the national institute for public health, the statistical office, the Slovene Intelligence and Security agency and many other national institutions
They also increased their own salaries to the maximum still legal amount (while the country was going through a crisis, but not increasing the salaries of health workers)
Other parties in coalition have also had their share of scandals, with both the minister for economic development and the minister of agriculture being accused of corruption, and two more ministers stepping down due to being in similar circumstances
The government is also under scrutiny regarding how they handled the corona crisis and how they have limited the rights of NGOs when it comes to environmental protection
All in all, a clusterfuck
Honestly, tempting

Best outcome would be if UK stays in the union
I suspect the current deal, as it is, is best for the EU
It's really silly for UK politicians to expect that the EU will bend over backwards, compromise the union, throw members under the bus just to accommodate all UK demands
A deal would still result in the UK leaving and compromising the rest of the union just to make it easier for the UK is just not going to happen

It looked really good back then ...
Who in the hell has a negative opinion on Liechtenstein
Why do they hate Russia
Wow look at all the different types of weed
That's the first and the only thing that I was looking to find it here
This is more fiction than reality
Because no way we (Slovenia) will close our biggest coal power station, it only recently started operating and it costed 1,5 bn €, way too much to run only for a decade
Am 21 can confirm, started liking EU now this
Yeah, but just the thought of someone that is so detached from how the internet works in politics is worrying
Tensions are rising between Germany and Poland
Slovenia actually had that in constitution but we had to change it when joining EU
So now we extradite our citizens to other EU members for crimes committed in EU
I think that's because he might face death penalty and EU countries don't extradite people for such crimes
So US tends to go around it by asking for extradition on different crime, one that carries no death penalty, and then expanding the charge once they have them
Canada may have same reservations
One case I can think of is single terrorist who survived London Iranian embassy siege in 1980
He was released in early 2000s but UK didn't deport him to Iran as he would be executed there
I think there were similar cases regarding MKO members arrested in EU as well
As you can see from this illustration, it won't matter anyway once Brexit is reached
"Croatian Hachiko". From Croatia (City of Vodnjan) comes a story about a dog's love for a deceased friend
Even though he died four years ago, dog named "Lady" (16) comes everyday, sits and waits for him, in rain, snow or unbearable heat
in front of the door behind which her dear Salko once lived
Stop cutting onions, guys
:((

Rip Paris
It's back to 15 °C here
It's been raining since May here
Not in Slovenia
It's raining 90% of the time
16 degrees in Ljubljana atm
To be fair, it does seem to be rather cold in Portugal for this time of the year
It was sort of the same here yesterday
After a few days with perfect sunshine and temperatures close to 30°C, we had miserable weather yesterday with loads of rain and temperatures of around 16°C. Didn't feel like Summer at all
I would pay for 14°C right now
No I don't
Yellow circle gang (I'm from northern Slovenia)
We're melting in Koper
I much prefer the rain to 27°C heat
It kinda is 14 degrees right this moment
Well, yeaterday wasn’t any warmer here
Right, it's just that I visited Portugal (area around Porto) in late September a few years ago and the temperatures were still in high 20s/low 30s, so I was surprised to see that area have temperatures of around 23°C at the moment
Or was it just unusually warm when I was there
Me especially since my birthay is in december
Good for you, I have like 20°C rn and it's also raining
I think its very hot when its 27°C, my ideal temperature is 15°C
Where are you at
I live just North of Ljubljana and the temperature never exceeded 17°C yesterday
Same
I live near Koper
Where are you from
Interesting, i would've thought you were from a southern European country since you like the heat
Ja natürlich we can
Seems legit Italy
Slovenia: english or german; it really depends in which region you live, mine is german because i live near austrian border but students in lets say Ljubljana or Maribor have english
In my part of Slovenia, it's German
In other parts it may be Hungarian, Italian or English
In Slovenia the main second language is English (obviously), especially for the younger generations
Other than that, Serbo-Croatian is the most widely understood and spoken, while German comes third
Italian is spoken by about 10% of the population, being a co-official language in Istrian municipalities
To take your example, my parents born in 1960s in Slovene Istria have learned English, Italian and (only one year) of Serbo-Croatian in school
With the exception of Serbo-Croatian which they do not use, they are fluent in both of those languages
I too had to learn Italian since grade 1 and english since grade 3 and i can speak both quite well
I also took Russian classes later on, but i am far from fluent in it
I'm proud of you, Polishbros
Way to go
I'm glad Poland is FINALLY getting some positive press
This sub has been stuck in a hurrr durrr Eastern Europe bad, throw everyone out rut for far too long, by people that have never been close to the border, let alone actually visited the country
Why did they send so much help
Because they are awesome
I visit Poland several times a year, have driven all over the country, several times over - thank you for all the wonderful nature, super friendly people and amazing food
This is what Europe should be about
I remember when the Austrians did something similar when we needed help with ice rain a couple of years back
Seriously this means so much to the locals, go Poland
Do you seriously think changing a leader solves anything
When the leader is overthrown/changed the new leader still needs to pay the same people for loyalty, make business with immoral organizations to stay in power etc
That's just how politics work
The ruling is the goal, not ruling well
EDIT: I might have worded this a bit too harshly
But the amount of belief I see people have about changing a leader bringing better life is astounding
In western democracies it might work because the productivity of citizens is THE income that the country relies upon thus they need to spend some time in their time in office (which is not limitless) to make something to make people just a bit more productive + it's a crowd pleaser which usually results in second term
Like their situation won't change until the source from where the government gets the money changes
And as it stands right now - there were no news about it
Africa is rife with corruption not because leaders are incompentent bastards but because the productivity of the citizens is so low they are NOT the main source of income thus not worth to spend money on them
Go deeper
Read Dictator's handbook
While Rules for rulers is very clear how politics work, in the book they are written on world examples - Liberia, Zimbambwe, Bell's town in California, Iraq etc
It's so depressingly accurate you have no choice but to change POW
The problem is - the leader could say "no" to these organizations but then they will have problems with rivals who said "yes" to them
Money is needed to keep your supporters loyal - if you make deals with those organizations you have it
Imagine it this way - You have 100
000€ per month to distribute between your supporters
An organization appears that want you to fuck with Iran as much as possible in exchange for giving you 200
000€ per month until the end of your leadership
You can say no and continue distributing 100
000€ but your supporters might overthrow you because a rival came to them and said "Instead of paying you 100
000€ as it is right now if you put me in charge I will pay you 250
000€ per month". You see where I am going with this
If you want to stay in power then you need to do shady stuff to stay in power
Because if you won't then someone else will
Should and does are 2 different things
Government should be the voice of the people but it's not
Government should be filled with people wanting common good but they are not
Why
Because of the reasons written above
Let me elaborate
We all know on reddit we are all goody 2 shoes who would like common wealth to everybody BUT if you were SOMEHOW the 2nd man in the office with an offer of 100
000€ per month in exchange to fuck with the healthcare system would you do it
While morally the answer would be no I am serious practically everybody on this site would give it a thought if not accept it straight
Greed and power go hand in hand
You could jump 2 social classes with that pay and made the future of your family very nice
Or you could be moral - say no and still stay in the middle class telling other people about decision you could make but you didn't because you were moral and most of people would totally respect you for that
And if you think that was not real example - just in a simple town in California people lived in poverty while the officials of that town had 80
000€ per month
I agree with you
What I used was very basic example
In democracies there are way more subtleties than in dictatorships
But that doesn't make my words any less true
Presidents while they can be figurheads they definitely don't need to be
But to remain in the office and enjoy the benefits after it you need to play by the rules OR you pay consequences
They look more comfortable than most benches
Is possibly an art installation
Something about the painful results of global warming and how we've turned our backs on the environment
First the leaning tower of Pisa and now this
Italians really need to learn to build their towers right
For any Italians reading this: if you're gonna build a tower, make sure to build it **vertically** and **not partly submerged in water**.
Yes, it is
It says so in the map
Ok, enough Reddit for today

Italians trying to speak English come second only to Germans trying to speak Italian
I can barely contain the laughter
So many of them decide to just fuck it and go back the way they came

Something not so historical, but current: we rank 2nd for the amount of suicides (in Europe)
Basically we do have an extreme left
After ww2 the partisans slaughtered people they suspected were german collaborators (My grandfather was one
He was 16, the germans were promising freedom and they were afraid of communism
Most were simply picked up by the germans
) and people they didn't like and some just for sadistic reasons
People still deny this even after mass graves were uncovered
They deny, say they all deserved it or even say not enough of them were killed
We have "anti-faschist" (I am firmly against our current government but can be a part of these people) protests going on and if you even mention Tito (the Yugoslavian dictator) was a dictator in their online groups they loose their shit
No one gets called out for hate and saying people should be killed and those comments receive a lot of likes
I hate living here right now because I consider myself a leftist, yet I have no place in my country
Just don't ever think people who claim to be liberal, moral, educated
can't use fighting agaist fascism to turn in to fascists themselves
I watched a movie about this as a kid
Still haunts me
Seeing Milky way with bare eyes is no real achievment
I live on the outskirts of a population 20000 town and there is visible light polution on the horizon, but I can easily see the Milky way if I only let my eyes adjust
But real dark sky Milky way is really impressive
I'm so sorry for what's going on in Serbia
Have the protests accomplished anything
>Supposedly their concentration camps were much worse than any Nazi German one
I heard that some germans working in concentration camps came to visit one of the croatian ones and they left early because it was so terrible they couldn't take it
If you have such an old and powerful institution it will of course have a lot of dirt
There were also positive sides and my comment in this thread is about slovenia's disgousting secret, where religious people were the ones under threat
It's not an institution or religion, it's people
Anywhere where there is power and lack of control, shitty people will pop up and do shitty things
Not always, but often
Did they flee to Canada
I have some relatives there  because one of my grandafther's brothers made it out alive
Good luck guys
Serbia has not had it easy
You deserve better
I'm not religious
I just see that same shit happens everywhere and religioin is a scapegoat
Like I wrote in my post to this thread, in my country it was the "liberators" that were yhe bad guys
If we don't realise that horrible practices can happen in any ideology, then bad things are bound to happen
In my country the left think they have such a moral highgroung and religion is so hated by them that they feel they have the right to want to kill them
I'm not talking about giving passes, I'm talking about trying to prevent these things from happening in the future and focusing on the root of the issue
The church was extremely powerful and with that represented the good and bad in european history
It was also clergymen who spoke up against witch trials and slavery
I have Irish friends, I know how problematic the church is in Ireland
I just wish you understood my point
Because as long as people are focused on some organisation as the enemy I only see us going in circles and killing each other
Like I said, I have irish friends, so I know all that
It's not the same everywhere so the generalisations are not fair
I know what a far left can be, yet I understad that when people talk about the far left in the US it's mostly blown way out of proportion
We need to be realistic and critical
The religion hate that is spreading has very diferent effects depending on culture
Well, well, well, I guess there is a way of expanding Piran Bay ...

all the dumb things he said about brexit already make him a complete moron or at the very least an insidious man
Probably leaving yugoslavia and giving everyone a reason to send in the tanks and then thinking we would become slavic Switzerland
Turns out that's pretty damn hard so we became slavic Germany instead
ok, ok, frere moments then
Same here
Living in an old apartment building says nothing about your income
Yep, I'm using internet all the time and most sites are in English
Then there is my dialect which makes it harder for me to speak "clean" Slovene than English
I had better grades in my English class than in my Slovene class for most of the time in school
Pretty much no
I use 95% Slovene when talking to other Slovenes and a small mix of German words (due dialect) and Serbo-Croatian words here and there
I speak English only online or when I talk to a foreigner (or I am visiting a different country)
Managed to stamp out 90% of it, but I still have a bit of that distinctive slavic accent and I don't like it
Through the amazing process of media osmosis, I have learned English from such a young age that I'm probably more fluent in English than Slovene
So yeah I'm fine with it
I generally know how to speak American English, but I may roll back to the hard Slovene consonants when my tongue refuses to collaborate with the brain
It's however obviously understandable and I don't much care, except in aesthetic sense
We don't like it
That's why we speak it only if we really have to
We had a French native speaker in high school
Would trade her English accent for what she did to Slovene words any day of the week
It was also very tragic, she tried so hard and was still incomprehensible most of the time
I think it's mostly because Iphones are quite expensive and the general opinion here was that the price is not worth it (you pay just for the brand)
Of course, Apple fans would disagree, but they are not in the majority
All other phones mostly use Android
Because Android is objectively better and we're less naive
Yeah but also -3 INT when talking to tech Wizards
I don't like Maribor, I don't like the people there, they have that being 2nd complex and I can't stand their dialect
Anything in Prekmurje really
Lendava has this distinctively foreign air that I just don't feel in other border towns/cities
Sadly, it's the capital
Ljubljana
Alot of the people there think they're better than everyone else and that most of Slovenia that isn't Ljubljana are peasants
Honestly alot of them are arrogant
Not everyone though, there are really nice people
Berlin's incompetence is so famous it produced a copypasta
Ach Berlin

Slovenia has some ugly cities like Jesenice or Trbovlje, but they're not really to be ashamed of
Jesenice has just shit geography, Trbovlje even worse plus being a former coal town so it's not too hard to understand why it's falling behind economically
Maribor on the other hand has great potential, being close to Austria, fields, mountains, well connected etc
but unlike many places they never fully recovered from the industiral decline in the 90s and nowadays have persistently higher unemployment than the rest of the country
They have a tendance to elect shitty mayors which keep them behind economically, ending up entrenching the being 2nd complex
It's a shame since in the end it's a place with honest working people, but making bad choices and blaming Ljubljana for all their woes
Ljubljana people are known as arrogant but we mostly just laugh at them since they think they're living in a world metropolis while the city has just 300k people
Edit: This is just Slovenian banter, as a tourist you should defnitely visit Maribor on a day trip, it has a cute, quaint baroque center and nice surroundings

Well maybe you should ask Ljubljana about their complex
Some of them litteraly think that most of Slovenia, except Ljubljana, are peasants
Full of arrogance
There are many ugly towns, yes, but I wouldn't be ashamed of that
Everything you wrote is pretty much on point, except that I never met those 'arrogant' Ljubljana people everyone on the internet talks about
They are defiant when attacked, but that's expected
People in MB are way more arrogant, especially when it comes to football, but at the same time they're nice
They're just so weird
I would say people in MB are nice, sometimes overly nice and talkative, they're just very annoying with their complaining and ugly dialect
Pubec je ena najgrših besed
Bruhec mi dvigne
Yea, that's exactly what people in Maribor with a complex say
I haven't met a single person in Ljubljana that thought that while studying there
Paisley and Renfrew were scary driving through
I think people from Ljubljana hate other people from Ljubljana
and students from Maribor who don’t know how and where to park
I have lived there for a year while in high school
No joke, most of the people in my class werent all that nice
Really arrogant about "being no
1". Could be I just saw a bad side to the city, but all in all, I think it's wonderful
I just don't like the stereotype that comes from it, and then the rest of Slovenia gets the same stereotype attached to them
Everyone in Slovenia hates everyone in Slovenia
That's just how it is
My personal excuse is 'trash truck blocked my way'. It works once a week

Oi i spilled my coffee come and clean it up for me
No that's me now can you please move us to the western side of the building, I just want a new computer and a better office
It's like a national past time
With me it's weird because when i speak some words sound british and other american so it just creates this weird fusion of both accents
Oh yes
When I visited America last summer I got made fun of for using "fake British slang" when I'm not a Brit, and in Ireland where I've lived for more than 2 years I get called out on my "fake American accent" when I should apparently be speaking with either a perfect Irish or a thick Slavic one
I feel like English-speaking folks don't really understand that we don't have an "authentic" or consistent accent and vocabulary in the English language as we learn and build it from many different sources
In clubs, partying, women would come up to you and start a conversation
Happened 0 times in 15 years of adulthood in Europe

Umm, I didn't know Slovenians are supposed to be tall
Is that a legit stereotype/stat
Did his parents know and what was their role in this
This is so weird
Croatia is a member of NATO any you get military aid from the US
Unfortunately you can't rely on us to do much in a war
I don't think that'd happen
Esspecially in europe it probably wouldn't go unnoticed but Hungary is also a member of NATO so I don't know who the NATO would side with
Not our Janša. Listening to him is worse than listening to that mouth smacking ASMR, yet his following is significant
He has no speaking skills whatsoever, not a pinch of charisma, just skills in fear mongering and lying
Yea you are right
As you said I wouldn't be suprised if wars poped up and if this thread is to be believed many things are going to shit now
WW3 leak confirmed
I was joking, but if its a nuclear war then einstein will have been right when he said "I know not what ww3 will be fought with but ww4 will be fought with sticks and stones"

Ah, can try'i. Well, this night not'i almost nothing sleep because i most time spent with learning for exam
School not is fun
Not going that well because are words and sentences in Slovene created on completely different way
And now me hurt brains
There is no way in hell slovenians would do this
Even if we did qualify
I guarantee out team does not care, fans would probably be annoyed if anything and other people don't really bother with any activism
We hardly stick our necks out for ourselves and wouldn't do it for anyone else
Plus it's not like anyone gave a shit when dogs were brutally slaughtered and burned to death for the championship
Or eurovision
That being said, I would love it but I don't expect people to for a second give up on trivial fun for others' lives
First we need to qualify
And despite beating Croatia yesterday that will be hard
So if we qualify we shouldn't boycott it, because we usually dont qualify
Otherwise the biggest issue I see with Qatar 2022 is that it is going to be held in winter, which will likely cause problems to both footballers and broadcasters
Also it wont have that usual charm
Summer sports really should be kept in summer
Not to mention the piece of shit who kicked and killed an owl
Yes such good
Football disgousts me with how much suffering a silly game has caused
Animal cruelty
EU should pick four random US states and start requiring visas for them
That's not true
We have a common travel area, so we make our deals together, otherwise it all falls apart
Imagine if half of EU required visas for Russians, while the other half didn't. How would that work
That is not being treated as an enemy
A internal affair between countries in the EU will become an affair between Spain, Ireland (and EU by proxy) and the UK after brexit
Which makes all situations very difficult and de-escalation unlikely since the UK made the first step in alienating itself by rejecting core EU values
I find the current events saddening because the UK was an important and very influential party in the EU
Saying that UK was in this just for financial benefit is a gross misrepresentation of the truth
Many EU institution are shaped like they are today because of the UK
Standardised products, safety standards for consumers and consumer protection we enjoy are UK's great contributions
Even Airbus is a product of cooperation between European countries
I sincerely hope that this is not the end of cooperation between the UK and the rest of Europe
Our prime minister said man made global warming is not a thing, that global warming is actually connected to the activity on the sun

If everybody at once would stop hiking
I think that even Covid19 won't stop us
Luckily
But only with family members
Yes
I meant that
Of course, we could not live without it
But our politicians and the doctors are so much insisting  that we have to stay at home, that some people were worried that hiking was prohibited too
You got my vote, but firstly Schengen needs expansion
I want a good railroad system so badly I would support any effort towards that

Ye 4 years ago we had 3m of snow and now we get about 0,5m
Well here, when i was like 5 we had snow in Ljubljana, like quite a bit of it
But now maybe for a weekend we get the slushy and dirty one
In my part of Slovenia(Northern Slovenia next to Austrian border) Germans are percieved as positive people
I can say that when I was little and my grandmother told me stories from WWII I always taught that Germans were the good guys in that war and partisans were bad guys
I think she did not know what really happened in the war and had good memories of German soldiers because when they came life got better for her
There really isn't any
I've heard "It's a shame Germany didn't win the war - at least things would be in order" more times than something against Germans being said
Generally Germans are seen here in a positive light
They have the reputation of being hard working and honest people
Yes
If it only weren't for those damn Germans, man
It doesn't come up very often, but yes it is still very common, especially because of Austria's  reluctance to recognize the rights of its Slovene minority
Our issues with Germans go back a lot farther than just 70 years, they go back to over a 1000 years of oppression and gradual assimilation by them
We've probably had these issues for longer than any other Slavic country
Nothing much has changed, the gradual assimilation is still happening, still nothing we can do about it
Not really
We're too busy hating each other and mocking the brits
You must live in very SDS-voting areas xD
Overall the relations between the countries have improved in the previous decade especially on the minority related aspects
That is probably actually the reason for most of the anti-German sentiment in Slovenia
Even the issues during WW2 and WW1 were mostly because of that
Both Styria and Carinthia were originally almost entirely Slovene, but due to Slovenia being unfortunate enough to be the first Slavic nations to lose it's independence to the Germans over a thousand years ago it lost almost all of that land after centuries of gradual assimilation and depopulation due to wars
That and with modern Austria absolutely refusing to recognize what is left of their Slovene minority despite being constitutionally bound to so, I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people are still upset with them
Why wouldn't they be
Or reading comments of news sites of ill reputation
Haha yeah you could say so
Tell that to the Slovenians, the Germans colonised almost all of their land
Honestly, you Austrians got most of your modern state from the Slovenes
How could you get it back if you never had it to begin with
If I'm being honest, Slovenes did live in all of those areas
Carantania alone consisted of basically all of Styria and Carinthia plus East Tyrol, and southern parts of Lower and Upper Austria
Even the eastern parts of South Tyrol were part of it
Not to mention that the northern parts of Upper and Lower Austria were still originally inhabited by Slavs before the Germans moved south, they just weren't part of Carantania
Carantania was actually relatively ethnically homogeneous, with the vast majority being the Slavic ancestors of the Slovenes and the remainder not being Germanic at all, but the remnants of the Romanised Celtic population
Also Salzburg has only been part of Austria for 200 years so I don't know why it is relevant, it never made up historic Austria
Even as little as 100 years ago both Styria and Carinthia were still more than 1/3 Slovene
Going back 100 more years and Slovenes made up almost half of the population in both
Nowadays the percentage of Slovenes in Carinthia is constantly lowering, I wonder why
Austria basically got their entire country by germanising the Slovenes
Trieste has basically never been part of Venice, save for when it was briefly occupied for a few years
Austria had owned the city for around 700 years
The inhabitants of Trieste were also originally the Friulians and the Slovenes, not the later Venetians who tried to assimilate both
In Slovenia Spar used this in commercials, since we also use the word (although with a slavic twist) šparati
Thanks for the breakdown
It is really much more expensive than in my country (around 2 million people)
Here, employed people pay 6,36 % of their gross pay for basic insurance, which covers almost everything (the list is actually complicated, but suffice it to say that you don't have to worry about paying, especially not for rare conditions, though one notable omission is dental care, which is covered very sparsely)
Unemployed get coverage through assistance for unemployed or through family members or they can pay for it themselves
Minimum salary here right now is around 940 € gross, and healthcare for that salary is around 60 €/month
Just to give you a perpective, neto minimum salary is around 650 € as of this year, adjusted once per year
Edit: one more thing to put costs into perpective
A short visit to a GP costs 7,26 €, a first curative visit 17,42 €.
Specialist care:
Surgeon - 4,09-17,77 €
Cardiologist - 3,85-16,73 €
Dialisys - 176 € (chronic) or 302 € (acute)
CT - 130-300 €
MRI - 200-450 €
Kidney transplantation - 82
768 €
Birth - 1
200-5
600 €
True in a way, but Bismarck began work on that much earlier
And his reason was to make the population of Germany better workers
Those social conservatives were crafty
Yes, that is what I mean
I used decimal commas, points are for thousands
But this the cost charged to the national insurance, you don't pay that out of pocket
Yes, of course
Our tap water is of excellent quality in most parts of the country
We always drink tap water
We even got annoyed that restaurants wouldn't give you tap water and now they have to
I hate it when people buy unnecessary plastic when they have clean water available
In Slovenia I only buy bottled water at festivals and occasionally when travelling (but even them I mostly bring water with me, because prices)
I buy sparkling water in bottles (reusable glass ones), but otherwise tap water all the way
Radenska and home made apple juice, yum
Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well :)
Way too often to the point that I feel like I can barely speak Slovene
Ever since 5th grade, I've been a big fan of reading, and, altho I'm ashamed of saying it myself, the majority of the books I read were light novels
These are unobtainable in Slovene, so I always read them in English
In the meantime, I barely even touched a single book in my own native tongue
So while my English vocabulary exploded, my Slovene one shrunk significantly
All the time, actually
Sometimes I have to even use Google Translate to find the Slovene word I'm looking for
I work in engineering and Slovene words for some things aren't really used
I know they exist and I can go find them in the specific dictionaries when needed, but I'd probably laugh at anyone using them casually
A lot of them just sounds made-up
Some are actually quite good
None are common
In general, I sometimes 'lose' words in either Slovene or English
I do a lot of writing in English, but commonly check Google Translate for words I knew yesterday
When I lose them in Slovene, it takes some description games
Imagine trying to describe all the various fantasy weaponry, spells etc
in Slovenian
I think it's actually not that bad with words of Latin/Greek origin though
Actually, would be interesting to think about whether it even ever happens with English words of Germanic origin
Never call a Slovene (or pretty much anyone whose national first language isn't Russian) Eastern European
In the same vein, never call anyone *not* from Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus Eastern European
Also not being a politician or owner of a company and not assuming that all the politicians and company owners are stealing from everyone they can
Is it weird that I'm not sure if esteriotipes was being used ironically or seriously
Wait, I thought we got the idea to serve Wiener Schnitzel with tartar sauce from you guys as a package
O_o
Literally came here to say this
Central Europe is a thing, learn your geography
We may forgive being called Balkans, but not Eastern Europe
Sirov burek
Here are three pics that will also illustrate why the common usage of EE doesn't make any sense:
Only because you always go to war against everyone else except each other xD
You're just Slavs in denial anyway :D
dude you're killing me
As someone from other Slovakia, I can confirm that we too have "Nizozemska" (Lowlandia), which does only refer to the Netherlands though
Ahahaha I love that statistic and am very proud it was not us
I don't know any for Slovenia
Probably because we have an inferiority complex so we only ever talk about the statistics, where we rank well
Well
apart from having way to many suicides and alcoholics
When you say "other race" do you mean only POC
What about a white South African or Latin American
(for example)
True, but we still rank really high
At some point we were second I think after Finland or something
We only ever fight with Croatians, who also happen to be our only neighbor we never were at war with throughout history
But in general, no
Personally, on the off-chance that I encounter some revisionist or irredentist Italian, Austrian, or Hungarian that makes claims to our modern-day territory, I just start poking fun at them that they couldn't even erase our culture back in their glory days, so trying today would probably lead to us taking over Rome/Vienna/Budapest
That's half-hilarious and half-true (I'll let you figure out which part is which), so it usually dispels any tension
And in general, not really
Some of my grandma's cousins were killed by the 3rd Reich
I don't blame modern-day Germans for that, so no reason for things to get awkward
Aye, everything south of Kolpa river is a mess
Gotta watch what you say or you might as well get stabbed by someone
Albanians, bosniaks, croatians and serbians
Dangerous people when it comes to discussing history
In western slovenia we have: "Italijani napadajo/prihajajo
" (The Italians are attacking /coming)
Oh then yall do it only when you come here
It is a common thing that when someone gets stabbed it happeens in a fight between folks south of Kolpa
You were
Now you are just loud guests who drive really slow, but we like you
Our people used to live in harmony for centuries, 2 wars and atrocities on both sides shouldn't ruin that
Can you browse reddit tho
That's like punishing your child for not obeying computer time limits with staying in his room but he could play playstation or whatever
Well that would at least be funny if the police officer would take your phone
I never heard of any one doing it here but i wish they did
There's only [one example I know of] and it's pretty good, which makes sense, since the girl's real life mom is apparently Slovenian, but you can still hear the accent
this has yet to happen but even if the actor had a strong accent we'd still lose our shit
I always say hello to people passing by in mountains, but that's rare for me, because I don't go to mountains that much
Yes, absolutely
It's considered rude if you don't.
Generally yes, but I usually try to read the person approaching, because you can see some of them just don't want to be greeted
I also noticed a big difference in the past few years, since "instagram hiking" became so popular, there are many more "city dewllers" that just ignore people
I think in general the mountaineering ethics has declined a bit since it became so popularized
I was hiking in Wales and got a feeling that it's not common because people were often surprised when I greeted them
Eating horse meat
Not as a speciality, but stuff like burgers, sausages, hot dogs, meat loafs
The regular food
Talked to a Romanian friend as she was completely surprised we eat it as beef or pork meat
That is maybe the biggest cultural shock I had in Poland
It also showed answers from another town who didn't agree with it
We also have it here, but not as big
I saw some videos from yesterday's parade, and that stuff is straight from the nightmares
pancakes are a dinner food here as well
It is a thing
We (Slovenians) still say Ja for Yes
Undo what you have done
In UK people are afraid to see themselves naked let alone strangers :D
Hehe, in all seriousness I prefer saying "ja", it sounds better than "da", don't know why
Actually I love the fact that our culture is really similar to yours in general (if you search up Slovenian folk music, you may be surprised by how similar)
All spas/wellness'/health centers here have saunas
From my experience you have to be naked and use two towels
A bigger one to sit on and a smaller one to wipe sweat
Vesel božič!
"To je kot Španska vas" - This is like a Spanish village to me is a saying when you have 0 knowlage about something
"Ne delaj se Francoza" - Stop acting like French is a saying when somebody pretends to not understand something
We have that too only that it's "like a spanish village to me"
"To je pa češko" - "That's Czech" : it is not particularly well made or it looks off, but generally functional
Russian/Soviet technology - usually old, absolutely unintuitive to use but indestructible; it doesn't matter where it was actually made
Teksas - Texas is referred to a situation that is messy and lawless
Not necessarily negative
Never heard it used positively
Texas meant messy, lawless and absolutely not doing what it was supposed to
In a very bad direction
It's going to be a global 9/11
Kiss your freedom and democracy goodbye
Any country could close their borders/airports and there was nothing the EU could do about it
I mean, if Slovenia could do it, Ireland with its much stronger economy and, as you say, *being an island*, could definitely have done it as well
You're blaming the EU for something it didn't do - that's Brexit-style talk
Don't forget us, your neighbours, we have an Orbanesque government now
The first thing that our forreign affaires minister(?) did was invite the Hungarian one to visit
And the media house of our far right party (15% support usually) is owned by Orban money/people, in coordination with their Slovenian friends
We have a police investigation about funding said television(media house)
And the new minister for internal affairs(the one overlooking the police) is a director in that firm(media house)
Sorry for maybe wrong words, am trying lol
Unless I'm mistaken, they can be stripped of their vote, and then essentially anything can be decided, even a treaty change which allows for states to be expelled, but I don't think expulsion is an option already
Or is it
That says a lot about the Irish government, not the EU
Fuck
> Its the same with the Balkans that may or may not include Slovenia, Greece and Romania
And Austria according to north Germans xD
But yeah, you're right about the east-west question
People with superiority complexes use the borders of the Slavic countries
The rest uses geography or history
I agree about that
Emergency powers aren't inherently bad
They're just dangerous in the wrong hands
Once in school we were listening to a dialect for an exercise and I literally couldn't understand anything
But I don't travel much inside Slovenia, so I don't really get to listen much to other dialects
If you will not learn we will have to change language (while showing cooking wooden spoon- kuhalnica and threatening beating with it)
Same here, it’s either working in McDonald’s or stocking shelves in Mercator (the largest Slovene supermarket chain)
There is also "If you will not learn you will be road cleaner/road (maintenance) worker
so no one was told they will be "stacking sugar on the store shelves"? it was a classic  in my household
I know this comes up a lot and people here joke about it, but in this New Years holidays I had to explain that Slovenia is NOT Slovakia
and I had to explain that to two Germans who are travelers
Idk man
I think that this joke is something that pretty much only Americans (British as well maybe
) use
I've never heard about the France surrender joke in real life and 95% of time I encounter it is on Reddit
That is because Italy occupies the surrender joke position in Slovenia
And the Balkans, generally
Wasn't it also the Weimar Republic that put heavier regulations on civilian firearm ownership
Movie Blades of Glory was translated into Drkajva skupaj
Drkati is very old expression for skating - more then 100 years from its use, but even then expression drsati was much more common
Today, drkati is exclusively used for male masturbation - jerking off
So Blades of Glory was translated into "Let's masturbate together"
Well
The titles of cartoons and shows are fucked up
Like "Lost" is "Izgubljeni otok" which in singles is "Lost Island". This comes on the top of my head
There are probably more but I am on the English stead of the Slovenian internet
House in Slovenian is "Zdravnikova vest" or in English - Doctors Conscience
HAHA
I found out what "drkanje" meant a few weeks ago lol
If you put the Slovenian translation in English you get "Let's masturbate together"
Does nobody in Slovenia look at translations
I guess this wording was used intentionally to rise eyebrows, but as this is movie with very poor reviews it was mostly passed without notice
I was once looking trough tv guide and saw it on tv schedule on one popular Slovene station during the day hours so I was quite sure it wasn't porn but typographical error
But when I checked the description of the movie, the first line of description was from the Slovene dictionary (SSKJ) of what drkati means
"iz Slovarja slovenskega knjižnega jezika: drkati -am nedov
(r) zastar
večkrat zdrsniti, zdrkniti: potne kapljice so mu drkale po čelu
drsati se: gledala je, kako fantje drkajo po ledu; otroci so se hodili na potok drkat
Pojasnilo glede prevodov naslovov filmov: prevod filmskega naslova je izbira distributerja in ne prikazovalca
I know
Still quite dumb
"Drkati" is today referred to as jerking themself
And show "Lost" is "Izgubljeni otok" which that in English is "Lost island". What kind of Janšist thinks of these translations
i actually always thought kazakhstan was a democracy
i mean i never even heard of nazarayev
are the other stans all dictatorships too
SO you're saying that the man who brought an end to the tyrannical USSR communist rule over Kazakhstan and established a blistering free-market free-enterprise oriented liberal democracy, wasn't such a good guy
uhhhhhhh, what
English stags need to be banned in Europe
We are all sick of them
I'm serious
Can you brits fo something about it pleasw
It's about 30 °C here, which is fairly normal for this time of year
Nights suck ass though
I'm too cheap to buy one so I suffer in silence instead :D
Sometimes
This week it was actually pretty chill
About 25C.
I think it has a lot to do with the centralist model around which the french state and the french nation developed
The french territory was more or less unified already at the end of the middle ages with the main centre of power located in Paris
This got even more prominent with the rise of absolutism
When the french revolution came and the nation started to form its national identity and spread it among the people, and when the organization of the state started to develop in the post-revolution time, it employed an extremely centralized and top-down model
As a consequence Paris became by far the most important economic centre where all the population started to move during the demographic rise that accompanied the industrial revolution
All other cities remained far behind
Even today you can observe that France is the only big european coubtry that has one megacity and no other urban centre comparable by its size
If you look Germany, Italy or Spain, they all have at least two large urban areas of comparable size
First of all is that per mile or kilometer
Idk where are you from, you don't have a tag next to your name
Slovenians are born with work as soon as they're born, found on a podcast
That's typically Belgian :o ? I thought we were the only nation this mad
I know a number of people who consider building and renovating a hobby
That really depends on the person
I helped renovate 2 flats now and I vaguely hated it, also now I have to live with what we did
On the other hand, people who hired workers to do it for them admit it is a generally an unmitigated disaster, reliable and responsible workers are rarer than unicorns
If you do it yourself, you at least saved some money and you know anything wrong is your own fault
My father used to say he is Bosnian (not Bosniak), now he proclaims himself as Serb from Bosnia
Jesenice
Although all the images online seem to try and hide it's uglyness
Everyone in Slovenia will spit the name out if you ask them this question
It's an ugly industrial town in the middle of beautiful scenery
La Spezia is alright, imo
Been there a few times, and I've got zero complaints about its looks
Imo, some of the Sicilian cities take the cake for the ugliest city, but that's only my opinion
I was looking for an answer from a fellow Slovene
I agree
I had a coworker who moved from Ljubljana to Jesenice
I would also say Jesenice
Also Trbovlje, Hrastnik, Velenje and Nova Gorica
I was curious if anyone from Austria will have had a similar experience since it's so close to the boarder
The town really sticks out in a bad way
... ...  why
If I remember correctly his girlfriend was from there and wanted to stay near her parents
It makes even less sense if I tell you that he worked (and still works) in Ljubljana
None of it makes sense but I wish him well
Because most European countries are generally more reserved
No shouting in public unless absolutely necessairy, no talking to strangers, even smalltalk is, at least in Slovenia, just a way to make yourself unpopular and annoying
"Slovenia is a democratic republic"
And even that very short statement is now being undermined by our current extreme far right PM
We used to do it on r/slovenia but i got old because we ran out of words that rhyme with dečki (dudes)
This is a bit out of context, but this thread just made me a bit sad I don't speak more languages
So many memes go over my head ;\_;
Danes je sreda, moji dečki
(Well, not anymore)
We tell people to bring their own slippers to a party
It's way less messy, but you do need space for all the shoes
Prekmurje
Poor guys have to live in a flat plains
No mountains, no hills - just flat terrain
Empty horizon :/.
Goričko is pretty hilly (kind of)
Lendavske gorice as well
Well, they still have the Goričko
Its not like when I was traveling trough Poland: 5 hours of train and everything was totally flat
But yeah, as a slovenian I would have a hard time to live in a totally flat rural area like that
Actually I would not live in the Dolenjska region either
Just too many super religious rednecks for my tastes
I've seen pictures of Schwerin and it looks beautiful
Also aren't there a lot of lakes
They could develop some quality trourism there + it's not far from Berlin and Hamburg
Oh, they have a lot of canals and other water features
That makes the landscape a tiny bit less boring
Well, traveled trough western Hungary and it was quite hilly here and there
I remember a town at the slopes of a really funky looking hill, don't know the name of it
I seem to remember plenty of stories about a quite brutal Hungarization in what's today Slovenian Prekmurje, so it's ironic that you'd consider yourself a colony
Maybe "junior colonialist partner" in the partnership with Austria would've been a better term to use
Well we have dual form which is pretty unique for languages in Europe
Slovene doesn't really have swear words
To curse, you either use a borrowed word form former Yugoslavian languages, say literaly 'curses
' or possibly 'damn
' (not sure which is a closer translation), or there are some traditional not really curse words that are just funny, like 'pasja taca' (dog paw) or 'tristo medvedov' (three hundred bears)
We have duality instead of just singularity and plurality in Slovene :
sestra - a sister
sestri - 2 sisters
sestre - 3 sisters
Haha just wanted to say that
I love that we have dual
"Midva" is supposed to be the most beutiful word in our language because it menas "us two". I think a few languages have dual but not many
I love turkish
Such a beautiful language
My ex boss was turkish and it was interesting how many words we picked up from you guys
You were everywhere haha
I actually had no idea ancient Greek had dual
You learn something new everyday
Like how there are separate forms for singular and plural, there's also a form for exactly 2 of a thing
Imagine:
1 Chair, 2 Chairs, 3 Chairs - except the 2 chairs have a separate form
Yeah Slovene definitely isn't completely unique but it is still pretty uncommon
I'd say a more accurate comparison would be a Bosnian with a stick up their ass
Haha I love to hear how others hear our language
My ex said, before he knew our culture, that we sound disappointed
Which was really funny because the stereotype is that we're pretty whiny
I love how this completely ignored that half of the Slavic words are actually Slovene in origin
So, like English where you sometimes say 'you two' or 'a pair of'
In Slovenian it would be:
1 stol
**2 stola**
3 stoli
4 stoli
5 stolov
6 stolov
Yeah that's how dual works in Slovene, too
It changes the end of the word (for example: 1 stol -> 2 stola)
It is, however, mandatory
1 stol
2 stola
3 stoli
Croatian has something different (that is, an alternative plural form for lower numbers), whereas Slovene has a distinct form for exactly 2 of something
I did not know that, interesting
We also have the special plural, but for 3-4 and then 5+ :
4 stoli, 5 stolov
Summer time for sure
In the summer we would keep sunlight in the evenings and in the winter we would have an extra hour of sunlight in the afternoon so you could go for a walk
The only downside is that we would have darkness until about 8
20 in december
Same in Slovenia
It's not unusual for some cafes to open at 6am (before COVID), so people can go for a quick coffee before work
Slovenia as well
We had two who escaped prison few years ago and they wouldn't get any additional years for escaping
Venice, instead of stealing cars you would be stealing gondolas
The Postojna Cave
It's a beautiful cave, but you pay 20 euros (or 25 eur, not sure) of entrance fee per person to have a 30 mins "run" trough the cave with almost no explanation or entertainment from the guide, in a group that is usually too large to feel engaged anyway
Plus stalagmites and stalactites are nice too see, but that's really all you will see
On the contrary in the Škocjan caves you have the stalagmite and stalactite part which later evolves into a massive underground gorge with waterfalls and a magnificent exit in the green dolina
A much more interesting and diverse experience in my opinion
We are supposed to hate our neighbours, alchoholic and suicidal
I barely interact with neighbours, dont drink alchohol and havent commited suicide so far
I sure fit some
I'm an emancipated woman married to a slightly effeminate man, fitting the ex-yu stereotype like a glove
I'm also pretty sporty, love skiing and climbing mountains, and I totally wear the company soft-shell while doing it (but at least it's not Akrapovič)
I spend part of my summer on Croatian coast
I however don't drive a VW Passat TDI, Salomon shoes generally don't fit me and I don't plan on building my own house if I can avoid it
edit: spelling
You could do a beer flavoured mayo though
I have no idea what we did to Sacha Baron Cohen, that he hates us so much, but
First in Ali G he as Ali G proposes a policy to only allow fit women refugees into UK, and sends a ugly looking chick "back to Slovenia".
And now in the new Borat movies he calls Slovenia a "shithole", and uses the story of Melania as a way to frame the story of Borat's daughter
BTW I hope you get, I'm not actually mad at this, it's just funny two of his movies both have a negative view of Slovenia
BTW "go back to Slovenia" was kind of a meme/catchphrase when Ali G in da house came out
It's a heresy for sure, but is it a tasty heresy
How would that even work
Put cheese in goulash and serve it on fresh bread
I suppose the cringiest moment was in the mocumentary Sicko, where the scene of supposed Slovene health system was actually taken from our comedic serial
Wait what
That happened
I feel like I need to do some googling
> Eastern-European
Please, central for about 1300 years
And then 50 years of non-aligned, so neither west nor east
And now 30 years of central again
Also our [median person's HDI] and [median person's net wealth] seem to place us in a quite interesting position
Look at the guy, comes over so innocently and throws the most universal insult you can use on Slovenes :D
I believe existence of Central Europe as a unit is covered in geography as well
Pretty sure whoever put them in just did a mix of exYu stuff
Both Roman and Niko as short for Nikola could be something a Slovenian would do, for example
And we have plenty of -ić surnames here
The tricky part is that he fought in the war, so he definitely wasn't Slovenian
But theoretically, it could be that one of his parents was Slovenian, for example
At the very least that would clear up the naming inconsistent with both Croatian and Serbian
On the other hand, there's no excuse for the most expensive game of all time back then to not have a single person point out that the last name likely doesn't end in "ick", considering last names ending in "ich" is one of the single most common tropes about Slavs
But the one time where they could've generalized, they didn't.
I have two conspiracy theories
The first one is that the real Tito was swaped with a russian spy, who then ruled over Yugoslavia
The second one isn't that interesting, but there is a conspiracy theory about the death of our famous writer, Ivan Cankar
The official cause of death is that he died of disease, but some people speculate he was murdered by some government officials because he said some weird things about slovenian nation and some higher ups didn't like it and got rid of him
Tick-borne meningitis is pretty common in Slovenia and somewhat rare generally in Europe
This is obviously because Germans intentionally infected the ticks to weaken the partisan resistance during WWII
My mom, a firm believer in this theory, told that Tito used to speak slovenian and croatian, but when he came back from Soviet Union, he could not say a word in slovenian
And there were some physical references she believes chaged after he came back
And he came back from Soviet Union because the russian send him to rule over Yugoslavia
Idk, it's weird
I'mma just leave [this] "Map of Slovene Lands" from the mid-19th century here and show myself out
> In Italy we often joke about reconquering Istria and in particular the city of Fiume (Rijeka, Croatia)
There are still some Italians living there
I can say almost the same as a Slovenian (about Istria and a few other islands in Croatia like Krk, Cres, and Lošinj) because there are a lot of Slovenian tourists there
I also need to mention that the most common joke in Slovenia is about Trst (Trieste) in Italy since it was ours in the past and a lot of Slovenian people still live there
We will help you get back Rijeka in exchange for Trieste (Trst)
> Not sure if joking or serious:
> Central Europe
And that's why we're having the most fun =_=
Trieste is Slovenian :P
You mean in English
That's just because we didn't want to scare native English speakers with a vowel-less-looking word like Trst
Well, you may want to read up on the [etymology] of that name
Apparently not
Read the link
Yup, but that just means that you can't use the origin of the name to justify whose the city is, since it predates both
For the record, this entire thing about Trieste being Slovenian is a joke to most Slovenes, so I'm not actually trying to argue that in all seriousness
Federal EU is where my <3 is at
Slavic cultures aren’t western
Surely you don’t consider communism as the defining characteristic of Slavic cultures
How would you view for example Czech culture if not in the context of Western cultures heavily influenced by Western Christianity and Greco-Roman culture
you get here 3 or 2 days of paid leave for moving
for your own wedding you get 3 days off, 2 days for your children wedding
for child birth you get 2 days leave; and then extra paternal (30 days), maternal (105 days) and parental (260days) leave
for your child or husband/wife death 3 days, for parents 2 days, for sister/brother death or grandparents only 1 day
for natural disaster if your life, health or property is in danger 3 days
you also get a paid leave (1 day) when your child goes to school for the first time
> 3 or 5 days per year for caring for sick children (edit; this is a common feat from private companies, but it's not mandatory)
3 days
what if they have a flu or something
They just send them sick to school/kindergarten after those 3 days
Here it's 7 (school kids and adults) and 15 days (kindergarten kids and special needs) everytime they're sick
And if they don't get better in that time frame you can get up to 6 months from your doctor, if you need more then it's decided by a commission
This made me laugh so hard
We share quite a few words with our neighbors in Croatia that are spelled and pronounced the same in both languages, but mean totally different things
For example:
"Truden" in Slovenian means tired, in Croatian it's pregnant
"Vreme" in Slovene means weather, in Croatian time
"Molim" in Slovene means to pray, in Croatian it means please
"Zahod" in Slovene is west, in Croatian it's toilet
I like it here
Maybe Germany or Austria, if i had to choose another country
Malaga, Korčula or Amsterdam
I travel quite a bit, so I have this happen to me quite often
I’ve now come so far that I don’t let it bother me and just tell whoever thought I couldn’t understand what they were saying to try and not be an absolutely disgusting person in public
The first time was when 2 English-speaking girls (presumably American, judging by the accent) were talking about how “horribly” I was dressed and how fat I was in the checkout line at a grocery store
It really destroyed my sense of self-worth for the next few weeks
Walking in the streets of Zagreb, talking in Slovenian with friends, albeit quite fast
2 teenage girls are talking in Croatian behind us "What language are they speaking
They must be German
" We turn around and I say in Croatian "Uh actually, we're Slovenian". They just laugh embarassingly and go away
Oh no no, we have a saying here from the times of the old Yugo, I'm pretty sure you have it too
"Pricaj srpski da te ceo svet razume"
Not exactly Croatian, but seeing as it and Serbian are so similar ^(\*cough\* almost identical \*cough\*) and the huge diaspora between all the ex-yugo countries (about 10M people in total) it's no wonder you found someone who could understand you
Oh damn yeah that is a bit more of a long shot haha
The "other" deck we use here, next to the French, is the German/Bavarian deck, which is also called Hungarian here for some reason
(maybe only locally in my region
i have also seen such an abomination, lmao
Whaat
Are these used for regular card games
I have never seen them before
We don't use Spanish ones, but we use Italian ones for certain card games like briškola (briscola)
At least in Primorska it's very popular
We have them to, of course not nearly as pouplar as french
30+°C hell on earth
15+°C - t-shirt
15-5°C - sweater
5-0°C - light spring jacket
below zero - winter coat
It depends though
Last week I went hiking
It was a cold but sunny dry windy day, 6°C at the top of the plateau
It felt just right in t-shirt
The same temperature with high humidity would probably see me in jacket
Below 5°C is warm jacket cold
Below 0 is coat cold
My car just said it was 2°C outside this morning, I was still in my autumn jacket, and I was lucky i got the parking spot close to the door
I'm entirely prepared to go out in any cold we get here (it's rarely below -20), but the reasons for it must get exponentially better the colder it is
It just takes too much effort to plan and execute the clothing so that I'm not cold and still mobile
Above 20 is hot
0 to 19 is t-shirt weather
-10 to 0 not really cold but I'll wear a coat, coats are cool
My experience of Belgian weather was so wet I find this pretty hard to believe
That was only 2012
I generally vote the party closest to my views, or at least one that has some ideas I find good
It did happen I hated everybody, so I put in an invalid sheet (I did the possibly pettiest thing in the world and drew a penis on it)
I think there was about 2 elections to date that I voted lesser evil, since fear of our current ruling party overcame my convictions
Ah yes, snus master race
The prices increased
I was in Kosovo last september and paid 2€ for a pack, and I saw even cheaper ones
How cheap were they before
We were in montenegro going to serbia on a roadtrip and an idea came up let’s go to kosovo while we’re down here
Hey I got a kosovo passport stamp and now I can say I’ve been to kosovo
Mistaking us for Slovakia
I doubt that
No offense, but I always thought tje Dutch preferred the Netherlands over Holland but these year when i sople to a bunch of Dutch tourists they all said: we are from Holland
And not a single person said they are from the Netherlands
It is less similar in Slovenian - Slovenia is "Slovenija", while Slovakia is "Slovaška". Only first four letters/sounds are the same, the rest is completely different
The languages are closely related and both of us essentially call ourselves 'Slavic' or 'Slav'. You would have thought the words are going to be similar
It didn't exactly depend on us as modern nations
Yes
We have a tiny coast whereas Slovakia is landlocked
On beaches with more families I've seen maybe 2 out of 100 women  sunbathe topless, most of those just laying on their stomach not showing their breasts on full display
I've seen maybe 1-3 women in my entire life walking around with their tiddies out on a beach like that (all of those were older unnatractive ones that I really did not need to see, especially as a little kid)
On beaches with more young adults, I'd say the number is up to 5 out of 100, still I'd say half of those just lay on their stomach not really showing anything
I do
In croatia a would say
3 in 10
But I don't go to super turisty beaches full of families
You could be both right
Overall if you look on beaches there is probably something like 10% average on a given time
But if you look how many women fells comfortable to take off bra at least once on a vacation when sunbathe than 50% is a bit low
Depends on what kind of beach, if its crowded, popular beach I'd say less then 5%, on a more remote  not crowded one it can be between 10-30%
But on an almost empty, smaller, secluded beaches, you would definitely see it more than one or two
No way, I was in spain for months but in Croatia people are way more open to being topless
>an average German made 1
900€ per month
Is the net average really so low
The wikipedia page says the net average is well over 2000€. Slovenia has an average of around 1200
TBH if you can you should always buy of the online lego store, shipping to slovenia is free at least for what i am trying to buy
I got sets of LEGO as gifts all the time when I was a kid and I've still got a huge box of mixed pieces
All bought in stores, not online
The most expensive one was a 120€ truck for my 10th birthday
I'd say "normal" sets are quite affordable here and tbh I haven't noticed any bigger price difference between Slo and D.

Janez Janša (current PM) twitter battles with journalists
Another fight happened yesterday, instead of lying, JJ accused a journalist of laying
Very embarrassing
Edit: Alenka Bratušek’s PPL MUST TRUST US deserves a honorary mention
Came here to look for Jadranka
Her English efforts are quite legendary in my corner of the internet
Well, after WW2 our government decided to kill anyone that might had something to do with the faschists
So there are valleys filled with bodies
The worst part was that if you came from a concentration camp you were likely to be shot as well as you were perceived as a nazi collaborator
Why isn'y Belgium here
On the other hand, I've yet to meet someone who considers executions and expulsions of Italians and Germans from what's modern day Slovenia a "horrible atrocity". It's usually met with a shrug, which I really can't blame anyone for
Oh absolutely
Slovenian here - I don't think anyone here considers modern Macedonia anything other than one of the Yugoslav constituent republics, and certainly not an entity with any relation to what we learned about in history class about antiquity
Also, the way we learn about history is that ancient Macedons were just one of the various variants of Greeks, so Big Alex is certainly considered an OG - Original Greek
Not really in Slovenia, so we'll keep those if you don't mind
For Slovenia
Tricky, as an independent nation we didn't the time (or power) to do much shitty stuff
I'd guess this might be the worst
"[The Erased] a clusterfuck of beaurocracy that left a few ten thousand people without legal status for decades
Thousands of cases are still pending
I dont have anything for independent slovenia, when we were still part of yugoslavia there were massive after war (II) murders, up until this point they have found 600 massive graves
We had simmilar "cleaning" as USSR under stalin, yugoslavia was hiding all the time, despite local people knowing about the graves
Identification of the victims started only in independent slovenia
After the war, murdering the members of the Slovene Home Guard and their families and throwing their bodies in pits
Seriously
What would the world look like today if he was accepted
We can only assume
We also have bonfires ([kres] on 30th of April but we don't have any witches we just have bonfires and drink alcohol
A Slovenian that doesnt hike and garden and is not in a feud with a neighbour
And doesnt go on vacation to Croatia
I've only met only two people in my life who had a feud with their neighbour, I've never understood that stereotype

My father is bosnian and my mother slovene
Does that make ma Croatian
Can confirm
Moon: (tista) luna - female
Sun: (tisto) sonce - neuter
The sun is neuter (sonce), while we have two words for the moon
One is luna, which is female, and mesec, which is male
Mesec can mean also "month" though
Sonce in luna
The sun is neutral, the moon is female
As a male, maybe
But I don't think many people think of them in genders
edit: although, Luna is also a female name
From what I can find on the internet, it's *Luna*, both linguistically and scientifically
*Mesec* should only be used in a poetic way
I can post a pdf link once I get off the toilet
Andrews tourist hostel in, well St
Andrews, Scotland
Don't be fooled by nice clean photos on the internet and positive comments, I bet they're writting them themselves
I am honestly baffled by the comments
This was the most disgusting place I have ever seen
You enter a hostel from the side of an old house
There's a Mexican restaurant or something at the bottom of the house
Then you climb carpeted stairs that are glued together with blue tape
The whole place stinks of food and old
The room we stayed in had one little window that couldn't be closed because it was literally rotting
Bed sheets looked like they were 70 years old and not washed in a while, beds were old and squeeky
Carpet, that was everywhere, looked disgusting
We had 2 other roomates
We were all sitting on beds, not wanting to move because everything was so disgusting
It looks like there are some homeleless people living there permanently
We went out, came back at 10pm, went to sleep with normal clothes on because no one had the guts to even check the shower rooms and we wanted to get the hell out first thing in the morning
We were supposed to stay for 2 nights
I am not overreacting, this was a horrible hostel
At least the location was really good
And the price was very cheap
I guess you get what you pay but this hostel was rotten and not worth even 0,10€.
One of more memorable incidents on a school trip to Italy:
A guy tried to scam (I guess you could call it that) a schoolmate of mine when he put a bracelet on his wrist and expected him to pay for it - of course without the kid asking for it in the first place
So he said "I don't want that, go away". And the Italian guy went absolutely bananas
"You no say go away to me
You say go away to your mother, your father, your brother, your sister, but you no say go away to me
Luckily our guide intervened and calmed the Italian down before anything worse happened
I always have copies of my ID and/or passport in at least 2 different bags and you can give it to people who you're travelling with as well
That's one of the biggest rules of travelling
Well nowadays it's easier to keep a copy in a cloud or mail or something you can access from everywhere, if you're going to a country with sure internet access
How can E.R. be closed
Same in Tunisia
A hotel employee literally asked my 14 at the time cousin to stay with him at night infront of our parents
And there were so many other incidents targeted at women in our group that by the end of the holiday it just felt normal
Ridiculous
We had a giant scorpion in a bathroom in Tozeur, Tunisia
No one took a shower that day
We threw a towel over it
I can't find the hostel on hostelworld anymore, which is where we booked it from
My bet is that they removed it because it was so bad
I really hope it's not operational anymore
When I got home I wanted to write to St Andrews mayor or whatever they have, that's how bad it was
Hmm, I wonder if this is a thing
We stayed in another hostel that looked like it had permanent 'guests'. But at least that one was clean
Yea I'm not doing hostels anymore either
Unless I go to Japan again
I've seen all kinds of people use them there and they're all so nice and welcoming
I think I was there 2 or 3 years ago
Maybe they cleaned it up
Hopefully
But it's not on hostelworld anymore
No definitely not
But if you lose your passport it will be easier to prove your identity
You moved tents because of a little hedgehog
Have you considered picking it up with a towel or something
For my country Slovenia, it is German and Italian
I have English C1, German B2, Italian A1 and Spanish B1
Spanish
I see a lot of ads asking for it
Germans usually speak english well, spaniards, not so much (no offence guys)
I mean I'm from Slovenia and that used to be common here as well
Was never once considered an Italian thing though
Well, Germany is still brutal when it comes to protecting its interests even with "fellow EU nations" to the east and south, but at least it's not slaughtering people this time, so that's progress
Seriously though, I like Germany in general, but a downgrade on the arrogance towards poorer countries in general and Slavs in particular wouldn't hurt
AIN'T NOBODY GOING TO TRACK ME WITH MY ID

Learning grammar would be very hard, but possible
Getting to a native pronounciation and accent
Basically impossible
Jesus, did you jinx Michael Robinson
Because he reportedly passed away yesterday
Funny how you say that, while i was actually confused as a native a few times
I am not Italian
> the vast majority of people in the UK are quite frankly rubbish at Grammar
So we have Americans messing up "their/they're/there" and "could/would/should of". What's the most common British grammar mistakes
Or is it the same set
Oh boy
If we count different sets of case endings for the "same gender" as a different gender, Slovenian has 12
I'm gonna use this now to scare foreigners, thanks for the idea :D
In case anyone's curious, see below
-e is the genitive ending, "npr
" == "e.g.". Sklanjatev == declension
male
- prva moška sklanjatev (korak, -a)
- druga moška sklanjatev (sluga, -e)
- tretja moška sklanjatev (c, npr
v visoki c visokega c)
- četrta moška sklanjatev (dežurni, -ega)
female
- prva ženska sklanjatev (lipa, -e)
- druga ženska sklanjatev (perut, -i)
- tretja ženska sklanjatev (mami, Karmen ...)
- četrta ženska sklanjatev (dežurna, -e)
neuter
- prva srednja sklanjatev (mesto, -a)
- druga srednja sklanjatev (jaz, mene -i)
- tretja srednja sklanjatev (tri, npr
v tri deljeno s pet)
- četrta srednja sklanjatev (Krško, -ega)
Thank you France for everything

I hope I can live there one day
Germany and Austria for helping us win our independence
Singapore for supplying rifles to us, even is ammunition caused lots of horrible deaths on Yugoslav side
Vatican for starting the wave of recognitions of our independence
Austria during the Habsburg years for developing our country, which is still seen in our everyday life
The UK and the US for supplying our Partisans with weapons and heavy armaments
All good
(I didn't even know we were invited
We're thankful for your generous contribution to our road budget too ;)
Much love :D
So, I came here to cover these things, and now I end up learning some things I hadn't even heard about
Singapore supplied us with weapons
TIL
I'd also add a thanks to Croatia for being the one neighbor we were never at war with, and I can't wait for you guys to join Schengen, so the stupid border checks can be a thing of the pre-WW1 past again
Been there, it is so beautiful
I absolutely loved it
I would prefer to be on the outskirts a bit, a nice house in smaller village or town <3 But first I at least need a remote job
Singapore supplied us with SAR (Singapore Assault Rifle), which were using 5,56 NATO ammo
The gun caused serious wounds, the bullet had enough velocity to tear through body but not enough to break bones
It caused the bullet to turn into a pinball inside human body, bouncing from bone to bone and tearing organs
Doctors were helpless
Yes I do and you can see this "European culture" in threads where we wonder why Americans do certain things and where Americans wonder why we do certain things
Europeans are different but we do have a same view and culture about certain things
I believe in both
I am a European but I am also Slovene
I don't think we should loose our national identities because it enriches Europe
I think it's what makes us great (thanks Trump for ruining that word forever)
It also provides some security I think
Because a huge entity has its issues
I can't help but look at America and be worried
> Millions of men have been willing to fight and die and kill for their national and religious identities, but I have yet to encounter a man willing to do so for something as nebulous as Europe
Millions (well, thousands) of men were willing to fight and die for their feudal lords and gods, but I have yet to encounter a man in year 200 AD who's willing to do so for something as nebulous as the United Kingdom
Hey there Croatia
We just sell guns to yall

Yes
One is in the [shower] and the [other] is outside of bathtub/shower on bathroom floor
Entire Slovenia felt it
I'm in [Celje] and it was bad
It woke me up and I was just waiting if I'll have to hide somewhere
I also felt another one around 7:02
I can't imagine how horrible it felt in Zagreb
Just a bit more perspective:
Nuclear power plant Krško is just 40 km away from Zagreb
No damages here, but it woke me up all right
Everything in my room was shaking
Unsettling shit
2020 _please_. Haven't we had enough
I live 75 km away from Zagreb but I was asleep and didn't feel anything
Friends said that they felt it and woke up
I guess I'm kind of used to shaking now as I live next to a quarry and can often feel explosions
felt it when i was sleeping though it wasnt that bad
Can confirm
I live on the coast and didn't feel a thing
I woke up all of a sudden, didn't know why
i found out later
And yet I didn't wake up
I didn't feel anything in Ljubljana
Lake bled turned red
Several injured, 15 yo girl in critical condition (has already been reported dead but that has just been denied by the hospital) according to the main croatian media
I hope she makes it
Im in Sarajevo as well and there was no shaking
>damn draft
Promaja, the first, second and third cause of death in the Balkans

I got the joke, but who/what is Székely

Yeah, Slovenia and Croatia together already had a trifecta in less than a month
Meteor, virus, earthquake
And it also snowed in some parts today
Do you know what exploded
Or at least tell us in which city
That was fast
I thought it was a last name

I like it
Small (2 hour drive from the Alps to the seaside), one of the safest countries, solid standard of living, solid education and health systems
Could do with a bit less blatant corruption, but this is sort of a consequence of living in a small country where most people know most people :D
I like life here
Slovenia is safe, egalitarian, fairly progressive, has good infrastructure, good social safety nets and a high standard of living
I, however don't like the political situation at all
Janša is highly corrupt and buds with Orban, fortunately he has plenty of opposition
&#x200B;
If things do go to shit however, I'll most likely move to Austria, or failing that, Croatia
I never feel too far from home there
Move the frick out
No good food like Doritos, we have no Spotify, I don't know were to find Persona 5 royal, no foreign food
At least McDonalds icecream machine works
Good btw
could say so
I'm from here, yes :)
All young (under 40) people speak more or less solid English and a lot of older folk as well
Tourism is good, but our coast, while O.K.-ish is not the best part
That would be the Bled and Bohinj lakes (in my opinon), some spas and Prekmurje region
Finding a "tourist farm" to sleep etc
is quite great
100 %
I love it
Slovenia is very diverse naturally and culturally
On the west we have contact with romance speaking Europe, on the north with germanic Europe and we are a slavic speaking country that has contact with the slavic Balkans on the south side
And all these diverse cultures influenced us
Then geographically we have the sea, we have the Alps, we have the pannonian plain and large areas of beautiful hilly landscape
We have also the northernmost tip of the dinaric mountain range, with a typical karstic labdscape and large plateaus covered with forests
We can grow grapes and olive trees
We have a mediterranean and a continental temperate climate
I think that we really have no reason to complain
Lada Niva was very popular
Lada overall was also pretty popular
But we had our own domestic cars that were cheaper and about as (un)reliable
I think it would be customary here to ask how much we owe
If he was to take the 10% literally he would have given the 1€, but I get what you're saying
Edit: Nope I'm just a little stupid
That's how they do it in Lidl and Hofer here
One reason why I don't like going there if I have a lot to buy
You have to throw everything in to the cart and bag it at the counter
Although they calmed down a bit now
When they first arrived here it was chaos
No, you sit down here and they come and take your order
We also did that in Scotland
Sat down and waited for a long time for someone to come which they never did
Then we saw other people go directly to the counter
Weird
Except when bar is packed then you go and other because otherwise they won't see you
In great Balkan country of Slovenia we do for  quite a long time and [Ljubljana] is really successful
Some Croatian cities are also recycling pretty well
Yeah I just checked my math, it told me I'm dumb
Was thinking of 10% of 10€. Sorry
I don't think it's most
Maybe a few
You even need to buckle up your pets here or have them in a transporter which need to also be secured
Most original Slovenian fairy tales and stories are dark af
My mother had to forbid my grandmother from reading them to me since I wouldn't sleep at night after them
I don't remember too much about them, but I think people tended to get lost to magical entities a lot and only sporadically returned, and there was a mass murder of dog-headed people
Oh we had the same game here
"Kdo se boji črnega moža?" I always imagined this black man as some kind of boogey man and not like actual black person
I formed a theory that the black man is in fact reffered to the Moors
Sailors brought back stories of Moors kidnapping people, hence the game
IDK this might just be my ramblings :)
Exactly, I imagined him as a black fat scarecrow
r/unexpectedmontypython
My friend once had an erasmus student from the Czech republic in his dorm
One day he came home saying that he found a cool bar nearby
After some talk, they realized the bar was 4km away
Not really 'nearby' by our standards
I'm not a native speaker but I can speak English for as long as I can remember
I've always associated cheers with Australian English in the Cheers mate/Steve Irwin way
But then again I grew up watching crocodile hunter on animal planet so that could be the reason lol
Well, I don't really feel 'Slovene' but at the same time I don't feel like anything else, really
Besides, people put too much emphasis on national identity, so I'm not too worried about it
Certainly not seen like that
It's seen as acceptable on certain occasions although obviously not any time
In rural areas it's a lot more common
Aye
In rural aread it is an everyday standard
Lots of people getting wasted at local bars and restaurants
Oh, you mean šnops
We have a similar saying "klin se s klinom zbija".
There is also some truth to that because of how alcohol gets digested/transformed inside the liver
He's probably feom ljubljana
I only know of 1 and I am still baffeled why it is there and how it got there but generaly no they are not
We never had that before
We didn't have religious extremists
Now unfortunately people are copying the US and yes, we actually have jesus loves you billboard that take you to antiabortion sites
Another issue that was never a thing before they started copying americans
there are, actually
They are far more passive and I usually see them when going home from school
Most common theme is 'Jesus loves you'. Honestly don't mind them that much, since they're not as up-front
Never seen one of those here
But we do have some large billboards advertising a certain right wing party
Which is even worse
I know of a couple, but they are rare enough to make you turn and recheck if you saw correctly
One is adjacent to a church anyway and they often put up some motivational quote instead of an actual religious message (it currently reads 'If something is important, you will find a way -  if it is not, you will find an excuse
I saw another just yesterday and it read 'God is the way' or something rather neutral like that
It also looked like the graphic designer did his job for the first time ever
We also have some weird youth organisation that promotes Christian values that sometimes puts cringy billboards up, but I'm not opening their website to give an example
Where is it
I don't think I've ever seen anything like that here
I've also seen one
It is in front of a church but I don't know if it counts because it's usually more like general motivation to be kind to others
I've seen quite a few
It's on this building:
Huh I wonder why google street view cuts out just before that village and restarts after O_o

Every time I hear portuguese my brain goes "ok, this sounds like us, but i can't understand a single thing
Must be portuguese
“Burek”, it’s not Slovene in origin but here you’ll find it everywhere in the major cities, it’s essentially fried flaky dough with fillings such as meat and the like
I don't think we have any that would be typical ours, they're all "stolen". The two most common would have to be Burek and Kebab
That's just a normal hot dog here
No one thinks it's anything special
> Schnitzelsemmel
That's the typical food you pack in your backpack when you go hiking here
Some people hang them up for holidays, and they are also used for sporting events
I think it wouldn't be weird if someone owned one
For Slovenia it's normal to be hung up on certain holidays
It was an
*interesting* experience coming out of the airport in Copenhagen and there were a lot of people at the exit waving small danish flags, looking a lot like what a reception for some VIP would look like here
Too little competition in the market of telecommunication services
If you don't care for a pack of internet, TV, stationary and mobile phones, there is little choice and it is comparatively way more expensive
The housing crisis is real
Housing prices have gone up 15% in 2020 alone
The average price of houses sold in Ljubljana last year was 330,000 € while the average gross salary is 1,753 €/month (which comes to 1,133 € after taxes)
I don't know who is the owner of infrastructure and I don't think it is as much of an issue as forcing the packet deals
I don't care for TV and stationary phone, my company pays for my mobile (if I even cared to have it in the pack, there are better options available), so I only need fast internet
It is something like 70% the price of the 4-pack
Also another issue is that the providers can change conditions like price and force them on you with no repercussions
You can switch 'for free' then, except they are going to make you pay off all the discounts they gave you
You chose this provider for the price, they changed it, and it is extremely expensive to go somewhere else before the contract is up
When fibre came around, they jacked up the prices
When 4G came around, they jacked up the prices
Let's just say I'm not holding my breath for change
If I remember correctly, our history teacher showed us a video where a children's cartoon was interrupted with news of Tito's death in May 1980
Can't find the video anywhere, so no link
Sorry
Now everything is left vs right though
I'm really sick of it
Yes and we're mocking them for it, yet we're gulping up exactly what brought them where they are
We want to feel superior and hate so badly that we'll take everything down
It's tragic because it's so preventable
I haven't been to the the US but what I see online and in the media is awful
People despise each other
I once tried asking lefties (I consider myself pretty left), who were completely against the idea of getting along what the end goal is
They are so fueled by hate that no one had an answer
I think it has a lot to do with their media and how dramatic americans are
They have been led to believe that you have to constantly fight everyone for what "is right" but what is right is very up to interpretation
They mock and hate people who advocate for getting along
I really don't want us to end up that way
~~Jurij~~ Jur, used for a thousand
Usually for money
Jurija evrov (euros) is 1000€. Can be also used for other currencies or even other measurments
It is not  official, just used in talked language
We use Krigl for beer too, I much prefer the Krigl glasses than the more modern wine-looking glasses for beer
And we use Klaftra/Klafter for firewood as well
Woops, true
I'mma nominate the [Škocjan caves] in Slovenia
> and OFC
Lake Bled, Slovenia
PLS NO
We have so many much better things
Lake Bohinj
Soča river valley, Škocjan caves if we're going by natural beauty
I mean thanks for the nomination, but seriously, Bled is sooo overrated -_-
The music
I learnt to appreciate some of it, like Avsenik and Slak
[This] and [this] are one of the nicest songs ever
I can't even believe I'm able to admit it
Same actually, I used to detest it
I think the main thing that changed it for me was giving the classics like Avsenik and Slak a fair try
I also quite like some of the songs by Beneški fantje, especially because of the clear Italian influence in their music
Rdeči cvet is my favouriet obviously
Not sure what you mean, since there's pretty much 1:1 mapping between Serbian Cyrillic and Latin alphabets, and we could easily represent Russian Cyrillic with Latin characters just as well without requiring any special new characters beyond the soft and hard signs
Mostly countries that we were fully or partially part of
Austria(if that counts as we were basically Austrian for centuries )
France
Germany/HRE
Italy/Rome
Probably Turkey because of Turkish raids
Francia would also be studied quite a lot
Austria, Hungary, Italy for sure, then France, maybe Russia
Also the Roman empire
Yeah, I included that with Italy
nothing has intrinsic value
not goods, not money (which is called fiat money because its value is set by the government/society and is not pegged to a physical good)
virtual goods have "value" because there is a demand for them
that is why there are chinese world of warcraft gold digging bots and league of legends account selling
how is this different from gambling for monopoly money or some such worthless item
because as soon as people spend actual cash on it, that is what its value becomes
really
what is its intrinsic value
thats not a value
those arent VALUES, those are properties
you dont understand
the properties are intrinsic, the value is given to it by people
people who VALUE it are driven to "kill societies for it", its not something the gold does intrinsically on its own
shoes dont care about feet, people do
food or water doesnt care about being consumed, people do
once again, people are giving them values , those values are not intrinsic to the object/item
Slovenians don't post memes
But on r/Slovenia I saw neon genesis Evangelion opening but it was Janez Janša lol
i couldn't stop laughing lol
Noone really, Austria looks down on us, balkan thinks of us like we are part of Austria
Personally, culturally we are very close to Austrians, so I do feel at home, when im there, and Austria is SO beautiful
How is life in Greenland
Wow, that was so sweet, yes many people kinda know how to speak Croatian, because of Yugoslavia, my generation (after 1991) don't really know the language that well, we do have plenty of Bosnians here who really like to talk loudly in public spaces, meaning i do get to learn some words, there isn't a sentence they say, without a curse word lol
The difference is though, that unlike Croatia, Slovenia was basically almost entirely destroyed by Austria
If history had gone just a little bit differently we would have been like the Sorbs
Just look at post WW1, already tiny Slovenia was looking to be half it's modern size and landlocked
Slovenia's history was basically having been almost completely assimilated mostly by Austria to the point of being 90% identical
Southern Austrians, like Carinthians and Styrians, literally are largely just Slovenes that started speaking German
That is why we have so much more in common with Austria than Croatia
Austria entirely defined Slovenia, if Austria didn't exist nowadays Slovenia would basically be a slightly smaller Austria
Croatia is really close to Slovenia, but it's just like I said, I personally see almost no difference whatsoever when I go to Austria
Only the language changes
With Croatia though, while our two countries are similar, once you exit the roughly Kajkavian speaking region, the Mediterranean and Balkan influences are definitely much stronger and more noticeable
In contrast to Austria where the entire country feels the same
We're just not important enough for any of them to realise that though
This is a tradition in Slovenia too, but during Easter, not as a wedding tradition
If given the opportunity, how would you redesign your country's flag
My boyfriend said a lighter blue and green instead of red would make more sense, considering our jerseys tend to be colored that way
Yeah, I love unique flags
UK's is one of my favourites
Japan, Canada and Kenya's are also beautiful
Between all the other Nordic crosses and the other countries with Union Jacks in their flags I fail to see how the UK's flag is any more unique than tricolour flags
Yeah
It's a huge plus
Happy Cake Day
I'm assuming you're trying to turn it into a Scottish flag, but in that case you'd have to remove the horizontal ones
I agree
I think a nice lime green would fit pretty well
I think a flat colour for the background wouldn't work that well
Especially white
I'd say the 3rd one
Interesting note about purple - historically, purple dye was really expensive (why is why purple flags weren't a thing)
Now that we're in the modern era with synthetic dyes, purple is actually a viable choice
Dammit, your pun is better
Replacing the red not the blue
No, definitely not
But it'd be odd if you had a job and didn't help with expenses, like paying some bills and buying food
Not really, no
Maybe baby human fish could be it
One of them, Viktor, lost his leg in a fight but it grew back
I once heard an American describe Slovenian language as "German-Russian language".
Looking at text messages: Where are all the vowels
Actual language: Woah, how tf can words like "Vrtec" or "Čmrlj" exist
Sorry to all the Dutch people but to me Dutch sounds like fake German
Croatia for the beaches
Don't kill me
And you are still trying to steal our Piranski zaliv
Ever since my neighbours blind boyfriend walked in
I live in an apartment and it has happened that people walked into the wrong flat so I do lock them
But my parents live in a house and they usually keep the door unlocked

99% of people, including busses, don't have winter tires on yet, so it causes a traffic collapse, trees still carry leaves and can get broken, and in the end it just melts and autumn is suddenly wet again, only no beautiful colours are left
We had that in (I think) 2012 last in Ljubljana, it was the city marathon day
University of Ljubljana is the best, biggest and oldest, but Maribor is not far behind

In daily life not so much for example you don't need to bribe a doctor to get a proper service in a hospital
But corruption in politics or in major construction projects that is completely different story
[Ansambel Lojzeta Slaka - Studenček]
I'm a big fan of nuclear power and I really hope we get some EU funding for the second block
It might give us the much needed push to get it done
Same
I absolutely hate airports and flying takes so long, that it would be much more efficient to go by train
We really screwed up by relying on airplanes instead of building better railway systems
Came here to mention an EU-wide network of nuclear powerplants to completely replace the fossile fuel ones and give the EU energy independence
Happy to see a fellow Slovenian is thinking the same way (even if just locally)
Sure it does
It goes towards Germany almost killing its neighbors' power grids when it surges
And towards Germany still having a horrible emissions per capita ratio from power generation, because you gotta back up sun and wind
And towards Germany paying ungodly prices for electricity
So it goes towards the worst of all worlds
Well in case mass orders would drive the cost down, sure :D Nuclear is not always the most cost-effective idea, it really depends on available resources and pre-existing infrastructure
That would be a good idea for an EU regulation - absolute prohibition of opening new coal plants to be extended to any sort of fossil fuel plants by 2045
Choosing between 2 and 3 is like choosing between supporting global warming and supporting an irrational fear

Some are quite nice, I would prefer most of them instead of today popular 3 letters names
Whether or not raisins belong in a [potica] I personally think they don't, but according to a recent debate on our national sub, a large number of my fellow countrymen would disagree
Sounds exactly like the Union vs Laško debate in Slovenia
Raisins must be in
Not a big fan of potica in the first place, but raisins make it better
No raisins
The only reason not to put raisins in potica is if you do not like raisins
I think that divides the country more
People who like raisins and savages who don't.
In Slovenia we (colloquially) use both
How those two words are this international, I have no idea
It looks something like [this]
You put them in the nut filling
You can see them clearly at the bottom in the [picture that's on Wikipedia]
We percieve distances differently
What might be a normal work commute in big countries is a pretty long trip for us especially when you cross like 2 or 3 different regions
Also we think that countries that consider themselves small but are bigger than us are big
You basically have to learn another language if you don't want to be stuck in one place your whole life
Also, odds are you're probably gonna consume a lot of foreign media if the small amount of stuff you get at home isn't up your alley
You also typically get used to people from other countries not knowing anything at all about your country (which is both a blessing and a curse)
We get 0 cool bands/concerts
We literally have a company that organizes tickets+transfer to neighboring countries (and Germany, etc)
All of the major concerts I've been to were abroad

I feel that part
Happens to me all the time when I'm travelling, but I find it somehow amusing
People remember you more and it's often easier to find a host on Couchsurfing because they try to colour the map:)
Can relate
Literally no one speaks slovene outside slovenia, bar some minorities sprinkled around the world
There's a joke that Slovenia could win a war against America since they will never find us on the map

More as a tourist attraction than serious food

So you're saying the Slovenian minority had all those problems with quite literal Nazi-successors
Well that explains a lot
There is the Markovec highway tunnel, actually in Koper, my hometown
Firstly, I regard this tunnel a massive urban planning mistake, as the highway is just one former regular road that was tansformed in a 4 lane highway that cuts the town in half, a unique example of this kind of genius in Slovenia
It is quite clear that the plans for it were lobbied by politicians who thought they were more intellingent then skilled planners
The initial plan was actually to continue building the highway towards the next town on the sea coast itself, thus destroying its natural beauty and touristic potential
Luckily those plans changed after Slovenia became independent, deciding to do a tunnel under the hill called Markovec
Well, after the year 2004 they finally begun to think about its construction
It took 9 repetitons of the public procurement process to choose the construction company, and innumerable burocratic complications, stealmates, complaints etc, for less then 4 km of highway
Well, at least the construction went without problems and now the tunnel serves its purpose
Another example could be the 6th block of the Šoštanj coal powerplant
The decision for building it was taken in a very werd way, without a large political consensus and based on flawed assumptions
Initially it was meant to cost about half a billion euros
After the construction finished the price more then doubled, to about 1 billion and 200 million I think
It was a complete failure of project management and then of course the whole thing smelled of corruption so much, that the police and prosecutors took a special case of the case
Now a few people (inculding the former director of the powerplant) are convicted
Plus, now we know the initial assumed price of coal was estimated to be too low, it is actually higher
The whole powerplant now operates with losses and relies on imported coal instead of reliying on the coal from the near Velenje coal mine
And, as if it weren't enough, the block has regular malfunctions because of which it has to be taken off grid for several months at the time for repairs
I think this is enough for now
Don't wanna even start to speak about the second rail between Koper and Divača, for which the planning process started in 1995, with the construction (if we will be lucky) starting in 2021
I don't think so
I've been to a shopping center supermarket yesterday and everything seemed normal
I was also shopping for my grandma who has an injured leg and can't go out and I seemed the most 'panicked' if anyone looked into my shopping cart
No, but last weak I seen a guy in a supermarket parking lot wearing surgical mask and corona virus is trough last weak always on the front page of news sites
It's not like water's gonna dry up
I don't understand stocking up on toilet paper at all
Facemasks are gone, same as everywhere, and disinfectants are running low as well (couldn't find any hand sanitizer, had to get 70% ethanol from the pharmacy)
Sales of paracetamol are up too, from what I've seen and overheard
We don't expect to have to drop poo in unison tho, so no rush to buy toilet paper lol
When the shit hits the fan
is you still a fan
Facemasks have been gone for over a month
You can still order Dezikim Derm (65%) on Bent

I’m an etymology buff, so I love words that have a very interesting origin
Here are some examples in Slovene:
**hrepenenje** (desire) - comes from the word “krepeneti” (to become hard), which is related to “krepak” (strong)
No idea how this happened, but it’s interesting as its distinctly Slovene
**mavrica** (rainbow) - it’s a diminutive of “mavra” (word that was borrowed from Latin Maura) which means “woman from North Western Africa” or English “Moorish woman”. In the medieval times women from that part of the world wore very [colorful clothing] as compared to Slovenes
That’s the reason why the old Slovene word for rainbow named *pijavka* (related to piti which means to drink) was replaced with mavrica
**medved** (bear) - this is common Slavic as well
It’s a composite of med- (honey) and esti (to eat)
Bear in Slovene and Slavic is literally “honey eater”. The -v- is part of an old u-base of the proto-slavic noun mȅdъ (honey)
**zdravje** (health) - in Slovene and other Slavic languages the same meaning, often used to cheers by saying “na zdravje” meaning “to the health
”. The word is actually a composite of “sъ” and “dőrvъ”, literally meaning “good wood”.
As a Slovene Littoral that borrows heavily from Veneto/Friuli, I can agree
Depends on which of the fuckton of Littoral dialects you speak, but generally, yeah
perfect name for a turtle
Talking Tom was invented by a Slovenian man
and now he is the richest man in our country
Of course this is not slovenian biggest invention but I find it interesting
But some od the great inventions are:
Tungaj transformer,
ELF EMMIT( digital headband that releases harmless electromagnetic pulses that encourage your brain to work in sync with your preferred state of mind)
And Peter Florjančič who conceived the PERFUME ATOMIZER and AIRBAGS
Probably modern beekeeping, which was pioneered by Anton Janša in the 18th century
Herman Potočnik was also one of the first people to design a theoretical space station
CCS is practically already a standard, it just needs formalisation
I'm however quite afraid that Tesla is going to screw us over like Apple did with charger
They prefer paying fines the EU to using standard chargers
Companies with too much power
What I'd like to see is a standard for electrical safety in cars
At the moment everyone just somewhat believes that everything is going to be fine, because people are somewhat prevented from accessing high voltage parts
I work for a safety testing company and it took us about a minute to expose vital (and decisively high voltage) components
Don't tell me idiots in cars won't do that
edit: typo
Are there different track gauges though
I'm only aware of Russia having a different one than everyone else
Unless you count narrow gauge railway, but those networks are usually small
Standardizing signalling and communication is actively being worked on with various levels of ETCS, but the question is how much the countries will adopt it
It's much bigger of a problem IMO than the power systems, as multi system locosomotives have been the standard for cross border trains for a while now, but it doesn't help if a locomotive supports a power system, but not the safety system used in a country
Platforms though
Those are a mess even in a single country
We had an affair a while ago when the railway from Pragersko to Hodoš here was newly electrified, but the platforms on some stations were too far from where the train would stop, so there was be too much of a gap between the platform and the stopped train
Thus most of the electric trains that were planned to be used on the route couldn't stop at those stations
Allright, I didn't know that
Great to hear
Interesting, didn't know that
Thanks
I would like to thank our neighbouring countries for having an IKEA
Did you just
forget
there’s a whole country between Austria and Croatia
Or did i misunderstand something
Anyways we’re used to it
And we get to invade your coasts every year
It has one under construction currently
Dunno, man
Honestly summers in slovenian countryside wouldn't be the same without lost czech tourists driving around in the middle of nowhere
But yeah the vignette system could definitely be better
At least there are weekly and monthy ones available now (which are still pretty expensive, comparative to austria)
[Cockta] for sure
Yugoslavias answer to Coca Cola, still quite popular today
Also Im not sure if Radler counts since it can have a small percentage of alcohol
In any case [Union's radler] is quite popular, particularly the grapefruit version
And there is also [Ora] which is similar to Fanta
Kvass is only eastern Europe thing
West and south slavs don't drink that at all
Well the Cockta in Slovenia is marketed as original nowadays
But you'd have to ask someone who was alive in communist times if it is actually original
Yep the "original" is definitely a mixture of beer and lemonade
Nowadays its often used just as a generic name for any non-alcoholic beer with a fruit taste
Yes, I do, very very much
But I have my YouTube set to GB because trending videos in Slovenia are horrible
OK, Slovenia is always left outside, it seam that this is again the case or am I just unable to find this function
English
Haven't seen a single game worth playing that had a Slovenian translation yet
Since last year or 2018 i think for the first time in human history more people live in cities than in the countryside
My current language ambition is to not have issues with people from China speaking or writing English
Some formations they are prepared to construct is just baffling, while I have trouble dumbing my writing down to the level I'm reasonably sure they will understand
Apart from that, some German would come in handy (my reason for picking French in middle school was honestly dumb and I just don't go skiing there often enough to keep it in shape), and I could use Croatian enough to become fluent in it
Yes
I speak Slovene, Italian, English and Croatian a bit, but still see French and German as huge lacunae in my skills
Probably WWII bomb disposal would be most powerfull
Wrong country
Tsar was in Russia I am from Slovenia
No problem mate we always get confused with Slovakia and this time it was Russia :D
It is but it's ok we're used to it
My grandma LOVES to tell that joke to everybody new she meets
Thank you Croatia for all the summer vacations, my childhood wouldn't be the same without you
You mean, like, water, from the toilet
We have two, one is a specific place called Rovte, it exists and is a village in the middle of nowhere
The other one would be a nonspecific placed called vukojebina, the literal translation would be "place where wolves fuck".
I don't work in healthcare but from what I heard our medical workers signed agreements they'll be available 24/7, do 12 hour shifts and will take no day offs
They prepared beds in hospitals for them so they don't have to leave and possibly infect others
I also heard they agreed they will keep working even if showing signs of infection but only with patiens who have confirmed infection
Again, this is not an official information
Our government made it illegal to sell desinfectant and other protective gear to anyone but government institutions
I bought a bottle for myself, my grandma and my parents just in the right time
Yep, I definitely agree
I don't think they give a crap in what kind of bottles they get it currently
And no, 500ml bottles are standard in hospitals on tables and in wall dispensers
Yea, I thought about those after I posted my reply
No idea if people bought those as well
I did, but I bought mine for cleaning my car windshield lol
In Ljubljana there’s a law that prohibits building anything higher than the Ljubljana caste(which is 100m)
Kdor ni skrit, naj se gre solit - He who is not hidden, should go salt himself
Speaking of bosnian, serbian and croatian
Most people don't care but because of the wars some people do
For instance my friend was thrown out of a store in croatia because she used the serbian word for bread (unintentionally)
Exactly yeah
Not thrown out but told to leave the store and that they don't sell "hleba".
> peanutsauce on fries
I'mma need a recipe here
for a friend
In Slovenia there was a company named Jogi that was making mattresses
Now we call mattresses "jogi".
Radenska for any mineral water
I believe it is widely exported, but it is only used as general name here
TIL Jacuzzi is a brand
We use quite a number of these as well, but the obvious difference is superga (after Superga, I think they are an Italian brand) for sneaker
We also call a hairdryer “fen” (pronounced very similarly to “fön”)
Actually, most types of screws are called after brand names and sometimes don't even have a different name
Philips comes to mind for one of the variants with cross tip
I didn't know that and imagined that jacuzzi was a type of hot tub
My mind is now blown a bit
It's only a bit more than 2 hours away from me
Yes, in Slovenian we use "zmaj" for both a kite amd a dragon
In Slovene we have the same thing, both are called "zmaj", which means "dragon".
Yup, was there 2 years ago
Teen israeli girls were laughing their heads off, they were starting to get on my nerves, because they were so loud
You dont have to cry there, but be respectful of the place where thousands died
You should educate the pour soul
It wasn't their fault they didn't know it was actually the other way around
The castle was built first and the royal family wanted a private airport for themselves
It wasn't until the peasants rebelled that they were forced to give it up and now they are constantly annoyed by the noise of aircrafts flying overhead
Bloody democracy
Goran Bregović is known in the UK
waw
That should get anyone straight-up deported, following a massive fine
You're not dumb, you just don't understand what it means to have freadom of speech
Ex-yu languages use the same or a very similar word
It is quite magnificent
Do you get people who moved out and can't stop attempting to humiliate you over the fact that you stayed
We get some of that on local forums and it just makes me want to stay a bit more in case I turn into one of them
My local internet community gets it from people who moved to stay
It looks a bit sad, like they haven't managed to create a social circle there and their only source of joy now is putting people down over their choices in life
When I was still living near Slovenian-Austrian border I liked to go driving around Austrian Styria or Austrian Carinthia
But now that I live in Ljubljana I don't do that anymore
We go to Austria everytime a trip to IKEA is necessary
One's being built in Ljubljana, though
It deoends on where you live
I live in a tiny country so I will go to IMAX in Croatia, shopping or skiing in Italy or Austria, for a swim on the other side of the country to Croatia and so on
In Slovenia, having to commute more than 20 minutes is considered cruel and unusual punishment
Driving 1 hour away is considered a day trip that requires sandwiches being packed
Tongue in cheek obviously, but not far from the truth ;)
If I may make a recommendation, take one day for Ljubljana, one day for the trip to the Soča Valley (go rafting if it's late spring/early summer), and one day for the trip to Piran, stopping at and visiting the Škocjan Caves and the Predjama Castle
And if you have an extra day, visit lake Bohinj
You'll pass through Bled on the way to Bohinj (unless you take some back roads)
It's fine to stop and taste their "Kremšnita" (local pastry), but despite it being the most well-known Slovenian tourist place, trust me when I say that Bohinj blows it out of the water (try the local "Grmada" pastry there :)
If you're gonna be spending that long in Slovenia, I'd also recommend a visit to the north-east regions of Štajerska and Prekmurje
The former has two cities dating back to Roman times (Celje and Ptuj) and there are some Roman-related things along the highway as you travel east (well-signposted)
Once you cross the Mura river, you're in Prekmurje, and there I'd recommend you drive to just about any village guesthouse and sample a local bograč (goulash), dödöli (potato thing) and prekmurska gibanica (local pastry)
Also, if you're into "energies", there's Lake Bukovnica that's supposedly quite decent energy-wise, and there's the Grad Castle, which is an interesting one to check out
There's also quite a few historical workshops one can check out here (pottery, basketweaving, blacksmithing etc
), and since this region was quite cut off from the rest of Slovenia for most, a visit to the regional museum in Murska Sobota castle might be interesting
And if you're interested in WW2, there's a monument to the partisans and the red army together with 2 field guns from the time
Anyway, I'll stop spamming you here, but if you feel like you want some more help planning the trip, feel free to DM me when the time comes :)
(Serbo)-Croatian due to Yugoslavia and just general similarities
Serbo-Croatian because of Yugoslavia
Also German, because it's taught in some high schools
For slovenia is german
My mom knows it and they taught german insted of english I think
Probably Croatian/Serbo-Croatian cause we were still part of Yugoslavia 29 years ago and everyone HAD to learn Serbo-Croatian
Balkan languages (Serbian, Croatian etc)
But if you mean official, then Hungarian and Italian
Yes while in schools german is most widely learned
(Probably not in the regions next to Italy tho)
In my experience, there's 2 groups of people who know how to actually use computers:
Those that got their start in DOS or at the very, VERY latest in Win XP
Those that grew up poor enough that they had to pirate games/software
It seems to me that the generations born in the 70s and 80s were the peak of the bell curve and now we're going back towards computer illiteracy
My nephews, nieces, and cousins under the age of 20 are waaay more clueless than my mom when handling a computer, and she isn't exactly brilliant at it either
Not surprised
Parents don't take time to teach kids computer skills because they themselves don't  know how or just seat them in front of the TV
I know so many parents with small kids all proud of themselves that they don't allow their kids to play video games
The person was explaining this when the kids were alone in front of tv for more than an hour with the remote control
In schools computer science is not taken very seriously just yet
Also add the fact that desktops are pretty much obsolete with nontech crowd
So how could they learn
I even met millennials with less then satisfactory computer skills and they grew up with them
I mean, I mostly spend time with CS students, but even my other friends do at least know their way around the Windows UI
> As a side note, they consistently tended to refuse to read error messages which were telling what to do and call me for help whenever something popped up
That is the single most gear-grinding thing EVER
And it cuts across generations
Very
It would be legal but unfortunatelly everyone wants their laws to get passed because they're being paid by diferent lobies
On the right side of subreddit there are comunity options and there you can set your flair
Are you sure you are in AskEurope subreddit
I mean, fair, but is Ukraine really the destination you choose because you can't deal with a bit of corruption
Železna cesta/iron road is a poetic word for železnica
To elaborate on this, železnica means "the iron thing" (female)
That's the general word for railroad
The tracks specifically are tiri (plural, male) or tirnice (plural, feminine), which supposedly comes from protoSlavic, basically meaning the path that someone makes where there was none before
[Not much] no
Even in green areas you'll find people
Or bears
Yes, quite a lot of it
Well you would run in small villages here and there, but generally there is quite some wilderness here
Especially in the Alps and over the vast forested dinaric plateaus
I may have just climbed out of my cave after 2 years of sitting in one place but I am pretty sure that bears don't count as human civilization and I am pretty sure the virgin forests of Kočevje wanna talk to you
One of our previous PM's and current mayor of Ljubljana was born in Serbia
He's controversial for other reasons
I do not care and I think most people over here would not care either
As long as he's not a jerk, it's fine
All that aren't tooting their lies
This only goes for current government
All of them
Because the current right wing leading party controls directly just one TV channel which is small and pathetic (and funded by Orban)
All other media companies are regarded as 'communist' by them, even if they are actually nowadays quite liberal and were just founded in Yugoslav times
Actually the most left wing newspaper is Mladina, which ironically used to employ also the current prime minister 30 years ago
Actually since Janša took power again, he has been engaging in endless twitter wars with slovenian and even foreign journalists
Pathetic
The national one here in Slovenia
Yes, it's that bad
So, you are saying that basically every newspaper except Nova24 and Demokracija
So sad
Sounds a bit like China, but without all the effort put in censorship and survelliance technologies
And Reporter and Družina
And Ognjišče. Probably missing something
Yeah, better comparisons
However, still not a good situation
I wonder what would it take for Orban to get defeated
No matter how unlikely, I hope it happens soon
I hope it happens soon also for the sake of us
Yeah, but I've noticed more women (usually 30-60 years old) who wear tshirts with cringey overused quotes like 'live laugh love' and shit like that
I'm almost certain 95% of women that age own a few shirts with love and/or happiness quotes on them
Yep same here
I just have shirts saying "Generic
at least those mean something
go to zara, h&m or similar stores and all their shirts have some random word and number combination that dont mean anything
i get they try to avoid copyright, but why not make an in-store character or phrase instead of just putting gibberish on shirts
We only just got our first Primark though
Have seen a bunch of boys/young men covered in that stuff since its opening
True
Quotes are still better than nonsense
Haven't been there yet, do you know maybe how crowded it is
I'm assuming since it barely opened it's packed with people
Happened to be there a few days after the opening and it was stuffed with both tourists and locals
Don't know what it's like now
Try-hard cringe said in Steyermark accent
At least that's what popular TV and radio shows keep selling
At a bit higher level, I think satire is quite popular, or maybe just generally teasing politicians and celebrities
There are long running shows with imitators, and I also noted stand-up comedians creating a lot of jokes on this behalf
It's basically boomer humour and "haha man from ex-YU country funny". I think satire is also kinda popular, even our ex PM was a part of a satirical show
It's exaggerated
Nobody actually pronounces Js, so it's Loo-blah-nah
The best part is, this is the traditional pronunciation
The Js got stuck in in 19th century for no better reason than to fuck with kids when they learn spelling, and probably looking more civilized
Well, I giggled, so I guess it works
How would you describe homesickness
Well ask or president Pahor [picture]
This was from Kairo, where he met with Egyptian President Al-Sisi
This type of posing on stairs is now known a Boruting in Slovenia
I started to follow french politics and french news in general, but that is because I'll move there in the near future
I need to be up to date with what's going on
Alps in the middle of the thunderstorm, with no shelter in vicinty
Otherwise pretty much the same as elsewhere in Europe
13-14, but we have a pretty big drinking culture here
It's less common than it used to be
Ohh beautiful Balkans
I donate to local bands doing free online concerts
I almost never watch them, since they just make me miss the live music more, but they need all the support they can get
Given name (only one) + father's surname, or on rare occasions both father's and mother's surname
Interesting
and do woman change their surname if they marry
There's a famous Italian who changed her surname (Marzia Bisognin, Pewdiepie'd wife), now she makes herself call Marzia Kjellberg in social media
Is she just trying to brag that she married a swede
I don't know, in Slovenia it's not like that
I know that in Russia is for sure like that, but I don't know about the rest of the countries
Probably a maid in a local chateau
I have ancestors who were farmers, but they spoke German and were involved in court so i guess beeing the oldest, I would be excused from the army to work the field
But i have no idea whether I or one of my brothers would get the court job
Dead
Cooking and raising the kids
If I survived giving birth
Nothing, cause Slovenes didn't matter in Austria
Probably a merchant or barrista, likely to be married already with one or more children
Well a lot of people from the village I live in actually descend from the help
I think it’s actually how the village formed
Gardners had to live somewhere I guess so the chateau owner build them houses
I was told it was northern Norway
I seem to be a minority :)
This looks pretty brilliant
Now I'm wondering if something like this wouldn't be feasible for motorcycles
Pretty sure the UK is going to be the 52nd state (after Puerto Rico ofc) before Czechia is part of Russia
Any time you go onto the highway, expect a 2 hour ride to turn ibto at least a 4 hour ride
Road work ALL THE TIME
Worst of all, they're really slow
Surprised we seem to be the minority here - no
You can attend religion classes, but they are separate from school and in no way related
We are taught about religion, obviously, but no specific class for it
That's BS
It's left cheek, right cheek, lips
> the east speaks church slavonic
Well, Slavs do actually have an [almost-completely-intelligible-even-without-training-universal-language]
*Realistically*, there's no other option
But me - I would choose the 2nd biggest city Maribor
We don't deserve it, but it would be pretty cool
West Slovenia doesn't have to have everything, let us have the capital
I think Trst would be a better option
We're a country of 2 million
If we got annexed by [Italy/Austria/Hungary/Croatia] nobody would even notice we were gone
Let's see
Slovenia is important because if we in, y'all northerners would be waiting for days or making proper detours to get to Croatia in Summer
Not to mention that Austria and Italy can rest easy knowing that if they ever want to get rid of Trieste, Villach, and/or Klagenfurt, we'll happily take them off their hands
Seriously though
We're net recipients, though just barely and a couple of good years or another low-gdp-capita member would likely push us across into the net contributor range
We're at the intersection of east-west and south-north transport corridors, so it's convenient to have us as part of the single market
Depending on our government at the time, we support the austerity block or the gib monies block, so that's another vote in the Council for whichever side
And we provide Austria and Italy with mid-highly educated workers at discount though not dumping prices
Oh, and for a couple more weeks, we hold America by the balls
Yeah, you'd get all your correct mail
Nah, nobody really cares about Slovenia
Serbians and Bosnians are the ones to worry about when stirring things up
Nobody would care if Slovenia was gone
We were already under Austria in Austro-Hungary, so we've got a lot more western influences in us than all the other balkan countries that were under Hungary
Doubt it
Slovenia is like a miniature version of a lot of countries put together
We have the sea, mountains, rolling hills and lowlands
And everything is accessible by car in more or less an hour from the capital
You don't have to drive for 10 hours or get on a plane to get from one part of the country to the other
That's really cool (imo) when you get it in a complete package, but it would be just one more city with 300k people in Italy which you'll never visit, and another coastal town among thousands, and another ski resort among hundreds
I admire your sentiment, but as someone from a tiny country that's been someone's b**** for all of history up until 91, I share that stance with /u/Eurovision2006
It's actually kind of a compliment to you guys, and I do think how France has been stepping up for the past year or two has been great
You get the cheap brains that improve your economy and you pay for it by providing the cheap muscle with work, which improves your economy but hurts your people
It's unlikely you'll be able to counteract the latter while capitalizing on the former while in the EU
Wait times and the amount of money the state has to direct to it on top of all contributions by the workers
Generally I am happy with the system, however the wait times are too much
Oh and a cherry on top: a lot of doctors actually have a private side business that they do after work at the public hospitals
Their public job is a lot of times used just to get clients for their private clinic
For example orthopedic surgeons are notorious for telling people who come to them in a public hospital that they need a certain surgery or therapy and then they tell them: or you wait 6 months or you come to me in the afternoon and I do it immediately (but you pay a few thousand €)
However don’t be fooled, your situation is so bad that it requires immediate action
Well now it’s up to you ;)
+ longer waiting lines for procedures
+ corruption, money disappearing thru bogus purchases into private pockets
+ lower efficiency and quality, staff is paid thru a rigid pay-bracketing system regardless of the quality of service, they are overworked because there is not enough money for new hiring (see one point above) meanwhile private practices take the time for throughout examination and procedure to insure costumer satisfaction
+ not getting the doctors approval for a specialist appointment, because it costs money, and your condition hasn't deteriorated so far to make it necessary, of course once it has progressed enough, you are further delayed by longer waiting lines, before you actually reach the specialist it may be too late (cancer) or you have permanent damage despite the procedure
+ Your money is deducted from salary regardless, you have no say which agency gets it
On the plus side, it's still a lot better than reading stories from USA where giving birth can leave you bankrupt, but god dammit we have been waiting for too long for a government that would have the balls to clear this corrupted mess of the national insurance agency that is stealing our money in broad daylight
But every ruling party that started to deal with the mess fell apart in a matter of months, literally
In short dear America, do it, but do it better
Several doctors were sent to prison over this about 2 months ago, high-profile orthopedic surgeons ([
As long as you get a fair treatment if you come in on the public healthcare plan, and as long as they pay fair rents, I have no problem with doctors having public & private practices at the same institution
At least the equipment gets used round the clock and the hospital can spend the rent to buy even better equipment
Yeah, we used to be so proud of our medical system
Wow have we fallen
And now that you mention it, it's true: any Slovene government that starts a medical reform is a dead man walking
Well I am a bit sceptical about this because having a public and private practice inherently brings a clash of interest - especially if the private part of it does not represent just a 3 hour a week side job but the majority of your income
However I realise that the doctors working only in the public system are not paid enough and since a significant increase in their wages is not in sight, there is probably no other way than to allow such practices
After all, they enjoy much higher bargaining power - if they all quit their jobs at public hospitals, the system collapses
I would just like to point out that in the specific case that you mentioned the doctors were not sentenced for abusing their job at the public hospitals but because they were bribed in order to secure contracts for the delivery of certain medical materials on behalf of the hospitals
I agree with this
I have the impression that private medical insurance companies are one of the toughest lobbies in our country
They topple whole governments, block reforms and yet they remain somewhat under the radar of the average citizen
In SLO from every worker's paycheque an obligatory insurance fee  is deducted that goes to the public health insurance company
However, if you want to avoid additional charges for certain drugs (actually a long list) etc
you can pay an additional "voluntary insurance". However basically everybody pays it so it is more or less involuntary as it covers a vast amount of additional charges
This money on the other hand goes to private insurance companies
So far so good right
Well, no
From this money only a pretty small amount is actually spent on healthcare (idk the exact % but if I am not mistaken it is below 50%) so what is left is pocketed by the private insurance companies
EVERY government that tried to change this has ben toppled
The last attempt was in late 2019
Hungarian, totally incomprehensible to me
Same for Finnish, but I like the language more because of the elvish flavour
I can't make much sense of the baltics or Albanian either
I've never heard Basque and Maltese
In Greek i know just some basic greetings and in Irish just some basic words, I find both languages beautiful though
For all the rest, if one would speak really slow, i would probably have some low to medium degree of understanding
In Italy, the UK and the western balkans I would probably have higher degrees of understanding, since I speak the languages
Hungarian or Finnish language
Like, wtf even is that
I love the sound of Turkish when women speak it
It sounds super feminine and adorable to me, for some reason
I'll take that over the crazy that is 2342390457 tenses most non-Slavic languages have
Past

And then someone from the west starts talking about a continuous future past
GTFO

Slovenian
Also, I distinctly recall seeing that in some (wannabe
-)archaic-sounding English texts
Portuguese is either Spanish people trying to speak Polish or Polish people trying to speak Spanish
Not sure which, but one of those
THANK YOU
I keep repeating this to everyone - Either Poles speaking Spanish or Spaniards speaking Polish
How someone can say that Portuguese sounds like anything remotely close to Russian is beyond me
...and Slovenian has that (different for 3-4 objects than 5+) _plus_ dual so three plurals :)

And about the counting, I assume you meant this beauty xD
1 pes, 2 psa, 3 psi, 4 psi, 5+ psov
My guess it's because Slovene women are strict when it comes to romance and want to know very precisely whether by "we'll have fun" you mean just her and yourself or also her friend
War of the roses and the spanish war
I just know they happened
> In Germany, when we look back at WWII we tend to be very focussed on the holocaust but sometimes we tend to forget the crimes that were committed in the occupied countries to the non-jewish population
Thank you for mentioning that
I absolutely don't want to take anything away from the Holocaust, but while 6 million Jews died, 30 million Slavs died in WW2 and nobody really cares
> What were the origins of Yugoslavia
Put super simply, after Slovenes and Croats were free from the Austrians, Hungarians, and Italians, i.e. post-WW1, they realized that staying solo would likely result in them getting reconquered by one or more of the former masters, so they thought let's join forces with Serbia as kind of equals
The original name was the Kingdom of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs
Well, soon after, Serbia, being the "senior partner", decided to throw its weight around, the name got changed (Slovenes and Serbs changed places), and power started centralizing more and more
Eventually the renaming to Yugoslavia happened
Post-WW2, Tito kept the brotherhood and unity alive through sheer force of his personality cult and secret police, and once he died, Serbia started centralizing power again
Eventually Slovenia and Croatia demanded a more federal system, Serbia disagreed, the Slovene and Croat delegations left the Parliament and that's how the dissolution started
Slovenia was in for 10 days of "war", partly because we didn't go along with the order from Belgrade to disarm and disband our territorial defense force (national guard essentially) and partly because Serbia didn't really care about Slovenia - we've always been the odd ones out in Yugoslavia
Croatia wasn't that lucky though, and Bosnia basically got brutalized by all its Yugoslav neighbors and also in an internal civil war
Eventually NATO bombed Belgrade into submission and 25 years later, here we are with SLO and CRO in the EU, BiH, SRB, MNG, and NMK outside, and with jokes floating around (in Slovenia) that once all the former Yugoslav republics are in the EU, the EU will probably collapse, since there is no force that can keep a union with all of us in it alive
There's probably at least 5 vastly different narratives about that one for every 3 people you ask
So depending on your level of masochism it can be super interesting or super-suicide-inducing
When I was in school it usually started at 8:00
If you needed help at some subject or if you needed extra work if normal work was to easy then you started some days at 7:10
But now I see some schools start at 7:30, some at 7:50 which is crazy and some start at 8:20
So I'm guessing there's no set time to start
One class period is 45 minutes with a 5 minute break
One of the breaks, usually after 1st or 2nd period is 20 min and it's when kids have breakfast/snack
This is provided by school
Then from what I see, 1st 4 grades have lunch after all the classes and 5-9 graders have lunch between 6th ad 7th period
It's also 20 minutes long
Lunch is also provided by school but you don't have to have it, if you don't want to
In that case you just take some fruit or
bread which has to be provided all the time to everyone
This is for elementary school
edit: for high school, things have also chnaged since I attended
I'm just gonna look at the time table of the school I went to
0 period starts at 7:05, 1st period starts at 7:55
After each period there's a 5 minute break
At most there are 8 periods, so it all ends at 14:50
Each grade has a lunch break after different period and it lasts 25 minutes
Lunch is also provided in school, there's 5 menus each day
If you want it, you have to sign up for it each week at the terminal or online
Could be the 2nd of January for Slovenia
It's nothing special but just one extra day you get to be at home after the New year's
24th, in the evening with dinner
25th is a holiday but it's just another day, people usually visit family or do nothing
26th is  Independence and Unity Day so also a work free day
No, Slovenes are too diverse and there is no generic Slovene look
The only way I recognize another Slovene is when they open their mouth
Otherwise I could easily mistake them for almost any other European nationality
I do, however, find it easier to spot some other nationalities, for example Italians or nationals of some ex-Yugoslav countries
The holy tourist triangle of Ljubljana, Bled and Piran
If there's one thing this Corona virus is good for is that you now can visit places that were previously too crowded
I was in Dubrovnik just a couple of days ago
[It

It's kinda overrated the beaches are better in Dalmatia
I know the names of most states, I know their location fairly well too
But fuck the nonsensical state capitals
The fact that the capital of Illinois is Springfield and not Chicago blows my mind
It's about the same as Americans knowing European countries
Everyone knows the best known ones and then there's a ton people wouldn't believe even exist if you told them their names
A similar one I've heard is:
Wir helfen kranken Vögeln - we help sick birds
Wir helfen Kranken vögeln - we help sick people fuck
Yes, have you ever tried learning Slovene
Draft
It can kill according to some legends
It seems that soldiers not talking about war later in life is a reocurring theme here, which i find very interesting as my great-grandfather too fought in WW2 (as a partisan) and also in WW1 for Austria-Hungary, but never talked about his experiences
The Slovene Wikipedia is depressingly barren, being inferior to the English one in almost all articles except for: Slovene places, various Slovene companies and some historical Slovene personalities
Sometimes
I noticed quite an improvement in quality over last about 2 years
Particularly if I go looking for some plant or animal that I don't know the English word for, I start with Slovene article, and more times than not I don't even need to click to English version to get the info
On average, English is still better, but I was in for a couple of pleasant surprises lately
People who drink bottled water are considered weirdos
The only reasons to do that is when tap water is not available, or possibly in the club where you want to use a bottle
I know this is of topic but Ljubljana needs only around 5
000 more people to be on that list
Bochum, Germany
But then after that I'm good again until the last one - Galați, Romania
Łódź for me
Allthough Iwas so surprised by some of the cities being so high up
Zaragoza for example
Hmmm, apparently there is a [city of Brussels ] is inside the[ Brussels region]
I mean, random Korean cities vs cities in the literal center of Europe
While asking Europeans
I'd say don't bother unless you plan to live here for a longer period
The grammatical rules are quite complex and there's always a ton of exceptions
Ah yes, the old die Stadt vs der Staat clusterduck xD
One can easily be understood if they only use nominatives and infinitives though
Sounds funny, but it works
They do to speakers of languages that aren't used to meaning changes due to vowel length
It's like the bitch vs beach thing
That's all correct, but if you can't hear those distinctions, they may as well not exist
It's like when I was trying to teach portuguese speakers to say "cesta" in Slovenian
They apparently couldn't tell much less produce the difference between "testa" and "cesta" (the c in the latter sounding like z in Zeit)
It's funny how brains sometimes (don't) work =)

You wish, my friend
Our word for 'thank you' (hvala) rhymes with 'rolling' (val'a), so if, god forbid, we forget to say thanks, our mums might retort with "What is under the table rolling
" (kaj se pod mizo vala
), to which you're supposed to immediately answer "hvala".
(((Followed by mum's self-satisfied chuckling as though she'd invented the joke herself
)))
"Do you have a tail

A politician is allowed to steal millions of Euros and is not to be prosecuted, but a poor man trying to feed his family shall be jailed for stealing a loaf of bread
Yeah
There are some special cases but in most cases if you hear a wird you can spell it
99% of the time the answer is yes
There are only a few minor exceptions where the letter 'l' at the end of the word is pronounced like 'u'. So for example, the world chair is 'stol', but pronounced more like 'stou'. But such words are very few
Imo Italian is easier than English
While I learned English through shows and the internet I would say it would be hared to learn it through rules the way they teach you in school
I studied Italian for 6 years in school and while it was harder to get a grasp of what sounds right (because I don't really watch Italian tv) The rules had fewer exceptions and the exceptions still adhered to a pattern
I would also say it's easier than German as well (although I never properly studied it) since German has all those long words and my dislexia made it harder
Školjka - sea shell

Reminds me of my favorite Swiss word (probably butchered here): Chäschüechli
I tried that out and people weren't able to repeat it even if they never saw it written down, so it is a good one
The sheer amount of consonants scares non-Slavic speakers
> Hottentottententententoonstelling
Reminded me of this German gem:
>Es war einmal eine alte Frau, die lebte bei den Hottentotten
Sie war ziemlich trottelig und stotterte auch ein wenig
Daher wurde sie die
Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter genannt
Die Hottentottenstottertrottelmutter hatte auch ein Haustier
Das war eine Beutelratte
Damit die Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelratte nicht weglief,
verbrachte sie ihr Leben in einem Käfig, der mit Latten vergittert war
Dieses Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitter
hatte auch so eine Art Dach, das auch Wetterkotter genannt wurde
In diesem Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotter
lebte die Beutelratte glücklich und zufrieden, bis eines Tages ein Attentäter kam,
die Beutelratte in einen Sack steckte und mitnahm
Damit dieser Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäter
aber nicht einfach so davonkam, versprach die alte Frau demjenigen,
der die Beutelratte wiederbrächte, eine Fangprämie
Diese Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäterfangprämie
war so hoch, dass alle Welt sich sofort auf die Suche machte, den Attentäter fand
und so die Beutelratte wohlbehalten wieder nach Hause kam
Darüber freuten sich alle, vor allem aber der Hottentottenstottertrottelmutterbeutelrattenlattengitterwetterkotterattentäterfangprämienempfänger
A mixed group of exchange students, not sure about all nationalities
Some Spaniards were sure present
One
Slovene quite often adds schwa before r or more rarely l to manage pronounciation of consonant clusters, but we don't use a letter for it
Čmrlj can be pronounced \[ˈtʃmə̀rəl\] or \[ˈtʃmə̀rl\]
I feel honored at your belief in my ability to remember details of an event in a mixed group of exchange students :D
Stari (dude)
brat/sestra (bother/sister)
pobalin (hard to explain, troublemaker
cefizelj (literature origins)
A more literal translation to *Stari* is "*Old* (man/woman)". It's funny to me because it's used by children (definitely not old men) and adults alike
Never in my life have I heard somebody call someone else pobalin or cefizelj
Where do you get that
Out of his butt
Maybe they used it in literature 100 years ago
Never have I heard anyone call someone brat/sestra either
Fine, I don't have friends, so I made it up
Yeah sometimes
Usually when talking about them to someone else
It's more of a teenage slang thing
I used to refer to them as *moj tastar*/*moja tastara* a lot when I was in my teens
Now in my 30s not anymore (i think they're getting too old and it would just be rubbing it in )
Stari in slang between the same generation is considered friendly, but if you say it to someone actually older it's usually more in a rude way like: "stari, daj mi mir" (don't bother me, old man)
We do refer to grandparents as *stari starši* (old parents)
Not really
For fathers we may use "foter" (from German Vater) in a similar sense I guess
Not really
For fathers we may use "foter" (from German Vater) in a similar sense I guess
I think the most well-known one is about "King Mathias" (Matjaž), who was a benevolent ruler and is now sleeping under a mountain Peca, and one day he'll wake up and continue his reign
Well turns out this mythological king is based on actual Hungarian king Mathias Korvin, who ruled over parts of Slovene territory during parts of middle ages, I think 14th century or something
We also have some "invader myths", basically myths about various times we were invaded
In and around the Soča/Isonzo valley, there's loads of stories about Napoleon and his army
And apparently they built loads of bridges there, as there are at least three bridges all named Napoleon's bridge
There's also stories about Turkic conquest
One of the most popular hills near Ljubljana - Šmarna Gora has loads of myths about Turks, as it was used as a refuge during their raids
On the main path towards the summit there's a supposed stone where a hoof of some Turkish's general horse struck, right before saint Mary appeared and turned them into stone
On the other side of the hill there's a a more likely and way less violent story, abut a Turk who apparently decided to stay here and became Christian, he supposedly built a chapel to commemorate this, and it's known to this day as "Turk's chapel".
Another interesting story about the time Turks were invading, is linked to the village of "Hudajužna". Locals have the legend that it's name comes from when Turks were camping near by and just as they were having lunch, all the church bells in near by villages started ringing and (there's a chance I mixed my myths up, but I think people just came with similar stories) saint Mary again appeared and turned them to stone, or destroy them
That's why the name of the village can be interpreted to mean "Terrible Lunch". But in reality it stems from "heavy thaw", as it's in that part of the valley, where snow thaws the fastest
Also for most people who don't know where every small village in Slovenia lies, Šmarna Gora and Hudajužna are like around 60km apart, so the myths probably developed independently
With fireworks specifically we only celebrate New Year, but we celebrate Easter with "Pokanje", which just means "banging" or "popping". It's usually done with carbide
In my village specifically we use old milk cans
You put the carbide inside and seal it well with a lid
You lay the can down sideways
For ignition, we use a long wooden stick, with a petroleum soaked rag at the end
You fire it up, and kind of tap the bottom of the milk can with the end of the stick that is on fire
It creates a really loud bang, and usually when we were younger they sent the kids looking for the lids that flew off when the bang occured
It looks [something like this] Also, this explains [why our goalkeepers are so good]
Our biggest lake completely disappears twice a year
We have the highest density of caves
Funnily enough, for Slovenia it's the exact opposite
Though much fewer people think about our national color in the first place
^(or about slovenia
)^(or know we exist)
Wut
I never expected Italy if all places to be big on kiwi production
I mean yeah it's southern regions are pretty far down but still
No, I'm talking about Cerknica lake
It literally drains out, like a bathtub
From [this] to [this] The water drains through ponors, požiralniks and estavelas into the underground
I don't know if there's any other lakes like this in Europe, apart from a few smaller ones in Slovenia
All I can find is that Cerknica lake is the biggest and primest example of a lake this kind
I mean the land of the Slovenka :P
Well, yes and no
There are plenty of airports with cheap flights all around Slovenia only a short drive away, but it's true that Ljubljana is horribly unconnected with direct flights
No, no, she's all yours, we insist
[This] is how it disappears into the underground
This is a *požiralnik*. It's what's at the bottom of the lake on the first photo
edit: phantom comments still aren't resolved, so to the person asking what these people are doing - they're members of a Fishing family, trying to save fish to move them to another lake
It's a common practice
Compromise - send her to Canada
They'd be too polite to refuse a gift, surely
I feel like I can talk only for "my" group
But yeah what you described is exactly how it works here
We have special scout names (that range from nicknames, to something silly we come up with on the spot)
While we try to teach kids some basic scouting skills, we're not very strict about it
And the main "speciality" of our group is, that next year we'll celebrate 70 years since our establishment, so we think of ourselves as above every other group in our area, and in general
Especially us from the "older" generation, where we considered our group above our regional organisation, and on par with national organisation
And we're not even the largest group within our regional group
Actually I'm pretty sure almost all (with few exceptions) other groups take scouting way more seriously than we, at least those of us from the "old guard". The younger leaders are a bit more open to ideas by the regional organisation
But we're still doing "community work". I personally helped during many "major disasters" that happened in our country last 10 years or so
From floods, to sleet
Also as someone with a political science degree, I try to teach kids how to engage in politics and stuff
But not in any kind of "civic nationalism", or whatever many scout groups are doing (I feel you've noticed that with US scouts), but mostly trying to give them tools to understand politics and the system we live in
That's why almost every game I devise, has a bean-based monetary system, where their power is directly linked to amount of beans they have
I got the idea form one of international camps I attended, where they had this system
And it "failed" or rather succeeded in the most spectacular way
It had everything from money-laundering through casinos scheme, buying your way into politics and position of power, a coup, and spam mail
And I'm pretty sure those were all unplanned side-effects, that the organisers of the camp weren't planning for
Sorry for going down the memory lane, but that's to me probably the best part of being a scout
Well
Scounts are a christian thing
So when we became part of Yugoslavia and became socialist, religion was persecuted, they had to solve the problem of christian things that they didn't want to give up
So instead of Christmass, the main thing was the New Year and we got a new santa, Dedek mraz (Father snow), the christmass tree (literally translated: christmas spruce) became a "novoletna yelka" or new year silver fir and bised the boy scouts there were "taborniki" or campers
Those included boys and girls since socialism did a lot for women equality
They didn't sell cookies or anything like that (neither did the scouts)
Both camped, sang, had older member be leaders and so on
Pretty much what you described for Switzerland
Are you a Tabornik or Skavt
Tabornik
Skavte pod avte
I was planning to mention the difference, but forgot
(this is mostly for people outside Slovenia to get the difference)
Basically we have one "boy-scout" group and one "girl scout" group
They're both "co-ed" though
Boy scouts - Taborniki are part of WOSM, but are also inspired by Woodcraft movement of Ernest Thompson Seton
Girl Scouts - Skavti, are basically Boy Scouts, but openly Catholic
Because their programme was way to similar to Boy scouts WOSM didn't allow them to join, they only allow organisation with different programmes to join, they've joined the WAGGGS which stands for World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts, that's why they're technically Girl scouts
Boy scouts, and our group in particular was started by the founder of Boy scouts of Slovenia: Pavel Kunaver - Sivi Volk
EDIT: I think I've given enough information for anyone to actually find out what group (rod) I'm part of
There's literally just one group that meets all the criteria, that I've named in both of my posts
My ex was a basque
It's so beautiful there
Since we broke up I haven't visited but the weird thing is, I feel a connection with the basque people
I miss the basque country more than him
I realised there were scouts in Europe really late as well
I thought is was an american thing since we have our communistic version
Yes
We have them in our capital
A part of a roman wall that people still climb and there is a well still preserved under one of our main squares in Ljubljana
You can see it when you go to the garage bellow
There are other places as well
Nothing huge but still amazing in my opinion that these things survived for so long
There really aren't any here but neighboring Croatia has a beautiful and well preserved amphitheater in Pula, they even run concerts and stuff like that in it
Let me tell you a joke
I got sunburned in Ireland
It was supposedly the nicest summer since about the 70s, but it still rained cats and dogs about twice in a week
I'm fairly certain you're 100% wrong on this one
We have roman ruins and whatnots all over Slovenia, they might not be in the same class as an amphitheater ... but we do have them
We probably do have them but they probably are pretty insignificant imo
Bled is an incredibly pretty place, but it is not the only thing we have to offer, and therefore overrated
And we have chocolate, apple, kebab and kranjska klobasa burek
Kranjska kobasica =/= Kranjska klobasa
Kranjska klobasa needs to have specific ingredients, what you call Kranjska kobasica doesn't and it tastes a lot different
If nobody is home the package is usually left on the doorstep
We have an basement with open door and the postman was told to leave the package there
The whole stealing of packets is not really a thing here - actually crime is not that common here
Not really a problem
They have to give you the package or leave it in the box
If the package is too big and you aren't at home you have to collect at the post office
That's for the Pošta; our main postal provider
The curriers require a sign-off
If you are not home they re-deliver on another date or take it to the collection office (like a gas station)
If you agree they can leave it at a neighbour or a business close to where you live
It might be different if you live in a house as opposed to a tenement building though
I've heard that some curriers just chuck the package over the fence or something, but I've never experienced that
It is technically possible, but extremely unlikely
The delivery guy calls you (you always have to provide the phone number) to come outside, or to get instructions if someone else is going to take the packet
You can also ask them to take the packet to a pickup point, where you get it with ID or with a code they send you over SMS
You can technically ask them to leave the packet, and while afaik they aren't allowed to do it, some might
The post attempts to deliver to anyone at your address who answers the door, so I suppose you could pick something up for anyone in the building
They usually call before delivering
If my parents aren't home they just tell them to leave it infront of the house
Not all packages need a signature
It's pretty random
In my experience, most don't. I on the other hand live in an apartment and if I'm at work, some will bring it to my work the next day or they leave it at post office, Petrol or in the Parcel box
DPD once left it with my neighbour without me giving them permission
That pissed me off
I went through Ženica on my way to Sarajevo this summer
It left a poor first impression, which quickly crumbled after I saw Sarajevo
Gotta say, no country I've ever been to has such good costumer service as Bosnia
Sarajevo and Mostar are both incredible cities
So this is the AFC Wimbledoon beef backstory, this horrific town
I taught you Germans have a form for everything so it is right to assume that you must first fill the form then you can run someone over
Meanwhile your i doesnt have a dot
Does that also work for PhD students perchance
Only nazi gold accepted
I used to like them but after 2014 when our house was almost flooded not anymore
After that expirience if I hear a tunderstorm I feel a little anxious
Depends, if it is after a long period of draught in summer it is very nice to see some rain fall and enjoy the outside afterwards
Mostly I don't really like the storm itself, especially since last year we had some hail damage
I'm more of a sun person

It's impossible to translate each word but here it goes:
Zdravo, moje ime je Janez
Me veseli, da sem vas spoznal
Od kod si
> Hello, mine name is John
Me happy (more like 'making me happy'), that I did you meet
From where you
If I try to literally translate from English to Slovenian:
> Zdravo, moj ime je Janez
To je užitek k srečati tebe
Kje so ti iz
Zdravo, jst sm Erazem Lipovina
Me veseli da sva se spoznala
Od kod prihajaš?
Hello, I am Erazem Lipovina
Me pleases that we have realized
From where coming
Brown bear and Wild boar females are probably most dangerous if you encounter them with cubs
Ticks for sure
Apart from that, the only dangerous animal is the bear but even they just mind their own business if you're just a bit careful
Yeah every year there is few bear attacks
Southern part of Slovenia has most of our bear population so it is a little dangerous walking in forests especialy in mating season or when cubs are young
You can hear almost every year how a bear was sighted near Ljubljana
As for boars I have not heard of somebody dying from an attack but I know few people who have been attacked and they barley escaped
I have even heard of deer attacks when they are in mating season but it is rare
This picture encapsulates why I'd like to learn German
Cvetje v jeseni is one of the only Slovenian movies that I actually really enjoyed
For Slovenia i would recomend Outsider
Its about beginings of punk in slovenia and strugle of youth in 1980  slovenia
I'm not German but may I suggest "Der Goldene Handschuh". Especially if you are into true crime/horror genre
What about "Dnevnik Diane Budisavljević"? Didn't it get Big Golden Arena for Best Film this year in Pula
One of my favourite semi-recent Serbian film is "Rane (The Wounds)". Kosturica's films are also great
There are also some older classics from ex-Yu
Ye, it was advertised here like it's Ex-Yugoslavia's Schindler's List, a must-see, etc
Well, commercials always exaggerate stuff, it's their whole business model :)
I'll do Croatia
We got your back
We'll do Trieste
You mean 1914 or something else
> The Christmas truce
Which was in 1914 not 1912
I love our dual form:
Stol - Stola + Stoli / (one) chair - (two) chairs - (multiple) chairs
I love how many very different sounding dialects we have
I love how diverse our language is, it's both South Slavic and Western Slavic sounding, there's a lot of German and Italian influence in the language as well
When I was visiting Romania and went to the store, I understood what plenty of food items are, because very similar words
Fuck, we still have that, just different
When you first mention something, you use, for example, nov zvezek (A new notebook), when you mention it later on, you use novi zvezek (THE new notebook)
We have a funny one too, we have Zbogom (sometimes written as Z Bogom) which literally means (go) with god
means goodbye (forever)
The article explains it well, "volk" (a wolf), "volka" (two wolves), "volkovi" (more than two wolves) is a good example
Anytime we reference two of something, there's a slightly different word for it
There's some exceptions, but we generally use it all the time
What about it is confusing
When we count things it gets even trickier, because when you talk specifically about three or four of something this happens:
En volk (one wolf)
Dva volka / Dva volkova (both means two wolves, both are used to my knowledge)
Trije volkovi (three wolves)
Štirje volkovi (four wolves)
Pet volkov (five wolves) - notice no "i" at the end
Everything up until "sto volkov" (a hundred wolves) is simply volkov (no "i" at the end), and then the pattern repeats with "sto in en volk" (a hundred and one wolf), "sto in dva volkova" (a hundred and two wolves) and so on
So generally, counting is a little different than simple plural
Without specific numbers, we say:
"volk" (for a single wolf),
"volka" / "volkova" (this unequivocally means two wolves, even with no number in front of the word),
"volkovi" (for when you know there's more than two, but cannot provide a specific number)
Example: There were wolves on the hill yesterday
"How many
" Probably 5 or 6 wolves
This sentence translates to:  Včeraj so na hribu bili volkovi (with an "i", simple plural)
"Koliko
" Verjetno 5 ali 6 volkov (with no "i", since you've now provided a specific number)
I don't know how relevant this is to your question, I hope it helps

You can eat it instead of popcorn lol
Hmmm
I'd have to say Žganci (Ajdovi)
They look and taste disgusting and I don't know why people like them
If you don't like Fire salamander brandy/močeradovec there is gadovec/Adder brandy
Ya completely integrated in slovene language bit it is written as "okej"
We have our own country lmao
Wow that sounded impossible to me at first, but I looked it up and it is actually true, apparently South Tyroleans were to be relocated to Crimea
In our translation instead of Baggins we have Bisagin
Well at least according to the subtitles from the movies
The weirdest for me are the translations in Harry Potter
Some examples:
- Voldemort - Mrlakenstein
- Severus Snape - Robaus Raws
- Bellatrix Lestrange - Krasotilya L'Ohol
- Nymphadora Tonks - Fatale Tanga
- Dolores Umbridge - Kalvara Temyna
[Other translations] make more sense, well the Voldemort one is reffering to the >!I am lord Voldemort
< part
The weirdest to me is the one for Bellatrix
Lmao we also called him Torbar at one point
Don't know what his name is now, but our teacher calles him Torbar
Baggins is translated Bisagin in Slovenian - its a weird one
In slovenian it is Bisagin for no reason
I like the LOTR translations, since they didn't change too much like Harry Potter translations did, which I think was unnecessary
I love how the characters in LOTR and The Hobbit all kept their original names, but the lands (middle earth-srednji svet; the shire-šajerska) were translated to be very silmilar to their origins
I dislike Slovenian translations for that very reason- they change names and even movie titles way too much
Subtitles are often even worse-they leave out important things, completely miss the joke, and are often overall horrible
It comes from bisaga - a type of a bag
Which is many times better than the previous translation of Bogataj
It's probably because bisaga means bag
Yup, se strinjam s tem

I am saddened every time a piece of cultural or natural heritage is destroyed or damaged, no matter where in the world it happens
I am as sorry for the Notre Dame just as much as I was sorry for Palmyra
When it comes to cultural heritage, I don't only see it as European, Asian or African heritage but as human heritage
Picking up women in English (my technically 3rd language) is light-years easier than in any other language I speak at any level and that's the effect it has on my personality
Flirting in German is just weird but I get super-rational, and Slavic languages are great to be pissed, depressed, and negative in, which usually happens
I think Ljubljana is the MOST hated or disliked, but most people are still pretty indifferent
They're just a bit more arrogant, rich and stuck up I guess
Still love visiting it though
I don't think Bosniaks hate Sarajevo
They love it and praise it as their capital, even in the Krajina region(I'm from a village so it may not be true for let's say Tuzla)
But I think they're too busy hating on Croats and Serbs (also vice-versa) to hate on themselves
The hate towards Banja Luka is much stronger in the Muslims
Yeah
if just someone could condirm it
lol, upsala is a word we use when we did something clumsily, like almost tripping over or almost leaving an umbrella on the bus

Our goverment threw hands in the air last year as covid situation started, let the "opposition" to take reins (our current goverment) and is now complaining about "draconic/fashist covid measures
Everyone and their mom speaks english here
Even when it comes to older population, many will understand at least the basics
Most people are required to learn a third language in high school (most commonly german or french, spanish is popular too), though the fluency in it varies from person to person
Yes, absolutely, you really can’t do anything with knowing only slovenian, as it is spoken in one country, by 2 million people, and a 2 hour drive in any direction will land you in another country
Older people will more likely speak german, and less likely to speak english, while the younger population will almost certainly speak english as it it learned from the age of 6 now
Later in primary school they can also choose to learn more languages, most commonly german, and in about half of high schools picking another language apart from english is mandatory
I think a while ago I saw a statistic that the average slovenian speaks 3 languages, which is a lot, but you also have to consider that most slovenes will speak croatian as the language is very similar to ours
Croatians, on the other hand, mostly won’t speak slovene, as understanding croatian from slovene seems to be a one way street
Edit:
Here is the survey, we rank 2nd in EU, I guess
I think most people near the italian border speak Italian
Styrians and Carinthians speak (to varying degrees) German
Serbo-Croatian (we generally don't notice the diference between Serbian and Croatian) is understood by basically everyone, though I think that younger people understand it less and less and older people speak it, since they learned it at school
I always found it funny when Tarik Filipović tried speaking Slovene on Potjera
He seemed very fascinated with the word for lunch, "kosilo". He couldn't pronounce it correctly for the life of him
I don't really know why is that and I agree with you
I guess older generations learned Serbo-Croatian in school
I know that people who didn't have cable watched HRT a lot (along with ORF and Rai), this must have something to do with it
Also we spend our summers on your coast and listen to your music
I think we have a basic idea of the language, but I think we generally speak broken Croatian
I for one believe that I could hold a basic conversation in Croatian, but I rather just speak Slovene instead of weird Croatian when I'm in Croatia and it works out well most of the time
I switch to Croatian when it doesn't, especially with numbers
We have a glorious law stating that it is up to the bureaucrat taking the name to judge if the name might be morally, socially or otherwise unacceptable
In that case, the parent get a warning, and if they don't change their mind, the name remains and they get reported to social services
This is a very convoluted way of saying you can name your kid anything and absolutely nothing is going to happen to you unless you try something like running for public office
Edit: found out we have a limit at used characters
No numbers or special characters, must use Slovene alphabet + xywq
At least that part is not too terrible
The military museum in Pivka
It has a submarine, fighter planes, tanks, apcs, guns, trucks and other ww2 stuff
Nope, they just talk really quite
But because my parents barely speak any English, I sometimes spoke English with my friends(even tho they were Slovene) hehe
From my experience, not one tourist or non-native spoke to me in Slovenian
It is always either English or their own language (mostly in Italian) because the part of the country that I grow up for some reason the Italian tourists always expect we know Italian, the same goes for people that come from Serbo-Croatian speaking countries they expect we know their language already
But if I ever hear a non-native try to speak to me in Slovenian I'll be pleased to listen but until then I can't say if it's annoying or not, I mean to me it would be awesome
The smell of an alpine forest with some freshly cooked sausage
Wild bears stink, can't really describe the smell
If you are downwind from it, you will definitely smell it before you can see or hear it
The last one is just straight up awesome lol
If you're travelling nowadays that's essentially it
Abandoned guard houses
My dude, that's really weird
To be fair though I used to think Croatia was just a weird place within Slovenia, where people spoke some sort of SUPER version of the Bela krajina accent
I was a weird kid
I'd recommend you continue onwards for like 20-30 minutes from Bled and hit up Lake Bohinj
It's much more beautiful than Bled IMHO and less touristy
[Here you go for the cream cake recipe :\)]
If you visit Slovenia again, may I recommend a trip to the Skocjan Caves and the nearby Predjama Castle
Both of these go double if you're a LOTR fan (not filming locations, but could easily have been the inspiration for some)
I'm not big on baking, I just thought you may have forgotten its name and found one
[Here's one] in Slovenian which might be google translateable (feel free to PM me if any translations don't make sense)
There's also a [companion video] with it, that shows the steps (though the voice and text are also in Slovenian)
If you decide to re-visit and want some more tips on what to go see, also, feel free to ping me, I'm always happy to give people some tips :)
It's Illy and not even close
Second is Barcaffe and after that Lavazza
Lavazza is trash compared to Goriziana and Trieste
Just to say, its a bit arhaic in colloquial but it used more often in some dialects
I think so

Thanks u/Big_Dirty_Piss_Boner
Not well known to anyone but some locals
I live in a town that blew up when they have found coal, now the town is a shithole with 100's or even up to a 1000 people moving away to Ljubljana every year
The town had around 50
000 people living here at its peak and when the mines and industries closed soon after the fall of communism a lot of the factories were left abandoned one of the biggest ones being demolished not long ago
These places are now place for teens to explore since there is nothing else to do in this boomer town
In one of those factories someone committed suicide and it was a story of the week along my classmates
There is hundreds of  buildings like that here that just lay there forgotten
But one of my favorites has to be an abandoned graveyard
I live 10 minutes from the old centre, you know the deal: church,... Not far from the center was a graveyard, not maintained for years so the trees grew over it, a lot of the tombstones were replaced, but some are still the original ones
I haven't been there for years but it used to be very spooky
v - in
h/k - to
s/z - with
o - about
a - but
Words
Not that I can think of (unless it's slang)
However particle words what I call them, yes (aka words that serve grammar like preposition or other)
v -> into/in
k/h  -> to/towards
z/s -> with
o -> about
(The two possible ones in the 2nd and 3rd examples are used based on the starting letter of the next word but mean exactly the same)
Amongst people on similar positions in a single company, it generally isn't discussed, since nobody wants any tensions in case salaries are different
I don't think it's rude, just everyone prefers not to know
Amongst people outside your company, it is almost a small talk topic
I live in a bilingual area, where slovene and italian are official languages
Italian is the co-official language because the coastline of Slovenia had a substantial italian population until 1954, after that year most of them emigrated to Italy with just a few thousand people remaning
So, today not much people speak italian at home and generally slovene is much more widely spoken
However, the italian minority is very active culturally and has many rights and institutions in place
They have a whole system of political and cultural organization that is soley theirs (the self-governed italian communities that are joined in a general slovene coastal community)
They have the right to 3 seats in each city council, they have one MP in the national parliament
All have the right to speak italian during mostly slovene-speaking sessions
They have their parallel italian school system from kidergarten to high school
All slovene schools have compulsory italian language, but just 3 hours per week, one hour less then slovene and the same amount as english
However italian starts at first grade, english at third grade
I went to an italian speaking kindergarten myself
They have their own local TV and radio station in italian
Then bilinguism is compulsory in written documents
So, all forms, all written announcments, all street signs etc, have to be in both languages
Street and place signs are perhaps the most obvious manifestation of bilinguism
All the members of the minority speak fluent slovene, also a huge number of slovenes speak italian, but unfortunately not all of them (sadly also many people at official positions have quite a poor fluency in italian)
Usually the italians will switch to slovene if they know they are in public and speaking to a slovene person
They speak mostly italian when they are among themselves at the bar of the italian community or at cultutal events organized by the community
We are very lucky to have them since their events are always higher in quality then other events
That is weird
Doesn't it bother the people that your country's language is not used
Why don't they use it, is it a recent language as a result of secession, or was it rooted out while you were part of Russia
I would think everybody would be eager to embrace it as a monument of independence, it is a big part of national identity, I mean, Croatians even invented new words to further the differences between Yugoslavian/Serbian language and theirs
I think that in Italian mixed area there are seperate Slovenian and Italian schools
In Slovenian schools language of instruction is Slovenian and they teach Italian as 2nd language and vice versa in [Italian] schools
But in Hungarian mixed areas all schools are bilingual which means language of instruction is both Slovenian and Hungarian
I don't know how that works though
The way I immagine it is that they sometimes have math or whatever in Slovenian, and next time in Hungarian, idk
There are also bilingual schools with Slovenian as language of instruction in Hungary, Austria and Italy
Understandable if it were only up to a few individuals in government and education to enforce the language, but what puzzles me is the lack of initiative from the general populace
>  all fur coat and no knickers
hah
what an interesting saying, love it
Well yes, parents are usually at work by then
They only need someone older than 10 to walk with them in kindergarten and 1st grade, so that's when they're 6
The oldest one Slovene manuscript is Freising manuscripts from 10th Century
It could be understand but you would need some time to get "aclimated" and get to know some different letters an phonetics behind it
Most Famoso sentence there is ""[Etjè bi det naš ne səgréšil, tè u weki jèmu bè žíti,...]" which would be translated in moderen slovene as ""Če bi ded naš ne grešil, bi mu v veke bilo živeti"- "If our grandfather had not sinned, he would have lived forever
I once tried reading more than this famous first lines and it gets complicated really fast after that
I'd say I didn't catch more than half the meaning all in all, but the opening lines are really similar to modern language
Later texts, from Primož Trubar in 16th century and later are more or less understandable once you get past the spelling and font
I have a happy gap in knowledge of any texts in between the two
To me it was an embarrassing moment when I went to Munich with my school
We were riding an escalator and I was standing in the middle while some woman wanted to go faster so my classmate said in slovenian "Daj spusti staro burglo mimo" (Let the old hag go infront)
I stepped aside and when she passed us she turned around and said that we are not the only Slovenians there
We were shocked and after the shock wore out classmait was verry glad he did not say something worse
Yes it does and this is a sample card
[Sample]
[Slovene ID card]
Here almost everybody has one
If you cross the border driver's license is not valid and you must have passport/ID
Passport is quite large so if you go to Croatia for a daytrip or shopping in Austria (yes sometimes they check in border crossing in Austria even though we are Schengen) so ID is more practical because you can always have it in the wallet
It looks crazy because they use digraphs for single sounds
Writing it down in another Slavic language it'd look like: Brenčiščikijevič, which probably still looks crazy to nonSlavs but has like only 2/3rds of the letters
Tina is a normal name and "Vzorec" means sample
Another name that is commonly used in card samples is Janez Novak
The name is exactly the same as in Germany
Vzorec translated into German means Muster
So translated it would be Tina Muster
We also use Janez Novak/Marija Novak because Janez and Marija are most common names and Novak is most common surname
General feel of the photo tells me that birth date and photo could match but that photo was made in late 80s or beggining of 90s. And photos on ID cards are just wierd sometimes
Here ID is a bit cheaper and before Brexit we could even go to UK without passport
So basically you need passport only if you travel out of Europe or in Belarus, Ukraine, Russia Turkey, Moldova or in Caucasus
But you [can] travel with ID to Croatia
You can even travel with ID to Montenegro and they are not even EU
For me it's really more about practicality because ID can always be with you in the wallet but passport is too big
Honorary Slav
Trst, Trst, Trst, Ljubljana, Ljubljana
Celovec(Klagenfurt) and Gradec(Graz) were also very important for Slovenes
Celovec(Klagenfurt) was/is also very important for Slovenians
In Carantania it was Krnski grad (Karnburg)
If we can count that
Yes, but Trst is certainly bigger
Yeah, most of the people say Gradec although Graz is also used, especially in Eastern Slovenia
You can also find Gradec on [motorway signs ]
2021*
I started learning it at when I was about 6, I' m 15 currently
I feel like I am at the fluent level, as I am constantly emerged in the language via YouTube, Reddit etc
I started learning it in school in like 3rd grade, but I learned the most out of watching minecraft youtube videos
My speaking is ok but if I speak for a long period of time, it starts to sound like my mouth is stuffed with something
Sorry that this doesn't really answer your question
I suggest just reading and speaking more so it improves with time
You can make a pretty good guess often, but there are many exceptions everywhere and you can burn easily
You can, for example, usually recognise a Muslim Bosnian (Bosniak), because of darker skin and visible Turkish features, but not really Serbian or Croatian Bosnian, because they look more general South Slavic
But at the same time often you can't distinguish between a Russian and  a Frenchman
Also regarding food:
- buy local and seasonal, avoid exotic fruits imported from the other side of the world (s. America, asia)
- buy or make (from old curtains) reusable and washable bags for fruits and vegetables
Same goes in Slovenia
Edit: It's fly instead of flea like my colleague said down below my bad
Oh yeah you're right, my bad
My brain is not working correctly in the morning
Yes
The Fran Ramovš institute for slovene language is regarded as the ultimate research and normative authority regarding slovenian lanaguage
The institute is part of the reasearch centre of the Slovenian academy of sciences and arts
We've got a miniscule 46
6km coast
I'd say around Ankaran or a bit to the north
Or Piran in Fiesa or Strunjan
I love Sango Sands in Scotland
But it's too cold to swim, even in summer
Bele Skale and Mesečev zaliv are nice
Although dangeruous in some parts because of falling rocks
Bohinj lake has beautiful beaches so does Soča and some other rivers, but those tend to be cold
Strunjan is the best spot, if you ask me
Part of the cliff crashed down a few weeks ago, and it's not really reccomended to go there now
However, I hope the situation stabilizes before the summer
Oh yes I always prefer non-salty water
I think it's a vegetable
,right
I 'swam' on a secluded beach in NW of Scotland
It was a hot day, 28-30°C. I only took a dip, the water was way to cold to swim in
I have also been to Sango Sands, a really really beatiful beach but no one swam there
The only place I saw a few people swimming in was in St
Andrews but the water and beach there didn't look appealing
Ljubljana and Maribor, capital vs second biggest city
The two best football clubs are based in these two cities (NK Olimpija and NK Maribor), as well as Slovenia's two biggest universities
Ljubljana (the capital) and Maribor (the second largest)
However Ljubljana has a rivalry with basically any other city in the country
In Slovenia it's very similar
We have a saying that goes "vsaka vas ima svoj glas" (every village has its own voice), meaning that every village has a slightly different speech than the neighboring one
On a scientific level Slovene is divided into app
50 dialects, grouped into 7 regional dialect groups
True dialects are mostly spoken by old people in rural areas, most of other people speak one of the colloquial regional varieties of Slovene, that are more unified, they are closer to literal Slovene and there is less variation between them
But still they can clearly show where one comes from
Slovenian as such is basically the lingua franca of Slovenia
If you learn just Slovenian to fluency without exposure to the dialects, everyone will understand you, but you'll still understand precious little of what natives are saying to each other, if they're all from the same part of the country, no matter which one
We have a saying: "Vsaka vas ima svoj glas" - Every town has its own voice (meaning dialect)
He is not
[There are quite a lot of them]
The difference between the terms "dialect" and "language" more or less always depends on politics
And even that is inaccurate, because Prekmurje (the north-east-most) is split into 4 dialects that differ in vocabulary and pronunciation as well
Not to mention that the Prekmurje "dialect" has historically been a separate literary language in its own right and is still the de facto language of education, business, and everything else in Prekmurje
[This] (PDF) is the best map around
[This one] is interesting
Croatia stealing our sea
Wait that actually was Croatia
for the last time
polish death camps means death camps in poland, not that they were run by the polish
maybe
i mean if there is one historical record even a layman knows about its ww2
since we all know nazis made death camps it just seems like its pointless to talk about if someone would mistake polish to mean operated by poland, they are either ignorant or dumb
i'm more appaled by some poles having such a hissy fit over it that right wing politicians came out to say how 0 poles ever colaborated with the nazis or had no hand in rounding up jews
We don't either
Religion is just briefly mentioned in ethics class in 8th or 7th (I'm not sure) grade
I doubt there is any other country, that would have Slovene for its subject
We also have it in Slovenia
We have it too
In 5th and 6th grade
Here we also learn about equality at home, accidents that can happen at home, hygene, ecology, money, clothes, shopping and of course about cooking and cleaning
We only have that in last year of high school
To prepare for a [matura dance]
We have both 'home economics' and 'handicrafts' in elementary
Handicrafts meaning making stuff out of wood, metal,... technical drawings, electricity
stuff like that
We have Philosophy in gymnasiums
Only one year though
And one year of Sociology and one of Psychology
I did orienteering at Taborniki (non-religious Scouts)
It was so fun
Finding CP's on a map, night time orienteering
I really wish I joined an orienteering club
Ethics class is taught in both 7th and 8th grade
We have it only as optional class and I don't think that even all schools have it
It's called religions and ethics and it's not only about Catholicism
Gospodinjstvo it is called
I know, but I don't remember in which grade religions are covered
I think 7th
I remember we had to do presentation about different religions and in 8th it was more about politics, environment and so on
I don't think many countries have religious classes
Pretty sure most countrie learn about it in the same fashion as you
They learn about world religions from an objective point of view
We learn about world religions in 'Civic education and culture and ethics' class
Curriculum content points:
Important human right - Freedom of religion
Religious communities in R. of Slovenia - all equal, seperate from the state
Big world religions - Judaism, Christianity (Catholicism, Protestantism, Orthodox Christianity), Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, new religious movements, non-religious forms of worldview
Common features and differences of world religions
Moral and ethical principles of world religions
Cooperation and conflicts among world religions
We do have a few villages where cities are basically divided by two
A good example would be Gornja Radgona and its Austrian side, Bad Radkerburg
A weird case is the towns of Gorizia and Nova Gorica (New Gorizia)
Although they are separate town and Nova Gorica is younger (so they don't qualify), they're just across the border and, if the said border was gone, the two towns would be basically indiscernable on a map
Edit: I messed something up, my bad
Besides the most well known of Gorica/Nova Gorica, we also have Radgona (Bad Radkersburg)/Gornja Radgona and Libeliče/Libeliče (Leifling)
Kind of
The closest example is Gorica/Nova Gorica
When the "old" Gorica (Gorizia in italian) was awarded to Italy in 1947, Yugoslavia decided to build a "new Gorica" on our side of the border
Nova Gorica was built as a modernist and socialist town as opposed to the old medieval one
The towns were never a single whole, but they literaly "touch" each other and are increasingly starting to function as a single urban area as the borders controls were abolished with Slovenia entering Schengen in 2008
Another example is Gornja Radgona on the austrian border, which lies on the Mura river, which is also where de border lies
Gornja Radgona used to be a whole with Radgona (Bad Radkersburg i think) on the other side of the bridge in Austria until 1918
Not at all
Usually there is no one on the border at all, not even on the highway
I've been stopped once, for a quick check when going from Italy to Slovenia
Idk where you've been stopped, but in Gorizia/Nova Gorica you can't even spot the border if you don't know where it is
Fuck, my bad, I mistyped that
Forgive me
No idea what they were looking for, but it is defenitely not normal
On the Slo-At border before the Karawanken tunnel, traffic jam is quite often (to pay for the tunnel) and it feels like you're waiting for a border check
But if they checked you on a bus station, that couldn't be the case
Maybe it was due to Corona anyway, the panic had already begun at the time
Nice, I'm from just outside Ljubljana
Hope you enjoyed your last trip for some time
it was not the best time to visit lake Bled though, the red water was disgusting
Not total, we can leave the house freely, but we're asked not to hang around public places so Lj is deserted
A lot of dumb people've been taking trips to the seaside lately, so from midnight on it will not be allowed to leave the municipality of your residence
There are new people infected every day, but everything looks under control
A week ago a whole retirement's home got infected so we have about 10 deaths now
Hope things get better soon in Spain, I've been to Andalusia 5 autumns in a row
looking forward to come back

The battle at capporeto
Here in slovenia we call it the mirracle at capporeto(čudez pri kobaridu) but italians call it the disaster at capporeto
I think here he's seen quite positively
He not only made Slovenian an official language he also made Ljubljana the capital of the Illiric Provinces
In Slovenia he is treated as a hero (or at least as a positive figure)
In slovenia he is treated as a hero I'd say, but is a thing of debate
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't Otto von Habsburg help out a few thousand Austrian Jews flee to Switzerland
No, but I do have period underwear
Cheap & old
Surprisingly nobody is talking about any of the numerous songs
Now that we are in a civilized subreddit, I think all should be fine
HoI4 - Always Yugoslavia or some LatAm country
I find trying to take over Eurasia with Yugoslavia a nice challenge, and the same goes for the Americas with whichever LatAm country
Sveti Trije kralji v Slovenskih goricah (Holy Three Kings in the Slovenian hills) - 34 letters
Sveta Trojica v Slovenskih goricah (Holy Trinity in the Slovenian hills) - 30 letters
[Sveti Trije Kralji v Slovenskih Goricah] apparently with 34 letters
According to RTV article, it's either Sveti Trije Kralji v Slovenskih goricah or Sveta Trojica v Slovenskih goricah
Yes they are less than 5 km apart
Slovenian hills - Slovenske gorice,  Windische Bühel in Austria, is the region in north east of Slovenia (Styria)
Many small settlements are carrying this affix of the region to the name to distinguish them from other same name towns in Slovenia

A saw a car with license plates from Malta a few years ago
"afna" - which translated means a monkey or it can be used for a person who seeks attention
honestly never thought about it having anything to do with a monkey
Opica = monkey ...
Afna = @ or a rude attention seaker
It's an old word for monkey
>**áfna** \-e ž (á) nižje pog
*opica:* afne skačejo po drevesih
Afna its an old word for monkey, my grandmother still used it
Yeah, I hear it often over here
More in context of parents calling their children "afne" telling them not to behave like an "afna", if they're particularly playful/mischievous
"Ne afne guncat" and "ne se afnat" is very widespread
Rarely have I ever heard it in the context of actually calling a monkey that
Usually I root for every underdog country
But if Croatia is competing I root for them
In Belgium, I saw for the first time the really complex bureaucracy working smoothly
The employees actually knew what they were doing, amount of mistakes was negligible, and they seemed to have an information system that didn't need an IT guy hovering in the back the whole time
Really felt I was from a less developed country at that point
It was in 2012 and thank god it improved for us since then, but I'm still reminded sometimes
> Also portions of food were much more smaller
That's just because Turkey's national goal seems to be to make sure every tourist gains like 10 kilograms / week there
It's also why it's one of my favorite countries to visit - dat food
They're too close to the US ;)
I want a sandwich with 10 dekagrams of salami and 5 dekagrams of cheese, and a nice 7 deciliter bottle of water, damn it
Malta is epic, can confirm
Anyone who likes castles can spend probably years there and not see them all
It's brilliant
Wanna trade with Slovenia
We'd rather be called micro-state than Eastern European or Balkan
Well, geographically, culturally, and historically, only Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine are Eastern Europe in all three groups
Politically, one could add the rest of the Warsaw Pact, but Yugoslavia wasn't part of that, so Eastern Europe doesn't work at all
#unaligned
As for Balkans - that makes more sense even though it's kind of like being a child of a black and a white parent - not really one or the other but almost always considered black, so it's begrudgingly accepted, but then in most contexts the things that are said about the Balkans don't really apply
Considering Tito smoked Cuban cigars in the White House
Not exactly comparable to Stalin or his followers I'd say
Also ignorance
Much
Ignorance
What was he doing in Baghdad anyway
Italy

Because traditions
Yes, nobody expects the Slovenian uprising and then invasion from the south
MWAHAHAHAHAHA
Celovec, Beljak & Gradec shall soon be liberated
That's why the Netherlands should be the strongest proponents of Eurofederalization
Invading the Netherlands is one thing
Invading half of Europe is quite another
Italy or Hungary are more likely to invade because of their national minorities in Slovenia
We literally stole Prekmurje and Primorska has always been influenced by Italians
Our Russia
Slovenia
Yeah agree on that
Maybe a natinalist Austria
But Croatia
Nah
Nobody stole Prekmurje any more than any other region was stolen :P Also, Murska Republika bitches, older than Slovenia
Y'all should've joined us
Oof, hits close
That's because you're Slavs
Western Europe is simply racist towards Slavs, and the Slavic EU member states are not treated even close to equal, even though some of them have since surpassed some non-Slavic EU member states
And Russia is specifically targeted because it's the only Slavic country that can give the western EU trouble
> The bad news is that we're never leaving Poland
This is why I'm hoping for another term of Trump
He actually might stumble into that
Low but nonzero chance
Best thing that can happen for Europe for the reasons you explained
Respond preemptively how though
In a situation where the EU and Russia (and presumably all the countries in between) are bonding this much, the US would literally have to declare war on all of Europe + Russia
I don't see that going well for even the US, even if you can get China to threaten the Russian southern flank enough that they can't dedicate all their armed forces to defending their shores
And I'm not sure China would willingly go to war against the EU either, if they can stay neutral and not lose that market
I also can't imagine the various 'Stans or Turkey attack Russia/Europe, because if they should lose, there's a good chance Russia would steamroll them on purpose and Europe might even support Russia there on principle, since nobody likes being stabbed in the back
Ofc it's not happening anytime soon, but as a thought experiment, if it were to happen through the magic of newly found friendship and trust, I find it highly optimistic to believe that the US could do major damage if going to war against all of Europe + Russia, simply because invading and keeping up logistics across an ocean isn't quite that easy
Not to mention that even on the off chance that the US establishes a territory in Europe, they'd be fighting people who look like them and understand their language
Literally anyone could be a spy
So unless we're talking mass murder even Mao would be in awe of, the US would find out first hand how obnoxious European guerilla warfare can be
But it wouldn't come to that
Europe + Russia aren't exactly some 3rd world country you can steamroll even now where Europe is pretty much asleep militarily
And if NATO breaks down, you'll have Europe arming itself, so by the time this happens, the US have 0 chance of winning
It's a either draw or nuclear annihilation for everyone
> Europe can't arm itself if there's no money to buy the arms and no people to use them
You realize the EU economy alone is as large as the US one
And you'd be adding the rest of Europe on top of that, which doesn't bring THAT much but it helps
Also, 20% are aged 65+ in the EU
Finally, you don't need nearly as many people to defend as you need to attack
Especially with modern weaponry, which a combo of EU + Russia would definitely have
Also, you're forgetting that the world would take sides
I could see plenty of the world siding with Europe + Russia here, which would be a major blow to the strength of the Dollar, which can utterly destroy the US economy
The US debt-to-GDP ratio is 106%. For the EU, that's 80%. We'll see about the Eurozone
The only reason why the US are safe-ish is that the USD is the world trade currency, which would change in the event of such a war though, so the US is in a riskier situation in that regard
No young people in Europe can easily be fixed
Hell, I'm pretty sure if the EU relaxes immigration laws, we'll get plenty of young Americans come over
Y'know, free education, no worrying about going broke over a broken arm etc
And if we create a program where you get citizenship for going into the army for a bit AND actually use our own military-industrial complex to prop up the economy like the US does, well
The US exports to the EU make up 18% of US exports
The reverse is 21%. Not a major difference, both would be comparably hard hit if that ceases
The US can have 11 carriers and the 2 largest airforces on the planet
But that still doesn't make it allpowerful
The rest of the world doesn't NEED navies that can compete in the event of such a war, because everyone would simply be fighting a defensive war and waiting for the US to exhaust itself and for its morale to break like it did in every
Single
War
starting with Vietnam
Not to mention that being the instigator of WW3 wouldn't make the US popular with anyone on the planet, and I'd bet that even Canada would stay neutral, which means you'd have to leave its shipping alone
As for trade - there is no way the US can control the Mediterranean
Even just getting in would be suicidal, considering all entry points are literally chokepoints easily covered from Europe
And with that secured, the EU can continue trading with 7/10 of its top 10 trading partners
A bit more inconvenient, since it would go by land, but in a scenario where the EU and Russia grow that close, it's reasonable to assume that land infrastructure between them has been vastly improved, and China is already building its Silk Road 2
0, which is just that
Seriously, there's no realistic scenario in which the US can defeat a united Europe + Russia + all the traditional enemies of the US who are in the middle east and elsewhere, who'd join that alliance by default
Remember the war games where the US invades Iran
With its resources, Iran could sink a carrier already
You know what America's biggest weakness is
Y'all aren't used to losing
So when something isn't going your way for long enough, you "bring home the troops" instead of finishing what you started
On the other side you have a continent which is historically known for slaughtering each other until the whole continent burns
The start of our discussion actually says it all
The US would do everything in their power to prevent an EU-Russia alliance, because it's clear to everyone that if that happens, it's down to 2nd place for the US
No, but we have lots of restaurants that serve so called "malica". These are daily menus that are only served between 10:00-14:00
They are normally cheaper than regular food and mostly for workers who work close
All employers need to pay "malica" to workers
So normally workers get additionally 3
81 - 6
12 euros per day only for "malica".
I mean, most of Oliver Dragojević's music is really good
Plonkec/plonklistek/plonkceglc or švinglc/švinglceglc or cetelc
Plonkec (v. plonkati) probably comes from German *blank sein*
cetelc means *piece of paper* in probably some dialect
No idea where *švinglc* comes from
There could be more words in different dialects that I don't know of
makes sense
Yes, I think now most schools do
When I was in elementary school we didn't. You just hung your coat on a hanger infront of your main classroom and left your shoes under a bench
I think in first 2 or 3 grades we had a locker room
Just a big room where we all left our things
In high school we had lockers but we had to share with another person
We have lockers, but we usually use them just to keep shoes and umbrellas there or winter clothes
What you had lockers I never had any locker not in primary school or high school
In primary school we had only a place to leave your coat an shoes and that was it
In high school you had to carry all your things with you all day I went to SERŠ in Maribor
First 4 grades we had a shared space for coats and shoes and seperate drawers for notebooks, inside the class
From 5th grade on, we had our own drawers in primary and highschool
Ljubljana btw
People from other countries find wearing slippers for school funny, but it's very nice
Halls and classrooms were clean and I think wearing winter boots in heated classroms is not too comfortable
In highschool we kept out shoes on though
It was just big white lockers in the basement
I went to [GCC] (Celje)
I think they have better ones now
But damn, it was a good school back then, looking at their Instagam profile now, the new principal is killing it
I wish I could go there now
We had lockers in primary school (from grade 5 onwards) but we were the first generation to have them
In highschool we needed to opt in to have lockers but everyone decided to get one (it cost a couple of € per year)
While you could leave books at school most people didn't since you usually needed them for homework or studying
Most people kept their PE clothes there and "berilo" (not sure what the english word for it is lol)
This was ŠCPO in Postojna
To feel more comfortable
Who wants to be in their shoes all day
Especially little kids in snow or rain boots
That's just not normal
I think high schools here had different rules
Some allowed shoes inside, mine didn't. We had lockers but we only used them for coats, shoes and p.e. stuff and carried all our book for the day with us
They have different lockers now but idk how they use them
I guess it's up to each individual
But if you leave your books in school, how do you study at home
If you're talking about the narrow grey ones, they're still here but the only ones using them are the 1st years
Small kids wear slippers, similar to the ones on the first pic
In the higher grades everybody has  [those]
We had [this kind of] closed wardrobes, and never had lid desks
Have you ever heard of slippers
Do kids in kindergarten wear shoes all day as well
Yikes
Having visited my girlfriend in a kindergarten she works in, I can't imagine kids playing in their classrooms and climbing over gym equipment in the same shoes they wear outside
Hallways are always full of dirt and sand after they come in from the playground
But kids still jump and play and roll on the ground inside
It also rains and gets very dirty outside
My girlfriend works with 1-2 year olds and they climb everywhere and put things in their mouths, shoes included because that's how they learn
They have fabric and leather furniture and a comfy carpet in a calming corner and fabric toys and that all gets dirty even without dirty shoes all over it
Well 4-5 year olds still jump and dance and sit and play on the floor
And then it's raining outside, a whole bunch of kids comes in with wet shoes and then they go and play on wet and dirty floor
million = milijon
billion = milijarda
trillion = bilijon
quadrillion = bilijarda
etc
It's in the shape of a chicken
Not really
Especially in city buses where the exit door are in the middle/end of the bus
You ain't gonna tell across the whole bus
Nope, you almost always exit the bus through the doors at the back of it so you’d have to yell for him to hear anything, on the rare times you exit through the door next to him the most you’d say is bye
You’d get a lot of wierd looks from people if you said thanks
We are [chicken shaped]
I'm just going to put this here
**Slovenia because we look like a chicken
Italy would be my second best
> Croatia is also unique, but it's shape "makes no sense"
[dragon]
Prekmurje is entire head, Goričko is the brain
Don't you see the chicken
Coughs in Spanish
Are ISIS in your mind the oppressed party
I say, that would be a stretch ...
Pretty much most of the time unless they english is very good
You can usually hear an accent
We don't bite anything
We have: "Iti po gobe" meaning: "to go get mushrooms". And the other one is:"Iti rakom zvizgat" which means: "to go whistle to crabs".
In Slovenian, we say *iti* *rakom žvižgat* (literally to whistle to the crabs) or *iti po gobe* (to go mushroom picking), but I'm pretty sure we don't have any phrases with biting
In Slovenia, 'Culture day' also celebrates a poet: France Prešeren
[Prekmurje] is quite distinct from the rest of Slovenia in pretty much every way
History - They spent most of their history under Hungarian rule, while the rest of Slovenia was under Austrian rule
Language - They speak a famously difficult dialect that could almost be considered a separate language
They even codified their own alphabet that was based on the Hungarian alphabet, but it fell into disuse after WW2
Religion - While still majority Catholic, they also have a strong Protestant presence and are considered to be the center of Slovenian Protestantism
Geography - It's the flattest part of Slovenia, which together with different architecture, town design, etc
makes it visually distinct from the rest of Slovenia
Understanding people from Prekmurje is just so difficult it's ridiculous, I really appreciate them talking in standard Slovene when around others
They're basically what's left of pannonian Slovenes from before the Hungarians came, pair that with living under hungarian rule for centuries separate from the rest in Italy and Austria and you get a very distinct region
We can't sing but we do it [anyways]

Why is there these wannabe ghetto kids in mostly rich european countries
There aint anything like these down here
I like ours
It's about friendship and peace, not about a single nation's patriotism, which is a rarity
Here are the lyrics:
God's blessing on all nations,
Who long and work for that bright day,
When o'er earth's habitations,
No war, no strife shall hold its sway,
Who long to see,
That all men free,
No more shall foes, but neighbours be
It's a drinking song
What else is there to say
Not to mention it talks about a free-thinking Slovene, who's politically aware, which I think fits well for a national anthem
What also fits well for Slovenes, is that it's also a drinking poem and a carmen figuratom in shape of a cup
Super prevod
What about the other lines in the poem
[Hrvatska do Tokija
In my area it's 4-7 usually
Idared, Jonagold, Granny smith, Braeburn, Cripps pink (Pink lady) and Fuji are almost always available and others rotate around
Depends on your taste and where you use them, I love pink lady but for some stuff it can't compare to Granny smith

We also have extra pairs of slippers for guests in different sizes
Yep
It took me a while to start using 'what' instead of 'how' in cases like these, and I sometimes still make a mistake when speaking if I'm not paying attention
Could you share your edit, please
Thanks for sharing
If you don't mind, I'd like to read your version of the text
You can send it to me via a PM if you want
I work as a translator and I like reading texts like that in hopes of improving my language skills
:) It's been a long time since I worked on academic texts, but the one you posted seems to be too complicated and it doesn't quite get the message across
Thank you

over here we are "sexing"

It's a romantic way of saying having sex, sure, but the phrase itself is not exclusively sex related
On the contrary, it's main meaning is to deeply love someone, completely nonsexual in meaning
Like food
For example: [makovka] or [makova potica]
Poppy seeds are food, primarily for sweets, but also found in savoury bake goods
While I don't think it counted as drugs, more as herbal medicine, there are recipes around for brewing tea from poppy flowers or unripe pods to help with insomnia
Does [this] beautiful glorious thing answer the question
These poppies are most probably *Papaver rhoeas*, the field poppy (could also be some other *Papaver* - not so familiar with flora of Spain, field poppy does grow there and it's probably that)
Poppy that is used for food (and opiate production) is *Papaver somniferum*, the opium poppy
That certainly isn't it
(Also if you come to Central/Eastern Europe, do try some poppy pastries
They're just yummy

Please tell me "bejgli" is the Polonized version of bagels
I feel like I need to give the recipe for this makowki thing to my pastry dealer
Oooh thank you
I hope to try it next weekend =D
If I look widely at the history of Slovenia, history of Slovenian poople, and history of the territories that Slovenians inhabit today in the wide sense
there are two such things
It would be really interesting to know what would happen to central european and balkan history if Ulrich the II of Celje would not get assasinated in Belgrade in 1456
If the house of Celje survived, it would probably lead to some of them getting the title of kings of some kingdom, at a certain point
Ulrich was already regent of Hungary at that time, had control over many lands in modern day Slovenia, some parts of Austria and especially in the Balkans
It is possible that the house of Celje could have stood at the front of the fight against the Ottomans and thus gaining advantage out of it like the Habsburgs did
Maybe a separate kingdom that could have included modern day Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia could have formed, thus completely diverting the way these areas developed from the 18th century onwards (under Habsburg supremacy)
But this is total speculation
Even if he survived, probably some of his followers would have succumbed to the Otomans or the Habsburgs anyway
It would be really interesting to see if in the 80's Milosevic would be ousted by some more progresssive part of the Serbian communist party and if an agreement about confederation would have prevented the breakup of Yugoslavia, leading to democratic and market reforms and Yugoslavia joining the EU in 2004
I just wonder how would this country look like today and which role it would have within the EU and more widely in the world
I would make it that Ivan Kramberger wasn't assasinated
He was running for parliament and I think he could have been a really good pm and he might have actually won
I don't think that the Samurai play the same cultural role in Japan as the figure of the cowboy or the concept of the Wild West play it for the US
And I don't think we have anything similar in Europe
The United States built their national identity upon the concept of colonization of "untamed land", of expansion into the wild nature and its subjugation to the will of men
The figure of the cowboy is at the forefront of this process, its main ambassador
Europe has been inhabited continuously since ancient times, at least since the Roman Empire has been filled with with a pretty complex entrenchment of civilizations and cultures
Here we are all aware of the continuity and slow evolution of human habitation and culture and there is no cultural concept of "wild natural area" that a society can colonize
Of course we have narrations about men who strive to survive in the nature or independent of civilization in various areas, or men that behave traveling warriors etc
But none of them has the same cultural role as the cowboy figure has for the US
> Some are strangers that come and go
Others are established lawmen seeking to tame a chaotic land
They survive on their wits, skill with guns, and the friends they meet on their journey through the vast expanse **now** known as the ~~Wild West~~ **United states**.
That's easy
We call them Americans
*sighs and flips open Krško self-destruct switch cover*
It's the Slav way
Also imagine if there were rewards paid out for reporting legal loopholes, financed by fines paid by those who failed at it and with the provision that loopholes get automatically plugged by an independent commission

Same here, they don't even want to take out things they were supposed to learn in schools right now
Their excuse: exams have already been printed out
High school 4th graders are going back to schools after 1st May holidays, which are next week
We don't have a national liquor
Maybe borovničevec, which is schnapps with bluebberies
Then there's viljamovka with Williams pear, tropinovec made with grape pomace, Brinjevec from juniper berries, Brkinski Slivovec (not Sliwovitz)
we're not really big on these things
Sadjevec
It's similar, but we use all the fruit mixed together (apples, pears and plums) not just plums
> bear’s blood
I have no idea what that is
edit: ok, I googled it
It schnapps with berries
Maybe it's local lingo, I don't think I have heard it here in my parts
I don't think English is hard language to learn, but it's not easy to really, really master it
There are a lot of rules in English that I still don't understrand, even after 10 years of speaking it
But it's definitely easier to learn than German language
I still can't hold a conversation in German, even though I am studying it for 5 years now
You do make a big deal of veterans
You even have a Ministry of War Veterans but I guess it's still not such a deal as it is in USA
Nicely sumed up
We're not big enough for our cities to have english names
But everyone does get very creative with their pronunciations of Ljubljana
Only one that I can think of that's still used (disregarding ethnically partially or formerly Slovene cities) is Vienna - Dunaj in Slovene
However, there's two more that I can think of, Munich and Cologne which in the past were called Monakovo and Kelmorajn, respectively
There's probably a lot more that I can't think of right now
Interesting, Slovene name for Venice is Benetke
There are also Kelmorajn for Köln, Draždani for Dresden, Lipsko for Leipzig and Kodanj for Copenhagen
Yes we have [Geopedia] It's way better than google maps or anything of that sort
The only gripe I have with them is, that they (just as our military/government mapmakers) transitioned from 1:250000 to 1:50000 scale, so it's not as detailed as it once was
But still if you plan to go hiking in Slovenia, I can't recommend it enough
Both
Cursive in the 3rd grade, the others in 1st and 2nd
I started school in 2002
Firat grade we learned printed then in second we learned cursive amd we had to use it throughout elementary/primary school
In highschool they didn't care as long as they could read what was written
I went to school in 2011 and we were taught cursive, I actually prefer it to normal letters
First they teach you printed like (grade 1 and 2 for me) after that it’s cursive all the way
For most of primary school you’re required to write in cursive and even in secondary school most people are used to writting in cursive so the majority still use it then and even later on in life
both actually
In 2nd grade we learn printed-like and then in 3rd grade we learn cursive but most people i know use printed because its easier
How much are we talking here
Learned a costly lesson in Bratislava
A local showed us 2 euro beers during a happy hour (Serbia vs France at basketball)
Combine that with the French starting to sing the anthem out of nothing, it was a glorious night
In Portugal is the tradition of Christmas Eve
I mean I'm sure 80+% of our population ate it at some point in their life
Squid is a lot more popular here but octopus is not unknown, especially in a salad form
I find it normal
They are quite easy to catch when dive fishing (or whatever the word it, snorkeling with a harpoon gun to shoot fish with), which is a favourite seaside pastime for a number of people I know, so I remember getting nearly sick of them every summer
I still quite like to have it about 5 or 6 times a year, but not more often than that
Slowly roasted with potatoes and onions is probably my favourite
Society be individualistic as fuck
Also I'd have to make roughly 10x more there to be able to afford the same level of security and comfort in life as here
Oh and forgetting all the social welfare and helthcare issues: Americans are literally full fash now, locking people up in concentration camps
And the 'normal, decent' majority just goes along with it
The bigger net salary is bull ... u still use the money on healthcare and education and pension, but the service is much worse
While I wouldn’t move to the gulf states, when I finish my engineering degree, I would sure as hell love to work there
Then I’d move to serbia and be rich

Saldy in US 'liberal' means the opposite
Much is opposite in the usa
Like dying in the street because no cash for hospital is liberty and freedom
Us media and politician usually use 'liberal' as in for gay rights, not being religious, pro abortion etc
So conservative media paints everyone not a conservative religious asshole as 'liberal'. Even though republicans are also liberals in the normal meaning of the word

Hungary -> Madžarska (I don't know the translation, but it's most likely something historical)
Netherlands -> Nizozemska (the low land)
Croatia -> Hrvaška (again, don't know the translation, but it most likely has something to do with history)
Finland -> Finska (the land of wealthy or "fine" people)
Denmark -> Danska (the land of day)
There's probably more, but these just came from the top of my head
is Kıbrıs island of Cyprus
How do you call northeren part
Or just Engleska
Czech is funny for all Slavs :P That was Slovenian though
which word
No worries, honest mistake
At least you didn't mistake us for Slovakia
Actually, there's lots of schwas that aren't written (anymore)
The word "čmrlj" (bumblebee) in Slovenian usually trips up foreigners, because it seems to have no vowels, but in reality it's pronounced as čmǝrǝl (colloquially sometimes čmǝru), and 2-consonant-clusters aren't anything special for Italian either (e.g. "st" in "stazione")
Krst pri Savici(Baptism at the Savica river) written by France Prešeren, is our national epic
It is set during the violent christanization of Slovenes in the 8th century and is depending on who you ask, very pro-religious or anti-religious
If I remember correctly, a national epic or something (not certain about the translation) is considered a genre and most nations have it
Ours is technically not an epic, it only has some properties or it
It's Krst pri Savici (Baptism at Savica fall) by France Prešeren and tells a pretty tragic story about Christianisation of Slovene area
Apart from the tragedy, it's actually a very easy read with great rhythm
I used to know the Introduction part of it by heart for years after we considered it in school
Hell I forgot about this religion sentiment, that is pretty genius that it can be interpreted either way
Also I believe it's Savica fall
The river isn't really mention worthy for that couple of kilometers it has, but the fall is pretty neat
We actually took lessons on development of English language on example of Beowulf
Worked on it like idiots for at least a week
I also learned that if there is a word for something in the landscape that I don't know, it is almost certainly another word for a bog
It was slightly traumatic
We have deer, rabbits, hedgehogs and whatnot small wild animals living in the forest that doubles as city's main park
It is rare to see them just wander around residential areas though
Hedgehogs will do that the most, some people have them in the gardens in a kind of a symbiosis
There was an uproar a couple of years ago when a juvenile bear got into the park though
They closed off all access points until they managed to put it to sleep and relocate it
My grandma lives in a heavily forested part of Slovenia, and multiple times while out tending to her fields she has seen a brown bear
One time he came out of the forest, within 15 meters of her and her dog
luckily her car was right there so she and the dog quickly got in
Myself I have seen and heard wild boars while out on runs or walks many times
I've been listening to hedgehogs infront of my apartment building in Celje for a few weeks now
They are soooo loud they wake me up because I have a window opened at night
Unfortunately there's also many dead ones on the streets
Yesterday morning I saw 4 when I went to work
Its just dumb
Some things should be kept within its normal time frame - regardles of how much somebody pays
The main problem for general audience is, that the world cup will interfere with the wintersports broadcasts - which are, at least in my country, very popular
So yeah, will be very bad
It's "funny" how they didn't even try to hide that Qatar WC was bought
Very small, desert country, monarchy, barely any big stadiums, no football tradition whatsoever, human rights violations
But they got €€€.
There’s a great video on YouTube about this:
“German nation”
Not a movement but a real thing
Slovenian words are replacing many foreign words
At first i thought it was a joke
But it is making slow progress because many teachers are replacing their foreign words with official Slovene words
Some words sound really stupid
CD - zgoscenka
PowerPoint slide - zdrsnica
TV or computer Screen - zaslon
Example is the word 'kavnik'. It is supposed to replace the word 'džezva', for the pot to make Turkish coffee in
What's so stupid about it
Kavnik would mean a pot to make coffee in
If it would refer to all pots to make coffee in (like a cafetiera for example), then it would be good
But a džezva is a very specific coffee pot, for making a very specific form of coffee
But they didnt care about this
Most of our gramarians are people who stayed with their heads in the 80's. They still think that Serbo-Croatian is the chief foreign influence on Slovene, while English gets more and more influential every single day for 50 years
For me it is use of: Costumer instead of Customer, college instead of colleague, paid instead of payed,
I ofter mix up the english "mine" and german "mein"/or "is" and "ist".
Yeah, maybe we should declare Lizzy the Queen of Europe so there will be less things to be confused about
I have the same "problem" when discousing on Askmen
They are also very afraid of being accused of rape and partying culture and dating culture
I think I seem much friendlier and more outgoing
I don’t really think that my personality changes as much as I just appear more that way
I think it’s just that when I speak Slovene I seem colder and show less emotion
Yes, my voice gets deeper, I become more self confident, also a tiny bit more hostile
I forsee the same status quo as now until a new economic crisis hits and finally shakes politicians minds enough to make reforms that are long  overdue
If the EU federalizes, there literally won't be any "much bigger entities". There'll only be 2 equals - China and US
Slovenia has more dialects (which are the primary use of communication locally) than EU has languages, and some of the dialects are further apart than some EU languages
But everyone just uses formal Slovene to talk to each other and it works fine
Unless we're gonna make the case that Germany can't possibly succeed because someone speaking Bayerisch can't possibly be in the same federation with someone from the north, this argument should be laid to rest once and for all
They should be given a fair referendum in the relevant region though
Self-determination should always be respected
Well, no overlord ever willingly grants the right to self-determination, unless they're certain of the "right" result
I just think refusing to grant a referendum to the relevant region shows that the government is afraid of the result, which probably means that the ref-proponents are on to something
which is perfectly fine, if incredibly stupid
the UK, yes
CH and Norway aren't. I don't know enough about the exact deal Greenland has
If I remember anything from my childhood literature is that -ix means they are from modern day France ;)
Well -nig(g) is the germanized version and so not common in Slovenia, but the original \`ik\` very much still is
I know a Blatnik, Hribernik, Potočnik and a Veršnik personally (more than one of each actually), the rest are probably more common in some other region but they "sound" correct :)
Many of the Carinthian surnames you’ve mentioned are common in Slovenia but spelled differently
E.g.  Blatnig - Blatnik; Goritschnig - Goričnik, Koričnik; Hribernig - Hribernik; Lutschounig - Lučovnik; Pototschnigg - Potočnik (very common)
I’m not sure about that, there are still many common surnames that are describing a place but could be
However, some of the ones you’ve mentioned are indeed not very common any more (e.g. Glančnik - Glantschnig, don’t think I’ve ever heard it)
Probably because in each slavic language there are different surnames

[Narodnozabavni rock]
[Vrag naj vzame]
[Mr
Nobody]
[Stay forever]
[Nanana]
These were terrible
A song called "Narodno-zabavni rock" in 2010
Makes me cringe to this very day
Oh man, it would be easier to ask which song was actually good
Man I actually like the real Slovenian version of Nanana
it's an upbeat pop song
It doesn't have the usual eurovision syndrome out songs have where they make everything overly heavy and dramatic
Though I prefer if they didn't translate it
Tbh, most of the songs we send are trash
That song was good
First time hearing this so no and I haven't seen anyone wearing it ever
I don't think our soldiers fought on the western front
We were part of Austria-Hungary and mostly just fought the Italians
There's very little remembrance of WW1 here
Probably because we technically lost
In Slovenian it sounds fine (Češka), but Czechia in English sounds atrocious
At first it seemed slightly off, but I find it normal now
Especialy cuz we already use short "Češka" in Slovene
To me it's kinda funny, because in slovenian it's called Češka and everybody calls it that
Yep
I have never used the shortened English version and I never will
I just write Czech R. Shortened version makes me shiver
Same here
I'd sooner accept Canadia for Canada than this unnatural "Czechia" concoction
Čehija^ohgod No
i think something like check-ia or check-ya
Is it only to Slovenians that it sounds terrible or what
Not many others seem to be bothered as much
Canadia sounds fine compared to ... I'm just gonna go and say it sounds disgusting
I never wanted to admit it because I felt so alone in this lol
Definitely this one  [
We only have one lol
I actually like the current one more
The simpler, the better
Actually, hasn't croatia considered anytime adopting just a red/white checkboard for its flag
I think it would be beautiful
In Slovene, *revnost* is scarcity or the state of being poor
I checked etymology and it doesn't seem to be related
Theres also favšija (informal version of zavist)
And nevoščljivost which means you feel the other person doesnt deserve what they have/wish they didnt have it
38 dialects in seven main groups, which is a lot for a country with 2M people and 20
000km2 of area
About the differences: Usually dialects depend on the neighboring countries
So some dialects have more Italian words, others have more German words
There are other differences as well
For example: Slovene language uses also the dual form (in addition to singular and plurar), but the Litoral dialects don't use it
Up to 52 dialects depending on who you ask, Kajkavian Croat being a dialect or Prekmurščina and Rezijanščina being separate languages entirely
We're one messy place
Yes, 78% of Slovenia is considered mountainous
Also, Slovenia is a Slavic country, that borders Italy (romanic language), Austria (germanic language) and Hungary (Ugrofinnic
laguage), which means many different influences
Yeah
Every village has its own dialect
No, that was Slovakia
Yeah, that didn't end well when the Czechs told us to pump up a pool float
This exactly
Speaking your dialect (almost language) in other areas is often times "unacceptable" so we tend to use a mix of standard slovene and dialects
In official manner, standard slovene is always a must
No dialects are allowed when conducting official business
I for one come from westernmost part of slovenia, do our dialect includes a lot of Italian, Friulian and German words
When we speak it no one can understand us outside of our municipal borders
When we leave our municipality we keep the dialect but combine it with standard slovene
Our dialect is different in cases, sounds, sentence formation and words
Examples :
Kje si
- > Kod si
- > where are you
Za hisami - > zad za his - > behind the houses
In - > an - > and
Zica - > cukzn - > wire
Drog - > kntlabr - > pole
Dvorisce - > brjac - > front yard
Czechoslovakia and Checnoslovenya, got it
In Slovenia that thing is pretty much easy to define:
Ljubljana = everything
Everywhere else = nothing
There are some big industries still in the smaller towns, such as Velenje, Novo Mesto, Kranj etc
but they do not operate as attractors of new population
It is almost incredible how centralized we have become after the completion of the highway system
Ljubljana is pretty much the only and undisputed economic, financial and cultural centre of Slovenia, where a lot of people go to live and which attracts daily commuters form most of the country
This is totally wrong
For example :
- Ljubljana is not the tourist centre; there are way more tourist sites outside of Ljubljana than in it
- Maribor is without a doubt the sports “capital of Slovenia”
- This could be somewhat offtopic but the worlds oldest grapewine (Stara Trta) is also in Maribor
- Your culture theory is also wrong
I think that  the fact that Maribor had the title of European Capital of Culture in 2012 speaks for itself
- The head office of the Slovenian Postal service is also in Maribor
- The biggest brewery in Slovenia and also the most popular beer brand (Laško) is brewed in Celje (and is also the better one)
- Anything that would be related to transport and transport industry is not in Ljubljana
The biggest centre for that in fact is Koper where our biggest and only commercial port is located
- As far as technology goes I would also give this title to Maribor
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FERI) recently developed and withe the help of ESA launched the first Slovenian satellite
This is a big technological advancement
The fact that  nor FRI nor IJS managed to do this speaks for itself
Just because Ljubljana is the capital does not mean that it automatically becomes the centre for everything
Sure there are things that can not compare to it but still you have to give credit to the rest of the country
Koper is definitely the center of logistics and transport
Novo Mesto probably holds the top spot for pharmaceuticals
Sea transport
Thats just because it has the sea
I'm sure if Ljubljana in Koper both had sea access there would be no competition
Btw, I'm from Koper and the port is not a big attractor of new population (at least not from Slovenia xD), It keeps beeing a stable employer though
Novo Mesto, yes, partly
But Ljubljana has Lek + chemistry and pharmacy faculties, which Novo Mesto doesn't have
It would rather be a carmaking centre (Revoz, Adria), but thats about it
Mate, it’s not just sea transport
the cargo that arrives to the port has to leave it somehow
There’s a small ocean of logistics and transport companies in Koper - TPG, Intereuropa, GMT, just to name a few
while I cannot think of any in Ljubljana
It’s true that Koper does not attract as much new population as Ljubljana, however, that does not change the fact that it remains the hub for logistics and transport
Yeah Koper has a port because it’s by the sea, and Ljubljana isn’t, I mean that’s just fact and you cannot change it, why would we talk about hypothetical situations
Ljubljana is what it is
Both, interchangeably or as a synonym to emphasize which vaccine you're talking about
Hmm
Seven, I think
Slovenian, Croatian, Serbian, Polish, Italian, Spanish and English
Edit: lmao forgot I can speak German
The anwser is eight
I've been to Singapore and the first 2 things I associate it with are:
-Your absolutely gorgeous architecture and incredible development that resembles what a modern city should look like
Definitely Dubai of SE Asia, hands down
-For some reason, the Petronas Towers from Kuala Lumpur (when I was 4 and 7, me and my family went to Kuala Lumpur from where we went to Singapore and from there to either Indonesia or China
I believed we were only in Singapore until later when I saw the date and place under the family photos on the travels) are something I always something I associate with Singapore
Sorry
The last battle of WWII in Europe was fought in Slovenia at Poljana na Koroškem, on the 15 May 1945, a whole week after the capitulation of Germany
Also, the Slovenian war of independence (also known as the Ten-Day War) was the first armed conflict in Europe after WWII
Thanks for correcting me, I didn't know that
This is what I remember from high school history, looks like we were taught wrong
Putting each other down
While I believe it is a generally popular sport in the Balkans and east of them, man we are great at belittling each other
Freediving since we currently have a world record holder in that
Competitive blaming of events in the 1940s and 1950s for the modern-day economical, social, and political situation
We have a joke that Hofer cashiers go to work at other shops for their holidays
Actually, I think it would be more fun to first watch them agree on the rules :D
Otherwise, I know a number of great fencers from Italy, and you have your own traditions
You could totally rule any discipline that doesn't contain too many Poles or Russians
No, I'm thinking HEMA
Most central and east Europe countries have strong clubs, but from what tournaments I've seen, Russians and Poles seem to do exceedingly well
Might also be skewed perspective, since I seem to have mostly seen the tournaments held in Czech republic and Poland
edit: spelling
> Slovenia much smaller
I feel attacked
It's getting bigger isn't it
No, I didn't know that was a thing
Now I would like to have them in Slovenia as well
It must be said, though, that excessive noise on our trains is only a problem during peak hours, other than that people usually keep to themselves
It would be quite hard to make quiet sections, since our trains sound like The Battle of Kursk
True that, I'm hopeful that the new trains will be better
I agree
They were not that bad
I actually expected they will be worse than they were actually
From 6 trains (4 were intercity, 2 were regional) that I took with CFR only two were delayed for 20 minutes
Others were on time
In Slovenia it's Ljubljana, in Belgium (second home) it's Leuven
Kinda so so
I think the height of it was a couple of years ago with a bunch of dank memes on instagram
The memes here on Reddit are usually literal translations of english memes and everyting sounds super cringy to me
I feel like the whole Slovenian sub is like a private party with people having inside jokes I don’t get
Obligatory "Trst je naš"(Trieste is ours) and "Hrvat je tat"(A Croat is a thief) memes
Usually used in an ironic way
Oooh and we also like salamanders
for some reason
We had some sex-ed in primary school somewhere at the age of 14, but before that it was mostly trough TV (no PG ratting at that time yet) but no parent talking
Nurses came to my school for sex ed in 6th and 8th grade
We are thought about it in schools but you just learn somehow
I actually technically learned about 'how children are made' quite early, from an illustrated encyclopedia which was the favourite book of my childhood
However, the concept of sex remained unknown to me until puberty
I remember those sex education hours
I was embarassed as fuck
No parent talking here either
Just joking or does this really happen
I wouldn't be surprised honestly
I like a lot of Slovene names for villages
Some are quite impressive, like Jeruzalem (there is some legend that the crusaders loved it so much they called it that when they passed the place, but I've no idea how true that might be) or Nebesa (Heaven)
I don't think any Slovene city has an official English translation, although Ljubljana almost deserves one
It seems to be impossible to pronounce for English speakers and I'd prefer they made up a name they could say
Actually Graz or Gradec as it’s known in Slovene means “small castle”.
Probably somewhere in the forest-covered south of the country
Which is also a much less popular wild zone then the Alps, which tend to have a bit too much of hikers and tourists sometimes
Every small village that isn't near a city
I guess Eastern Poland could use some investment
We have bohinj and bled in the north in the alps so that pretty much assures it not being in the middle of nowhere
I'd reckon the stuff between Idrija,Vrhnika and Škofja Loka
People live there
but there isn't anything major
Pretty much yes
Still if you find yourself on Kredarica you can't claim to be in e very popolous area
Yeah
But there you still have many small villages and highland farms
Around Kočevje you have just pure wilderness for kilometers in every direction
Only bears, no people
That's true
The population of the municipality I live in went from 4741 to 4977 in the past 18 years
And I would say that my municipality can be considered rural
> People usually move to “bigger” cities for their studies
And then they usually stay there
That's not true at all or there would be few people outside Lj and Mb
Mb population only grew for less than 500 in 10 years and Lj 14860
The "burial grounds" signs that you find near some forest roads in certain areas of the country, and they signify the burial grounds of mass killings
Mostly from WW1 and WW2 and it's aftermath
Not sure if it qualifies, but maybe the [dangerous road sign] Most of the time a variant of this sign with an exclamation mark appears
Only saw one example of this one with black crosses on route 409 near Planina
Not popular at all, it gained slightly more fame that one time we won a division or something
Our national team has some players that are from the UK, but are of Slovenian descent, so we are probably much better with them than we would be otherwise
Not popular, but present
I used to live next to club with playing field
We have 2 types of milk, sterilized under high temperature which is good for months and can be stored at room temperature or fresh which last 2-3 days and has to be stored in fridge or it will get soured
Eggs are always stored in fridge but they are sol in stores outside of them
I have a privilege of living in small town/village so I buy both of them from local farmer and store them in the fridge
The most common milk here is UHT pasteurised so as long as it's unopened it can stay at room temperature for months
After opening it goes in the fridge
Fresh milk is always in the fridge
Eggs are stored at room temp in the store
But I put them in the fridge when I get home
They last longer
We refrigirate our eggs and 1 milk at a time so that it is cold
Yea, same
Fresh milk goes bad one or two days after the date even in a fridge
And 4th day after opening is on a limit as well
In Slovenia it does happen
Especially if there is a bigger celebration and there were plates of food and not an individual portions
Then normally they pack you remains of these food plates
I mean if you already paid why would you not take it with you
Completely normal and happens on daily basis
They even ask you if you want to take it with you
QWERTZ with Š, Đ, Č, Ć and Ž on the sides
I remember i was thete 2 years ago
It is wonderful museum with alot of great things to see
I read about that and found it hilarious
I sure would have been one of the party goers
I'm actually surprised that we don't yet have gas stations in every shopping centre so that they could work
But it is true that it has not been even a year yet
I'm not sure what rules we got about gas stations, except that they work and are crazy busy on Sundays now that almost everything else is closed
Even a lot of small shops opted to close, I think there is about 1 on every road leading to the city centre in Ljubljana now
Complimenting is pretty broad and it's the same as in any language, but funnily enough, you would very rarely say "I love you" aka *Ljubim te* in Slovene
It just sounds weird in my opinion
What is used most often is "I like you" aka *Rada te imam*.
Destroying our economy for few years, getting our credit rating into low B, just in hopes to get Troika to force us to keep his party in power
It didn't help
But it did crashed our economy for years to come, and we're still trying to get out of that mess
Mostly by just selling everything to anyone, which meant we sold our biggest retail chain to Croatian company, that also imploded, and now one of the biggest employers and it's chain of linked professions, that by some accounts employs, or rather has people dependant on it (farmer with exclusive deals, various smaller industries, for whom this is their biggest trade partner) around 40% of all employed people is in a "limbo" between going under or being sold off to Russians, who might just sell it off to get back what the Croatian company owes them
Well all speak in certain dialect, some people from Ljubljana sometimes think that some of the dialects are too villagey
Indeed
Proper Slovenian (and it's bastardized form in Ljubljana) are just the Esperanto for people from all over this huge country to communicate, since without it, most people wouldn't be able to understand each other
Prekmurska gibanica from the northeastern Slovenia
It's even hard to find a good one elsewhere in Slovenia, much less abroad
[*Mavželj*] or [*Mežerli*] from Upper Carniola and Carinthia
It's ball shaped, made out of beef entrails and/or minced pork head meat and brain
It's an Alpine dish, called *saumaise* in Bavarian German
Some people in some regions also still eat [edible dormouse stew] which is a dish from Roman times
Wait, is polenta obscure
It's one of the most common baby foods all over Slovenia
Or it used to be when I was a kid anyway
> Bubble and squeak (England), rumbledethumps (Scotland), colcannon (Ireland)
Is it just me or do all three sound like they wouldn't be out of place going on an adventure together
Good to know palačinke are a thing of the whole ex austro-hungary
Change it to Slovakia and change Slovakia to Slovenia
Maybe then the US could get it right
"Horvejša" - interesantno
I like Valuk
He was a duke of Alpine Slavs
I think Lars would work
I know a Slovenian Lars
It works
Typical Slovenian surnames end with:
-ar
-er
-ič
-nik
-ec
You forgot -šek
also -cl and some -a.
or -ak
-ič is the most common ending of specific endings but it's not nearly as common in Slovenia as in other countries
-ič is not that common
The most common is probably -ar
Interesting, we use “Novakova” when your trying to say Novak’s daughter/wife/mom but not as a surname
There is also “Novakov” which means Novak’s son/brother/husband
Yes, but that is only Italianized version of Slovenian and Croatian surnames that end with ič in Slovenia or ić in Croatia
It's easier to learn than the other possibilities
I visited Slovakia last December and could get by with Slovenian only
It was a similar experience in Czechia
It takes some getting used to, but generally it works
At first I wanted to use English at the Slovak border, where I purchased the vignette, but the teller heard my brother talking in Slovene with my brother and he just spoke Slovak to me
From then I didn't even bother with English and stuck to Slovene
It works quite well, even after a couple of beers when I reverted to my dialect
But since Bratislava is on the Austrian border and I'm from Styria, where dialects generally use many German words (I sometimes joke it's like German Creole), it went just fine
Which brings me to another story where an Austrian understood (well, got the gist of the conversation) me and my friends talking in heavy dialect, meaning many German-derived words
Its nearly the same language lol
Cajt - Zeit - time
Cajger - Zeiger - clock hand
Bremza - Bremse - brake
Ek - Ecke - corner
Fertik - fertig - done
Ksiht - Gesicht - face
Flaša - Flasche - bottle
Lampa - Lampe - lamp
Mašina - Maschine - machine
Bek - weg - away
Ohcet - Hochzeit - wedding
Žleht - schlecht - bad
Hozntregerji - Hosenträger - suspenders
Župa - Suppe - soup (though this one may be french)
Žajfa - Seife - soap
Tepih - Teppich - rug
Bademajster - Bademeister - life guard
Talar - Teller - plate
Cimer - Zimmer - room
And many many more
We may also use serbus (servus) as a greeting, everything car/engine/tool related (kuplunga - Kupplung)
Some words are not even dialect specific and are understood across Slovenia (tepih, žajfa
Until, I think, the spring od nations in the 19th century, Slovenian was full of German and slovenianised German words
Influence of German can be seen in standard Slovenian even today
We say nasvidenje or izgled, which are direct translations from German (na-svidenje - auf-wiedersehen, iz-gled - aus-sehen)
Since when do you require to need to speak English in France to succeed
I have plenty of French friends who tell me nobody learns English in France just because it's unnecessary
I've even been to France myself a couple of times and nearly nobody spoke English
oooof hit a weak spot haven't I? How dare I compare the all mighty englishman to a filthy american
Slovenian and Croatian are both slavic but barely the same, some people have told me that our language sound arabic to them
Cohabitaton will do that, I guess
It goes both ways too, but to a lesser extent
Germans who lived in the slovenian part of Styria and Carinthia (I think also Germans from the southern part of austrian Carinthia) also use(d) some bastardized Slovenian words
Klutsch - ključ - Schlussel - key
Kua - krava - Kuh - cow
But these dialects are to my knowledge lost, since the Germans either don't use German any more or, more extensively, moved and were moved to Austria
Oh and I use the pre 1918 terminology here for clarity
Back then Austrian meant anyone who lived in the Austrian part of the country, including Slovenes
I mean im really not sure, but judging by my experience in three very big and influential non-English speaking European countries (Spain, France and Italy) and their lack of the English language I have series doubt that even at the professional level that a few are capable of speaking English
In comparison, in Slovenia a country with 2 million people, we are introduced with English and French/German as soon as we hit primary school
For us to succeed we must learn important languages
I guess the big countries have a form of autarky while the smaller ones just cannot have
you are right your majesty, we do understand Croatian and Serbian quite well, but they cannot understand us whatsoever
Just Hungary
With Austria and Italy we have generally friendly relations, deapite some issues here and there mostly regarding our minorities
We have a border dispute with Croatia, but that does not represent a threat
While on the other hand our current prime minister and the hungarian president are good friends, and Janša gets his media and his party financed from Hungary
He fancies Orban's model of illiberal democracy and wants to introduce it over here
Plus that, Hungary had a serious bet to invest in an important rail link between our only port and the hinterland which would give it de facto control over our port, which was luckily prevented, as we are capable to invest in it without foreign help
And of course Hungary is the one that most openly talks about its irredentism (wishes to annex parts of neigbor states that were once part of Hungary)
I don't know, maybe I'm overreacting but Orban scares me a bit
I feel you
Corona is not a threat, Janša is
The narrative in our country atm is that our PM (Janša)  is practically a Hungarian vassal, Orban's puddle
Most of the media here are left-leaning and current PM is on the right, so one should take these allegations with a grain of salt
I do not have information about any administration houses
Our media continuously reported (for a few years continuosly) that Hungary will directly invest in the new rail link between Koper and Divača (I think the contribution was intended to be around 300-400 million euro out of the total 1,2 billion cost), which is currently under construction
It was continously also reported that informal talks were put in place about how could we "return the favor" to Hungary
At the end it was revealed that Hungary had been promised a large plot of land near Luka Koper, which lay outside its concession area, but inside the area that is aimed for the port to enlarge in the future (designated by a national planning act for the port)
Thus the enlargment of the port could have been serioulsy hindered
There was initially also talk about a potential sell off of a shareholder slice in Luka Koper, but there was no talk about this later on
This, however, is anathema to us as a local community that depends on the port as the largest employer and actually a very profitable state owned company
About the irredentism; I am aware that this is just part of his nationalist discourse
But also the holocaust began just as a bunch of stupid prejudices, that someone started to exploit for political gain
And if you keep reading continuously news like this [one] you just start to worry
It might seem stupid, if you take just one piece of news in consideration, but if many come repeatedly, it's obviuously a pattern
Most of our media is liberally oriented, with Mladina being the only one really left-leaning
Since I still consider liberalism as a "normality" in a liberal democratic political system (that we supposedly still have), our media is just actually normal western media with many journalists doing a good or average job
Janša is trying to portray all media that arent't Nova24 (TV station owned by Janša's party), Reporter or Demokracija (right-leaning newspapers) as left-lening, which is just not true and which is part of his political discourse aimed at discredt anyone who tries to criticize him
When I read how Orban and Kaczinsky behave towards the media, their discourse sounds strikingly familiar
Yes, besides slovene I speak italian too
Italian is a co-official language in the area where I live, sice an italian minority lives here
They have also a parallel school system in italian language
I went to an italian-speaking kindergarten, then later i continued my education in slovene, which is my motherthongue
A lot of people here speak and comprehend italian, but not many actually speak it at home and in their everyday life
Oficially the minority counts about 1000 people in an area of 50
000 inhabitants
The poeple who are part of the minority mostly speak fluent slovene too
So there is a lot of us who are completely bilingual regardless of which is the motherthongue
But the people of the minority mostly tend to adapt to the majority, sadly
The heavieast blow to the italian speaking community however, was that most of the italian speaking population left our country after WW2
The number of those that remained has stayed somehow stable in the later decades
Too bad
I love the language
I really hope that Irish gets revived somehow in the future
It's beutiful really
There is a large number of them, in all generations
But I can't really tell if it's a majority or not, but if it's not, it' close to a majority
Most of my generation learned by watching the italian TV
Nowadays children mostly grow up with Cartoon Network (I channel I always deemd as stupid) and they speak better english than italian
In my generation it was the other way around
I actually grew up by watching italian synced anime, which made my childhood kind of multicultural, a weird slovene-italian-japanese blend

Post WWII kilings [example] probably NSFL
Officially it is not yet determined, but there are indices that put the blame to at least local authorities although direction was supposed to came directly from top leaders of Yugoslavia  [Dispatch from Kardelj]
Well not all of them, some were:
Homeguards - whose primary object was defending villages from "bandits who plundered and rape", Fore sure they did not fight Nazis who provided weapons for them but most were young boys brainwashed by catholic church and school
Chetniks (name originates from before WWII as member of the četa - regular army company unit of the kingdom)- They flighted firstly for the king against Nazis, after they saw what Nazis done to retaliate (like burning village, shooting villagers) they called ceasefire with them at least until partisans would be destroyed
Ustashe - Army of Independent state of Croatia, Nazi puppet state
A lot of them were Nazi supporters, but many were dragged in all of this
And then there were their wife and childrens who are also in those holes
I feel a bit familiar with Morocco, since I had a friend who has been there as a tourist, another one who has been a surf instructor there, and I met a couple of people from Casablanca/Rabat at an exchange
I also know a few people from Egypt, but I feel the country much less familliar, If I think beyond my childhood infatuation with ancient Egyptian monuments
Otherwise I feel the Maghreb countries very unfamilliar, especially Algeria,  which has a huge population and covers a large part of the area, but I have never met anyone from there or anyone who visited it
Čefur -  typically an immigrant from ex-Yugoslavia (most often Serbia & Bosnia) who likes to wear tracksuit, loves to drive with open window and blasts very loud turbo folk music
Girls have normally black hair, hair extensions and like to wear a lot of make up and trashy looking clothes
Čefur is a state of mind, not every immigrant from other ex-Yugoslavian Republics is a Čefur
Prekmurci - people from the region of Prekmurje, often stereotypized as uncivilized and uneducated
Čefurji - immigrants from ex-Yugoslavian countries
Tracksuit in the streets, sweatpants with tanktop, white socks & knock-off sandals (Adibas and the like) in the sheets
Limka/buraz - vapid, superficial girls & boys, usually highschoolers but sometimes young adults aswell
Dudes only care about getting high, buff & having sex
Girls only care about their appearance and being popular
The terms “Chad” & “Stacey” probably come closest to this
This term is specific to Ljubljana & the surrounding region AFAIK
Isn’t a klošar just a homeless person
Still love yugo rock even today
Some of the songs from 70s/80s still remain hugely popular today, and are heard in clubs regularly
Peronaly I can understand Slovak and south slavic just enough so I can travel but, can't hold any meanungfull conversation
But Polish, Bulgarian, Russian
Only every 10th or 15th word I can make out but it could have different meaning
Example otrok means child in Slovene and if I remember right in some slavic languages it means slave
I can pretty much understand any of the slavic balkan languages to some degree
Depends which one
Slavic is a big family and understanding Russian is a lot harder than Croatian
Slovenian here
Cro/Srb/Bos - 90%+ understandable
The rest of the Slavic languages range between maybe 15-25% understandable (Ukrainian, Polish, Bulgarian) to up to 50% understandable (Slovak, Czech, Macedonian, Russian)
But the single most epic thing are the two Slavic esperantos - Slovio and the more modern Interslavic (Medžuslavjanski)
Those two are probably >80% understandable without any prior exposure
Sending people in mass into mine and blow up the entrance
[Warning
not exactly good night and probably NSFW]
Throwing people in karst pits
Ah a fellow nation of culture I see
Actually it would be quite ridicolous for such a small country like us to divide even further
Prekmurje used to have its own language standard derived from their dialect, which is really specific and very different from standard slovene, but this hasn't evolved in a true national movement
In my region (Istria) we have jokes sometimes about putting a border on Črni Kal (a village at the Karst edge, the natural border that divides Istria from the rest of Slovenia), but those are just that, jokes
However, both regions are so small, that they would be probably considered microstates and their independence wouldn't really make sense
We're very far away from a true separatist political movement
How are the thinks in Tetovo, looking trough census in 2002 Macedonians were already minority there
I guess this gap has increased
Eggs and testicles are both jajca
Bratranec (male) and sestrična (woman) are both cousin in English
Same in Slovene, both are “zmaj”
Another fun one: *Danka* is both a rectum and a danish woman
Both
If I’d speak with Slovenians or Austrians, I would tell them that I’m from Lower Styria but if I‘d speak to other people, I would say that I’m Slovenian
I'd say that I identify myself as a Slovene first, a Styrian second, a resident of Slovenia third (since my parents are all Slovene but come from Trieste and Klagenfurt)
I don't remember writing this comment
RIP Donald Duck magazines
They stopped being released here is Slovenia a while ago
They were the best shit
[Rakov Škocjan] is one that springs to mind, but generally anywhere where there is karstic topography, the environment is quite interesting
Ritoznoj (ass sweat) I think is the funniest, and their wine is called Ritoznojcan
Bruhanja vas (puking village)
Lepa njiva (pretty field) or Dolge njive (long fields)
Suhi dol (dry valley)
Mokronog (wet feet)
There's a lot of funny village names here but most of them are pretty innocent
There is a town in Croatia called Pofuki
Roughly translates to fuck it
Črnci - meaning black people (yes plural)
Črnci
Directly translates to "blacks". All fine and dandy until you reach the end of the town
I gotta visit
I was looking for the correct translation for that but yours is perfect
Purely human error
The worst is probably [Britannia Airways Flight 105] September 1, 1966
Controlled flight into terrain due to the pilots forgetting to set the altimeter to the right setting, 98 fatalities
The deadliest I can think of since we are an independent country is the [canoe accident near Blanca] July 3, 2008
A group of people including the local mayor decided to traverse the Sava river before the completion of a hydroelectric dam that would permanently prevent such an activity
In the meantime, water had already been redirected from the riverbed over the spillway
The plan was to avoid the unfinished dam by exiting the boats upstream, carrying them along the bank and continuing downstream
However, two boats decided to continue through the spillway despite warnings and the fact that the construction site was off limits for unauthorized personnel
They broke up upon crossing
13 people drowned with only one survivor who was lucky enough to be washed clear of the torrent
Now that's some serious shock and awe
Well, he certainly had it scratched anyway
Props to your dad and I'm happy the bouncer wasn't a total dickhead
If you challenged one in my country you'd probably get laughed off or thrown out
Meh, just a dent
A bus and a fucking *ambulance driver* out of all people
Quick question - what is it with Polish truck drivers
Why do the repeatedly try to drive me into the divider when I attempt to overtake them
Do they do that to Poles as well or is it just in foreign countries
I most often get asked this by Americans who are visiting Croatia/Slovenia
I usually answer that I'm from here
The next question is almost always "And when did you move here
". I empasize that I'm *from here* and they always look shocked cuz I sound (and honestly look) super American
It's either that or they ask if my dad works for the military/the embassy
I personally find it funny
It has only snowed once in December where I live
Entire January without snow
It's the coldest winter in a while and temperature only goes above 0 for about 2 hours a day but there just hasn't been any snowfall
Over the past few years where I live there’s been a snow early in winter (dec, jan) and then one in march and almost nothing inbetween
Still exists here, but I'm not sure how popular it is
Exactly
What about [Juwelo TV]
One of only three battleship sinkings caught on film
Random teacher, primary school: "An aqueduct was a Roman viaduct that spanned a river
History teacher, primary school: "Americans did nothing in WW2
History teacher, ~~grammar school~~ gymnasium: "Upon taking the German throne after reunification, the Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm IV changed his title to Wilhelm I". They were two separate fucking people, dimwit
I didn't correct them because by that time I'd grown tired of the inaccuracies and just facepalmed internally
The second one still rustles my jimmies when I remember it and I wish I'd said something
To me this is pissing on the graves of those young men
Edit: Changed "grammar school" to "gymnasium" because apparently the term is valid
Also keeping "grammar school" for Grammar Nazi jokes
Heil spellcheck
What, because of Quisling
She didn't know Norway had to be taken by force
That was a sweet move
I'm happy he replied
I don't know what it is with history teachers
A third of all replies in this thread are about them
What is the battlefield like
Are there any museums or guided tours
Well, islam still is a dangerous religion
Let's nit pretend it isn't.
Type of high school
"Gimnazija" in Slovenian in case that helps you
She was wrong
What if an aqueduct crosses a dry ravine
Is it no longer an aqueduct
It was clear from the context that she did not know its purpose
Nah, she was shit regarding history in general
Never mind the bombs, there are almost 4 years of brutal fighting in the Pacific and 2
5 years in North Africa and Europe that she brushed aside
Not to mention the US taking on the role of the so-called arsenal of democracy
Both viewpoints are wrong
Neither the Western Allies not the USSR were not sole victors of WW2
Whoever claims otherwise has an agenda or is ignorant
>But to be fair, the Americans did nothing for you in particular
The claim was "did nothing". Not "nothing for you", "nothing".
>One could even say they betrayed you (giving Stalin reign over you)
One could say that but they would also be wrong for several reasons
First, Yugoslavia wasn't alligned with Stalin
Second, it is silly to think that one of the main victors of WW2 would be denied a sphere of influence
Third, the Western Allies didn't owe us anything
They already came to help against Nazis and to insinuate that even that wasn't enough is outrageous to me
Fourth, another war with the USSR right after the cessation of the greatest global conflict is hardly a good outcome
Fifth, what kind of mental gymnastics must one perform to blame Americans for us having to endure communism
Blame the communists
The ones we had weren't "imported" from the East, they were our own
You are not retarded
Oh yes, arguments from authority are always the best
Can't fight that, right
\*Nazis
Oh, shit
Thechnicaly correct, but it just so happens that in Islam that happens far more often than with any more religion
*Far* more
We learned the term in English classes
It is possible we just took the nearest equivalent we could find in the British educational system and used the name for our school
I'm not familiar with their system enough to give an opinion on whether it is appropriate or not
Anyway, it is a high school you go to after primary school at 14-18 years of age and gives its students a general education
Edit: Well fuck me, apparently we *can* use the word "[gymnasium] for it even though our English teacher said it was incorrect
How appropriate for this thread
Oh I know, I just added to your point
I apologise for my harsh response
From the way you wrote I assumed you held those views and got a bit triggered
I love your username
The number really nails it
I understand
Would "grammar school" be an appropriate term
Funnily enough I was going to write "aquaduct" at first but checked the spelling because I wasn't sure
It seemed more natural because "water" is "aqua" in Italian and the spelling is "akvadukt" in Slovenia
That's good enough
Thank you for the explanation
As for Americans, a user replied that in the USA grammar schools are elementary schools
The confusion is complete
Not really at least in my part of the country
Maybe its different in the eastern part
Oh wait, it’s “Sveti trije kralji” day
Maybe some minorities in Prekmurje but I don’t think anyone else celebrates it
National Anthem itself, it was written by our greatest poet France Preseren
"Ne vrag, le sosed bo mejak
" (not devil but friend will be neighbour)
From anthem Zdravljica (the Toast) - France Prešern
Probably you are right, yes
Although my first idea was the first verse of Povodni mož:
*Od nekdaj lepe so Ljubljanke slovele*
*al lepše od Urške bilo ni nobene*
I found the translation for Povodni mož [here] and for Zdravljica [here] Scroll down in both cases
Just came here to say this
It's probably just me, but in my circles people always preferred the Baptism at Savica (also by Prešeren):
"Manj strašna noč je v črne zemlje krili, kot so pod svetlim soncem sužni dnovi" - "Less terrifying is the night under Earth's dark wing than days lived under the bright sun as a slave" (my translation, predictably terrible, but I couldn't find one online)
..goes better with our history, like white wine goes better than red with fish :P Also less idealistic, but useful in way more contexts than the anthem :)
&#x200B;
EDIT: ah, found a more "official" translation [here] "Less fearful the long night of life’s denial Than living ‘neath the sun in subjugation
" It's a Wikipedia article about Ivan Hribar
As a respected person and ex mayor of Ljubljana (our capital), he was asked by fascist invaders during WWII to become mayor again and help them pacify the rebellious population
Already 90 years old at the time, he instead commited a public suicide and left that verse in his farewell letter
Apparently, like me, he also found it more practical :(
There is an urban myth that this verse in translation was graffitied onto the building of my high school for some years before I attended
This
In Slovenia we have at least one piece of news a year describing a group of tourists (mostly Czech) hiking in sandals or a similar bizzare thing
Are you Felix (PewDiePie) and Marzia
To be frank, when I went to Transilvania there were many hungarian signs, for a moment I thought we did a wrong turn and went east instead of west from Oltenia
We need them gone
I feel more unsafe with them on our continent than without
I've just looked at the map of lactose intolerant people and it seem like white population has least trouble with that, anybody knows why is that
Maybe because of the recent conflicts, but I find especially interesting the countries on the eastwards borders of Europe
So namely, the Middle East, Turkey, the Caucasus, Ukraine and Belarus
I also have a friend of Ukrainian and Georgian origins and she makes me think about these places a lot
Some historical very strong empires and kingdoms were located there, of which we learned quite few things at school, even if they had quite an influence on us
for example the Byzantine and the Otoman empires
And, of course I find also the Balkans very interesting, being the part of Europe that was an intermediate between the Middle east and continental Europe
Does it exist online
Do you have the link
Either in 8th century to [Carantania] because it would be interesting to see how our ancestors lived
It would also be interesting to see a Ducal integration on a [prince’s stone ]
The second option would be to 14th century in the time of [counts of Celje ] I could warn Urlik II
from his assassination in Belgrade or convince him to let his son Friderik mary Veronika and with that continue on with the blood line
Who knows maybe Slovenia would be as big as Austrian empire at that time if they succeeded
Sometime before mass population and pollution, to enjoy our natural gems to the fullest and in peace
Probably the week around July 19, 1906, when the railway through my region was opened to public
If not possible that precise, then any week between 1850 and 1914, as I think late 19th/ early 20th century (before 1914) was a nice period in history
Our country was a part of Austria-Hungary then and I believe that Austrian rule was better than what we have now
>Our country was a part of Austria-Hungary then and I believe that Austrian rule was better than what we have now
Can I ask you why you think that
Not trying to be mean or anything just curious
I know Russuan, UK, German, Italian, Slovak, Polish, Croatian, French, Spanish and Slovenian
And well our European
I only know the italian one (not the words though) and spanish one because of Moto GP
The italian one is easy to recognise because it just sounds so italian
If the communists were half as good at economy as they were at composing, we'd be begging for the EUSSR
Wait, does that mean that communism is just a Big Music conspiracy
Why that's simple: a big house, multiple cars, a goddamn yacht, the usual FLEX
Slovenia is culturally divided into 6 regions: Prekmurska, Stajerska, Primorska, Gorenjska, Notranjska and Koroska
And let me say, not only does each of these regions have their set of slang, Primorska is notorious for an accent that is pretty much impossible to understand to outsiders
So yeah
Absolutely
Most spoken languages that are even considered dialects are ok-ish, I usually need explanation for some words, but nothing too bad
However some are just too close to neighbouring languages for me to process, or the pronounciation too far off the one I'm used to
Dialects from vicinity of Idrija come to mind
Also fun fact: I work 20km out of the capital city and the local spoken language is already considered part of a different dialect group
I understand them, but there really is an obvious difference
I find it sort of amazing and sort of scary that a language with 2mio speakers can have such variety
Hah, I've seen this, I think they actually show this video at some point in university here, or maybe it is just really popular with English students
We have 7 big dialect groups, all with distinct accents, that can differ not only between dialect groups but sometimes also between neighbouring towns
Not only that, if you go few km outside of town, you can already hear the difference between accents, to a point you can almost pinpoint a village
I won't even start talking about differences between Primorska and Koroška or Prekmurska
Did you mean prekmurska, not primorska
>  Prekmurska, Stajerska, Primorska, Gorenjska, Notranjska and Koroska
RIP Dolenjska
Oh that explains a lot lol
Can you tell me Ljubljana, Maribor and Koper's region
Yeah, sorry
Ahh Dolenjska, never even knew thee
Ljubljana is Osrednjeslovenska, or Central region (historicaly part of Dolenjska, Lower Carniola), Maribor is Štajerska or  Styria, and Koper is Primorska or  Littoral
Ljubljana is a lot more gorenjska than dolenjska
Historically everything south of Lj grad was said to be dolenjska (Vič, Rudnik), the rest was gorenjska (Šiška, Bežigrad, Jarše, even Polje)
I noticed some accent differences between people from koper/litoral and Ljubljana/Maribor
The difference wasn't that notable between the two major cities
You can actually tell from the accent in English from where in Slovenia someone is
Parts of Carinthia and Prekmurje have very typical pronounciation that is hard to shake off, and for some of them English is second foreign language (German being first)
Oh there is a very big difference between the Ljubljana and Maribor accents and especially their dialects
>and for some of them English is second foreign language (German being first)
If you meant Carinthian Slovenes by any chance, German isn't their first foreign language, but their second language
I noticed that some people in s-love-nia sound like they are native English speakers but their slovenian accent is perfect
It's amazing the combo
Usually people that speak slovenian as their first get the accent when speaking english but this people I've met they don't. I'm not sure where they are from
I think it depends on the school
It is not general, certainly
Oh, I thought you meant Slovenes in Austria
>I think it depends on the school
It is not general, certainly
I think about 3% of Schools in Slovenia choose German over English for the first foreign language these days
German being mostly in the northern parts, as you said earlier
It varies from year to year
Last two winters were quite mild, but during one before that we had serious snow and cold for the whole February
What I noticed is that we commonly get a flash of cold and sometimes snow already in the autumn, but then December is somewhat lukewarm
Depends on the region of course and altitude, but in general winters are very mild last 10 years or so
Snow lasts for days now, not weeks or months
As a kid, I remember jumping from balcony into snow; I wouldn't recommend doing that now :)
There are predictions that a lot of ski centers will have to close in a few decades if thing continue this way
Same as with other religions, as long as you are not forcing your belief to other you are fine
Quite normal, at least I have not been in any weird position because of admitting it
Actually I have the feeling that if someone young admits that is religious, he gets weird reactions
But then again, I'm a young adult with an urban lifestyle, there are parts of the country (especially rural ones) that take religion much more seriously
Still, in general, being atheist is ok, nobody feels ashamed of it over here
He goes around doing regular people's work like picking up trash and working on fields instead of doing his actual job as a president
But we still love him, its just jokes
Our prime minister used to be a popular comedian
That's funny enough on itself, no need for jokes
in Sloveve, I say Budimpešta (š being sh in English, you could say), as that is the Slovene name for Budapest
but in English, I say it with an s, could be wrong doe ( [buːdəpɛst/] is the pronunciation according to Wikipedia)
Basically this:
Albanian, Welsh and Basque for me
If it's instant I'll go for the ones where I have no other connections to
German, because why not
Then Mandarin (which would also give me rough knowledge for reading other languages which use the same characters),
And then probably Dutch, for no other reason, then I like it
Mandarin
Turkish
Russian
All the other European languages are quite manageable
From similar pathways you have
Portuguese
Spanish
French
Italian
Greek
Then you have like slovenian, and most of southeast countries come from similar grounds (Russian)
Then you have Mandarin which is probably the most amazing language out there, with simplified/traditional chinese having years of culture and huge number of dialects within Mainland China and it's Independent regions
Also it has come to my attention that Mandarin speakers who also speak English have an easier time learning Germanic languages
Turkish because I kinda like their overall culture and their food is extremely good
German- because I already know some basics French- it might be useful
Dutch- just cuz it’s kinda cool
We are a bit of an odd one out here
The regime in Yugoslavia wasn't nearly as oppressive as the regime in USSR and satellite states
As a consequence we kinda just left a lot of the monuments in place and I don't really think we renamed that many streets or other named public things
That being said, the theme of most monuments is fight against fascism and remembrance of fallen partisans, with a few statues to politicians and Tito
I don't recall us having random busts of Marx and Lenin all over the place
We never really distanced ourselves from the previous country and we never got over it and most (if not all) of our political debates devolve into Partisans v Slovene Home Guard (left vs right, but like we're perpetually stuck in 1945)
I was thought that North and South America are separate continents
There that there are also Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania and Antarctica
Slovenia, 15-20 years ago: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, North America, Central America (mentioned as kind-of-but-not-really a continent), South America, Antarctic
It's pretty decent in Ljubljana
We were lucky that our designers took inspiration from Copenhagen during the urban expansions in the '60s, so all the major intersections and underpasses got cycling lanes very early on
Most of the city center is now closed for motor traffic so cycling is often the best method of getting to/from the center
The cycling network is big enough and the city small enough that you can comfortably get pretty much anywhere with a bicycle
However, the quality varies a lot and some sections were clearly designed by people who've never ridden a bike
This things, at least in my area, are usually held at farm tourism places (kmečki turizem) or a 'gostilna' (a family owned type of restaurant)
You sit down at the tables, you talk to people, they bring out beef and mushroom soup
Then they bring out plates with food and salad bowls
Then comes the band, usually 2 or 3 people that plays oberkrainer/pop folk music and one of the guys tries to be funny
A few people dance, most sit around and talk
Then they bring out a cake some time later
And then sometimes there's some terrible games and even more terrible skits and some more music and few people dancing and the rest sitting around and talking
edit: I forgot to mention, before the official party, family and friends come to the persons house on the day of his birthday and put up a may pole or a giant flower with a sign saying how old the person is
And often times they put a weird human sized doll next to it
If the person is 50 years old, the may pole has to be up for 50 days
The putting up celebration is organised by family and friends and removing celebration by whoever it was put up for
edit2: This is for major (round) birthdays or round wedding anniversaries, nor normal 'family gatherings', obviously
A normal family gathering is just close family members for something like Christmas or easter, gathered around the kitchen table, that's all
I have a smallish family cell - there's 8 of us, all on maternal side, plus my husband
We meet for holidays and birthdays, we usually share food preparation duties, have a dinner, and happily yell over each other
You can tell we are related by strength of our voices, and I married a fitting guy for us
The only outlier is the grandmother, and my mom has to shush us all to let her speak
Most of us keep cats, so we talk about cats
We get an instant unbelievably loud argument if anyone mentions daily politics, so we steer clear of that
Yup
Every round birthday ever

Ivana Kobilica - though I must admit, I knew of her mainly because her portrait was featured on the 5000 Tolar banknote, our currency prior Euro, otherwise she'd be more or less just another name on a long list of historical figures we needed to learn for school
Nowadays I wonder if youth still knows of her
I just realized how much not having your own currency affects the cultural, national individuality
But what about the Spanish inquisition

If i want to learn something, I learn and understand things better in english then in my own language
Also i can read it faster and easier
soo i enjoy it
I'm more afraid of of weird and ineffective "corona rules" that are taking place since new laws are made overnight and are getting weirder and weirder
I have an hour long commute to school every day and I take a train
In response to corona they closed 1/2 of seats so people just stood shoulder to shoulder next to the doors, they basically made already full trains even worse
Depends on how things go with the second wave, but we had 2 months of school via internet before summer vacation so odds are, if isolation will continue into September, it'll be like that
If we do have to go to school right away, I'd put a high chance of other precautions being taken (similar to precautions we had right before schools closed down: hand washing, disinfection & masks)
I'd understand if they limited the overall capacity a train can have but just saying 'lol don't sit together' is kinda ridiculous
Well Transylvania with the castles and forests is seen as a nice travel destination
The first thing that comes to my mind about romanians tho are truck drivers, people stealing gas at the station and their orphans from the 90’s. Not the best image bit, I know they are making progress and I’m happy for them because it’s a fascinating country
The average Slovene probably knows Dracula, wonders why there are so many vans with Romanian license plates crossing Slovenia all the time, and I'm pretty sure it stops there
Personally, I loved visiting Cluj Napoca - friendly people, good food, pretty girls
And just photos of the country made me start planning a road trip around the country in late spring
I love your language
I speak Italian and started to learn Romanian as well, it fascinates me how these two languages are similar and totally different at the same time (at least to me :))
What Romance influence
If any, Slovene was mostly influenced by German, however, many germanisms have been removed from the standard language due to the efforts of several linguists in the 19th century with the aim of “purifying” the language
Also I have never heard about any Hungarian influences on the Slovene language
That's right, there are no such influences in our official language as far as I know
On the other hand, Slovene language has around 50 dialects, many are influenced by German, Italian or Hungarian - maybe that's what they had in mind
Although the dialects are so different, sometimes I wonder if it even is the same language because I barely understand people from another part of the country :'D
[The castle] is the main one
[Roman road] and other Roman remains would be next
We also have a frescoe on the scale of the one in Pompeii but I don't think it's available to the public eye yet, it has been discovered quite recently
In my city theres an iron mine thats now closed but they say its been used since roman times
Kladivo in Slovene
Doesn’t sound very bad-ass to me lol
We also say kladivo and nakovalo for anvil
Well, *macola* is also a hammer
Hehe “palice” means sticks in Slovene
That’s interesting, in (Istrian) dialect we call hammer “bt” and my grandpa always called the sledgehammer “macola” - however for the latter it might not be a dialect word but rather a word  that he started to use when he was serving in the Yugoslav Army in Beograd
I earn around 1450 EUR/month after tax
I live in second biggest city
I live alone (since I was 25)  with two cats, support myself financaly and I'm paying off a loan for the apartment
Loan per month is similar for whar I would pay for a rent
I save around 400 EUR per month and we also get Christmas benefits and "regres"- money paid by your employer so you can go to vacation, amount differs where you work (this year I got 1000 EUR)
I save around 5000 to 6000 EUR/year
Savings depends on person's lifestyle
Some could save a lot, but they spend everything
If i remember correctly, I was saving about 200€ a month
I was sharing a small flat with my boyfriend, we both had regular (but entry-level) jobs, and our combined income was about 1800-1900 €.
You are an exception and you have very high earning, esoecially for your age
Most live paycheck to paycheck
Agreed my dad which is going to be 47 this year with 25+ years of experience on the job(civil engineering) and has been working at the same company for the past 17 years and makes a tiny bit more than him, he is a big exception imo
Most of my friends have similar paychecks and their boyfriends too (some even play football in Austria after work and that means around 1000 EUR extra money a month)
But I am well aware of low paycheck problem in Slovenia and how hard it is to get a job
I don't spend a lot of money on food or expensive items (no iPhone for me)
Cost of living depends where you live
In Ljubljana paychecks are higher, but everything is a lot more expensive there (rents are crazy)
Average paycheck is around 1100 - 1200 EUR
Cost of living (small 2 rooms apartment 50m2, not in a capital): summer 180 eur, winter 240 eur (cost of internet and cable tv included)
Meal in a restaurant per person is around 10 EUR
Rent for 50-60m2 apartment would be around 400 EUR, maybe a little bit more
And he says he does admin work
I'm slightly suspisious or he's extremely lucky
Well you are in very good company then
because I'm 30 and only developers have similar paychecks from the people I know
And I know quite a lof of people
Well he could be including lunch and transportation in that
If he lives in Maribor and works in Ljubljana he'll get like 300€ for transportation alone
Yeah this is after taxes(which are bigger than USA's) so before it would be like 2200-2400 I think
There are smaller leagues and clubs
They play for them
Extra money
In Slovenia most clubs don't make a lot of money (even in the 1st league), so sometimes it is better to have a job in Slovenia and play for some club in 3rd league in Austria, if you like football
Oh no I gotta wait a week for the winter holiday
Slovenia is literally too small so nothing significant would happen
plus people mostly live in the center of the country, around the capital
Nothing, really
Benefits of a small country, like ours, you can walk from south to north in a week or less
We get both, very cold and dry and not so cold but humid
Very cold and dry is way better
Who is dumb enough to think Italy is a third world country
No we don't have anything like that
I have always tried to figure out why americans do that
Maybe english spelling is less intuitive than slovenian
Or you just have more words
Yeah same here
How do you spell Šta, K-A-J
That's a very interesting system
So, if I understood you correctly the Italian people directly vote only for national MPs
And how is the President chosen
Do the MPs offer one of their own or a party member or do candidates apply themselves and the Parliament votes on them
Not really
It's notmal to settle down in your 30s and some who want that feel the pressure but it's not that big of a deal I think
I guess it depends on what you mean by settle down
My god yes, and not just by elders or family, my peers who are already settled are strangely even more annoying, as soon as a topic turns to marriage, kids, house/apartment or owning land they will always single us, the unmarried or single, childless girls, out
Like it's a race, or they have a need to validate their life choices
I think its pretty much the same for boys
It made me wonder, since when is this an acceptable topic, to pry into my personal affairs and plans by a relative stranger from work or a hobby group
I'll never forget a conversation I had with a Canadian tourist I chatted up on a train a few years back
She was traveling alone through Europe before she settles down, a woman in her early 30s. She was amazed how the people viewed age differently in Europe, she was considered old to start a family whereas in Canada they considered it normal, young even
Here, the pressure is real
On the other hand, living at home is considered normal, even majority of houses are build to support 2 to 3 families
It's a remnant of a time where one of the kids stayed at home, took over the farm and took care of the elders
Putting a parent to a nursing home was considered disrespectful not so long ago
Still is in rural areas
- Gorenjska: Rude, stingy people, they love everything that is free, they always hike or do extreme sports
- Primorska: Laid back, outgoing, charming people, they hate Italians but cook their food amazingly
- Štajerska: Always drunk, farmers, inberds, however generally happy
Subregion of Zasavje: Poor, miserable, they swear the most
Subregion of Savinjska: Stingy, farmers, probably drunk when they are working in their forests, for some reason the worst drivers
- Prekmurje: Totally non-understandable accent, poor, nobody knows what is going on there, they are also called "Hungarians".
- Dolenjska: The drunkest region, probably from their awful wine called Cviček, gypsies
Subregion of Bela Krajina: They speak a funny dialect, almost Croatian, drunk farmers
- Notranjska: Bears, people with funny accents
- Koroška: Funny people, but remote, can't say the letter R.
- Ljubljana: Arrogant assholes with too much money, corrupt mayor
They live in the swamp where is always foggy
You guys don't recodnise Graz as a city
Shit, when we talk about Graz we might as well be talking about New York
I live 1 kilometre from Italian border
Nothing special, really
And actually even before Schengen if you lived close to the border you would normally just be waved through (you had some special passes)
People usually went to Italy to buy stuff that were not available in my country
This was especially true during the time of Yugoslavia
Nowadays, we usually go through Italy to reach certain places faster
For example from my house to Nova Gorica you take 3 minutes less if you go on the Italian side
Going to Koper through Italy saves 15 minutes
The nearest beach is 50 minutes away in my country, but only 10 on Italian side
We dont go to Italy to shop anymore
It is the other way around
Italians come here for cheaper gasoline
Apparently 45 cents per litre
Also, there is a town of Gorizia with 34000 inhabitants just behind the border, yet it doesnt have a shopping centre
Residents of that town go over the border to a much smaller Slovenian town of Nova Gorica with 3 shopping centres
Also, Nova Gorica has 6 or 7 casinos and the same number of night clubs - mostly aimed at Italians
We have it too although I've seen it in this [version] more often
We use it for puree
We wear it in Slovenia
We don't have big cities and actually many people live in villages where you are not always enough visable for other vehicles
We get "[kresnička/firefly] in lower classes and they teach us in school that we have to use it
Kids in first grade also get [reflective thing ] that you put around your neck so they are more visible on the street
This thing for meat it's really common in Slovenia
Finding parking lots can be hell, but other that that and driving through extremely narrow streets, I love it
I am not really living in an old city, but my house was built around 1650 (at least the 'new' part, the old part was there at least 200 years prior) and the municipality we belong to, is basically just one ancient house after another (houses were mostly built in 15th to 18th century)
Also as mentioned above, WWII bombs literally everywhere, but we're kinda immune to it now
> One day you find out that that one barricaded doorway in the basement of your secondary school leads down to an uncharted 16th century cellar system that runs the length of the town centre, but noone's been down there in a century
Story time
I would soooo love to be a part of such exploration
Sounds super interesting
There is dissent in the historian ranks over whether Aldi is related to the very similar yet oh so different deity Hofer
Oh hell yes
I think since 2008, we have a new party formed  for each election just so that our current PM wouldn't win
They generally don't rule terribly well, there is a generaly lack of foresight and ideas with them, also they get themselves into scandals pretty fast, so for the next electrion, a new party is formed again to take him on
He hasn't actually won since then, but still managed to form two governments because the other guy failed or resigned
I think I voted 'against the guy' twice during this time and it is likely I'll do it the next time, since the leadership during the pandemic is above even his average for absolutely atrocious
I admit I can't judge the actual width of that road from the photo
If there is space enough for 2 cars on the tarmac (or maybe even if the edge is fine), I'll go the speed limit
Depending on conditions of course, I won't overdo it in fog or heavy rain
I never had any issue
It happens sometimes I meet someone suddenly behind the corner, but it was never even close, we might just steer more to the edge once we see each other
There is time enough
If there is only space for 1 car and I can't see far enough ahead, I'll probably go 40 as well
I think I'm the minority
Most people look to me like they are scared of bends in the road
Yeah, same
And usually I'm the one who reverses because people that somehow end up in our area are already afraid of driving forward XD
You're speaking the highest forms of truth
Novo Mesto (meaning New City) is one of the oldest settlements in the region but it got its name in the 14th century
Moravske Toplice (Moravian Spa), is a village that is nowhere near Moravia
At least it has a lot of spas, tho
Those are the only ones I can think off from the top of my head
In Slovenian a river is Reka and we have a river named Reka so we have "reka Reka". Then Castle is Grad and we have a Castle named Grad that is in town named Grad that is in municipality named named Grad so we have a Castle named Castle that is in a town named Castle that is in a municipality named Castle
Muff means what i think it means right
Yeah afaik languages and dialects still have no support in France or at least aren't nearly as supported as in other countries in Europe
I work for 8h (with rare exceptions) and spend a little less than 1h commuting
I sleep for about 7h per night, which is not as much as I'd like, but good enough
I have time to cook and eat with my husband daily, to do some sports or hobbies, and socialise in some limited way in the evening
I'd have much more time if I browsed less internet, but it is pretty pleasantly recharging to do along with a coffee after lunch
Probably [Velenje] it’s full of work immigrants from the Balkans and they usually speak very poor Slovene
The most Slovene is probably Ljubljana
Slovenian
Nobody speaks it as a first language - everyone in Slovenia has their dialect/regional language as the first language and some of those are more different from Slovenian than e.g. Croatian is - and it's a living language, unlike e.g. Latin
Best of all worlds
Also, super simple to learn
Only has 3 tenses, no definite/indefinite articles, and the spelling is reasonably consistent
Easy peasy
Do you say 97 in worse way than the French say 98
Because I really hated the French 98
I 100% absolutely don't get it
French require math, this expression I expect requires some history knowledge
ČMRLJ says hi
You have letters in latin alphabet available, like ČŽŠ and similar
I can't even why they decided against them
Celjski grofje not procreating
You're not a painter, are you
Look up, you might be in some good company
It's relative, it depends on wind and humidity
Although generally speaking, i'd say anything above 35° is very hot, 30° - 34° is hot, 26° - 29° is warm, 20° - 25° is nice and perfect, 16° - 19° is also very nice (just not t-shirt and shorts kind of nice), 10° - 15° is chilly, 1° - 9° is cold, and -9° to 0° is very cold
I have never experienced a temperature below -9° C, but its probably really bad
Edit: to clarify, i live on the Slovenian coast, which is by far the warmest part of the country, especially in winter (on average more than 5° warmer than the rest of the country)
In other parts of Slovenia this scale might be different
\<0 cold
\<10 chilly
\<21
5 cool
5 perfect
\>21
5 warm
\>28 hot
In other words:
\<1 wouldn't ride a motorcycle
\>42 wouldn't ride a motorcycle
Cold: <0
Chilly:1-11
Nice: 12-17
Warm: 18-24
Hot: 25<
For me it's exactly as you said about those 5 degrees
I live in central Slovenia, Zasavje and I'd shift your whole scale 5 degrees downward for me
I've also spent a fair bit of time in Sweden at -10 to -30 and didn't really find it bothersome, I might just be a winter person
Reading your comment:
>  10° - 15° is chilly, 1° - 9° is cold, and -9° to 0° is very cold
What the
> I have never experienced a temperature below -9° C, but its probably really bad
WTF
o.O
>  i live on the Slovenian coast
Ohhh :)
To clarify, I live in the north west, in the Alps, and boy do I miss my winters with -10 in November, with piles of snow by mid December and a winter breeze that feels like litle razors caressing your cheeks
Heh
We only get a few cm of snow every 2 or 3 years- and even then it only lasts a day before it all melts :)
Also, happy cake day to you
>Also, happy cake day to you
Thanks, totally missed that :)
Care to explain
[HK Olimpija] for me
Ajax has better logo
I give y'all Slovenia's very tree-filled cities
Trees are good
The Slovenian no-bullshit approach to racial equality
Then we give pumpkin seed oil
I'm not familiar with this, would you explain
Ayy

Wait, no, that's already taken

High five
Last time I had it was an hour ago, gotta have my daily fix
Nobody cares what color you are as long as you respect the culture and language
Of course
We have Styria too, you know
that is very nice of you as a society :)
Hence me putting it forward =)
I think I have been to most major tourist spots in Slovenia, but Bled island maybe doesn't count since I swum there in the summer and didn't want to linger
My school took us to all major museums in Ljubljana
I feel like I spent half the childhood in the Technical museum in Bistra
The school also took us to some less well known places like the Roman necropolis close to Celje
I've also been making a point of visiting some part of Slovenia every year for part of the annual break, usually some 4-5 days
Prekmurje was my favourite to date, but Bovec is another fantastic destination
In Slovenia we start counting at 21, so enaindvajset, dvaindvajset, triindvajset, štiriindvajset…”
21, 22, 23
(enaindvajset, dvaindvajset, triindvajset
This must me the correct way
Same in Slovenia
E-nain-dvaj-set, dva-in-dvaj-set, tri-in-dvaj-set ...
Chemistry, pharmaceutical science, biochemistry and medicine
You can't go wrong with any of these in Slovenia
Pay isn't the best mind here no matter what you do, but you will find a job fairly easy
Computer degrees (at least here) aren't as useful as actually being good at coding
And chemical engineering - probably more than pure chemistry and biochemistry
Sheldon, is that you
> The exclamation “Boh” is only italian
And the Slovenian littoral where Italian culture has a strong influence
Slovenes are outdoor people so they are also into picking musrooms and other things that grow in forests and in the meadows
> proper dark rye bread is all but impossible to find outside of Denmark
I've never managed to find it outside of Slovenia
Shall we do a dark rye bread exchange, bred-fren
You haven't travelled much then
As someone living 30 min from the Hu border, AFAIK they're "normal".
You should venture outside of Western Europe to the Slavic lands
I feel like Slovenia or the land of current day Slovenia is mostly innocent
We dont even have regions
The first (and only) level of subdivision are municipalities (212 of them with population ranging from 500 to 300
000, most of them less than 5k)
If some of these were autonomuos, it might be chaotic or even local dictatorships (in the smaller municipalities, some mayors dont get changed)
Why would I have problems with local sheriffs
Because of username
Here the larger version more suited to sewing and opening packages is the more prevalent
I do possess the small precision pair as well, but they are much rarer
Frexit
I am not a teacher but this was repeated many times on TV
Kids motor skills worsened for more than 13%. Especially in kids who were very active before the lockdowns since all after school sport activities were also closed
Subcutaneous fat rose for an average 20% in 50% of kids
In other words, they got fat
This was a first in history of Slovenia
And we have this motor skills measuring programe for decades
The research was done on more than 20000 kids
The plum ones are more popular here as well
We generally use the bread crumb and sugar topping with a bit of cinnamon on top
My grandmother makes these in bulk, freezes them, and hands them out to everyone in the family
We call them češplovi kneldi (meaning plum dumplings)
Both words are derrived from German (knedl - Knödel and češplja - Zweschpen)
Zweschpen in an old Austrian word that transformed over time to Zwetsche and to češplja in Slovene
So I guess it's all connected
Quick question
What region are you from
I'm from primorksa and we call them "cmoki" but I'm not sure if that's just my circle
"Knedl" is what we put is soup
> The plum ones are more popular here as well
Are they
We only had apricot ones at home
But maybe that's because I don't like plums and would throw a fit as a kid if I saw a plum inside instead of an apricot or a strawberry
Styria
We use knedli interchangeably with cmoki
Primorska region here
We say češpovi njoki as in plum filled gnocchi
This is mainly cause we use the same dough as for ordinary gnocchi
It's the same recipe as OP's.
>a breadcrumb and sugar mixture roasted in - ideally - clarified butter
Not just plain breadcrums
Though we don't call it Brösel
Your grandmother's version sounds tasty
Perhaps I could try to make that sometimes
Ok, it's only my family then
I guess it's the same as in Austria then
You just use what you have and/or prefer
Marelica in Slovene
I personally don't eat after beers, they kill my appetite for some weird reason
I like some small snacks with or after wine though, like olives or a bit of cheese
I did go along with people for things like burek (particularly the pizza style filling seems to be popular at night), pizza slice, fried chicken or different forms of kebab
Well, we have a church on an island
in a lake
Lake Bled is probably the most well known attraction in Slovenia, but everyone recognizes it by the church
Maybe Ljubljana castle as well
Good point
The only natural island, that still exists
Around Ljubljana, I ride an old Rog Turist (a well known brand in Slovenia)
The bike does not have any gears and it is a bit rusty which is a good thief repellent
It is not perfect but at least I always find it after parking it on the street for a few hours :D
Yeah, as you wrote, Ljubljana is quite flat around its centre, so it is possible to drive around without any gears on bikes
In fact, a lot of my friends also use old rusty bikes without gears since new shiny bikes are frequently stolen
People who ride shiny new bikes are usually locals, who keep their bikes inside their sheds/ garages overnight
During the daytime, bikes don't get stolen so easily, but a good looking new bike will probably not survive a night unsurveilled on any public space
I ride an [old Rog bike] as well, but this one has gears
Overall it works very well, but mine looks quite unattractive, so I can leave it anywhere without concern
I attached a huge basket at the front of the bike, mainly for the groceries, I also have a smallish trailer in case basket is not enough
It's a bit (a lot
) controversial and disputed, but I'll put down two:
658 - 745
1991 -
Personally, I wasn't impressed by Prague
Also Paris, I think it's just super overhyped so I didn't know what to expect
Funnily enough, Palermo is my father's favourite city
He just loved how quickly we passed from a "shady neighbourhood" to what is to him a stunning city
Edit: Just remembered, my biggest disappointment: Berlin
A lot of history, but I just didn't feel any excitment going through the city
It wasn't a very memorable trip
Probably Paris or Amsterdam
Both weren't too great
I was there after several years and I must say now it's much prettier than it was before
Lots of greenery and walking zones
I'm talking only about center of Belgrade
I was in Bratislava in early August and i stopped at Meštiansky pivovar too - good food i must say, first time i ate non-savoury meat
I was in the city only 4 days, but it was great
Mesopotamia, Egypt, China, Indus, hettits, greeks, Phoenicians, Carthage, Rome, Celts
Mesopotamia and Egypt are extremely specifc (have to know all Egyptian dynasties and their achievements)
Rome and Greece even more specific (have to know periods, battles, leaders, government types)
Carthage just relations with Rome
The rest are just general, when, where, what
We also learn about mesoamerica but that's not an ancient civilization, Mayas, Incas, Aztecs are thought in relation to the New World discoveries
When it comes to battles and wars, we must know the date, opposing sides, their leaders, cause of war, triggers and also the results and consequences
Yes treaty of kadesh is also taught here, but why was it signed, who did it, ehat were the consequences
Then we are sometimes challenged on exams on who was at the right and why etc
Like this  , H pronunciation is the same in all Slavic Balkan languages
Well I'm a bit vulgar and use "v pizdi" which would be "in vagina" in english
We tend to say "Nekje Bogu za hrbtom", which means "Somewhere behind God's back".
I may be wrong with the translation or the example, but I grew up saying that
For a faraway or a remote place, we use the phrase "behind God's back' (Bogu za hrbtom)
Yea but you could say it more politely "bogu za hrbtom", behind God's back
Indija Koromandija also perhaps
We also have "rovte" which is a remote place
We also have "španska vas" - spanish village, a bit old fasioned
Oh yeah
The time when some american tourist bumped into my classmate
Our class was in Florence (we are from Slovenia bdw) and we were in the gallery, when some american tourist bumped into my classmate, jumped away shocked and with this really obnoxious american accent said: "God bless America
My classmate was like "???", while I was laughing my ass off
Nothing special, but it shows what americans are like
Imagine their faces when they realize we also have freezers
oida
Now that's what I call a sensible law
We only have police
And they are mostly concentrated in urban areas
In rural areas, you wont see them often
We do have MP but they have almost no jurestiction over civilians, only military
They do have same jurestictional training as civilian police though
Nothing
The Spanish state showed that totalitairan practices (beat the shit out of people that wanna cast a vote) work good and that people just stop when they're beaten the shit out of
And the Catalan parties just wanted some attention, not actual independence
> Some other EU countries would never let it happen because they are afraid of similar referendums happening to them
Like with Yugoslavia
The right of self determination of a people is higher than any constitution, especially one that limits such a fundamental right
And especially a fascist-written constitution which was written without the consent and participation of said people
And the "legality" argument is quite nonsensical
The holocaust (gathering a group of people and sending them to a concentration camp to be gased to death) in nazi Germany wasn't illegal for example
I live in a small town of Slovenske Konjice
The Slovene name comes from the word “Konj” which means a horse
The legend says that a dragon lived inside a local mountain and would often threaten to destroy nearby villages by flooding them with water from an underground lake
After an agreement with a noble the dragon promised not to flood the villages, but only if he was given six virgins to devour every year
For many years, the terrible sacrifice ensured peace in the land
One year came the turn of the nobleman’s daughter to be sacrificed
Even the noble realized that there was no way to save his daughter, Marjetica
But just before Marjetica and the five other virgins were handed over to the dragon, St
George miraculously appeared on a white horse and killed the dragon with a sword
The nobleman was so grateful to his daughter’s savior that he had the Church of St
George built not far from the dragon’s hideaway and a town was soon built around the church
It became known as Konjice
The term “Slovenske” was added in Yugoslav times to not confuse it with Bosnian town of Konjic
A white horse is still on [coat of arms] of the town
Yeah it comes from Slovene and we actually still use the name Gradec
We also say "prede" which would be translated to spin, like spinning wool
We've got like 3 in total lol
Wait what
Haven't heard of this
I've heard of "povodni mož", some kind of a water dwelling man, who'd steal people (women) and kept them in his underwater palace
But I don't think he stole souls, as he needed them alive as to keep him company
> Vodník
Damn you're ugly
Most American ones
Like Breaking Bad
Kids going thousands kilometers from home to study
Having a 'college fund' as a family
Jocks and cheerleaders
University and high school sports being a thing
Some parents do have savings especially for their kids college
Or at least a savings account that kids can use when they are 18
And also if you sign up for the international highschool graduation you probably want to leave the country for college
Yes
The savings accounts are like 30 € per month allowance
But hey, I am not in the millionaire circles
Neither am I. I only see this in kids with rich parents
"Proper" / literary language is taught in all schools here and everyone will write in it, many people will also speak it in highly formal occasions, but otherwise they will speak in their local dialect
The one difference are the people from the NE region of Prekmurje - their dialect is so out of there (influenced by Hungarian perhaps, I'm really not sure) that most people don't understand them, so they will usually adapt
I chuckled a bit when we visited friends and their younger daughter, still in kindergarten, started happily chatting with me and my wife in their dialect
Her sister, who barely started school, corrected her all prim and proper: "You must speak Slovenian, they can't understand you"  (she WAS speaking Slovenian, but in their dialect :D)
~~Safety~~ Emergency corridors on highways
Some countries have it in the middle and others on the hard shoulder
During the year when there's not a lot of tourists, safety corridors are made well but over the summer tourists just don't get it
Euros
I'm pretty sure that's already planned
We implemented it for trucks last year
If it's the same in Germany as it is here, it's because a hard shoulder is designed for broken vehicles, not to drive on
Therefore it would be a hindrance if there was a broken down truck or something on a hard shoulder while it was being used as an emergency corridor
Emergency corridor has to be made as soon as traffic starts slowing down and there are signs of a congestion
Most of the time it works fine, except in summer when tourist just ignore what everyone else is doing
It's normal here to move to the sides if you see an emergency vehicle behind you, on a highway or off it
> probability of having a broken down vehicle on the shoulder is much smaller than the probability of a vehicle not moving to the sides enough
There's plenty enough space if those on the left move to the left and those on the right move to the hard shoulder
The biggest problem are truck drivers and people towing caravans and boats
Back in the day you would only move to the side if you heard an emergency vehicle approaching, which is obviously not very effective when there's shit tons of trucks that have nowhere to move because they stop 10cm behind another truck
But now the law says you have to form it as soon as there's a congestion even if it's just construction work because you never know, especially in hot summer months, if someone stuck will need an ambulance service
You move back to the driving lane when there's no more congestion, at least that's what my logic says
> And how do you deal with exits
No idea
Whoever wants to use an exit just has to wait, I guess
If you know there's a congestion on the highway you use an exit before the traffic stops and use regional roads
[Here's] something about it by ETSC
We only have classic Central European potato dumplings (or as we call it "cmoki" or "knedli" in some dialects) filled most often with plum or apricot
We also have dumplings made from semolina (zdrob or "gres") which we put in the soup
I thought germknoedel is floating in vanilla sauce, not just butter and sugar
At least that's how they served me the only one I ever ate
Well, we all know the correct answer to this one
> Laško
Gösser radler is to die for

> Especially since i don't think my country has nearly enough in common with any European country to warrant something like that
You must not have traveled much
You have to renew your passport every year
> just something that counts as valid ID
So literally ID or passport
I don't think any police officer anywhere in the EU would let it slide if I got stopped traveling with just my driver's license, even though that's a valid form of ID in Slovenia
`za slavo zveze` => `Za slavo Unije` in Slovenian with those caps pls

Idk man, a lot of other EU countries can actually speak english at a very decent level across all ages
Italy and France are notorious for having very poor english knowledge overall
True, its annoying to have to talk in english just because of that one non-speaker
Gives incentive to learn I guess
> It's sad
I hate to say it, but studying something like East Asian studies is like shooting yourself in the foot
If you wanted a secure, well-paying, high education job you shouldn't have picked something like that
The amount of people who have that degree for such a niche field is way too high (at least here in Slovenia)
On the other hand, having a technical degree, law, pharmacy, medicine, etc will basically guarantee you a job
They are quite a bit harder though and certainly not for everyone
Or, considering it's now Germany vs France, Spain, Italy, and Poland, when it comes to major EU states, how about y'all just band together and force the ECB to devalue the EUR to the level that works for the average EU state
Germanic states wouldn't like it, but why should everything always be suited to their liking and not everyone else's?
France especially now holds all the cards, considering they're the last and only EUMS with a military worth a damn
Get to it
> What is needed to solve this is a healthy dose of foreign investment from the EU and a fair amount of regulations (or protectionism) to help create nascent, sustainable industries
The only other option would be for the EU to federalise and implement internal transfers like in the USA, covering for the deficits of those states, essentially turning them into sources of human capital for the industrial north and warm holiday places for northern pensioners to retire to
If only people in the poorer half of the EU would realize this
Instead, there's paranoia about Germany taking over
No, Germany is in charge NOW, where they write the rules and LOAN you money
In a federation, nothing would change about writing the rules, but the money wouldn't be loans
I'm sorry to hear that
Like I said, it's not for everyone and it looks like you did your homework with employability after all
A lot of people here don't and study obscure courses, end up without a job in their field and blame the world for it
According to the Slovenian statistical office a 2 person house hold uses 219€ per month on food and non-alcoholic beverages
I would agree, my boyfriend and I use about 50€ per week on groceries although when we were really cautious and frugal and mindful of all special offers we managed to get that to 30€ per week

The UK foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt called Slovenia a former Soviet vassal state
Since most people likely don't know - Yugoslavia was never a vassal and for most of the 2nd half of the 20th century not even a friend or ally of the USSR
It was one of the founders of the Non-aligned movement of countries not obsessed with the nuclear and/or space dick measuring contest (because they couldn't afford it)
Heey I’ve heard that somewheeee
druga Švica
most US presidents have said a lot of dumb shit about Europe, Trump isn't all that special in that regard
O_o Now THAT'S quite a few levels down the road
I wonder
If they have permanent residence in a country they should be able to vote as people who would be elected also represents him, while citizens of the country that permanently live somewhere else also have voting right even if affairs in the country have much less impact to them
No way
No offense but I don't trust people who aren't citizens to vote
They could be persuaded much easier because they don't have to understand the language, so they wouldn't have all the sources available about who they're voting for
Most importantly in a small country like our, god forbid someone like our current crazy PM brings in a bunch of people from conservative country
We're small enough for that to influence elections
Those five years didn't feel that bad tbh
And everyone older than me, tells me it was pretty much better in almost every way than it is now
So yeah
Yes, exept there was a lack of gas, inflation, empty stores, shitty cars, ugly buildings, undemocratic governmet
We were a poor county
The things that we experienced back then would have been totaly unacceptable today
The only people that enjoyed Yugoslavia were the communists themselves
They had fancy apartments in Ljubljana, paved roads, new tv-s, nice cars, send their kids abroad to study
Every else was poor
Thats why 90% of the people wanted to leave
They were unhappy with the sistem
We went thru the shitty 90s but now we live well
I think we have it 100 times better now
Thank you Ivan Janša, very cool
Just that, 1) only one of my grandparents was actually in the party
2) The gas crisis was universal in the 70's. and 3) until the "young-economist" took over and destroyed our economy our model was basically just updated version of Kavčič's from the 60's.
I'd recommend you to watch a bit less Nova24tv, and actually read some history
Bruh, i dont watch nova tv
But only a fool can say that we lived better in yugoslavia than now
You are in denial
Yugoslavia could not compare in any way to the west
All the people went to italy or austria to buy clothes or some material, because you couldnt get it here
All these things and problems that we had during socialism is obvius to me, but aparently to you everything was better
In what way is driving a yugo better than a renault or macedes
Yugo was a laughing stock in the west
Much like other cars (trabant, škoda)
And the wage gap is still visibe now, 30 years later
It was ridiculous, my great grandfather ended in prison for a few days because he told a joke about Tito in a pub
I'm just saying most older people feel it was better than now
Like my grandma, who says something "How far have we fallen, that things were better under rotten communism, than now".
I mean sure GDP, purchases parity, GINI coefficient are all way higher than they were then, but back then we actually had our own economy, now it's  just empty husk of a thing, after we sold all of the most important parts of it
Also the fact that we could go to Austria and Italy to buy things is actually a plus
In most other communist/socialist countries, you could only dream about going to the west
While we went there to get some diapers and a better Hi-Fi system, than one you could get here
The more I look at other (western) nations history, the more it's clear to me, that until like 70's there wasn't a very much big difference between Yugoslavia and any other western countries
The biggest difference was how both sides bounced from oil crisis of the 70's. The west got it's "reaganomics" (the first step towards current neoliberalism) economic boom, while the east including Yugoslavia slowly stagnated
Sure the Marković years, when our economic policies were set by the IMF (basically the same thing that happened to Greece with Troika), were really really bad, and obviously socialism seems like it was doomed after the end of oil crisis
- I could go into detail, as it wasn't just the oil crisis, it was a huge number of events that broken Soviet Union: war in Afghanistan, Chernobyl accident, etc
and all its satellites
And Yugoslavia was a the collateral damage, as Soviets had debts to repay us, but couldn't any more, which meant that Dinar got devalued, which meant that IMF got involved, which lead to austerity measures that ended in total collapse
Also the way Yugoslavia was built, it probably wouldn't survive death of Tito either way
But still compared to other socialist nations, Yugoslavia wasn't that bad, or dare I say it, maybe it was even the best
For me Italy, France, all German speaking countries, the Netherlands, all of Balkans and some Eastern Slav countries
If my Bosnian would be better, Turkey would be easier too
English would just be easier though :D
I live on the border between Italy and Slovenia (former Yugoslavia)
Thus I speak Italian, Slovenian and am very familiar with Serb/Croatian/Bosnian
As a consequence I would probably have no problems to communicate all over Italy and former Yugoslavia
Slovenians didn't flee from the war, since ours lasted only 10 days
There are other reasons why you could get by with German here
There are still some Germans living in Slovenia and German is tought as a second language (instead of English) in some primary schools, at least in Styria
Many people watched Austrian and German TV in the nineties
People have relatives in Austria, especially in Carinthia
But you can get by with German only in northern and eastern parts of the country
In the west, people tend to be fluent in Italian rather than German, due to proximity to Italy
Someone wants to sneak some drugs through europe
I mean Austria put up checks on the Slovenian border and I personally that's a betrayal of the values of the EU
Well, Austria is technically still controlling the AT-SLO border, though the controls are pretty random at this point
Not so
Austria has "temporarily" suspended the Schengen regime on its border with Slovenia in 2015
Ronde van Vlaanderen
Waffles
Shortcut
Italy for its military prowess or lack thereof
Imagine French jokes, but for Italians
Also Bosnia, where the Bosnian is either dumb or comes up with something that sounds dumb but is genius in its simplicity
All of our neighbors, but especially Croats
Croatia
Defenetly
Hrvat je tat
Croatia
They are thieves
Don't forget lazy Montenegrins and thieving Croatians
Pa še kak je res
I don't think Croatians ever play a thieving part in our jokes
You are right about the Montenegrins, though
*Sorry Italy, they asked
Italian WW2 rifle for sale - never fired, only dropped once
Why do Italian tanks have rear-view mirrors
So they can watch the battle
How many gears does an Italian tank have
Five reverse and one forward, in case the enemy attacks from behind
Churchill is being criticized in the House of Commons for not doing more to prevent Italy from joining the Axis in WW2
He answers: "Well, it seems only fair
We had them last time".
How do Italians determine the future career of a newborn baby boy
They slap him
If he cries, he will be a singer
If he kicks with his feet, he will be a footballer
If he shits himself, he will be a soldier
hrvat je tat
Yes, it's a bunch of unfunny memes posted by a statistically insignificant and non-representative sample of our population
The "Croatian thief" is not a part of jokes told by the general population
And most of them are just satirical and making fun of people who say it geniuenly lol Hrvat je brat
The sub has been so trashy lately

Poštena beseda
8, I like to wear short shirts in the house, we switched heating from wood to air source heat pump
Im amazed how many of you have it set to under 20°C.
Oh no
Currently live in Ljubljana
I've walked home many times at 4am from parties wearing short skirts, heels etc
and never felt unsafe
I think in general the biggest threat is getting your bike stolen
In Koper, my hometown of about 30k people, I’ve never felt unsafe
I’ve studied in Ljubljana and very often went home from a party between 3-5pm
Never have I felt unsafe walking alone even when walking through some “dodgy” streets
Basically I’ve never felt unsafe at night anywhere in Slovenia, however, females might have a different experience
Never felt unsafe even as a 12 year old walking home from friends birthday parties
Although that was 11pm at the latest and it was usually at least 2 of us
But now there's aparently 2 gangs of kids 11-16 year olds, patroling some nearby neighbourhoods and a pump track that are intimidating kids and elderly
Started happening now during corona lockdowns
The chances are very low
I feel safe walking alone anywhere
As a woman there are perves anywhere in the world but overall Slovenian cities are very safe
Yes, bicycle theft is probably the most common kind of crime in Ljubljana
Otherwise it's a very safe city and violent crime is extremely rare
Well, we have become kind of a cycling superpower in recent years with Primož Roglič and Tadej Pogačar
Diatonic button accordion or like we say [frajtonar'ca]
Well, surely the diatonic accordion is the most omnipresent in our folk music (usually also called "Oberkrainer music", if anyone is familiar), but it actually got popularized just in the 20th century
I find this kind of music dreadful, but too bad because I think the accordion is such a beautiful instrument if you just allow yourself to play it differently, not according to the oberkainer standard
Otherwise also the Zither used to be popular in alpine areas and the Cimbalom in pannonian areas
Even before the accordion started to dominate, the fiddle was popular too, but today it remains mostly associated with Roma people and with the music of the Resia valley, which is extremely specific
I guess the obvious answer is [Styrian Harmonika] Zither as well, since it's an older instrument
It's said that every Slovenian home used to have zither
It has such a beautiful [sound] way nicer than an accordion
In Slovenia its Zither and Styrian accordion (we call it frajtonarca and its my fav instrument)
Might wanna listen to [this] Its a tune from a really popular Slovene movie and Zither get associated with this tune here all the time
Beautiful instrument
It is, but after the break up of Austria-Hungary, [Duchy of Styria] was split between [Austria] and [Slovenia ] at that time)
Slovenia and Austria have 2 same regions, Styria and Carinthia
In Slovenia we say Austrian Carinthia and Austrian Styria just so we know we are talking about our northern neighbours

The white skin thing and beauty stuff in general is so true
This friend of mine is a registered nurse, as is 3/4 of their population, but now she has a beauty salon where they do skin whitening, botox and stuf like that
They get an IV with whitening stuff, they call it Cinderella treatment
She says people are obsessed with it and she gets a lot of money
They're also obsessed with fame, money and looking all fancy and rich
Half of her instagram posts are showing off gucci, LV and other shit like that

I think Americans consider any restrictions on firearms equivalent to a ban
The main difference is that in most European countries it is extremely difficult to acquire a firearms with the purpose of self-defence and that is what most Americans are talking about when they say "guns are banned". I'm sure, however, that many uninformed believe a total ban is in place and that a civilian can't obtain anything more than a slingshot
You are right, I should have written "any restrictions more severe than the ones in Texas/Kansas/other firearm owner-friendly states".
Swedes can definitely own handguns and I believe Norwegians can too but with many restrictions on calibers
May someone correct me if I'm wrong
Talking about historical divisions, 45 years of the Iron Curtain didn't undo the influence of several centuries of the Habsburg Empire
But the HRE did extend beyond the Alps and a bit into the Balkans
Some people on Reddit have said that they carry concealed even in places like shops or restaurants declared as "gun-free". Could you do so with a reasonable level of impunity since police can't search you without probable cause
Edit:
>Food for thought, the crime rate for concealed carriers is lower than it is for police officers, we're an extremely low crime demographic
You wouldn't happen to have a source for this
Not that I don't believe you, I genuinely wish to see the data
Here many people believe law enforcement should be the only ones to be trusted with firearms as if they are somehow better than the rest of the population
I live close to the capital and the prices have shot up like nobodies business
400k€ gets you a huge house (200m\^2) with some land (< 500m\^2)
Or a huge apartment (< 200m\^2) with no land
That's about it, since the market is so small there is almost nothing for sale regardless
Or like, a 100-120 sqm flat within the Ljubljana bypass if you are lucky and you get one
We have quite a shortage
can confirm on Bran, of all the castles seen in Transylvania this was the most meh, it seemed artificial somehow, like its made of cardboard, and the museum was poorly stacked
If I wrote in Slovenian and auto translated everyone would know immediately because flow of the words in sentences is very different and it is extreamly hard to translate automaticaly
Even if I write English myself I sometimes fall into a trap of wanting the words follow Slovenian rules for what comes before and after
And that is why we always laught at some spam email that was auto translated
So true, when i tried to copy my book assignments (domače branje, če se slučajno spomniš tega haha) i tried to use an english source and translate it with a translator and it would sound so bad i gave up and wrote it myself
Želim rezati kruh
To je vse, kar želim storiti
oops, autotranslate broke
Oh book assigments those were the worst I usualy just copied it from someone because I hated all the books
Why are you calling me a horse
Oh, sorry for the misunderstanding
There is a Wiki article about floor numbering standards
Slovenia like rest of Europe uses Ground floor
In Slovenia, the floor at street level is called 'pritličje' and it means 'floor on the ground'. 1st floor is upstairs from that
Nothing that I know of :I
that would be france
We have a village called Village
We also have a city called New City
The town Vodice (meaning waters) is not near any body of water
Novo mesto (meaning New City) was settled since the Early Iron Age (though it's name was given to it by Rudolf IV
Murska Sobota means Mur Saturday
Make whatever you want of that
Also, Rijeka (or Reka) literally means river, though that's in Croatia
I've seen various other Slovenes naming the more well known places
But we have loads of small villages and towns that have the most boring names imaginable
My personal favourite is probably Gozd - Reka, which is a very small village created from two even smaller settlements, One named Gozd (Forest), and other Reka (Rive)
You can guess that forest part is near a forest, and the Reka part is near a river, or rather a stream, also named Reka - river
Then we have loads of villages, that are just that village
So village in Slovene is Vas, and we have everything: Upper/Lower Village (Gornja/Dolnja vas), small village, but in outdated spelling - Vesca, village be with a different name - Selo, or just New Village (Nova Vas)
Back to Gozd - Reka
As naming villages Forest is incredibly popular
We have loads of just Forest - Gozd, or Under Forest - Podgozd
And sometimes we mix it up, and use a regional word - Hosta and Podhosta
Also sometimes we just name villages after one particular tree: Poplar (Topol), Maple (Javor), Birch (Brezje) and Linden (Lipa)
In slovenia we have a town named Novo Mesto (new city)
We also have new town- Novo mesto
We have Nova Vas too
Many of em
Here one as well, also some in Croatia
There's "New villages" too
Brilliant
Nothing will change for a while
The it depends how member state will implement it
And even then, let's not forget that new EU elections are just around the corner, so if you're worried about it, just don't vote for MEPs and parties that supported it
Also to me it seems that both sides are just different parts of huge industries trying to get better deal for their side
Without article 13, google and other news aggregators, and tech companies gain advantage, and with it old media and copyright owners gain advantage
It's not that much about internet freedom, as it is who makes money from internet
I like putting chilli sauce on
Probably 2014 ice storm
The photos were all over the internet
Probably the Easter earthquake of Ljubljana on 14th of april 1895
One out of every ten buildings were destroyed
Afterwards, when it was rebuilt, architecture and the city drastically changed
Hurt I don't know
Probably higher than usual broken bones and injuries due to falling branches
There were 13 deaths directly connected to the storm (interventions, restoration and rehabilitation)
Following year they estimate 3 of the forestry deaths and 20 injuries were connected
It wasn't a deadly disaster, it was a natural disaster
Corruption
It's definitely the coastal region with Koper as the main city
Even on the internet I haven't seen anyone poke at their accent
Central Slovenia with Ljubljana definitely not, if people talk shit about eachother's regions the heat is usually between Upper Carniola (Kranj) and Central Slovenia (Ljubljana) or between Central Slo
and Drava (Maribor)
It's kind of 'meh'. Nationally I'd only consider Eurospin worse
In my area maybe also Jager
Although Jager has a lot of good quality local products
Some things in Lidl are OK quality, some not
Hofer is better
Both Lidl and Hofer are seen as low tier shops almost Wallmart like
I only buy cheap alcohol there
The food is too processed and tastes like plastic
lidl and hofer may be cheap/budget but we dont consider them low quality
but im the type of guy who rants having to pay more than 10 bucks for a shirt and lidl has good clothing prices
In Slovenia, it is considered on the lower end in terms of quality
The good ones are Spar, Tuš and Mercator (the last two are Slovenian retailers), who all offer a wide variety of well known international brands and local products
Lidl has just cheap stuff and the knock-off versions of the well-known brands
Vesel tortni dan (happy cake day)
Agreed
I'd call it as Mercator/Spar - Aldi(Hofer) - Lidl - Eurospin
The latter three sell random cheapo stuff from everywhere except Slovenia, which many see as lower quality
Too often it feels like these shops offer leftovers, stuff that they couldn't sell in wealthier countries
Not impressed by their meat and prepackaged food sections (esp
Eurospin, ohgodwhy), but am not mad at their produce nor baked goods
Small lasagna with spinach is actually quite good
I never buy pre-prepared frozen food, except cmoki and štruklji but that's one item I always have in my freezer for lazy days
Merkur is selling groceries
Are we talking about the same Merkur
O, hvala lepa
Hofer has some nice bio stuff and Slovene products though
Lidl has 'Lojtr'ca domačih' but that's stuff's expensive
Lidl has great wooden toys for kids, electronic and home improvement stuff is shit
As well as any sort of shoes and hiking stuff
And yep, baked products and fruits and veggies are good
Eurospin can fuck off
Ja, drug Merkur
Fajn trgovina
Maš ga v Seiersbergu, če si s štajerskega konca
I'm mind blown lol, didn't know that store exists and I live so close to the border
There was a guy asking in r/slovenia about this
Basically his Slovenian gf (he was foreign but I forget from where) went to lunch with a guy friend
He thought it was a date and she kept telling him that slovenians can hang out with a different sex just fine
He decided to ask our subreddit if this is really normal here
So to answer your question it's very normal to hang out with a different sex
You can go out drinking, for coffee or lunch just as friends and it isn't really considered that you are a couple or whatever
Also I recently talked to an exchange student from Hungary about our student dorm situation and she was shocked that our dorms were mixed
Your roomate will be the same sex as you but everyone out of your room is mixed so the next room could be a different sex
She was quite horrified since she was expecting an all-girl dorm
Informal calls with family/friends I say “ja”? For unknown numbers I say “prosim” which can be translated to please (not really the most accurate translation as the context is important - means more like please, I am listening)
If I am at work I say the name of the organization I represent
In Slovenia same (Prosim) but if its like a friend or family member or something I just answe with "Ja = Yes" or "Ja reči = Yes go ahead"
Well, technically in 1991, but Slovenia first became an entitiy in 1918 with the founding of State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs, which then joined Kingdom of Serbia
Those two (and some other areas) formed Yugoslavia
Some Slovenes argue that Carantania from the 7th century was a Slovene state, but that is complete and utter poppycock
Since 1991
We have been wanting independency for a long time but only in 1991 did we actually achieve it
I disagree
The constitutions of the SHS kingdom and Kingdom of Yugoslavia were both heavliy influenced by serbian centralism, thus they did not want to divide the country in administrative divisions that would represent nations
First the created oblasts centered around the main towns (MB and LJ in our case) and then banovinas centered around rivers (Drava in our case)
In prtactice their territories corresponded with our language area, but those were not meant to be national divisions
I think the first political unit to materializw slovene nationhood without any constraint was the People's Republic of Slovenia
We could argue about the date of its creation
I think the 19th February 1944 - the first congress of the Slovene national liberation council (SNOS, some kind of first parliament, the slovenian equivalent of AVNOJ) could be a good candidate
The PRS later evolved in the SRS (Socialst republic of Slovenia) and in 1991 aquiring independence from Yugoslavia in the process of its breakup
Yes, some nationally aware individuals (mostly students) theorized about a unified land of Slovenes within Austria, but not much came of it
We learn the history of the territoriries that Slovenia covers today
From the archeological eras until the modern times
Slovenia an independent country is just the final small chapter
Good point
As a slovenian I feel ofended
Our history is very rich bur it's hard to rebel against austria when you are so small
There are plenty of WW2 monuments to Istrian battalions all over Istria, I wouldn't say they didn't participate in any wars
They're delivered by companies you buy it from
Drywall is bought and deliverd by whoever you hire to fix/build stuff for you
When I was renovating my bathroom most things were delivered by the people renovating my bathroom and some by a company I bought things from
We had a subject called "gospodinjstvo" where we did learn something about cooking
I remember us doing pancakes
But it was not just about cooking we learned about general household stuff
Considering how many ppl in the West are overweight, some practical exposure to efficient and/or healthy food prep would be good for kids
The average adult cooks regularly, yet hardly ever gets into logarithms or quadratic equations
Useful knowledge should one end up in prison
I guess German schools really do prep you for every scenario
If you don't speak our language, then you have no business getting citizenshipn
Learning the language of your host nation should the most basic requirement
What is it with Turkey and cats
Sounds like my family from mum and dad's sites
There was a bigger area but eventually every child got a part of that land and built the house in their part of the area
That is why most of neighbours are actually related to me
I now want to move to your street
Around 20min by car and 1h by bus
A 3 minute walk to the train station is followed by a 10 minute train ride and then I walk for another 5 minutes to get to school
an hour by bus or bike or 20minutes by car
unfortunately my bike was stolen and im too broke to get a car so im left with unreliable bus services
Arne and Sven, both present here for a few decades
Arne sounds like it could be a stereotypical Slovenian name
Agamar sounda dope
Like something from a Tolkein novel
It's Russian, not Slavic
I doubt there's many names common in all Slavic languages
That does not make a name a Slavic one
We apparently have very different concepts of what 'moving out' means
People here also 'move out' for univesity, but we don't call that moving out
Could be because most students still go home for the weekend or every other weekend and consider that their real home
Yep
Yes
A lot of them do pay for themselves
Our student housing is subsidized, if you stay in a student dorm you pay around 70€ or even less
Beside that, if you register a temporary address and live required km away from home you get extra 80€ government help
But your parents receive child benefits until you're in school and majority goes home every weekend
Edit: idk if you get those extra 80€ if you live in a dorm as well or only if you rent a private room
I'd have to check it later
Yes, that's probably a huge factor
If you live 5 hours from home you probably won't go home every weekend
Yes, but also students themselves consider that a home
But I guess it really is a matter of how you define moving out
Is it just staying somewhere during week to study and coming home during weekends
Imo moving out means staying at the place all the time (incl weekend and holiday breaks) and taking care of household
Month
Average dorm room rent in Ljubljana is 72,08€. There's also some duty thing that costs 21,58€ but I don't remembered paying that
I paid around 63€, same dorm now is 68€. You usually get a 2 person room, if you want a one person room you have to ask and pay a bit more
Most dorm apartments have 3 2bed rooms, a kitchen and a bathroom
Beside that we also have subsidized meals
Most expensive meal is 4,37€. With that you usually get a soup, main course, salad and fruit
I do not know how strange it is this, but it is definitely unusual
During the 19th and early 20th century, when Europe experienced the so called 'European population explosion', the population of most European countries grew by a factor of 3 or even much more, the growth of the population in Slovenia was very slow, only increasing by about 30%  (from ~1 million to 1
3 million) in 120 years
This disparity is due to the unfavourable economic and political situation the Slovenes were faced with as a small, rural nation ruled by the German uper classes
It resulted in the second largest emigration movement (proportionaly) of any ethnicity in Europe, only behind the Irish, with up to 400,000 Slovenes leaving their homeland between the years 1860 and 1910 alone
Yet this fact is still largely unknown even in Slovenia
Source
That number seems an exaggerated upper number
The max I heard of was up to 300k.
I will put it here when and if i find the source again
However, i do have at hand the data about the birth and death rate for Slovenia between the years 1857 and 1910, as well as the population of Slovenia for both of those years , from which it is not hard to calculate what the increase of the population would be if there was no emigration
Of course, this calculation comes with a few caveats, such as that without the massive emigration, the birth rates would be higher and death rates lower, meaning a higher overall population, as young people would constitute a larger proportion of the total population
But nonetheless, i did calculate it, and the result is at least 363 500 people missing in 1910 on the territory of present day Slovenia, due to emigration that happened between the years 1857 and 1910
Slovenia was already experiencing a not insignificant amount of emigration before that, and emigration was also very high during and after WW1, up to the 50s. With the exception of Ireland where population actually fell, Slovenia was the slowest growing European country in the 19th and first half of the 20th century
Took me some time, but here you go:
Page 2 (88), second paragraph:
"....At the same time, this was also a period of the large Slovene exodus when almost half a million people left Slovene territory between 1870 and 1914
The number is even higher than what i first said
The vast majority went to the USA (~250,000), some 50,000 to Germany, and the rest in France, UK, Austria proper, Brazil, Argentina, etc
Egypt, particularly the city of Alexandria was also a common choice for young women who went there ti work as house maids
But does it work if you try
So I wouldn't say that this is racist
It's nationalistic maybe and definitely a type of discrimination but not really racism
They are easily distinguishable but it's not so much about skin colour as it is their behaviour
and they tend to cause trouble
The appartment above me has 3-10 roma people living in it (no one actually knows how many)
Yesterday I brough up that they are parking on my parking spot with one of them
After some arguing the guy said that they beat up the guy who lived there before me for the same reasons (implying they could beat me up too)
Let me stress that I only pointed out that that is not their parking space and they thought threatning someone for this is acceptable
For reference I'm a 23 y/o 60kg girl
How safe do you think I feel
While all racism is discrimination not all discrimination is racism
Racism is based on skin color it literally in the name
I take your point and I agree
No matter who I met in life (or served since I worked in the service industry mostly) I gave them the same level of respect
No matter were they came from
From my experience most people in Slovenia are like that too
When it comes to day to day interactions to most it doesn't matter what you look like or where you come from
I'm sure some people can be jerks but for the most part i think people can act considerately to others
I did however point out where this prejudice comes from
It's not just because they are from another country and not because they look different
It's because at the slightest hint of disagreement they start threatening violence
So when I meet another roma peron will I think of them violent
No, i know one person isn't representative of everyone else
But right now if I had the chance to move to another apartment where I wouldn't have roma for my neighbours I would also do that
Ok but i still stressed that I don't care where they are from it's the way they act toward everyone in their community
Where did jews come into the argument
Either way I stated from my own example how my prejudice doesn't stem from their country of origin or their skin color but rather from the way they choose to present themselves
I see you are having a knee-jerk reaction as soon as discrimination was mentioned
I'm not sure what your issue here is
I never said discrimination of any kind is ok but to pretend that you hold no prejudice against anyone is lying
It's how you treat those people in day to day life
I would dare say that I don't treat people differently based on my prejudice in my day to day life
But is it wrong for me to say that I would prefer not to have roma neighbors since they literally threatened to beat me up over a fuckin parking spot
I would think not
I also realise that one shitty neighbor doesn't reflect on their entire population
Edit: also discrimination against jews isn't racism it's anti-Semitism
Again not all discrimination is racism but all racism is discrimintaion
Every year
It's a tradition
Me, every year
We have Germanised to the point where Ja has replaced Da (Yes)
No going back boys
You remember when Tresckow tried to kill Hitler but a wooden table protected him from the impact
That table was apparently made in Slovenia
Also, one of our oldest settlements is called Novo mesto (New City), though that name was officially recorded first by Rudolf IV or Austria
Speaking of Austria, we've been subjects of Austria for about 1000 years until we became Serb subjects for 30 years, then the Serbs became our equal subject for 40 years (god bless Tito), then we went back to being Serbia's bitch for 10 years until finally getting independent
Isn't that called defenestration or something
Oh, so that's how the term 'throwing someone out of the window' came to exist
It's commonly used here to describe someone losing their job
I wouldn't say exactly germanised, since we lived with the germans for several hundred years
Our languages influenced each other due to cohabitation
There was of course germanisation present, that's why german influenced slovenian more, but styrian german was also influenced by slovenian
The south styrian german dialect does not exist anymore, that's why it's not as appearent
A nice example of slovenian influence on german is, in my opinion, the name of the city of Gradec (Graz in german)
The german name is derived from the slovenian name, meaning little castle
I know that Styrian Austrians use words like klutsch (kljuc/key) and le (only) but lets not forget who was who's subject
The German language influenced all of Slovenia, the language and culture, while Slovenian did little to influence all of Austrian German
Yes, of course
All I wanted to point out was that it wasn't a one way street
People groups then didn't exactly live seperate from each other and influence each other, but also evolved together
It was a layered process between the nations that lived in the slovenian lands
Ah, sorry I missinterpreted your comment
We don't have that but every building has 3 different trash bins and one of them is for packagings and plastic bottles
I don't know if it's the same thing, but we have *kroketi*. They're usually made out of potatoes
I'm pretty sure only Spanish speaking world (and maybe France) see it as one continent
not really, i saw locals abusing this system by instead of fighting littering , they would just flip a trash can , take all the plastic bottles in it for deposit and leave all the other garbage on the ground
They're longer here, not like a ball
Same shape as a chevap
It's mashed potatoes mixed with flour, I think
Yea I read bellow they're made out of bechamel
It sounds delicious
[Over-Mura Moving Cake]
Sweet, rich, with a bit of everything
If you are ever in Slovenia, Prekmurje region, you need to have it
Bled cream slice
Not something I'd like to prepare at home, the custard is fussy and loves to remain too soft for cutting - but on the other hand, home-made usually have more intense yolk flavour, which is absolutely delicious
We also have mulled gin
I think that's a thing in most (colder) countries, no
Same here in Slovenia
A lot of houses use wood as their primary source of heating, it's more common in rural areas
In cities they mostly use other sources I think
In Slovenija it's very common
Not just in villages, but also in small towns
I think it's the most common form of heating
Yes
Pretty common I would say
Especially in rural areas, where people also own forests, and they cut wood for their own use or for selling
Lately are popular also other types of heating with wood like woodchips or pellets
Tokyo, Sapporo, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Kyoto, Suzuka, Osaka, Fukuoka, Yokohama, Nagoya
Not that many
tokyo,
kyoto,
sapporo,
osaka,
hiroshima,
nagasaki,
blanking out after that, all i can think of is famous tokyo centers like shibuya, akihabara etc
In Slovenia that honor would go to Ivan Lotrič.
Documentaries in here only have a narrator, not really a presenter talking to the camera
Lotrič has probably the most iconic voice among all Slovenes
Here's a trailer for a random documentary where you can hear him
Janša definitely
Not just right now
He also has that loyal 20% that always love him though
I would say our prime minister, Janez Janša. There are big protests right now against his goverment
Janez Janša, our current extreme far right PM
We've been having **massive** protests against his fascist-like power grab, his extreme anti-environment policy, his anti-democratic constitution amendment and his illegal pandemic profiteering (and also against capitalism in general) in many cities across our country for weeks, and the number of protestors is only increasing every week
For sure it's our prime minister
Basically our originl PM stepped down right before corona came so we ended up with an extreme right government most people did not want, just as corona hit
While obviously an early quarantine is necessary, they took advantage if that for their personal gain and to wage war with the press
They're funded by Orban and there was supposed to be an investigation in to that but of course they sabotaged it
Not even hiding any of this really
Then there were a few whistle-blowers that exposed corruption, which started huge protests which are still going on every friday
The PM is insulting the protesters, trying to minimise their numbers and so on
He's a much more thought out speaker than Trump but is basically copying the alt-right rulebook insulting, lying, playing victim, etc
If he is the most hated, could we guess that PIS will lose elections soon
Or not
What is the zeitgeist there
Are there enough people fed up of them
He has way less than 20% supporters but they are die hard voters
Problem is overall low voting turnout which enabled him victory
Dealing with latest COVID-19 crisis also brought him some positive points but not enough to not remain the most hated
Well that feels a bit weird because in Slovenia we have this kind of social measure (called "children's addition") since when I remember, probably it existed even in Yugoslavia
Not sure how much is it, but parents get a certain amount of money per year for each kid younger than 18
Maybe just people have to get used to this being a normal social right, then in the long term they will start seeing the bullshit that they are doing
P.s. I'm very worried about the election frauds you are mentioning, this is not something that should continue on uncontested
Oh, now I pretty much understand why are they so powerful
Thanks for the insight
Well, in Slovenia after the breakup of Yigoslavia we adopted capitalism, but our early governments took a very gradualist approach to the transition
I still think that much too many excellent things for communism were dismantled (especially the healthcare insurance system, the urban planning system and housing system), but we actually did retain a solid social security system all over this period
Ironically, here it was the opposite, more the parties leaned to right-wing and catholic, more they were neo-liberal
At least until recently
Now now, that was a common Balto-Slavic endeavor, and Romanians and Hungarians helped too
Everyone does that
I meant dumping people, who aren't wanted locally anymore into Brussels
Ideally, nobody would fear the EU because we'd use military might to crush them
Ideally, they'd fear the EU because we wouldn't HAVE TO use military might to crush them, because a crushed economy is every bit as painful
When I saw the Norway flair I didn’t even bother to read the comment
The language between places like Croatia, Bosnia and Serbia is the same, or at least super duper similar
If you asked me what the difference is, I wouldn't be able to tell you and if you speak one you speak the other
Slovenian is the least similar, because its influenced by German and even Italian for a bit
And if I had said that in public I would be beaten to a pulp on the very spot
(If someone wants to correct me, fell free
> Extremely prominent macho culture (except maybe in Slovenia)
Where does Montenegrin wife hide money from drunken husband - under the shovel
Where does Bosnian wife hide money from drunken husband - In a book
Where does Slovenian wife hide money from drunken husband - She puts it on the table and says touch it if you dare
> Governments whose core base of voters are fanatic pensioners who rise in 7 AM to vote while healthy young people sleep until noon, wake up and see that it's a bit rainy today, and decide not to vote
Yes
> obsession with betting shops
I don't think we have that here
> We're freaking tall
Very tall
Not us
We're average
> very similar cuisine and love of rakija
Not us
Yeah, bread is eaten with everything even things like pasta
Edit: not in Slovenia tho
Slovenian is different than Serbo-Croatian for the same reason Polish is not the same as Czech
It's not the same language, not because of foreign influences
Our closest language relative is the kajkavian dialect found in Croatia and we have much fewer problems understanding it compared to standard Serbo-Croatian
What
Slovenian isn't different due to German and Italian influence
Some parts of Slovenia use many words borrowed from German and Italian but that's not the same
No, not us
Our hard liquor is called žganje or sometimes  šnops in colloquial Slovene
nope
We say it "sirov burek"
I went for čevapi last week and saw zeljanica on the menu
I thought it was burek with cabbage but it's actually burek with spinach
Does burek with cabbage exist
Yes
> even things like pasta
that can't be true
Perhaps, I've got no idea how Croatian varies region by region
But I imagine that North-Eastern Slovenian, with a heavy country accent, would be very hard to understand
Hell, even I have a hard time understanding it
We also dislike the Turks, that one's pretty true
Making "žganje" is still very popular
I've never heard anyone coloquially say just žganje, except if they meant hard liquor in general
Mostly we have šnops
But you can also have travarica, borovničke, limonovc, medica ect
But then again, I'm from Savinja valley, so I can speak just for us
Serbia has one of the largest civilian firearm ownership rates in the world
Many people like weapons and there is nothing wrong with that *per se*.
I believe there is much more love but hate is something that sells at better price, being in the politics or on media
Wait aren't you in Argentina
My classmate in high school (his parents are from Bosnia I think) once brought burek with cabbage to school but said it's called pita
same for us, same for us
I think here in Slovenia, when couple is arguing, it is quite similar to Albania, man has the last word, although here the last word is "Yes dear"
It is
You are normal
Bread does not go with anything
Well nor does it go with filane paprike or sarma, but oh well
Why exactly do we dislike Turks
I never even heard anyone mention Turks in this kind of way
But so is in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Slovakia
Žganje is not the same as rakija
Žganje is official word but like you said šnops/šnopc is colloquial or even more precisely you call the liquor by the name it's made which what you said
In Bosnian bakery I received odd look with sayin "Pečen je bolji" baked is better
That's why I was confused
Zelje here is cabbage
The menu said 'špinača' which is 'spinach', maybe it's blitva (chard)
Yes, my co-worker who has family in Bosnia told us we have to order 'pita' not burek when we went on a trip to Bosnia
And in some places you have to order 'domača kava' in others it's ok to say 'turška kava'.
Turkish invasions in the 14th century made them a traditional bad guy in folk tales and bedtime stories so it carried on
Martin Krpan is a classic example
And what exactly is the difference
The user you replied to is Serbian so "who likes guns" sounded like you were trying to imply it wasn't widespread
Do you dislike gun culture or "American gun culture" (for lack of a better word, most Americans are responsible with their weapons)
Switzerland also has a rich gun culture and so does the Czech Republic
I feel like its more of a meme among young people, because we actually have nothing to do with the past politics
But some elders are still very sensitive when it comes historic events
Yes
But this is 21st century
I have never heard anyone say they dislike Turks because of what happened 5-6 centuries ago
How it's made and strength I think
I don't remember Eurokrem from when I was a kid but all chocolate spreads were called 'eurokrem'. We had Viki krema, with a little Indian
I have no idea what that is
It's not like we rationally hate the people now, obviously we moved on from it but I've personally never heard anything good about the Turks growing up
It's always "the guys who raided us" or "the guys who enslaved hundreds of thousands of our people" and so on
Hence you get the affinity to dislike them even though you've never met one of them
It's basically the same thing
It a broad term for alcohol beverages from different fruits
Oh, I missed that part about "we all". I understand now
I disagree on the last part, though
My co-workers stock up on rakija every time we go on a trip down south
My friend who has family in Bosnia insists rakija is differnt and stronger than šnops you get here
But I don't drink alcohol so can't speak from my experience
Rakija also has more tradition attached to itself than šnops here in Slovenia, I think
But what kind of bread
Garlic bread
-Sure, just regular bread
-Hell no
And what kind of spaghetti
With ragu sauce
-Hell no
Aglio e olio
-Yes
Just no
I haven't really had a culture shock while travelling inside Slovenia because it is so small
But I mostly am shocked by some phrases people from Primorska (the sea region) say
Like we say it is half seven (like in German, it means at 6
30), and they say at six and a half
I know it's really minor but it's fascinating to me
There are also some other words, but then again you could say that for any other dialect here aswell
Maybe
But also I never noticed that and I go to the sea side in Croatia every year, guess I don't pay enough attention
Really
In German class we learned that 6
30 is halb sieben
I just checked in my German book just in case I was wrong but that's how they taught us
Also like that 6
45 is Viertel vor 7 or something like that
And 6
35 is fünf nach halb 8
Well yes in English it would sound very weird to say half seven but in Slovenian to most Slovenians it sounds weird to say 6 and a half
Depends on the language, like in German you also say halb sieben, not sechs und halb
Pretty sure that's the influence of Italian, since Latin languages do X and a half IIRC
That could be it yes, our Primorci are influenced by Italians a lot
Yes, I'm sorry, I missed the also when I read your first comment, my bad
I meant half past seven yes, I'm sorry for the mistake
Yeah in some more inland places it's like that as well, but always in regions that were under Italy before
Suppose this mystery is cracked heh

"Govorim kitajsko

Meaning "Are you listening to what I'm saying
In Slovenia also
Horse burgers are a thing
Extremely common here too, unfortunately
But
but babysnatchers
The only thing I know of is [this] [Here's] another link, if that one's geo-blocked
[This] is not a ducumentary, but it's all you need to know about Slovene's.
edit: there's also [this] but it can't be found anywhere online and it's only in Slovenian
We learn the quadrille dance as well
It's part of matura dance performance we do for parents in last year of elementary and high school
I remember a similar nail game when I was a kid attending 'village games'. But there was no drinking connected to the game itself as they were already drunk at that point
They had to hit the nail with the narrower part of the hammer
We have this [doll shit] as well but for every round or 18th birthday
Also putting up a [may pole] for any gender or a [giant flower] for women
There's a 'surprise party' when they come to put the pole up
Then it has to stand for 50 days if the person is celebrating is an Abraham, 40 days if he/she is 40 and so on, before they come clean it up with another party
Well, is the matura dance really "for parents"? I thougt it was more like a fun last evening with your schoolmates
But yeah, the quadrille is insanely popular if you think about it, I danced it on like 4 seperate occasions the year I finished high school
My mom almost got strangled by a drunk parkeln (krampus) when she was a kid
Četvorka
It's just a translation of quadrille, I guess
We also sing Gaudeamus igitur
Yeah drunk krampuses can act like a bunch of hooligans since they are masked and thus unreckognisable
I know a guy whose car and frontyard got destroyed by a bunch of drunk krampus guys
We sing it at the beginning of 'maturantski ples' in high school
It kinda is but they can get very scarry because they kinda grawl and whip heavy chains around
Also because they are masked and braver they sometimes try to i guess flirt with women but in an agressive way
like I’m gonna take you away missy cuz you’ve been very very bad

I don’t know for me it’s a silly tradition because the little ones are very scared of them and I don’t know why they should be

I like Austrian ones, especially the one from [Graz]
Our Slovenian plates are rather boring, but our military plates I find really cool
They're white text on camo background: [Example one] [example two]
Oh yeah hehe
Here in Slovenia, it has happened before that hooligans from Ljubljana intentionally scratched cars with plates from Marbor(and the other way around)
I mean, I agree but how exactly would Venice benefit *financialy* by curbing tourism
Due to greater exclusivity (and thus price) or what
decent politicians
How do you pay now with Corona
They keep repeating here to us to use contactless cards when paying
Most companies disabled 'pay when you get it' option when ordering on line
Never seen one
Janša save us
If I remember correctly, I was taught Z with line in primary school, but we were told you can do either
I believe I gave it up as soon as we got a different teacher
I kept the line over 7 for longer though, because it was better for making it obviously different from letters
My handwriting is nothing to be proud of
Almost no one has a second name in slovenia
For example in my class of 32 only 3 have a second name
However lately a lot of wanna be posh people give their children 2 names, as if they were of blue blood, though their parents most likely still live on a farm
There's a difference
People in Slovenia can have 2 first names, but it's not an actual middle name
Lately
2 first names aren't a new thing (Example: Ana Marija was *very* common around 1940) and it's not a "posh" thing either, it's just a thing
I would know, I have 2, but am quite far from posh (we also don't live on a farm)
What's the point of having two names , when usually people with 2 names only use 1
None of the people i know with two names use both
Bolting out of restaurants/cafés after 2 hours max
In Slovenia, we can stay at a café/restaurant for *hours* and the staff won’t bother us
The longest I spent at a café was about 5 hours
My town doesn't have much

[Celjska koča] ) (Celje hut) is nice
And then there's [this Space center] in a little nearby village
In Slovenia I think the nicest buildings are kindergartents
I would forcibly move people from different countries into different countries
So you're saying everyone wins
> Education, definitely not
If you mean elementary and secondary, I agree
Tertiary is already pretty much there, though, with mutual recognition of degrees
> Tax havens would be eliminated by a minimum tax level everyone has to pay
Already exists
Check Ireland's corporate tax rate to find out what it is :P Also, I'd be against raising that minimum
As for personal income tax rates - I'd agree, however the limit should be based on the GDP / capita of the state
Thus, Bulgaria would be able to have a much lower minimum tax rate than Sweden, because otherwise you kill poorer countries with the brain drain even more than already
> Welfare would be member state level but work enforced minimum levels, backed by transfers bwtween member states when necessary
I agree this would be nice, but it wouldn't work
What's considered welfare in Sweden is higher than the minimum wage in Slovenia, and Slovenia is right at the limit of becoming a net contributor to the EU budget, so many countries are waaay worse off
What we'd need is for the richer countries to help make poorer countries places where people don't want to leave instead of throwing some money at them and attracting all the especially high-skilled workers
Is that a hard proposition
Absolutely
But that's the only way
> Corruption would have both member state level and EU level courts to hold both states and individuals accountable
Just EU level please
I don't see a problem with the monarchy actually
The Queen would just be the representative of the UK state instead of of the UK member state
Same thing
Random thought - is the Queen actually a citizen in the strictest legal sense
Because I know she doesn't have a passport or driving license for example, since they're issued in her name
Would citizenship work the same
And by that logic, if she is, is she also a citizen of Canada
> and a federation of regions rather than countries
This ^
People use the word federation because they think it sounds cool, but they don't really understand the meaning thereof
That's why you get paradoxes like claims that an European Federation will be ruled from Brussels, everyone will be the same, culture will vanish etc
I mean, Brexiteers are proven right in 1 out of all of their points - not sure that would heal the political divide, but at least they'd get 1 thing right and have that bit of moral justification to drag the UK out
Finns are similar to Danes, who are similar to Germans, who are similar to Austrians, who are similar to Slovenians, who are similar to Croatians, who are similar to Serbians etc
It's all a continuum, based on which border of a country you're standing next to
Also, if you travel outside of Europe at all, you'll know that once you're coming back from Asia, landing in London, Athens, Lisbon, Warsaw, Frankfurt or Vienna all feels like coming home
The differences between European countries are negligible
We have dialects that are more different from each other than Slovenian is from Croatian, for example
And the average Slovenian understands English better than plenty of our dialects
The food between the northeast and southwest of Slovenia is as different as the food between Italy and Poland, and we're tiny
If you're talking differences in mentality, however, the major difference I could spot while traveling all over the continent has been that only Germanic nations have this major superiority complex towards everyone else
But we still love you, so, see, anything can be overcome ;)
> The EU they wanted to remain in wouldn't exist anymore
Well, the EU the Brexiteers want to leave has never existed either thus far, and yet that doesn't seem to stop anyone on that side
Serbians and Croats (or US and UK or the various nordic combos of former empires) not working out just goes to prove that differences and similarities mean nothing
It's all about what people want or don't want, and those wants and don't-wants often have nothing to do with similarities
That's true, but the point is that their point not really existing usually doesn't stop believers in whatever
No, it proves that propaganda is what means the world
Variety can be society-enriching or society-destroying, depending on which side has the better propagandist
But what both sides have in common is that it's not their stance but rather the propagandist's skill which determines if their stance is deemed right by their audience
> This is why, as regards peace-making, the singularly most effective piece of construction is not, and has never been, the bridge
It has always been the wall
The EU itself is proof that that's not true, considering we're living in the longest period without a major war in Europe in history
Also, what you're saying is precisely the point
Little city states of what was essentially the same people from our modern point of view fought over trivial differences, throughout history, and it was because the leader of one managed to convince his followers that they're better than the other, which made them want to conquer the inferiors
On the other hand, comparative megastates like Germany, which were historically a bunch of bickering little kingdoms, are now one people, which even YOU treat as a "uniform" people, which is not even close to true in this conversation
It's all about propaganda
Always has been
With the right propaganda, you can split the same people down the middle and amplify their differences to the point where you get a civil war
On the other hand, with another kind of propaganda, you can unite everyone, despite the huge differences
I guarantee you, that if China were to somehow manage to invade the US, gangbangers and the police, blacks and whites and everyone else would quickly set aside their differences, to go fight them
Unless the Chinese propaganda managed to convince one side that they came to liberate them from the oppressors, for which there's plenty of precedent as well
All
Propaganda
Yugoslavia went from brotherhood and unity to genocide in 40 years, just because the propaganda machine changed
Africans went from "fellow unaligned" to "unwelcome immigrants" in former Yugoslavia in 30, because the propaganda machine changed
The best trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he doesn't exist
And the best thing propaganda ever pulled is making people believe they are immune to it
We already have a Disney princess
Twitter princess:
We did, in primary school already (not a lot though, just basic info)
There was a picture in our student's book: a long line of guys on the skis, in white clothes and guns which said "Finnish rush to the front". I really enjoyed the pic for some reason
Teachers, kindergarten teachers, police, those municipal people who give you parking tickes (I don't know what they're called in English),
public administration
basically all public services apart from nurses and firefighters
Even doctors are disliked when they want higher wages
Lots of backslash against teachers and kindergarten teachers atm, because they're staying home right now, even though they're forced
Office workers as well
When a bunch of Viola fans some equipped with plastic toy guns established Stajrska varda
In Slovene media they went mostly as a joke
but in foreign they took them more seriously
They're a joke, a bunch of too fat or too thin bored old men but there's nothing jokey about their mental state and what they're doing
Exactly
How many people heard about the recent kidnapping of a Gypsy girl in Serbia
Not so many
But they are fueled by foreign news agencies as ours mostly ignore them
If it would remain with only first report about them, joking them, I doubt they would still exist
where is cheese spread
Idk, they're not very bright people, all logic fails with them
I think them feeling important and tough is enough to fuel them
Ah we don't have this brand :D . those guys are football club supporters, the name viola is from color violet, color that players of FC Maribor are wearing on home matches
Insulted people from other ex-Yugoslavian countries (as a joke, of course)
Been envious of my neighbours
Been absolutely thrilled when a foreigner tried to speak Slovene (and butchered it royally)
Gotten drunk at a wedding and got into a fight
Could't be prouder right now
Keep up the good work, prjatu
I'd probably have to say Russian
Somehow always seems poetic in a very strange way and just sounds beautiful
Italian for me
English, but the northern dialects like Geordie or Scouse
the only ones I hear run this joke in the ground are usually 4chan nationalists
I tried it to learn German and and the beginning it was fun and I learned some basic vocabulary but then it just kept repeating so it got boring and I didn't see I would be learning more
It was kind of focused on the articles and not much else
I think if you really want to learn it, Duolingo will take you ages to do so
A lot of commenters said cigarettes but no one said alcohol which is just odd to me
Alcohol is almost or even just as bad as cigarettes, and I bet most of the people who said cigarettes should be illegal drink alcohol but wouldn't want it to be illegal
Yes, cigarette littering is an issue, but drunk people driving is an issue aswell
In Slovenia, you are allowed 0
5g of alcohol per kg of blood (i hope i said that right) but that regulation imo does nothing
People still drink and drive, thinking they're okay to drive but then cause accidents
Smoking is prohibited in public indoor spaces, and should be more regulated outdoors aswell (special spots for smokers separate from non-smokers) but alcohol should be completely prohibited for drivers
Alcohol also does a lot of harm to your body (just like cigarettes) and therefore they are likely just as bad as eachother
I am a smoker and I drink alcohol on occasion, but I think both should be more strictly regulated
It would also result in more black market activity-esentially giving drug lords a new task-selling tobacco and alcohol
Exactly my point
Everyone has so much problems with us smokers but no one would like to admit how awful alcohol is
That's exactly how it is
Haha i met an older guy from Scotland in a hotel who told me his name was "Wallen", after three days i realised his name is actually William
Hold up
You congradulate the family as well
Does this end at some point
Like when the "kid" is 18 or does it go on forever as long as the family is present
Thank you for the explanation
Yeah, the cat version is popular in Slovenia as well
Yes
Hiking is very popular in Slovenia
We are not that organized as you are and our parkings are not so neat and full of information
Our parkings close to hiking trails look like [this] although in some popular places there might be [official parking]
No, no official signs
In some cases there is only a sign for parking in others nothing
We actually have amazing page hribi
net where many hiking trails are described and you can see photos from the trail from start to finish with parking included
In Slovenia we mostly have UK or Scandinavian films
Also very common are Czech or Slovakian films
But we also have movies from other countries
There are not so much Slovenian tho
From the last decade
I find the baguette, wine and stripped shirt stereotype kinda funny in a satirical way, but that cheese-eating surrender monkeys stereotype is insanely stupid and makes anyone spewing it look like a bloody idiot
If you were surrendering, cowards, [this] nor [this] nor [this] nor [this] would happen, and the list goes on
Hell, I'd say French involvement was decisive for the Allied Victory on the Western Front

Hearing some nice German song gets me in the mood for learning it

That one counts

Haven't heard this one about Slovenes from foreigners yet, but some of us do think of Slovenes as serfs (a writer Ivan Cankar wrote about it in a satire "Hlapci")
If it's sunny and no wind even 10 °C can be enough for a T-shirt, although I feel more comfortable if it is at least 12
If it's windy or cloudy then about 15 would be enough
As for shorts, 4 °C is enough - usually you don't get that cold in legs as in arms
About 20 degrees at the lowest if the weather is nice and sunny
The leader of yugoslavia in ww2 who was born in our country
Josip Broz Tito
No Vlad Tepes
Edit: oh yes he is there the Impaler
He was born in Kumrovec present day Croatia, but to many he is still our hero
The other hero would be [Rudolf Maister]
I would say we also consider our poets and writers as heroes
> Ante Pavelic ... Josip Broz Tito
Interesting choice from the same poster, I would understand Gotovina and Pavelic, or Tito and Gotovina but not all three on the same time
He is more famous as that guy from Transylvania
Well
now you know  ^we ^need ^more ^land :)
Cmon man he was half slovenian
We have nobody else
Yea but as far as i know he was half slovenian
Mostly yes with nostalgia but there is still huge part that considers him as a villain, it is more on a family division in WWII
Jap that's the one, you know the Balkan no blood no fun
Well depends on the point of look for us he was a hero for you he probably wasn't
I would disagree
I questioned multiple people who were alive in his times and all of them jump to the answer "yes, I respect him", but talking further a lot of people admit he wasn't really an admirable person
It's true though - many people are nostalgic about Yugoslavie, but they do know it had it's (many) faults
Mostly
I'd say we are neatly divided into two halves over this issue
> with equal rights
not what we are thought, but every story has multiple points of views
> a kind of mini federalization within a federal state
At that time it was decided that Maribor would be part of Germany (Austria), so this federal state would most probably be inside German sphere, as Maribor was predominantly German town
The problem was that surrounding area, villages, were exclusively Slovenian that Maister tried to include in Yugoslavian land
Bloody Sunday, that is called in Austria, was never thought here in school happened 2 months after liberation/occupation of Maribor when "angry mob" supposed of 10
000 people tried to take control of a city hall while there were talks inside about drawing the borders between two states
Exactly
Here he is a hero through and through who won us half of our country
Living at home for long periods of time, proper healthcare, indoor smoking, public drinking, traditional music, tiny shitty cars
What more
Aldi (Hofer in our case) is much much better than Lidl
I don't understand people loving Lidl so much
Eh, we have farmers who like to shit on us "city folk" and talk how better they are then people who live in cities and how stuck up people in cities are
For reference the "city" that I live in is a town of 10k people
It's a thing in Slovenia
If you pass your driving exam on an automatic you are only allowed to drive automatics
If you pass on a manual you can drive both
Ohh sorry, didn't think about that
Yes, definitely however, to imply that we were that much different is stupid considering the town was 10k pop
All the kids grew up playing in the mud or in the woods and most kids helped tending vegetable paches
While you didn't need a tractor for that you still experienced how nature looks like
There were also pastures all around and famers would still say that we don't know how a cow looks like which is silly
If you have a bigger city those arguments could make sense but in a town that small literally everyone has ties to some sort of farming, even if on a smaller scale
In Slovenia, the Ljubljana dialect sounds so ridiculously anglicized to everyone else, that the stereotypical parody phrase in it is:
"Sem dogija na wok v siti tejku"
Sem - I have
dogija = doggie (phonetically + case ending)
na = for a
wok = walk (phonetically)
v = in to
siti = city (phonetically)
tejku = take (phonetically + past-tensified the Slovenian way)
Realistically though, the one word that's omnipresent and confuses many a native English speaker who stumbles across it - "full" meaning very
"Full cool" would be an a bit outdated but standard example of that (means very cool - epic)
The rent
Having a dedicated "workbook" next to a normal textbook and a plain book for many subjects
It is just an extra book that is often not very good at all and many teachers almost didn't use it even though we had to buy it as a part of our lessons
Most of the stuff that workbooks have can be easily done in normal plain books and with help of powerpoints and internet today I think they are obsolete
- In my opinion and from what I know too much homework
Especially for younger kids who have to be kids after school, not sit behind books
When I was growing up I felt that we had just a right amount, but I think things are different now
- All the books, handbooks and other equipment (including school bags, notebooks, pencils and so on
) is what parents have to pay and every year children have to get new equipment
It gets really pricy
Of course children also have to carry all that to school - not good for their backs at all
- Otherwise I like how students can chose from many languages beside English
Therefore many learn German, Italian, French, some schools have Spanish and Russian too
We loved planting [drawing pins] on each others chairs in school, extra points if you planted it while everybody stood up when the teacher entered the classroom
When the class started we made shooting tubes out of pens, and made loads of tiny paper rolls for the ammunition, for the improved version you rolled them in your mouth and then shoot from the mouth and they sticked to the surface
In between classes knuckles was a popular game, thanls for reminding me about the rules (spinning the coin, if you blew it you got slammed from everybody in the circle)
I usually go with tounge twisters, because then our language sounds very hard to learn (which it actually is) and it gives them a perspective of how it sounds
Some tounge twisters is slovenian language:
"Pešec čez cesto, v stož'ce, po rož'ce
"Pikčasta ptička v pikčasti kletki
"Če čebula ne bi imela če bi bila bula
There are a lot more, but I can't remember them now
That won't work with us, hehe
>:)
Pešec pešači čez pešaško cestišče got them like: Holy shit say that again
Oh my God, I can barely even say that hah
>"Zanimljive geografije" (interesting geography)
We call it *črkarija* which is hard to translate directly, but would mean something like "the letter game". It's great for kids so they can learn about countries, cities etc
It's also a great game for young adults to play at 3:00 in the morning when they are shitfaced
Or maybe it's just retards like me and my friends
My girlfriend says they have those snails in kindergartens here as well
And a board game where you have to pick up fruit from trees and some others, possibly by the same brand
Brno was a popular new year party destination a decade ago for many Slovenian students
I don't know, Brno is the second town when I think about Czechia, right after Češke Budjevice
I probably can’t compare us to other foreigners as we are your neighbors and Klagenfurt(or Celovec as we call it) is very close to the border but pretty much everybody knows about it
Villach(we call it Beljak) is also very known here(beside Graz)
And there is a bunch of [motorway signs ] it all around Ljubljana
> he would think of Prague
I don't know why Prague, as a capital, is not first think when thinking about Czech towns, could be because I had never visit it, even if someone ask me what is the capital of Czechia I would need a second or two before answer Prague, while Brno and few others I could fire in a sleep
Avstro-Ogrska
Avstro-Ogrska (Ogrska reffering to another name for hungarians- Ogri, coming from tribe of Avari that settled Hunagry)
Avsto-Ogrska
> keisarikunta
I can't be the only one who read this as Kaisercunt
Veverica
Veveritsa in English I think
Same in slovenian -- Veverica
Considering that EU member states can't handle their own trade stuff, I wonder what would happen if an EU MS did just that
Would PoC break trade relations with all of the EU
Private tutors normally just help students with bad grades and are normally just some university students or older students from higher classes
Special entry test before university are only for certain faculties like architecture, film, art and for these faculties some students visit classes to prepare for entry tests
They're sold on normal shelves in stores but pretty sure everyone puts them in a fridge at home
My grandma keeps her fresh eggs from her chicken in a cold pantry room but if she brings them in the kitchen she puts them in a fridge
I've always wondered why they have them on the shelves outside of fridge in the stores-maybe that's where the rep comes from
I always keep mine in the fridge
WWII partisans or home guards
Gay marriage
Stupid because it shouldn’t even be a topic
Why should people have the power to prevent marriage between two consenting adults
Everybody here writes about silly food names or tiny linguistic details, but Slovenians still have too much WW2 baggage
It is a political divide
SDS our currently largest party with most seats in parliament, is always in opposition, members are mostly descendants of WWII home guards and Nazi who wants justice for post WWII killings, condemning the post WWII government etc
While other side are mostly pro partisans, as it brings more votes, but are divided in smaller fractions
Well I agree with them that mass graves should be investigated and mortal remain buried with dignity but then history should be left to historians
It is to much smaller degree than in Spain
Our right wing SDS has probably support of less than 10% eligible voters while central and lefties are fragmented
So with low voters turnout those 10% are enough that they become winner of election but still without the possibility to go into coalition with any other party to form a government they are doomed to be in opposition until voter turnout fails even more
Now in corona times I travelled across a good part of central Europe by train
I travelled a few times from Ljubljana to Prague (about 14h), from Prague to Krakow (about 8h I believe) and even from Prague to Gdansk (14h) and every time it was cheap and comfortable
At least from my experience, the Czech Railways are a great and cheap company so whenever I will go back to these countries, I will go by train
In the future, I hope I will still be alive to see a huge transeuropean rail network of fast trains
If that existed, I think a lot more people would rather pick a train than an airplane
Happy cakeday
You learn it as a kid
We even had to bring bicycles to kindergarten because we had a booklet with activities we had to do
I think they still do
Usually by the time you go to school you're supposed to ride without those little wheels
I figure it still depends on the town/village and on the family
My nephew (a more recent addition to the nation) started with one of those pushbikes that don't have pedals and was confidently tearing up any terrain with a proper BMX by the time he was 3 and a half, whereas I learned at 9 or 10, I think
Didn't have a bike to learn on till then
That was a few decades ago, however
My schoolmate could kinda drive a tractor by then :D (I grew up in the capital, she did not)
Don't you have to get a bike license in like 5th grade of school
I know our school did it
I mean yes, it's national
Everyone does it
Austrians - Jodlarji - Yodelers
Italian - Makaronarji - Macaronis
Croatians (HRvaška) - HRčki - Hamsters
Hungarians - nothing - no one cares about Hungary
Less a nickname, and more outdated names: Italians are Lahi (I don't know etymology, sadly)
And Hungarians are Ogri (also Vogri in various dialects), this is even reflected in our name for Austria-Hungary, which isn't Avstro-Madžarska (Madžarska being our modern name for Hungary), but Avstro-Ogrska instead
I think that Ogri comes from bastardisation of German Ungarn, which is just German for Hungary/Hungarians
I'd add Švabi for Austrians/Germans and Lahi for Italians, though these are a bit older
Don't you call them serbs
Pederi
Hmm
What happened to alpski Srbi
Bećki konjušari
C'mon, no need to keep those silk gloves on neighbor, it's all for science
We call the germans "Švabi" as well
> Slovenians: outdated "Windische" because of a) the hill range "Windische Bühel" in the (back then) Inner-Styrian language border/language mixing zone and b) Slovenian was called "Windisch" >100 years ago)
Nowadays there's no nicknames afaik, maybe "little Austria"?
Just as a bit of cultural/historical knowledge - the term "Windisch" was used by the Nazis during WW2 to mean Slovenian the same way the N-word was used by plantation owners to mean black
Plenty of connotation there, so if by some weird coincidence you're ever around a really old Slovenian person and the topic comes up, you may wanna skip saying that one
Most people <40 would likely never have heard of that though, if their grandparents weren't ww2 storytellers
> Slavic people in general: "Tschuschen". It has a south Slavic origin
Either from "čuješ" ("do you hear
") because of gastarbeiter in the 19th century on the A-H railroad or from "ćuš" which was an incitement word for pack animals in Bosnia(?)
The origin through "čuješ" would be super interesting, considering the word for Germans in Slavic languages derives from "nem" (mute)
I have only heard Švabi used for Germans
But yes, I only used less derogatory nicknames
There's also 'tati' or 'Hrvat je tat' for Croatians
I have never heard anything ill said about Hungarians
As soon as you stop lumping us together with the rest of 'Yugos'.
I've heard it used for German-language speakers, so technically even some Swiss would qualify
I've never seen anyone make a distinction between Austrians and Germans, when using such phraseology, TBH
Isn't the "Hrvat je tat" thing just a /r/Slovenia meme
O_o
Now I'm curious how come you guys need to have a special word for people who fucked the same woman
I mean, just how common is this O_o
Ščurek
Possibly since they don't walk with nationality written on their forehead lol
Possibly also true
I don't think I have heard that phrase in real life
Said the Hungarian to the Slovenian
Not even we need a word for that, and there's way fewer of us
We were supposed to go through the entire historical timeline both in primary and grammar school
Both times we spent so much time on Ancient History, the Middle Ages and the early modern period that we had run out of time by the time we reached the 20th century
In primary school I remember we had to know the three decisive battles: Stalingrad, El Alamein and Midway (even though it's bullshit)
It wasn't much better in grammar school for the regular part of the curriculum as we barely touched WW2
The exception were those of us who chose history for our *matura* (*Abitur*)
We had expanded classes
Two of the ten themes that year were WW2 in Slovenia and the political situation in the late 20th century so the curriculum was adjusted to that
We focused on the political aspect of the war both in Slovenia (the Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation with its political structure, Dolomite Declaration, formation of AVNOJ, collaborationist units and *de facto* civil war
) and worldwide (Atlantic Charter, Casablanca, Tehran, Yalta, Potsdam
Military operations and even the Holocaust were dealt with superficially just to give us a basic overview of what was going on
You could cram it all in one or two lessons
The Pacific Theater was barely mentioned
I believe it is telling that our teacher knew next to nothing about the military aspect or at least not much more than your average person
I remember learning about the Atlantic Charter, Yalta, Potsdam etc
in primary school but I was that kid who took part in competitions
What I absolutely didn't understand, though, is why we didn't learn more about the way the war had affected people
Why didn't teachers tell us about Slovenes who were sent to concentration camps
Personally, I think that's more important than the dates
Because someone decided ancient Sumeria and Babylon are more important than 20th cenutry history
Edit: We mentioned Rab and Gonars in grammar school
We don't really have much of anything else tbh :P
Battle of the Golden Spurs
The phrase was used to distinguish the Flemish from French but that was supposed to have happened before the battle
Pigeons really fell out of favour
You can find recipes to prepare them in old cookbooks, but I've never seen anyone prepare and eat them in my life
Ducks are common in the autumn
Geese are somewhat less common, but not unheard of
Quails are rare, you can only get them if you know someone who grows them or in some specialised shops
Quail eggs are quite popular though
Edit: just remembered - there is a running joke that you it's pigeon's meat in burek in Ljubljana and that is the reason they are not as common as they used to be
That would probably be [Trbovlje] hate to people from Trbovlje)
Very industrialized city
I can't think of many explicitly ugly cities, but Jesenice is the worst I've seen in Slovenia
[Here's an image i found online]
Jesenice, Velenje (although they're doing a lot to make it nicer), Nova Gorica
Metlika and especially Črnomelj haven't had any work done in decades
I've been this summer and I was extremely disappointed
Črnomelj is a hell hole, Metlika at least has some potential but it's still one big ruin
It's such an ugly sight driving towards Karavanke
Funny enough, [Nova Gorica ] was the “nicest” medium-sized town in 2018 and [Velenje] was the nicest bigger town in 2019
> najlepše **urejena** mesta
So - tidy
Still ugly imo
Velenje has a nice new promenade and the lake part is nice, I heard
But the last time I was in Nova Gorica there was nothing
Ugly commie blocks, casinos and nice looking houses
Still nicer than Črnomelj and Metlika though but those are a lot smaller
there is the dreaded dual female form
(slovenian has singular, dual and plural)
most people dont know if its correct to say "ali sta prišle" or "ali sta prišli" (did you two girls come)
a common mistake is writing "ne" (not/non/un
) together with "bo" (will be)
ex: danes me nebo (i wont be back today)
using "s" (with) incorrectly when there should be a "z" .  ex: grem s dvema prijateljicama (im going with two friends)
People don’t know how to use dual and just use plural instead
Pretty sad since we are one of the few languages that actually have dual
Also very common: *vredu* - meaning *good*, even though I know the right way to write it is *v redu* it would feel odd to do so in nonformal texts
Additionally, the literal translation of *v redu* is *in order*, so it shouldn't be that weird to write it like that (but it still is)
Also
Svoj/tvoj or svoj/moj (“svoj” is a reflexive possessive pronoun, used to stress when something is your/one’s *own* instead of using the regular tvoj (yours) or moj (mine))
So, saying “bring me your pen” should be “prinesi mi *svoj* kuli”. Your own pen
Using “kateri” instead of “ki”. Meaning “which”, “kateri” should only be used when “ki” makes the sentence ambiguous
But it sounds fancy and people like to use it
“Drevo, ki je padlo
” (a tree which has fallen) is correct
“Drevo, katero je padlo
” is wrong
Remember this shit, people
One example of ambiguity is “Srečal je prijatelja, ki mu je dal darilo”. (He met a friend who gave (had given) him a gift/whom he gave a gift”)
If it’s that person who gave the gift, use “kateremu je dal
”. If it’s the friend, use “kateri mu je dal
Another thing, making grammatical cases with foreign words
People like to put a dash (-) and put the (albeit correct) Slovene noun suffix after that
“That of Sydney” would incorrectly become “Sydney-ski” or “(I gave it) to John” “John-u”. We have rules for these
Correctly it’s “Sydneyjski” and “Johnu”. It’s not “Ferrari-ja” but “Ferrarija”!
Another case thing that grinds my gears is not properly declining foreign male first names and last names
So, so many people would say "Videl sem Chuck Norrisa" instead of "Videl sem Chucka Norrisa" (I saw Chuck Norris)
I saw this happen in a variant of BCS but I can't say BCS directly influenced this mistake in Slovene
Yet another bad mistake is people using the wrong pronouns: "za njega" (for him specifically) instead of "zanj" (for him), claiming they have never heard of the latter form
How they graduated high school is beyond me
Drkajva skupaj - Blades of glory
skupaj means together while drkati means to masturbate while less known meaning is to slide/skate on ice, the more common expression to slide on ice is drsati
So imagine my expression when looking trough TV schedule to find a family movie around noon called Let's masturbate together
Wait drkati also means to slide on ice
They don't teach us this in school
I looked it up in the [dictionary] and well, they could have used a better example
Sport commentator Stare when he heard that drkati is skating/sliding started to excessively use it, I remember something in this line "Look at Peter Prevc how beautifully he masturbates on in-run" or comment on football tackle "How great was this masturbation"
Stare is a legend but isn't ski jumping commented by Andrej Hofer
I'm quite sure it was Stare but could be someone else
It was few years ago when Prevc was on the top, I'm not sure if it was even Prevc or someone else from Slovenian jumpers, but he was really looking for every situation to say drkanje
Stare is 15 year old trapped inside a grown man's body
I remember now that Hofer is for Eurosong not for skiing
But I think there's 2 commenting
I know theres a woman and Stare perhaps
I think Jerkovič also comments but he's more serious and mostly for football
I see you've met the Bear Jew
Those windows are pretty much the norm everywhere in Europe
It's been this way more or less since I've been alive
Even in Slovenia, just a few years after getting our independence from Yugoslavia, those widows were already pretty damn common, though not as much as now(now, 99% of the widows are like that, in every house and institution, unless it's a REALLY old, non-renovated building with the original windows or something)
I don't think I've ever seen a window that doesn't open that way
Not all of them had a lever
Ours didn't but my school windows did and I was very confused at first
So how do you clean it
Smidi plays & tristano
What does Agadmator stand for
I remember him saying he will explain it eventually but I haven't seen every single one of his videos
Has he ever answered that question
Here it's very common
You normally greet someone you don't know with it
But for close friends its a bit different (at least as teenagers)
It like a hybrid between a handshake and a high five
We use it everyday
Hello there kindred spirit
I do the same, but I make it a bit more interesting for me by telling myself that I'm playing "god" and affecting their evolution with this
I like to imagine a snail giving thanks to "something" (me) for teleporting them across the road
Does Gotschee German count
We're barely even aware of it ourselves, I'd guess most don't know about it, and I wonder if anyone still speaks it
Then, there's a case for Prekmurje Slovene being its own language and not just a dialect, but that's rather disputed
It is however extremely different from standard Slovene and basically unintelligible
We do have Hungarian, Italian and Roma minorities as well (excluding recent, ie
last century immigrants from ex-Yugoslavia and elsewhere)
We only have one language (Slovenian) and it's pretty unknown to the the rest of the world, so I guess that counts
But Galician is, it's just not the same as Portuguese (anymore
There actually still is a small german minority in Slovenia, scattered around the country
But it is not officially recoginsed
Many Germans who lived in the slovenian part of Styria emigrated to either Austria or Germany between world wars, were forcefully moved, killed, or they slovenianised (I'm not even sure this word exists)
That's why you can still find a lot of german sounding surnames in Slovenia
Oh, and about the Gotschee Germans
They were moved to Germany during WWII by the Germans, because Gotschee region came under Italian rule
Some of them, who didn't want to move also joined Slovenian partisans
I really don't consider Turkey to be balkan or greece for that matter
Half of Zagreb is not even in the Balkans
If you're ever talking with a person from there, best stick to SE Europe
Westerners usually use "Balkan" in a derogatory manner, so it can trigger some nasty reactions
But other than that, as we say here in Slovenia, "Balkan" isn't a place, nor is it a thing
It's a state of mind
I think we're waay more balkan than turkey and greece though
Maybe I'm biased but I see us all being slavic and having cultural similarities
So I see Balkan as ex-Yu + Albania and Romania
Turkey and grece are I think not balkan at all
We are both way closer to let's say serbia, than I think we are to Greece
Romanians have slavic influence and it's heard in their language
So I see them as much closer to us that Greeks for example
Romanians have slavic influence and it's heard in their language
So I see them as much closer to us that Greeks for example
Most of my friends and family know only that EU exists and that is it
In person I maybe know 3 or 4 people that know anything at all about EU
As for general population I have no idea probably they do not know much
There are things we have to learn about it in 8th grade of *domovinska kultura in etika* (it gets renamed every couple of years and it's mainly about various religions, the workings of the government, courts, presidents, national assembly etc
but it also covers the EU ) and in High schools during sociology, but I don't know which specific parts are covered
In Bosnia you just jump on a tram or a trolley and pray that a controller doesn't catch you
Heh, I'm quite certain that people from Bosnia and Herzegovina will gladly specify on their own if they are Serbs or Croats
I, for one, haven't been to Prague, did visit Sedlec for the ossuary
Fascinating place, really
Most timezones
You sure russia doesn't have that
Edit: nevermind
My mind is blown and I regret saying anything
Also, celebrating New Years is a Scottish invention, apparently
I went for a trip to Edinburgh right on Jan 1 this year and people wouldn't shut up about that
Paddington it is then
Eh who cares, as long as I have pasta
Bread with pizza
Nooo
Bread with pasta
Ok, if there is a lot of left over sauce and the pasta is already eaten
Ski jumping is very popular here and a there’s a big fan base that is very passionate about it
Things can get pretty wild especially during the World Cup in Planica but there’s no violence
The only other sport that I can’t think of where things get pretty heated and violence may occur is ice hockey
For us Slovenes no matter what sport it is if we are good at we go crazy about it
But the only one that can turn violent is football and even that its because of the hooligans
I don't think people ever turn to mention-worthy amount of violence, but international winter sport events are big around here
Alpine skiing, cross-country skiing and ski jumps all draw drunk and loud crowds
Other sports generally get popular whenever someone or a team gets good
It cycles, there is cycling, basketball, handball, volleyball, hockey, sports climbing, athletics, gymnastics etc
We manage something attractive more or less every year
I actually hate the sport but really cringe when it's not called FOOTBALL
To answer your question, un alpine countries are pretty obsessed with skiing
#tinamaze
Oh got I never got that
Slovenians love it to but what is there to watch
Excuse me
Tina Maze
Sitting with the other Balkans, but not feeling very welcome there, therefore trying desperately to join the conversation with the other countries
Also failing to do that succesfully, so we're drinking a lot to compensate
This comment is still the most infuriating thing I have ever seen on reddit
Gay propaganda seems to be really strong there
A girl who went on Erasmus to Russia said she met a medicine student while she was there
He was almost done with school, like 4th year or something, and he believed homosexuality is a disease
It's not a pop song, but probably the best example for me is Hands Held High by Linkin Park
I started listening to them when I was 11 or so and I liked the song a whole lot even then, but my appreciation of it has gone _way_ up with age and as my English got better
I find it very relevant right now, too
For me it was Pink
I was listening to her when i was like 6 and when I looked back at 10 to songs like Clown House or something similar i was really suprised
I started learning English back in kindergarten, so most of song lyrics fall under "[mondegreen] and it sometimes took me years to finally realise what the lyrics actually are
The most egregious example was probably Blue Bayou, which my father titled on his mixtapes as Blue By You, and it took me like forever to realise it's not that
But I did have the similar experience to OP's just not with English
I was listening to Peste Noir, and while I don't agree with Famine's political leaning I really like his music
And the first album I really got into is entitled L'ordure A L'etat pur, and because my knowledge of French is like non-existent, I thought this meant something like The order of pure state or something, while it's actually something like Boils and zits (someone who knows French can correct me)
Also once I started reading the lyrics, it kind of turned out that they're pretty shallow and not as "deep" as I assumed they were
Taborniki (campers) and Skavti (scouts) were pretty popular in my youth
i occasionally see people wearing scout cloths around their necks so its definitely still a thing
Once per year dentist, once per year hygenist is the norm
For last two years, my dentist asked me to come more often to exchange the old fillings that were beggining to lost function
More or less all of our history
We do have some interesting bits that could be mentioned somewhere
Like aforementioned first anti-fascist movement outside Italy, or the fact our language is the first Slavic language to be written in karolingian minuscule (I know very specific)
And on more general history that we learn and others don't, I'm always wondering why isn't the HRE interregnum and the rise of Hapsburgs more widely known
Like there's tons of books and shows and stuff about War of the Roses, but I have yet to find one based on that, especially when it's even more "epic" and complex
Really
Cuz in slovenia germany/hre is talked about more than any other outside country
All of what you noted here we learn
We learn them (tho Venice mostly since it was here)
World cup tho
Thats true
It was officially abolished on constitutional level when we got our independence in 1991, but even in socialist Yugoslavia it was rarely practiced
The last execution was in 1959 and the last death sentence was given in 1980 (to the infamous serial killer Metod Trobec) but was later changed to prison time
I was referring to Slovenia only
I don't know the data for the other republics or Yugoslavia as a whole
In Slovenia, the less the locals have to think about what they're doing when you're around, the more accepted you'll be
Try pushing your culture on them, however, and there could be trouble, regardless of where you're from
Also, by pushing your culture on them I don't mean e.g. wearing a religious headdress or ethnic clothing but rather expecting them to change their behavior to be in line with what your culture demands
In a city, meh, you'll get a some glances if you're not a typical white dude/gal, probably occasional remarks, other than that, nobody cares
But in rural districts, picture that silence when a suspicious character enters a bar in a movie
That silence will follow you around until you meet and greet, better yet, buy a couple of rounds
But the village I grew up in, the entire region for that matter will never fully accept a stranger, even a fellow Slovene that moved from a different region
I mean, they won't shun you or make your life harder, but you'll always be a stranger
Seems to me that in Germany, black people are less looked down on than Slavs are though
Or at least comparatively
Or perhaps it's just that nobody wants to seem racist by using derogatory language for blacks but with Slavs it's normalized
From what I hear from a bunch of black Portuguese I trust, they're quite adamant that Portugal is racist AF towards people from former African colonies at the very least
I haven't spent a ton of time in Poland, but I did some, and as a Black Slovenian, I must say it didn't feel xenophobic in the least, save for some nonsense at the airport in Warsaw with the border police, but those are probably 50:50 to happen in just about every country
I'm curious - how do Slovaks view Slovenians
Since thinking about it, there literally isn't any stereotype about Slovaks we have here that I'm aware of
> Eastern Europeans, especially Poles and Croatians
Please don't use "Eastern Europeans" for those groups and in general for any EU country
It comes across to many as offensive and "othering" since the term itself doesn't fit in a cultural, historical, or geographical context and is usually used to delimit subjectively "better" vs "worse".
> but you'll always be a stranger
And this holds true regardless of whether you moved from one village over or from Timbuktu
> Eastern Europeans
Unless you're talking about Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarussians, please don't use that term to refer to anyone else, since they likely consider it offensive for a host of historical and cultural reasons and because it doesn't really make sense either
Sure, but I wouldn't consider that a negative or racism
Sometimes annoying or tiring, sure, but unless there's a feeling of superiority on their side, all good, and that I've never experienced
I won't speak for them but my guess is that they wouldn't consider a 50:50 Dane+Pole Danish either
> If you picked a Slovak a put him somewhere in Slovenia, if people were not taking, he wouldn't know he is in a different country
That (in reverse obvs) is precisely my impression of Slovakia
> Because let's be honest here for a moment - it's not a different country, it's just a trick we play on Hungary and Austria
Just a very-long-game pincer attack to encircle and crush them
It would actually be hilarious for Slovakia and Slovenia to start a joint tourism program where we'd confuse people into whether it's one or two countries and then have them visit both
> Czech Corridor
How have I never heard of this
Would've been neat if it had happened
> So almost like brothers
You might enjoy our linguistic brotherhood as well =) These are always interesting to read for the various Slavic language combos
Oh, please, do not apologize
I'm sorry if it came across that way, but it wasn't intended as chastising, just as pointing out something that isn't well-known in "the west".
For example that Yugoslavia was never behind the Iron Curtain, that it was invited to join NATO in 1953, which was refused because it didn't want to be too dependent on either side, and that the Yugoslavs could freely travel to both sides and the rest of the world and everybody could visit Yugoslavia, it having been one of the founding members of the Non-Aligned Movement
Or that Finland spent more time in history under Russia than e.g. Czechia did
Or that using Eastern Europe in general for most European countries that actually were part of the Eastern Block is kind of like using colonial names for modern-day countries that have long-since changed those when referring to them
I've created a series of maps that shows the various versions of what is/could be/should be considered "Eastern Europe" and why it doesn't make sense, so if you're curious, feel free to check them out [here]
Again, none of this is meant as a critique of you as a person, most people just never think about this, so I thought I'd start spreading awareness
Have a great Sunday evening
That's just the curse of being mixed with "lesser/better peoples" you aren't accepted in either group
/r/mixedrace understands
> What the hell is going on with vienna
City, river, potayto potahto :P
> otroci na cesti
I've heard about that one, it's always hilarious to hear xD
Our reverse is "fukati" - though that might be with Czech, I'm not sure
But I hear it means sth like to blow air up there and here it's, well, straight from English
I'm not sure about "jed" - it seems to me it could have a relation to "jedek/jedka/jedko" which means corrosive I think, basically which can hurt living tissue
That seems to be a sensible connection
Ahahah, dark, but hilarious :D
Do you know where šukat in Polish etymologically comes from
I can't seem to relate it to anything we have nor any German or English I can remember
In Croatian, apparently it means to row hard and fast, but that's the closest I got
Unfortunately no, both holidays fell on weekend this year, and they don't get transfered
Lmao, we have May 1st and 2nd as a May day holiday
We also have January 1st and 2nd as New years holiday
And then October 31st is Reformation day and November 1st is All saints day and December 25th is Christmas and December 26th is Independence and Unity Day
So we have 4 two day holidays
If I took a shower, let alone bathe, more than once a day in winter, I'd be as flaky as a flaky pastry
Gorenjska - jokes about stingy people
Dolenjska&Štajerska - jokes about drunk people
Prekmurje - jokes about how nobody understands their dialect
Ljubljana - People from there are known as Žabarji (frog men)
Primorska (litoral region) - I don't know about any jokes (but if they exist they must be weather related), but we are looked down on (especially northern part)
Koroška is also looked down on
These two last regions have bad roads and even worse railways, no highways (except south part of primorska) and are mostly very mountainous and have low population density
So probably not weird that we are looked down on
Primorska looked down upon
I've heard of us being lazy but more than anything we look down upon all others
We have the weather, the food, the wine, the sea, the mountains and a very good quality of life
Y'all wish you were Primorska
I also don't know if Primorska is looked down upon
I'd love to live anywhere in Primorska (Vršič -> Nova Gorica for the mountains and Soča, Vipavska Dolina for the vineyards, nature and the weather, and southern part obviously for the sea) and think the people (that I know) are just awesome and northern Primorska dialect is the best sound ever
Edit: I'm (sadly) not from Primorska, so not much bias there (I don't think)
Well, as far as I know, we were always considered to be provincial
Generally, everyone outside of the larger cities gets looked down on :(
Ljubljana: 286 745 (municipality: 295 504)
Maribor: 96 211 (municipality: 112 682)
Kranj: 37 941 (municipality: 57 065)
Celje: 37 872 (municipality: 49 540)
Ljubljana (290 000) - the capital city of Slovenia and basically the central hub
Unlike in many other countries (like the UK) where the capital has a reputation for being expensive, unfriendly and cultureless, Slovenia holds up only to the first point
It receives a lot of Slovene immigrants since other areas aren't doing that well
~~Trst~~ Maribor (96 000) - the second largest city
Although I know little to nothing about it, what I hear is that most people there are depressed
Can't tell doe
Although ot has a university, it's apparently not that great but, once again, can't say for sure
Kranj (38 000) - recently surpassing Celje, Kranj is the industrial city that every country has
Major factories like Iskra and Sava are located here
Most people there are generally quite friendly
However, the area is also full of immigrants so people there are quite
diverse
Idk, basically just a lot of Albanians and Bosnians
In Slovenia we have a mandatory vaccination program
The only optional one is for girls for HPV I believe
Historical ones, yes
- John Lackland = Ivan brez zemlje
- Richard Lionheart = Rihard Levjesrčni
- Charlemagne = Karel Veliki
- William the Conqueror = Viljem Osvajalec
- Henry VIII
= Henrik VIII
- Mary of England = Marija I. Tudor
- Phillip II of Spain = Filip II
- Charles I. = Karel I.
- James I. = Jakob I.
But we do not translate the recent ones
Prince William is not called Viljem, instead wr just use the original version of his name
Same with Queen Elizabeth, and Prince Charles
Nice list
But don't we say *kraljica Elizabeta*?
Agreed
Russia is awesome
The people are some of the nicest in the world, even if they don't speak one bit of English you will be able to have amazing talks as long as you're willing too
Also amazing history, tradition and just the huge scale of everything
Very safe as well - once we were approached by some drunk gopniks in the middle of the forest in the night, they wanted some beef at first but in the end we shook hands saying "Hello friend"! Awesome guys haha
Either Solze or Krst by Brezno
I personally prefer Solze but Krst is based on a famous Slovene poem (by the sam guy who wrote another poem that would later become the Slovene national anthem) which talks about the war between pagans and Christians during the expansion of Christianity in Europe
I spent some time in Belgium and I'm continually impressed how a government can be this complicated and still work
It was probably the hardest thing I attempted to understand during my exchange program (I failed, but I also didn't try very hard)
I mean, the organisation seemed pretty impressive
I got bureaucratic thing done in a day that would take weeks at home
Locals seemed above averagely happy with it (which is not a lot, but something)
That's close enough for the definition of 'works' I think
This is pretty impressive, true
But on the other hand, we spend a couple of months without a government every two years or so when the previous one managed to trip itself over and a new one hasn't formed yet
It gets old pretty quickly
God, I just want a reasonably stable government with only some small corruption scandals and possibly a minister who has to resign due to discovery that he was a swinger
I can do with constant responsibility dodging   and zero principles
Yes
Singular: Hvala ti
Plural: Hvala vam
And a bonus dual option: Hvala vama
Edit: seems I misunderstood
Yes, you can thank people as a group
Sing
Zahvaljujem se ti
Zahvaljujemo se ti
Which would translate sort of to
"I thank you" and "We thank you" but without the first pronoun as it's reflected in the form of the verb
Hvala
- Thanks
Hvala ti
- Thank you
Hvala vam
- Thank you
(plural or formal)
One better
We also have one for dual (when referring to two people) which is different than the plural form
We have it in singular, plural and dual
'Hvala ti', 'hvala vam' and 'hvala vama'.
Aha
Right
Sorry
In that case
Zahvaljujem se ti/vam
Zahvaljujemo se ti/vam
If that counts
my kindle (survived diving in sea
), chess set, notebook with a pencil, my pocket knife, small first aid box, a detailed map
that's all that i can think of
Too many to write them all, but some of the more used are;  *flaša* (bottle), *lojtra* (ladder)*, žajfa* (soap)*, šraufenciger* (screwdriver)*, štanga* (rod/bar)*, šnops* (brandy), *žiher* (for sure), *glih* (from  German glich - not sure how to translate into English), etc
Edit: forgot to add the most used one, *ja* for ˝yes˝. I never say *da*, and i have never met a Slovene who would use *da* instead of *ja* in every day conversation

and more
Ja, all of them and more
Flajšmašina yes, vešmašina no
Yes, it's "karjola/krjola". I don't know where they use it though
Possibly Slovenian Carinthia
I think it's "karola" in Slovene Littoral
Other words I can find for it are kedrjola, tolige/talige/telige/tulige, talička, tačke, kolica, kolečka, somovoznica, samotežnica, karla, denper, trogarca, grodek, [kankole] The proper word for it is "samokolnica".
Here in Slovenian Istria we say ˝karjola˝. It comes from Italian
How do you call a mantis in your country
Exactly the same
All the Slavs reading this - I understand that one word
Well sure, standard would work too, and so would magyar at least for south Slavs
It was a joke though :)
Na Golici by Ansambel bratov Avsenik
Supposedly the most played instrumental song in the world
That we're part of the Balkans, probably
Švedska and Švica in Slovenian
it is even more similar in pronounciation "schwetzka" and "schwitza"
Just google Barbara pit
Threw them in pits aand that’s it, they died there
There is thousands of dead people lying in our caves, ex mining tunnels, pits etc
Men, women, kids, old people, everything
Most of them probably innocent, specially kids, women and eldery people, but commies killed everyone who didnt agree with their regime/ideology
They simply tied their hands, shoot them and bury them in ditches, caves
Extrajudicial executions
It's still a topic of great debate and controversy
> Queen Juliana granted pardons to some of those sentenced to death
What was the rationale behind that
I do not think the situation in Macedonia is comparable to that in Slovenia
> to help Europe
HA-HA-HA
The US spent $1 trillion in today's money to prevent the Soviet Union from taking over the rest of Europe eventually, be it ideologically or by force, which would most likely have tipped the balance in communism's favor
The idea that the US (or any other country for that matter) have ever done something big out of the goodness of their hearts is hilarious
Firstly, Macedonia was the most peaceful region during the war
Just comparing the Macedonian and Slovenian deaths will give you a good picture of that (\~90,000 Slovenian and less than 7,000 Macedonian)
Secondly, Slovenia was the only part of Yugoslavia that was directly annexed and incorporated into the German 3rd Reich and Fascist Italy
Thirdly, Slovenia had both ant active independent partisan (not under the command of Tito) and anti-communist fighting force, both home-grown and composed entirely of Slovenes ([Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation] [Slovene Home Guard] Next, unlike in Macedonia, many Slovene civilians were deported into concentration camps in Germany to make room for German settlers
And this is only scratching the surface, really
Yes
Croatia was still
well
"worse" also bosnia and serbia probably
And also to Yugoslavia but that help was outside of Marshall plan
> Then why did we feed, clothe, arm and supply the Soviet Army for the entire war
Because having the Nazis win would've been the same result except with Germany in charge, which would arguably have been even worse
> The Marshall Plan was specifically designed to jump start European industry
Because hungry people are much more likely to turn to communism, i.e. invite the Red Army for a visit
> we wanted Europe to be able to stand on its own and feed its own people so we wouldn't have to anymore
This we agree on
The US wanted as much of Europe as possible to be able to stand on its own and be well-off enough that communism would stop being appealing
And since that's expensive, it's much better if Europe can do it alone
Seriously, it's nothing new
The balance of power calculations and propping up other nations as buffers, vassals, allies etc
is something European empires, kingdoms, and later countries have been doing for centuries before the words United States of America were ever uttered for the first time
It doesn't mean the US are bad or evil
It just means they act in their own self-interest FIRST, which is normal and expected
We agree that the US did the stuff
We agree that it's good for Europe that the US did the stuff
What we apparently disagree on is my claim that the US didn't do it out of altruism but out of pure self-interest - that not being a negative thing but simply realpolitik
Or do we agree on that as well
> The country isn't one person with one belief
Many wanted to help Europe for altruistic reasons, many didn't want to help at all
That's all true
I'm talking about why the country did what it did, and countries don't do stuff out of altruism
> This was shortsighted and it's good we became involved and then stayed to help after
It's good you became involved and stayed to help after
Nobody's saying it was a bad thing
It likely saved a couple million lives that would've been lost if you hadn't. But you didn't join and especially stay after to save lives
You did it because if you hadn't, the old French and possibly even Spanish and Portuguese generations would still understand Russian today, possibly even live in a still-existing Soviet Union
> Roosevelt was idealistic though and he was our leader
Yes, but the leadership as a whole stayed pragmatic
A lot, including castle ruins, since if its a ruin they usually dont charge entrance and after ww2 most of our castles got abandoned and or destroyed anyway
5 or 6 mostly with school as I am not that interested in that period of the time and I find castles boring
A lot, including the ruins
A lot
In several different countries
Some already in ruins some that are nicely maintained
Company phones are not what I would call a benefit, since the boss then always expects you to be available :D
Good
Over here it's usually expected to answer your work phone when the boss calls, even though you're not at work
I mean even when you use it as a consonant it has something of a short 'ee' sound to it
Every
Fucking
Where
But fr yes, I've done it and i wasn't alone so
Being part of Yugoslavia
People are still torn by it
Many people on the left don't admit it was a dictatorship and that many people suffered
They expect people to just casually get over everything they went through
The people who did suffer or are future generations of the ones who suffered on the other hand sometimes use that to fuel hate
It's a mess and those of us who see both sides are enemy of all
Seen as stupid or naive
Something called “[segedinar] originally from Hungary)
I hate it, it’s too sour for me
Pasta
To me it's just bland, tasteless quick eat-stuff :)
Usually accompanied with some oily, fatty sauce to hide its taste
I know, it's cheap, easy and quick to cook (and this is imo the reason for it's popularity) but it has so many alternatives which are actually edible that it's almost a crime to cook that shit
Get me a whole grain bread, or maybe some dumplings or [baked potatoes] as a side dish and I'm a happy man
Probably my favourite museum in my country is the [WW1 museum in Kobarid] It is showing about a front that is often ignored in history and in general
There is 1 KFC in the whole country so pretty much non existent
And its location is in the middle of nowhere, not even in a city
Everything is in Ljubljana, why can’t Maribor have something as well
But it would be nice if we would have more of them and in other cities as well
Bosnia and Herzegovina
I guess we're in the way :/
We kinda feel the same for BiH
Ok northern Slovenes
In Slovenia there is only a special 5€ newyears' scratch ticket, and all win at least 2€. Unfortunately, the top prize is only 10
000€, and only 3 of 400
000 win that
Furthermore 96% win 5€ or less
In some years there was also a Super-Loto on January 1, with a top prize of 1 million (odds of winning are as in our regular loto: 1 in 15 million)
If the jackpot was not won, it was split among other prizes, multiplying them by 4 or 5 times
The most likely one would probably be [Lower Styria ] it has a strong ideology and connection with Austria(Hitler referred to them as Windish)
There are also some idiots that founded the [“Styrian Ward”]
Is it the people or the land you want to shake off
Stray dogs not really
I would say stray cats are more common but more in the countryside
There are about 10 stray cats roaming around in our village
And also other animals sometimes (wild boars, foxes, deers, shakals, there was even a bear situation ones)
We don't have stray dogs but there are stray cats
It has gotten a lot better over the years because of spay and neuter programs (mostly done by charities)
Unfortunately while you won't see many stray cats in the city, there are plenty in the countryside and even semi-rural places
Farms are especially bad and people in many rural areas still rather kill each litter of cats instead of takimg care of the mom
Males are neutered even less frequently
In Bosnia and Serbia it's unfortunately not like that
A few volunteers from slovenia go down there and take care of stray populations in garbage sites
There are new dogs dropped there all the time
Mostly pregnant or hurt
And people go visit these populations to abuse them
Often it's kids who do that (kill puppies, even cut of parts of dogs)
The volunteers usually get laughed at for helping them
Obviously nkt everyone is like that but it is a huge problem
You guys really do have a great relationship with dogs and they are super friendly
The shelters are so sad
I've see photos of dead decaying dogs among groups of dogs still housed there
I don't judge the people for not being able to care for the animals but it is so sad and I hope it gets better
We have special pens for left-handed here
I think ink for left handed pens dries quicker but it's been a long time since I was in school
The pens don't have the same tip as regular pens
Normally people drop off their kids and then pick them up at the end
If parents are really close friends they might stay for a few minutes but not much more than that
Mostly it was just kids, but I remeber a few occasions when I was still in the kindergarten that some parents stayed to help with the party, particularly if it was a larger one or if parents knew each other anyway
It also depended on company
I grew up with a group of friends that I had because my parents and their friends had kids at approximately the same time
Obviously at those parties, our parents were present and hanging out themselves
I remember we mentioned some specifics now and then, particularly in context of phonemes and a little about vocabulary
For example, there are Slovene dialects that use diphtongs, but standard language doesn't. Standard language knows tonal accents (although they don't change the meaning), but some dialects don't. Dialects use a lot of borrowed words from neighbouring languages
We didn't study them systematically though
Here in Slovenia, we dedicate a significant chapter in high school Slovene to our dialects
We have between 7 and 52, depending on who you ask
Dialects and dialect groups that are geographically close are usually mutually intelligible but still sound distinct
On the national scale, some dialects are so far apart that some call them different languages entirely
Imagine the entire English language along with Scots and various creoles, squeezed inside just 20 thousand km2 - roughly 4% of Spain
[This article] describes it better than I ever could
There is an official/standardized version of the language that most everyone can understand and speak
The vast majority of everything written is written in "standard" Slovene which is also taught and analysed in school
However, nobody speaks this "variant" outside of very formal situations, be it speeches or the news
In school, we learn of the dialect groups, what makes them unique and what the differences between and inside each group are
My high school was in an area that speaks "Rovte Slovene", so we did a deeper dive into the differences inside the group
I'm sure they do the same in other regions of the country
Austria of course
It is close to home and it has similar culture
It's a great country
Germany
Unlike the other two, they speak German
Well, in some regions at least
Probably Austria as it's the closest and i wont spend to much money getting there
Austria over Switzerland every day of the week
Sadly such help would come too late when you're left alone on a train trying to figure whether everyone has got off due to an undecipherable announcement or simply because that was their station
Aw that's the sweetest thing anybody has ever said about Slovenia haha
*Let's offend a country that we didn't even know that exists* lmao
Adria is trash, stay away from it lol
They sang *To be fair, Slovenia's lovely (we are kidding, it sucks too)*
That's horrendous lol
Sounds like a school trip nobody wanted to go in middle school lmao i hope you weren't late for some appointment or family time
I only know two relations: Nova Gorica-Bohinjska Bistrica and Nova Gorica - Ljubljana
The prices are:

Umm i have a book to read till tommorow
thanks for reminding me
Most people in my age group is putting some small amount away for retirement, since we're seeing the government retirement scheme drop lower and lower every few years
Apart from that, people prefer to keep money on hand to buy stuff they can use
Real estate is for own use and maybe some renting is probably the most common investment
Older people all got some money in this or other kind of bonds as handout during denationalisation, and while I got the sense they are all somewhat disillusioned with what they managed to make of it, the market for binding the money still seems quite strong
A lot of time
Sometimes I find myself looking for a word in Slovene but know the exact translation in a language I'm not even fluent and do use google translate to reverse translate it so I don't think it is only because of extensive use of foreign language (It may be age ;) )
It happens
For some reason I can often think of the Croatian word before I can remember what the Slovenian one is even though I don't use Croatian in my everyday life
TV SLO 1 is first on the list and the most popular one is POP tv
1 TV SLO is from RTV Slovenija and its a national TV
Yes, but goverment managed to change RTV management, things might change in the future
Yes they also want to make their Nova24tv (crazy nationalist propaganda) much more popular and obligatory on all tvs or something idk
I'd rather unite with Slovakia and become Slovenkia with them and end the name confusion once and for all
Austria would be fine, too
For a nice connection in the middle, between Slovenia and Slovakia :D
Been there, done that
Trieste was and is ours already :)
although this doesnt apply for the example you posted, its because even "i dont know" is an answer
i know i always want to contribute a unique slovenian perspective to the questions, but if i dont know the answer it at least tells you that slovenians probably dont know or dont have X in their culture/society
Is it rude to ask how old are you
I'm 21 and I'm very suprised you didn't know anything about other currencies
EDIT: Or better, how old were you when you found out
We got Euro in 2007 so I still remember the times we used Tolar
For you it was probably different
Ah ok, makes perfect sense then
Kids don't give a shit about money and many 7 year olds probably don't even know much about foreign countries
In my family it was only when we had family gatherings because there was no place for all of us to sit at one table
Sometimes we did that in the first round eat children or "the young ones" and in the second round all the adults
I sure hope not
I need to save time walking to the station
There are 30 judges at the Supreme Court and they are divided between the Civil Chamber, the Criminal Chamber, the Commercial Chamber, the Labour and Social Chamber, and the Administrative Chamber
The Slovene Supreme Court is not equivalent in power to the American though
The Court is the highest instance court, meaning that it is the highest court you can appeal to after your case was decided at the district court (first instance) and then the higher court (second instance)
However, we also have a Constitutional Court that deals with constitutional matters and there are 9 justices that are elected for a 9 year term
In some cases it could be said that the Constitutional Court is the de facto highest court, as you can lodge a constitutional appeal if your constitutional rights have been infringed even after your case was decided at the Supreme Court
In this case you’d have to argue that the supreme court’s decision infringed a constitutional right (which also proves you have a legal interest) and that you have exhausted all other remedies
Moreover, the Constitutional Court also deals with constitutional review proceedings, disputes regarding competence between the different branches of government, among others

The big change is that few "military secret" bases that were closed to public are now opened
Most notably the entire village and huge area around Kočevska Reka, which I'd highly recommend as it has some of the most pristine and wild forest in Slovenia, and the mountain Krim, which has become a popular hiking destination for many
But the more interesting (at least to me) is the fate of Austro-Hungarian barracks, at least those in Ljubljana, which many experienced different fates
Two are still standing, one on Metelkova street and one on Roška
The one on Metelkova was squatted by various youth movements back in the 80's and has become a hub of counter-culture ever since and is one of the most recommended tourist destination behind only Bled
The one on Roška was used as military prison all the way up to 90's. And back in late 80's it housed the most "influential" political prisoner and Twitter-shitposter that is our current PM
But after our independence it was vacated and left to disrepair
But it hasn't been demolished yet, probably because of its historic importance
Other two Kolizej and one on Topniška street (named after the artillery that was housed there) were back under Yugoslavia social housing
The first to be demolished was the one on Topniška, as it was to be replaced by a new modern "fancy" buildings
That was in late 90's early 00's, it has yet to progress from there
Kolizej was the one that was most well preserved and was used as housing up to 00's. But in late 90's a badly planned renovation caused a small part of one wing to collapse, so it was also later demolished, even though many architects were against that, as it was a important historic monument
There were ideas to at least conserve the outer facade, but in the end the deal was made that it will be replaced by a "cultural hub". But this project also went nowhere, and was recently replaced by just fancy apartment building, with no cultural value
I'd add "Pekarna" (The Bakery) in Maribor
Former Austro-Hungarian military warehouse and bakery, now a counter-cultural centre of Maribor
It includes an excellent used-book "shop" *Bukvarna Ciproš* (I really doubt they get anything more than to break even on expenses since "contribution to book preservation" is really low - they just quickly look at what you collected and charge as much for the whole pile of hard-to-find-anywhere-else bok as you might pay for one or two of the books in an actual shop selling used books), residing in the former flour warehouse
Ground floor has books in Slovene and textbooks+technical books in all languages and first floor has foreign-language fiction, biographies etc
And books are everywhere
Literally
Full bookshelves, tables completely covered, piles on the floor
I sincerely recommend anyone who finds themselves near Pekarna in Maribor Mon-Fri between 17-19; Wed 9-13 or 17-19; Sat 9-13 to visit Bukvarna Ciproš. It is completely worth it

Powerwolf is amazing, and I just started listening to Rammstein and I can't stop listening to them
Also Lykke Li and Robyn come to mind
Siddharta as well, they've been around America i believe
Andrej Šifrer and Slavko Avsenik have gotten pretty popular abroad as well I think
I remember hearing both on Serbian, Croatian and Ukrainian radio stations
Well, I was going to write that
One of them is actually a Slovenian
We don't have the same language like Slovaks, but
if I drive in Slovakia with sign "Otrok v avtu" I will get attention of local police as this in Slovakian means "Slave in the car" while in Slovene it is "children in the car"
Other way around is driving in Slovenia with "Hasič", in Slovenia it would be understand as "smoker of hashish" while in Slovak it is "Firefighter"
> sprostý
And sprosti in Slovene means relax
OK so now I know I should not say "sprosti se" to Czech or Slovak when trying to extract them from car crash
Or sirov burek
> "Pozor, policie varuje"
And in Slovene "Pozor, policija varuje" is "Attention, police is protecting"  :D
Short beards are quite common but long beards like I have (cca 50cm) are rare
My length of beard is so rare that I have been stoped on the street and asked if they can take a photo multiple times already
We're about to lose against Cyprus, so, not good
Badly
I really hate football so I'm happy with that
I don't like it if they stay too long
Because that "joy" bring misery to so many others
Most people who watch football in slovenia are mean anyway and racist (even to our own players of color)
Plus I despise these competitions and fans who put up with horrendous behaviour just to enjoy a sport
There are a lot of English words that are used in slang and with new generations this number just increases so yes I am a little
Any job that is d. o. o. , company with limited responsibility

One, and it is not open yet
It's goin to open this fall, if everything goes right
None
We've been waiting for one for almost a decade I think but the building still hasn't started lol
I kind of don't want it, since it will badly affect our furniture makers
the largest amount i see is some slovenians using the N word because they dont really understand how inapropriate it is
they hear it in songs and see it in movies too much
I mean it's not like there's anyone like that to offend here, so I guess it doesn't really matter
4 groups of people who use it
Friends who know it's fine to go "yo yo my nigga
", people who're crazy about hiphop subculture, people who're genuinely clueless, and racists
The last group also tends to correlate with low/no education and poverty
So the vast majority of times (first 3 groups), the usage is perfectly fine, unless the (semi)black person in question is offendable like an Afro-American
You'd have to get extremely unlucky to experience actual racism in Slovenia beyond the retard group mentioned above
Unless you meet a black person who just wants to play a victim, saying black is perfectly fine
I don't listen to any hiphop but when I hear it played, 90% of the time it's nigga this, bitch that, and hoes something else
It's irrelevant if you consider it shitty, it's what's most-played in many places
As for education and poverty, the former generally doesn't correlate with any kind of hiphop and the latter is relative
Still, not considering the context of word usage before getting offended IMO correlates with either low intelligence or ulterior motives
Well that's what I mean
If someone is offended by being called black, they're just playing the victim and oughtta be handled like that
Affirmative action in Russia
Just who do you mean by you
Considering I'm Slovenian
Well, IDK
I was advised by some Russian friends to not necessarily pick SPB as a trip destination because of potential neonazi love for blacks
Mixed info
Most of Slovenians agree that we are Central Europe
We’re culturally and historically very close to Austria as we were part of it for centuries
Ljubljana is also very similar to cities like Graz, Vienna and Prague
Generally we’re the closest to Czechs, Slovaks, Hungarians and Northern Croatians
* Never part of the east bloc - check
* Higher [iHDI] than many of the old empires - check
* Median person's net [wealth] > $50k - check
*  In the Mediterranean - check
* 1300 years as part of Central European empires - check
I'll go with Central Europe, which coincidentally is what most people in Slovenia also agree on
Most people also don't differentiate between someone from NI, Scotland, Wales, or England and just call everything together "England" and everyone "English". I seem to recall the other 3 "countries" not being huge fans of that
Ask around how many languages in Europe use "England" as shorthand for the UK in colloquial speech
It's by no means just Americans
And in general, calling former USSR colonies "Eastern Europe" is the same as calling the "countries" (regions really) of the UK England
It would be done only by ignorant people, since it makes LESS sense than calling Scotland England
After all, England STILL rules those three "countries" in a large proportion, while Russia has indirect influence at best on "Eastern Europe".
So yeah, whenever you feel the need to say "Eastern Europe" to refer to anyone that's not Russia, Ukraine, or Belarus, keep in mind that you sound about the same as someone seeing a guy in a kilt in Edinburgh and calling him English
Slavic is a linguistic group more so than a cultural one
A random person from west Slovenia has much more in common with Italians than with someone from east Slovenia, for example, and we're tiny
And someone from anywhere in Slovenia has much more in common with someone from anywhere in Austria than with anyone from Russia
If you go by the extent of the differences, then you still have to keep the former Austria-Hungary together
Common sense would already tell you that a millennium in the same entity would have more of an effect than being colonized for 50 years by someone else who just happens to have a related language
Why would language matter in this case
Apart from geographical proximity these countries also share their culture and history
I mean they were part of the same country for centuries, almost a millennium (Czechia and Slovenia were even part of the Holy Roman Empire, moreover, Slovenia was part of the Frankish Empire)
Even though language can be considered a part of the culture, it is one of the very few things that Central European slavic speaking countries share with Eastern Europe
For example, as a Slovene I feel much closer to Austria, Bavaria or any other Alpine  country than Russia, Ukraine or Bulgaria
> I will be sure to ask my Eastern European partner that tomorrow morning, although I already know what the answer will be
So, Duden is a reasonably big thing in Germany when it comes to language
The [entry for England] says under meanings:
1) A part of Great Britain
2) Great Britain (colloquial)
I'd also bet it's reasonably common in Slavic countries (at least in the South Slavic ones)
Not sure about Latin languages
> England does not "rule" the rest of the countries in the UK at all
Just look at the former and the current Socttish referendum movement
I have been looking at it ever since Brexit
They're more ruled by England than Slovenia or Croatia were by Serbia in Yugoslavia
> Yes there are a lot of political shenanigans that aren't ethical or right, but England does not "rule" or "control" the other countries in the Union
We have very different definitions of what it means to rule and control, apparently
> I didn't say that the Baltics were Eastern European due to former USSR rule, that didn't even come into consideration
Russia's previous control had/has no bearing on the general consensus IMO
Russia's previous control is the one "argument" the vast majority of people throws around (even though it's also explicitly wrong for a chunk of what they tend to classify as "Eastern Europe")
Everybody speaks their local dialect/regional language, Slovenian, English and a mix of Serbian/Croatian/Bosnian
People that live close to the border also tend to speak that language, so Italian, German, or Hungarian
And the same goes for e.g. foods - Western Slovenia lives on pasta and olive oil
The East swears by pumpkin seed oil and potatoes
For music, if you don't listen to the lyrics, what's considered the typical Slovenian and Austrian national music is virtually identical
Etc
edit: mixed up east and west - it's late -_-
> I'm pretty sure it's common opinion
Just like NI, Scotland, and Wales are commonly England
I never argued that it's not common opinion that some countries are called EE
I'm arguing that the common opinion is nonsensical at best and racist at worst
> they have distinct words/phrases for the UK and its constituent countries
That was never the argument
Of course they have distinct words/phrases
So do we
Everyone does
Just like English has Central Europe, South-Eastern Europe, Eastern Europe etc
What I'm saying is that in colloquial usage, people use England and people use Eastern Europe, not that precise words don't exist
> democratically the other British/NI countries are not ruled by England
I was under the impression that devolution means that Westminster yields some of the power to the parliaments of NI, Scotland, and Wales
And IIRC, Westminster recently tried to pass a bill that would remove some of those devolved powers from the parliaments back to itself
Also, AFAIK the NI parliament isn't super functional and thus Westminster effectively runs things, and Wales isn't super devolved in the first place
> in a union someone has to be the strongest member
That's called an Empire then
In a union, ideally everyone would be of equal power
Now that's unfortunately not realistic, but the members of the union should at least treat each other with that kind of respect
The EU tries to do this with the vetos
Scotland and NI combined couldn't veto Brexit
Now, if I ask a bunch of Scottish people, do you think they'd say they feel that England has way too much control over Scotland or that England doesn't have control over Scotland
> another referendum
And this is where you can see who's genuinely in charge
Scotland has to ask England if it may hold a referendum on its own future
That by definition means that England is in charge
When I worked as a special needs assistant the school I worked in had Czech exchange studentS and they had fricking Crocks, sandals and even foam sliders as slippers
It was funny
edit: students not student
When I was in elementary scool you'd be ridiculed if seen in foam sliders
Same as with white socks
I guess that's one of the reasons we call anything unaesthetic 'czech'.
Not just younger, prettier also and better surgeons
I was surprised to see top chefs serving polenta

Probably [Na Golici] It doesn't have lyrics though

That one is beautiful
Id say: “Slovenija od kod lepote tvoje” cuse of the lyrics
That is an option too
Probably also Kdor ne skače ni Slovenc
Lets keep that one to the sports halls and football fields :D
Normal but not everyday meal
People are more shocked that we eat horses
Not an everyday meat but nothing unusual
We had rabbit quite often growing up but I think most people get it from someone they know, not buy it in a supermarket, at least that's my experience
We always got it from a neighbour at our weekend house
Same with deer and boar meat but I think it's usually eaten in restaurants, not prepared at home as much
No one would bat an eye or be surprised hearing you ate those kinds of meat
yeah and it is extremely good, if you ever come in Slovenia you should try it out :)
>Leberkas
you can prepare it on many different ways, as a steak, pate, "fast food "horseburger"", you can cut it on tiny pieces and fry it otgether with onion
tbh i dont really cook i just like to eat, so i can't tell you all the possible ways it can be done :D
Happy cakeday
Phew, a few more minutes and I'd have missed it
Holy moly

But there's also [Guillermo del Toro] one that's supposedly comming in 2021
Elements like W for volfram, K for kalij, Na for natrij make more sense, but then O for kisik, C for ogljik and N for dušik make less sense
A rule of thumb is that more recently discovered elements are more likely to make sense, while older don't.
I will cheer for Finland, Croatia, Austria and Germany
You have Europe's support, Scotland
Good luck
"Are you having a boy or an abortion
So true
If you go to a kebab(döner) place
And you order without onions does the guy ask you if you are gonna kiss anyone
Here this is very common
I think this is exclusively a Slovenian thing
Still, the weirdest such exchange I had was at a horseburger place in Ljubljana (Trubarjeva, where Šeherezada is now) that tops all the kebab conversations:
Us: *order*
Dude: *takes order*
Dude: *leans on counter* "What's up, do you fuck
" ("Kvaj zj, a kej fukate
" for Slovenian Redditors)
Friend: "That's why we went to eat, to have strength for the evening
Dude: "Fuck that, you're gonna vomit all over her
I miss that place
hje hje hje a se boš ljupčkov
A se bos lubckou a?
Well that's a šiptar for you
Anything for a kebab tbh
When I was in Celje, they used to talk to us like that as well
And of course, the onions and kissing exchange was always on the menu too
Nah if you want something with yogurt just order burek
Lowkey homo
Probably because of kebab
You kissin anyone later
You definitely have to try it with ćevapi or any other kind of grilled meat
Geography mostly
Ljubljana is at the centre and all the roads and railways meet there
Plus, when Trieste (where most of slovene speaking burgeoasie lived) went to Italy, Ljubljana's status was undisputed
We say: "boli me kurac", which means: "my dick hurts".
I love the circus/monkey expression
I'm surprised how often this is used

Exactly, we only deposed Khaddafi because a lot of countries owed him money for oil, and making him a tiran was the easiest way to justify it
We have that too
For singular you you have:
* informal 'ti'
* formal 'Vi' (same as informal for more or equal to three people)
* super formal 'Oni' in which you talk to the person in front of you in the same way you would talk formally about about a person who isn't there physically
The last one used to be used when talking to parents or grandparents up to 1940 and is still taught in schools but only because it's in the grammar

Its lucky that they removed pictures and all before renovation and that 3/4 of the building is made out of stone
Still really sad it came to this
it survived so many changes and wars yet renovation destoryed it

Three referendums
First referendum: "Do you want to have another referendum about UK leaving EU

If yes -> continue to 2nd referendum
Second referendum: "What should the question on the referendum be

Why would you remove Slovenia from good results

reeeeeeee
Ah yes because Slavs = shit lifestyle and poverty
Definitely hasn't gotten to do with corruption and politics
It's the genetics
All I know is that weed is dirt cheap
And the ice cream is rumored to be legendary
Yeah, I think we're usually quite on par with most of the countries that should stay in the 'good results' bit per OP's rearrangement
But we're also Slavic, so we get -2 points for being 'Eastern Europe'.
It really depends on the metric
If it's things like safety and suitability for children, we're on par with Scandinavia
If it's anything regarding money, we're at least two shades redder than them
If you can pronounce Ljubljana, we'll forgive you

What an irony
Same in our neck of the woods, smooth-brains are convinced that we would surely be the exception in their eradication plans and that his praise was not at all a strategy to pacify locals into not joining local resistance groups
Since we know the Nazis would never go back on their word
Lol
Based and blackpilled
they were an exception when the Nazis needed collaborators
they would have probably received the great honor of being among the last Slavs to be gassed, had history turned otherwise
but hey, at least they defended their country against communists /s
I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment, sounds like a great film
A lot of pundits have said the same thing
We are living in an age of loneliness, especially impacting young boys/men
They often find solace and male camaraderie lacking in their daily lives in online communities where they can quickly get radicalized
The content on YouTube even has this intimate, domestic setting with streamers: "instead of hanging out in person, here is my friend Ted on YT reading me an FBI crime statistics report proving blacks are inferior to me".
It's the anxiety, frustration, lack of opportunities and defeatist attitude that pushes them into these radical beliefs, inceldom or similar and all as a result of the way modernization changed human interaction for the worse
Haha, my old part-time job we had a semi-ironic nazi and weapons collector who was the butt-end of the jokes most of the time, he surprisingly laughed with us most of the time
I still remember that I almost died laughing when my boss told him one day: "If wehrmacht had people like you leading, the only way they'd reach Istanbul would be with the index finger on the map
" Sounds less funny when translated, but the whole crew was cry-laughing

All you need to do is move towards where you are pointed at
Brilliant
Where are your slutty posts, liar
there’s a great article from Francis Fukuyama on identity politics on the left, but I think the logic applies to the political right as well
he argues that western liberalism, by explicitly abstaining from prescribing you any sort of meta narrative, is essentially leaving a huge emotional void in people’s lives
this void used to be filled by religions and empires
today, those are largely or completely absent in the West
that makes many people desperate for a higher purpose
for individuals who are for any reason unwilling or uncapable of reflection and critical thinking, and perhaps unsatisfied with their own place in society, this mix of circumstances makes them very susceptible to ideologies such as nationalism, racism etc
now again, he talks about the left, but I think the parallels are obvious
the article was published on American purpose
edit: grammar
I wholeheartedly agree and I'd also like to add that neoliberalism and austerity measures (trickle-down economics, anyone
) have effectively worsened working class welfare for decades now in the developed world, where small communities were nuked from the orbit with trade deals that exported all major industries to the global south or China
It's pretty easy to see who profited from these policies
On a global scale the same system failed spectacularly in addressing climate change, causing human-driven global extinction event, climate refugees and more
These facts and the terrible and corrupt governance is what causes populism to rise and extremism to thrive
yup
austerity basicly tells you that you’re alone and can fuck off and die
if resources are limited and essentially a zero-sum game, everyone’s an enemy
good luck telling the rabid we can grow the pie if we continue to collaborate
this ideology of austerity goes against so many economic lessons from the 20th century: that you need a strong demand for economic growth; that you need a big middle class to drive that; that infrastucture, public healthcare and school system, and social security create opportunities which in turn create wealth and well-being which in turn strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law; that for that, you need high and progressive taxes, etc
so many lessons which led to the best world we’ve ever seen willfully ignored that it’s hard to believe this destabilisation of democracies accross the western world was a bug rather than a feature
Agree but some countries have really bad train tracks and connections
A carbon tax would do a good job of accomplishing that
In Slovenia we need 30 years to agree where the trains should go
To actually build the tracks, it will take another 100 years
At that time we will not need trains anymore, probably
&#x200B;
We still have the tracks build from Austro-Hungarian times without much improvements
And who pays for it
Should the cost be placed upon everyone or like it is now onto those that use the train
We will all be able to travel for free across EU very soon :)
WW3 is coming anyways :(
Are you a politician
I asked a simple question and you replay with unrelated stuff
Let me try again
> And who pays for it
Should the cost be placed upon everyone or like it is now onto those that use the train

Jesus, it's Ljubljana too
Excuse me, our river has FOUR syllables
I tried to get a few americans to  pronounce Ljubljana once
It did not end well
For the record there aren't any slient letters in the word 'Ljubljana', nor in the majority of slovenian words
That's english's thing
Listen, I would imagine it was very difficult to have a legal abortion in Poland even before this, so I assume the vast majority of abortions are illegal or made out of country, which means this doesn't really change much
Apparently there were 1110 legal abortions in Poland in 2019
The context is entirely lacking here
People are posting statistics like "50% want to keep abortion as it is, only 15% want stricter regulations". That seems to me to mean, that 2/3 of the population do not want to have more loose regulations regarding abortion
Seems to me like a clear majority
Reddit is being incredibly reactionary again
Not to start "who has it worst" contest but I think Malta is stricter

The Slovenian prime minister has tweeted that the winner shouldn't be announced before the courts do their thing
Google translate:
>Interesting
Complaints have been filed in all U.S. countries with a close outcome
The courts have not even begun to decide
Nevertheless [\#MSM] (and not some official body) announce the winner
Congratulations from all sides
The rule of law does that
This is after he was the first one to congratulate Trump on his victory 3 days ago
The only thing that sunk Trump was his Covid response and even that just barely
Let that sink in, without it enough Americans would think he is doing a bang up job
When Bush the younger was elected Americans kept saying how he was a fluke
When he was reelected it was because you don't change presidents during war
When Trump was elected it started to look less of an aberration than actual representation of values of big segment of US voters
As a born American citizen and a somewhat recent Slovenian citizen through my family, Jansa can fuck the right off
You're either extremely gullable, or extremely misinformed on who biden is
He is a right-wing politician who agrees with most of the views Trump had, even though they were extreme by EU (and Slovenian) standards
The voting base is also quite similar in demographics
Luckily even other party leaders from his coalition congratulated Biden and accepted the results
To be honest, I am sometimes relieved that almost nobody outside of Slovenia speaks Slovene, as our politics are sometimes even on a lower level than those in the US
Don’t get me started on the social media comments, those are even more batshit crazy
Distraction
Government fucked up response to second Covid wave, deaths are climbing, government is replacing people in all sorts of services and governmental bodies
Best to throw people a bone to pick and have them outraged over this then over other stuff
That's what we keep asking ourselves every day
So sorry, Europe
He knows not what he does, the Twitto
He, his ministers, a lot of prominent party members, and a few rich hungarians are majority shareholders in right-wing media houses like Demokracija and Nova24
It's in his political and economic interest to propagate his own media
Don't blame us
We didn't vote for this asshole
He has a hardcore support group and his party receives a certain percentage of votes on every election but it hasn't been enough to form a government in a while, however he got his break when the previous PM stepped down in a dumb headed attempt to win more seats in an election but instead, the president gave Janša an option to run for the position and all the wishy washy selfish centre/centre-right parties formed a coalition with the right wing SDS party (which Janša is the leader of) and formed the shittest government in our history
They all talked about how it's on thin ice and they have values and standards and demands, and of course Janša has broken all of them and yet not a single party has left the coalition (which would be enough to dissolve the government) since they're all too pussy to do it and lose their comfy government positions
>One of the first reforms in order is getting rid of the EC:
LMAO
Last two republican presidents won 2/3rs of their terms and what did Democrats do about it
Fuck all, that's what
Only change in past 20 years was that one of states decided to split their EV according to popular vote in their state
Fact is EC suits both parties because it creates safe red and blue states both parties can ignore because they are foregone conclusion and so both can focus on couple of swing states
Both ignore Texas and California because they know how they'll vote
Both ignore smaller states because victory is not worth the effort (and expense)
Which is why complaints about EC quieted soon after elections
Slovenian son-in-law
The real big brain move is always in the comments
Why
Well yeah Biden's not exactly a saint by any measure but definitely the lesser evil of the two
Be it casual racism, warmongering or whatever, but if you guys hate him then it's a plus for that in my book
What's wrong is that he congratulated Trump on Wednesday, when there were no official results whatsoever
It just makes him look like a hypocrite that sticks his nose in other countries' elections
Please support them
It's a tough time for us right now
Well, Slovenia is actually a Central European country
But in general, yes, we are doing better than other ex Yugoslavia countries
We had some scandals, but they were contained inside the country
But that was before Twitter, the go-to platform for every right wing politician
You're more right (no pun intended) than you know
But he's also not a stranger to corruption and other shady deals
From what I can gather after multiple visit to Serbia and knowing lots of Serbian, the thing you hate usually are the good things that happen for everybody else
So I'm in peace with that fact
It was horrible, but the alternative to that would be much much worse
And the fact that all Serbia politics do are blaming every other foreign nations on how shitty they run their country is also pathetic
Wtf its been 5 years already ?

It's a shame, because Norilsk is a pretty interesting city, and there's a bunch of really interesting articles out there that look past the clickbait-y garbage, and talk about how the city population crashed in post-Soviet towns, why it's growing again, and how people there actually live
Americans be like: "We don't care"
..and our stupid government is in cahoots with PL and HU
Lovely
Not to mention our PM is the only one (!) that congratulated Trump on 2020 victory

Abolish electoral college and then it will be much better
Also: how far to the right a country is

Holy shit, I was awake on the computer and thought I was dying of a heart attack or something
I've never felt an earthquake that was this strong
I talked with a friend and his grandma started packing up and leaving as soon as it started
and meanwhile my flatmate thought her cats were playing with the closets

We calls those korfi in Slovenia
You'll find the best ones in Trojane
Here in Slovenia we call these krofi, so I suppose we got the word from you guys then
We also apparently kept the hard k, unlike how we turned "Kirche" into "cerkev".

I guess we just need to go to Portugal then
I guess I wanna die
Oh no Slovenia, oh no
How do I die

Am, Slovene, can confirm
Im kinda sad and not really surprised about slovenia
In short, Slovenia was the shit back in the Yugoslav days, but we can hardly compete with the rest of western Europe
Also, a general disappointment with independence, I think
Slovenes actually had some semblance of unity in Yugoslavia and Austria-Hungary before that

In Ljubljana, Slovenia, the city center is closing for cars, but there are new big parking lots outside of the center, right next to the highway exits, where you can take a bus or rent a bike
Also, new undergound garages were and will be build near city center

Bees and Butterflies are definitely important for our produce, but not all crops are insect pollinated

Additionally many plants that are somewhat insect fertilizing can also self-fertilize
this includes tomatoes, legumes and peppers

We had that on [May 20th]

As for Syria, of course they're there - they're allies
It's CIA-funded rebels and terrorists that made a mess in Syria
Perhaps I favour Russia because my country has no bad blood with them, or I'm still clinging to the old 19th century idea of Pan-Slavism, but I'd sooner appease Russia, which is basically in our backyard, than continue this unhealthy relationship with the USA

Slovenian is unintelligible to Slovenians
If we talk in dialects at least
In language we are unique among Slavs with similarities in both south and slightly less west Slavic languages
Another problem with language is Germanic and Romance influence
When I came to Slovakia, I could understand most of what was written or what the people were saying
In Czechia a little less so
"Politicians not as curruopt"
We are getting there with Janša as PM, ok
>  It's another thing their politicians aren't as corruput as ours and that they prospered in the last 30 years
Hey, our politicians are also very corrupt
You are both kinda right
slovenes are like 30% west and 70%  south
Source: studying the early middle ages, slavic migration and shit like that
Edit: grammar
Well Slovenia is on the border between [Central Europe and Balkan] and even though the majority of geographical land stays in central Europe we are still mixed into Balkan and that's the main problem why people dispute about it
From the recent history, you can easily say we are part of Balkan but that only goes for 100 years or our nation's existence while through most of the history of Europe we were always part of either the [Austria-Hungary] or [Holy roman empire] and the first kingdom that people who migrated and that lived here were part [Samo's Kingdom] Not to mention a lot of german writing which describes us as [Wenden] which means "western Slavs" or Slavs that lived near german settlements
And that Balkan comes from Ottoman times because the ottomans gave the land of south-east Europe when they had it under control the name [Balkan] which in Turkish means "[mountain chain] (if I'm not mistaken) and we were never part of the [Ottoman empire] So I would always rather say we are part of central Europe than Balkan even though some will say language or last 100 years makes us a Balkan nation but that is more or less a political view which is a popular but not always the right view anyway
What if I told you Croatian and Slovenian are also pretty dissimilar and it's sometimes hard to understand that too
Yeah, but if something is more similar to A than to B, couldn't an argument be made that it should be classified as A instead of B?
Yes, you are right about it
I think there's been a misunderstanding
You are right that linguistically, slovenes belong to the South Slavic group
But culturally, they have much more in common with central europe, akin to other West Slavic nations
Is it because of the German influence
Yes
But that doesn't somehow nullify their entire culture
Good
Maybe they should consider a blanket ban on social credit scores and more substantial regulation of mass surveillance

Eh, I feel that that one is true, but it's mostly because it's americans that are popularizing it, because they have a huge history of Italian migration, and because of their status as a cultural hegemon

In Slovenia it's the same under a different name except it bans the right to adopt or for lesbian couples to get medical insemination
In many other countries there are even more rights "regular" marriage gives couples that aren't given to people in "special partnerships". From 2006-2016 in Slovenia before big reforms were made there were a bunch of stupid and glaringly discriminatory elements
Like straight couples could get married anywhere (hotel venues, parks, castles) with an official present while gay couples could only get "same-sex registered" at small dingy local administration offices
There were even more problematic sections that didn't allow for automatic hospital visits etc
The law was so worthless that in those 10 years only something like 60 couples actually made use of it
You won't be surprised to find out the 2006 law was written under a SDS/Janša government because of EU pressure to improve gay rights and they deliberately made it as bad as possible
I imagine this was the case in many other countries and that most of those laws written in the mid 00s are still standing
Fuck dude it's like 35°c every day
French coffee is also utter shit, so not sure why his face

I think I've read this guy's comments in the comment sections of some news websites
Happy cake day, Ottoman
The colors are way off
It's a cool 20-25°C here
's pretty nice
For your sake i hope it's dry heat
>you’ll be left with footprints of damage across your lawn
I really like how this is phrased
Good for you

In that case, I think I'll pass
It's the Reichtangle

Have a great day, Germans
Love you guys
Yes, "free wales" protestors
On Slovene, tja means "there", as direction
For example: Prmejduš, da ne grem tja
– Fopdoodle, I’m definitely not going there
Let no one say Europe and the USA don't perfectly complement each other
lol Slovenia, nothing changed in 18 years and we keep promoting our country as green, just sad
Croatia is definetely wrong since it shares the nuclear powerplant with slovenia
Also the Slovenian nuclear portion is most likely overinflated then
Hydroelectric shouldn't be considered "renewable". It's really destructive to environment
if only radioactive waste would also be split in two
Only a few regions are windy enough for wind turbines to be efficient, and even then this is such a small contribution that wouldn't really help much
Well similar with solar, maybe there are more places for solar but  the output would negligible
It is quite complicated
Well yeah, but it's not "green" as in environment friendly
Also AFAIK there were some studies that show, that dams don't only affect micro climate, but also on the wider scale, so they're not reducing the green-house gasses
But I might be wrong, or I've interpreted things in a wrong way
seriously
No offence, but that is not really good argument
You can't pay for bread with hypothetical money
why a problem
If you have a 50% stake in a company then have a 50% percent in its expenses or in this case, radioactive waste
Vem, ampak ne obstajata samo Zagreb in Ljubljana
Potem bi morali plačevati tudi Bulgarom, Srbom, Romunom, če upoštevamo vetrove
Ali pa jim subvencionirati njihovo električno omrežje, glede na našo grožnjo
Sicer sem bral, da bo hrvaški delež odkupljen s strani francozov ter, da so se dogovorili za skladiščenje radioloških odpadkov v Krškem in sicer do datuma prenehanja obratovanja elektrarne ( mislim, da 2043 )
Tako, da bodo tile odpadki še 20 let 100% v naši lasti
Če si 50/50 lastnik plačuješ vse pol pol
Tudi skladiščiš odpadke
Common sense
which was only agreed upon in 2016 I think
Like one said Croatia low and midtier til 2023 and high tier when decomissioned
Lovely fact is that the plant is operational since 1983
How much nuclear waste from 1983 till 2016 was taken by Croatia
Also when the plant shuts down 24-25 years from now, who is to say that they Will change their mind
Nothing against Croatia but is unfair having a 50% stake and have nothing but gains
free energy so to speak
A comparison between the UK and the US would be nice
Italian cuisine is not healthy in the sense that a nutritionist would prescribe it as the optimal diet
It's healthy, because it's balanced, with a high emphasis on fresh, non processed ingredients, lots of vegetables, healthy fats and seafood
And most importantly, Italians in general seem not to overindulge in the unhealthy stuff and value quality over quantity
In my opinion, Italian cuisine is overdone outside Italy and nearby influenced regions
Giant portions of pasta with very fatty sauces, an entire pizza, worth 2000+ calories and many other examples that have mostly been popularized by "Italian" Americans
Deep fried "mozzarella" sticks are not really Italian food
Cheese stuffed pizza crust isn't either
And this is clear from Italy's obesity rate and life expectancy
EDIT: LPT: If you're searching for restaurant reviews online as a tourist, sorting by language and selecting Italian is generally the way to go -- Italians know good food
Well, umm, yeah
In 2015 she was still on the pro-EU side of the Tories
Yeah it is funny that in Trieste, there are a lot of neo-fascists
Isn't that every table in Austria then
So *that's* where GRRM got the idea from for the battle of blackwater
...and there was much rejoicing
Nice
We also have something very similar in Slovenia
It’s called Wild Lake (Divje jezero) and it is about 160 meters deep
It's also a source of the Jezernica River, which is the shortest river in Slovenia (55 meters)

I like Yugoslavia
I will skin you and cover you in salt
Damn Greece got roasted
Yugoslavia
I'm erect
If you are russian, you probably like this map, you got the baltic states, Belarus and it says Russia on Ukraine so you get that too
Putin would be proud
Imagine if Yugoslavia got Trieste
The goal of the Russian military doctrine is to secure a buffer zone between them and powerfull western European countries
If the Us puts rockets in northern Ukraine then you are finished
We agree that Trst/Trieste is not Italian
I'm amazed they even use *public* transport

*checks foundations of geopolitics suspiciously*
In soviet Russia flair references you
And now many people seem to want out
I'm very pacifistic but I'm not naive
Since NATO was basically formed to oppose the Soviet Union, which disbanded over 17 years ago, its a bit puzzling why it has only expanded since
They're the only credible positive version of the future that I've seen proposed
There's absolutely a lot of negative versions which might win out instead
I know you guys basically first experimented with democracy, but let's not forget how that experiment ended
It was not the Delian League that won the Peloponnesian War, but the Peloponnesian League, with support from the Persians
We certainly need allies, we can't exactly defend ourselves alone
But as Melania's husband showed us recently, NATO isn't exactly a stable alliance anymore
Honestly, I'd prefer a nice regional alliance over NATO
Out interests aren't the same as the USA's, or Turkey's, or the UK's, and I wouldn't want us to be dragged into another war just because someone went and poked the bear
Oh I agree, I would love that
Unfortunately until we have that option we should stay in NATO

UK will have no representatives
So no voice . That would matter if EU would pass something and then in negotiations demand UK follows
That's how r/europe has always been and a primary reason why I stopped being a regular here
Anything going against the holy EU should be destroyed mentality here is too strong
We can finally change the name from Brexit to Stupid Brexit
Where the UK has to follow every EU rule without any say in it
Malta: Fuck
Lmao
It's probably worth something
People collect WW2 era and nazi stuff a lot
Surprised no one took it yet
Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Ticket
Being relevant on the world stage is overrated anyway
Common folk don't benefit from it and it only invites chaos and challengers
It's imperialist ambitions, like the EU's, that ravaged the continent in the 19th and 20th centuries
United in diversity is a utopia
I'm all for it, I love Europe and people who live here, but there isn't nearly enough people who think this way
I love it how the guy casually reverses as if he can see anything out of the car hahah hilarious
*Gulf of Piran intensifies*
I'm sure this will be part of any deal US and post brexit UK will sign
I'm pretty sure EU food safety regulations don't allow chemically washed chicken or other meat
The problem is not chlorine itself, that gets washed out before you eat it
The problem is that washing it in chlorine, or any other acid really, allows much worse farm conditions
Also it kills bacteria in the meat, but doesn't remove existing products of said bacteria, which can be toxic
Depends on price
And whether business that sell food will use and whether they'll be forced to disclose that
And of course price of such food
I suspect a lot of health, safety and workers protection regulations will change
With party that blamed EU for all sorts of problems and complained about excessive regulations and made that one of reasons for Brexit in power
Not likely
Wait, why are they destroying mid 20th century architecture
That channel also happens to be a standing joke to most Slovenians; though I hope that we eventually get some good non biased media (other channels while better have a decisively left / governmental / EU-fanboy bias)
How is this possible, we don't even have 1cm, nothing, nada

We have this in some stores in Slovenia as well
It's reuse bottles for same type of shampoo, but maybe it will spread
I remember that something like 30 years ago there were stores where you could buy liquid detergent and softener this way, you came there with your own bottle and they poured predetermined amount into it
It was discontinued because it was old fashioned
USA is in 45th place
and they always praise their country as the only freedom land, pathetic
Even here we can't get rid of Slovakia
Slovenia'a press freedom is going down since Janez Janša is prime president
What's the deal with Singapore
Considering it's often painted as quite a progressive country, it's pretty shocking to see them just barely ahead of the likes of Iraq, Somalia and Libya
I am pretty sure that kind of porn is illegal in the UK
There is not enough flats in Slovenia or they are expensive as fu\*k for young people
I also stayed away from parents for 4 years when I was studying
In a student home but I would never call that a home or moving away from parents
Well well well, don't I feel vindicated
65 down-votes and counting over my defending Russia being called a "terrorist state" in yesterday's thread about this supposed assassination
I think there must be something really wrong with you to do something like that to your wife (if she really didn't know)
Is that some kind of a proverb
It doesn't make any sense to me
The mental gymnastics going on in your comment is amazing
From my understanding, it was Russian-backed and directed revolutionaries that shot down a civilian airliner due to some sort of mix-up
Still, this whole situation with the journalist seems too suspicious
Was this a failed attempt by Russian-contracted Ukrainian veterans to murder a Russian journalist
Possibly
Was the whole thing falsified to further harm Russia's standing
Also Possible
I'm not denying Russia does some shady shit, I'm just saying they aren't that much worse than our "allies" to the west
True, the Slovenian army is incapable of defending the country, even our own airspace is guarded by Hungary
Still, Slovenia is one of the few EU member states that is willing to be cordial with Putin's Russia it seems, it does certainly help that we've had very, very limited contact with Russia throughout history
Here is how I see things: Russia not only is a super power (terrorist state or otherwise), but is the one super power in our backyard
Fear of Russia may be the one thing keeping NATO and the EU together in the future and as soon as the discontent of its members is greater than that fear, then the whole thing comes tumbling down
The state we are currently in, supposedly as bad as the height of the cold war, is in no way entirely the fault of Putin's Russia
It takes two to tango
And as far as the situation in eastern Ukraine is concerned, the Russians are protecting their interests after the revolution backed by our so-called allies, protecting minorities and the like
Sure, Russian troops are there, but they certainly aren't the only ones fighting
You guys have legitimate grievances with Russia, I'm not denying that
But considering the situation the revolution put Russia into, this was the only possible outcome
Hungary's finally happy I guess
Now we are ner France and uk now
Hell yeah
At least we got a longer coastline now
And we appear to be in the vanguard
Thankfully the Germans moved away
Even now that they dont have your 17th state

Western Slovenia stronk
What the hell
West europeans say, slovenia is part of the balkan, while balkan people say we are european
I dobt think a map was ever as accurate as this one
Less developed part of Slovenia reporting in
\*happily looking at map to find Maribor under developed regions\*
&#x200B;
JAZZ MUSIC STOPS
This map feels off, though
I'd put eastern side as transitional region, there's no way it's on same level as freaking entire Bulgaria
I live in the east, it never feels like west is that much better when I visit
Maybe the border regions are pulling the rest of us down
I feel like Savinjska is pretty well developed
Absolutely agree
The industry
On the west is more likely high-tech, service-based and export oriented
While on the east, agricultural, manufacture and labor intensive
But, correct me if I'm wrong
One factor to consider: Commuters to Ljubljana count as residents of the east but contribute to the GDP of the west
Half of Notranjska and practically the whole of Zasavje are within Ljubljana’s commuter belt
Podravje is 4th out of 12 regions by GDP per capita
From the bottom
They butchered our beautiful city
Developed in consideration of all the countries in the world
This map shows development compared to other EU countries
Could be, yes
East is definitely more suitable for agriculture
Although Novo Mesto and Kočevje are in the red here
They should be pulling us up
I hope Celje starts growing again
No idea about Maribor, it's a failed town
Why is Notranjska less developed
I don't know much about that region at all
They would have made Ljubljana a seperate region, like other countries do with their capitals, if that played any part
You also forgot Krško with our only nuclear power plant, Gen I and others
I could be mistaken, but Posavje is one of the most important arteries of the Slovenian power infrastructure
I don't understand why it would be considered under developed
By gdp per capita it went like this in 2018:
Osrednje slovenska
Obalno-kraška
Jugovzhodna Slovenija
Savinjska
Goriška
Gorenjska
Posavska
Koroška
Podravska
Primorsko-notranjska
Pomurska
Zasavska
Sometimes when I drive around the country, I really wonder where people in some more remote regions work
Like fucking Baška grapa
It felt like eternity to drive through and roads were super narrow
But all the houses were nice and all was beautiful
Same in many other places
Higher up the hill, more remote, nicer the houses
We have 2 cohesion regions
only Croatia and Blatics have 1
The point is, western region is probably not blue because it has Ljubljana
They would have made Ljubljana a separate region if that would mean more money
Interesting, is this from surs
I'd like to further research this
Yep
stat
Bruto domači proizvod na prebivalca (EUR), statistične regije, Slovenija, letno
I don't know, I'm under impression countries decide these regions by themselves
I read an article pointing to this same issue, how countries manipulate their regions to get the most money possible
This isn't that accurate
There are many missing, for sure
Just in Slovenia we have 16 Roman settlements and towns, while only one (Emona, present day Ljubljana)  is listed on this map
The missing ones are: Ad Malum/Ad Pirum, Aegida - Capris, Atrans, **Carnium**, Colatio, Castrum ad Fluvium Frigidum, **Celeia**, Longaticum, Metulum, **Nauportus**, Neviodunum, **Peotovio**, Praetorium Latobicorum, Pyrrhanum, Romula
*Perhaps you could argue that some cities were founded as "an order" from the empire as military settlements, while others sprung up spontaneously as civilian cities*, but that's not clarified in the case of this map :)
Missing Petovio and Celeia in Slovenia
In Slovenia I think there are far more than just Ljubljana
It's also missing a bunch of cities
I can tell you about 5 that are missing in Slovenia, off the top of my head
Depends on how you define a city
It would be perfectly reasonable to call all cities in Slovenia except for Ljubljana towns
Also, this map is about cities that were *founded* by the Romans
Celje, for example, already existed before the Romans took it over
But I'm sure that some of the dots on this map represent cities that are also small or were not actually founded by the Romans
Are they all so chill there
Apparently socks and sandals are the new hipster thing
Seriously
just no
TIL the colours of German and Belgian flags actually aren't in the same order
Never noticed it before
I guess I'm dumb
Its going to be trash
YUROP STRONG
We have a yearly [March along barbed wire] to celebrate liberation of Ljubljana
It goes along where Italians set up a [barbed wire] during WW2 when they occupied the city
Am I missing something
Looking out of my window in Slovenia and there isn't even 1cm of snow
At least you seem to be having fun with yours though
In Ljubljana, we have about half a bottle of snow
Yeah man i wish it was 4m of snow here
We do not have 4m of snow in Slovenia
Wow thanks, that's clever actually
1 room for pre WW2 era and couple of rooms for WW2 era so nobody can say they completely ignore them
Yeah but you have to consider that's *on top* off all the nations' own bureaucracies
I see he's taking a picture with a group of Portu-gals
The entire world population at the time is estimated to be around 5 million people
I wonder how many lived in Europe
You don't know that
Have you been there
Having family from Belgrade Serbia and Sarajevo and Tuzla in Bosnia, reading threads like this is really hard
First using the term 'Serbia' and not the 'Serb government and/or military of the 90s' is actually branding the whole nation as killers and terrorists
Drawing comparison to ISIS is especially distrurbing and sick, especially if you consider that 99% of the people didn't know what was happening on the front lines, as each republic was spewing hate and concealing all information which would tell its citizens what's actually happening
It was always the other sides fault
Slovenians caused the breakup if you ask Serbs
Croatians conned Slovenians into a referendum if you ask Slovenians
Croatians were mass murderers (due to ndh) and wanted to kill all in Knin just because they're Serbs
Muslims and Croatians are ganging up on Serb minority in Bosnia and we have to defend them
Slovenians were embargoed by Serbs just out of spite (according to Slovenia) and had to leave the federation or they'd starve to death
The list of BS goes on and on, and normal citizens didn't have a clue what's actually happening
Most people to this day don't know what happened
All 3 government sides in the war benefited hugely from prolonging the war, and was disregarding any human casualties or impacts as long as it helped their interest
I know objectivity is almost impossible in threads like this but some people really need to think before they post
And the fact that so many people here are explaining historical events with such authority and are rewriting half of it is a darn shame
Especially as Europeans with no knowledge of the Balkans wars take these things as hard facts
As the title says
Never forget
Edit: formatting
Because it happened 20 years ago
A portion of people just as a portion of Croats support Gotovina and a portion of Bosnians are totally fine with mudjahedins and Wahhabis fighting and supporting their cause
But that sure won't keep you from talking further nonsense
>Which 3 sides
Slovenia, Croatia and Serbia
First of all, I think you can't put Bosnia in there because I doubt there wasuxh profit from us, considering that Serbia was much better equipped than us
I also don't think that Croatia or Slovenia would profit from prolonging the war (perhaps attempting to gain more land
), but I don't know much about that, there are probably some Croats or Slovenians here to comment on that
Serbia also didn't profit from having 3 wars simultaneously, but it was in their interest to keep Yugoslavia together and stop the republics from gaining independence
Again missing the point
The profit and interest was with individuals running the countries and not countries in general
And yes Izedbegovic had a massive interest as his rise to power was done by using the war to make the running president seen incompetent, and Alija's second term was forced in a similar way as Bush Jr
, which was telling people that no matter how bad of a president he was, it would be a disaster for the security of the country if the president is changed in the middle of the conflict
Believe it or not, he could have ended the war before his second term was up, but he would have lost the position if he would
So he decided to screw the country for his benefit
And Ahtisati and other EU big boys supported Alija in his plans as they knew how to work with him, and any new person is a potential risk
yes loads of bad and sick interests on all sides and absolutely no regards for human lives, even their own countryman
Similarly bad was Milosevic excuse to defend Serbs in Republica Srbska in Bosnia, but when he realised they don't care for him, that they have their local politicians and aligences, Slobo pulled all support and let them rot
He would have lost his majority if Republica Srpska would have joined Srbija
Politics are nasty business and anyone that thinks any of the leaders cared for the people is insane, and any of the generals were not looting and murdering phycopaths is delusional
Slobo didn't care about Yugoslavia, Alija didn't care about BiH, Kucan didn't care about Slovenia, and Tudjman about Croatia
They all wanted all the power for themselves and being in a federation is the opposite of that
They all wanted to control everything they could
Please tell me how our students in highschool learn about independance war
Plot twist: they don't.
At least we weren't. Probably because main actors are still alive and beeing part of politics

People of Catalonia: don't forget that there are others who support your fight for independence and remain strong
People also thought that Slovenia and Croatia will never become recognised and that Yugoslavia will just fix its problems, well that never happened
Same goes for Spain
Also a country that has a suppression of regions written in its constitution shouldn't be considered democratic at all
If supposedly totalitarian Yugoslavia had in its constitution the right for nation to self-determine, then Spain is truly a totalitarian state who never dealt with its fascist roots

Slovenians when we see our country mentioned anywhere: "I don't have anything meaningful to contribute but I will comment anyway so people know Slovenians noticed this
Kdo bo naredu crosspost
Ma petek je, se mi ne da
Se lahko assemblamo naslednji teden
Ljubljana is pretty strange because the architecture outside of the places that tourists photograph is very mixed
Theres portions of the city where you can see austrian baroque façades, brutalist yugoslav buildings, and modern glass and steel building right next to one another
This is fairly new 5 star hotel
It really changed the landscape of the city

Fascinating
u/a-soul-in-tension can you please the provide the source for book sales though
I tried to find the numbers in the [document that is supposed to contain the source data] but sadly my rudimentary knowledge of Turkish and google translate have not been enough
Maybe some Turk can help here
However, I *have* thrown together a rudimentary [comparison of % of 'No' votes and number of books read per person in region in Turkey] and I see no significant correlation to confirm this hurr-durr-stupid-people-are-stupid circlejerk going on is at all justified
Again though, I might have misread the data ... but see for yourself
Sorry, I don't think OP's map has much to do with anything
Likewise
I'm not saying the connection isn't likely, but it should be compared with book sales per capita per region
Edit: and obviously not treated as some kind of first-past-the-post system
*I see a red-blue map and I want it painted purple*
Edit 2: and the percentage of books sold, while at first it appears to indicate education levels, probably has more to do with wealth
of books read per year per person would be a much better indicator, imo
Thanks
Time to brush up my türkçe :D
Edit: Sorry, but, I don't see any data on book sales or anything like that, just reading habits and library membership
And this data doesn't seem to corroborate the posted map ( [see my other comment] )
I think I'll take the map with a metric ton of salt
YOLO
Google search indicates that this is an image of "Hitler´s Eye Tunnel, Šibenik, Croatia" not the one on Vis
It's sad how every single Internet Warrior commenting here won't do jack shit to help the situation
If your symptoms are bad enough that you would see a doctor without the pandemic, they are bad enough to see your doctor now
**Just call first
There is no cure for the virus itself
Hospitals will only treat the symptoms while the virus runs its course
That's why testing isn't so important, they will treat you the same whether you have the coronavirus or not
Edit: to make it even clearer: DO NOT GO TO ANY DOCTOR WITHOUT CALLING FIRST
> Article 5 is only for defensive wars
On paper only
Yugoslavia, Libya are both NATO wars
Turkey was also invading Syria when it shot down Russian plane and NATO stood by Turkey
Who cares whats written on toilet paper
NATO went to war because France got a small dick complex and wanted "military glory". And Libyan gold
NATO wages wars when important countries order it
Articles are there for gullible fools so they can lie to themselves how its defensive alliance only
Libya literally was NATO war under NATO command
Syria is war with NATO members and their bff's like KSA
You misunderstood me
Im not arguing about invoking article 5, im arguing about NATO being defensive in nature - as stated by its articles
NATO does attack countries, even as an entity, not only its members
Articles are there so in case someone dares to actually hit back as in counter invade
Libya was prime example were they didnt even need to counter invade, it was enough for France to fail to topple Gadafi on their own
All of NATO was not involved because it simply wasnt needed
Same as Armenia not invoking CSTO because they dont see the need for it yet
If Armenia invokes CSTO and Russia sees a need to pacify Turkey, in order to defend its ally, you can bet your burger ass that NATO will be mobilised to defend them
NATO already sent SAMs to Turkey when Turkey was attacking Syria
When Turkey shot down Russian plane, that was attacking Turkish headcutters, NATO publicly declared they stand behind Turkey
So you already have an actual precedent of that happening
Yes, the important countries made a decision and others followed
r/GenZedong virgins are gonna storm your comment section, OP
Be ready to be enlightened about how the protestors were actually evil fascists and how the communists actually protected the worker rights by attacking the workers
It was a great moment for the Soviet Union and a great moment for humanity

There is unproportionally more posts about slovenia in /r/europe than there is percentage of slovenian people in Europe
Ia it just me or are here mostly pics of slovenia
Lake Bled is everywhere
Ta teden jezero Jasna
Of course why wouldnt we
Lake Jasna Slovenia
Hehe yeah
Haven't heard that one before
This is in the Alps hah

Don't give them any ideas

During the winter that region is almost always coverd in snow
Yes you are right we must keep our secrets, btw i have always wanted to see Transylvania in what time of the year would you recommend visiting it
Nope
And the ski slopes are closed as well
Well, Croatia is defenitely not Central Europe
As a slovene boi, Im excited about being in the same region as Trieste(Trst)
Do ypu guys think there are regions in Europes future or will we remain as countries
Croatia can finally into West
No, Slovenia is both beer and wine
Yes, Slovenia is a central power
But eg
Slavic Europe is no better at describing things than Central Europe
Okay, the language has similar roots, but the culture
It really isn’t that similar
Slovenia is Central European
Yes, we are Slavic, but culturally we are much closer to Austria and other Central European countries
>But I don't think eastern European is an insult
Not an insult, but definitely derogatory on an international level
If it weren't, then there wouldn't be such a big deal about it
>Despite the mental gymnastics some of these maps do to not call some countries eastern, I've never been ashamed to call myself an eastern European
It's mainly a geographical term
There are 4 types of Eastern Europe; political, cultural, religious, and geographical, in decreasing order of usage
-Political Eastern Europe is East of the Iron Curtain, or everything that was under the Soviets
-Cultural Eastern Europe is mostly similar to political EE, it being Slavic countries
-Religious Eastern Europe is Orthodox Christian
-Geographical Eastern Europe is harder to define, because it depends on which regions one uses (East/West, East/West/Central, East/West/Central/North/South, East/West/Central/North/South/Southeast/Southwest,...), and because there aren't any geographical markers to go by (like the Ural mountains for example)
P.S. Nick the Greek reminds me of Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels :)
Where Slovenia, Austria and Italy meet
Inhabited by Slovenes on all three sides
OC picture moreš dat, če je tvoja, drugače ti bojo zbrisal
Hello
Instagram purposes way before Instagram was a thing
We Slovenes like that it's underrated
That way we have peace and quiet
You basically described Slovenia
Right
I just now realised how many neighbors you actually have
I think there are church and radio transmission tower there
Yes of course because the US is way older than Europe
Snow is gone, u?
It's kinda going to shits, if you ask me
I don't think anyone lives on the island
It's tiny and that would be super inconvenient
Maybe the people who run that restaurant I guess
Well since Christmas is at the height of summer in Australia, a white one is very unlikely
Corona
We have some heavy measures and political tensions because of it
I agree, but the problem is the cases are *still* going up despite the measures we have
By all accounts, they're already pretty heavy and I am not sure what more can be done
We have to wear masks everywhere, we're on complete lockdown and people are also breaking measures because they're just sick of them already (how many people still disinfect their hands at stores
) and outright break curfews as well as travelling to other counties
Check up r/slovenia of people outright suggesting to a guy who wants to visit his gf what excuse he should give in case he is stopped by the police
Imo, it's not the measures that are the problem, but the people
its our premier, wannabe trump, shutting down news agency and we still have ~26% positive rate for more than 2 weeks, going nowhere
I wanter to write cool until I saw this comment
Why are people mad
Have they forgotten what happened early to mid 20th century
The UK leaving implies that a strong unified peaceful Europe may not be able to exist
That's why I'm mad, because the project is slowly falling apart
People say that the EU is fucking them but trust me, when the project dies and war breaks out again in Europe, people will remember the EU
You might think "The chances of war breaking out in this day and age are close to 0
No way it would happen
" but trust me it certainly can
Yes it is but instead of the member countries trying to help fix whatever bs is going on, they're leaving, that's the problem, there's no unity
Might as well call it the Broken Empire of Europe
fuck yeah
Great job Italy, bravo
the worst will come in 2 weeks
Gloomy autumn day in Ljubljana, Slovenia
Mmmm ni je čez Ljubljano
Takoj ko bojo občine odprte pridem
Man i miss home
Not LJ, but we also had bad weather
I couldn't ride my bike and couldn't wrench on my other bike either because the tool I need didn't arrive yet
Did some things around the house instead
Dober dan
Ne morem verjet da ni spet Bled že 24794tič.

You have to add Dalmatia and Istria as well
Yes when there is a lot of rain it turns brown because it lifts the mud from the bottom of the river otherwise its green
I can tell you that they are lol
It's so easy
You just need to spell "Ljublj", then add "Ana" in the end
It was very rainy thats why its brown its usually green
But only a veeery short stretch of the city
Doma je res najlepše

Pisses me off to see France getting constantly attacked for past years, on top of domestic instability
I wish my country would help in some way, now is the right time to show EU solidarity
Kick all the extremists out
France is for French values
Of that I have no doubt that we are united
I'd say though that overall we have more solidarity than US does
And of that I am proud
What's on Slovenia
France
Ustaše? What does that have to do with us
It's not about bad decisions the EU made, but decisions **I** don't agree with
Like there is a system where everyone can agree with everyone
WHYYY, HOOOW
Nippy
We were in Poland just two weeks ago for new years and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised
Our apartment was in Krakow but we took a day trip to Warsaw and I loved the architecture there (as we don’t really have that many skyscrapers back home)
[Me every time there's a pro-monarchist post at Europe]
Stay strong my dutch friends
You know we live in shitty times when my first reaction was: Cmon, not this shit again
It is getting boring
I hope everybody will be OK
Should be that we are part of the Balkans or eastern Europe for Slovenia
Nobody would take the "Alpine Serbs" thing seriously
Can confirm the one for Poland
Very effective when I want to trigger Poles on reddit
You'd annoy us by calling us Eastern European
Alpine Serbs just makes me chuckle a bit
Do you guys also get annoyed by bad Australia jokes
What about cellar Jokes
Or pointing out that Mozart was actually German
This comment deserves to be higher
The music in this video is the [Alpine folk music] though
This
What is their problem with breaking spaghetti
It's the sensible thing to do
Did you mean "Resistance is futile"? Or am I missing your point
Am I the only one who feels wrong about the fact that Germany supported our independance

Should I have written more double vowels
I hope that reading that no Finn thought I was mocking the language
I actually find it a curious how Italian is often adored, yet Finnish is the butt of jokes, while they're both vowel-rich languages
The missing data: I'd say Slovenia is dark red as well
(source: myself, a native)
They have data for Croatia and Serbia but not for Slovenia
Alright, I see how it is
Let's make "Less than 500" and "No Data" almost the same color
What a great idea
I've heard Frisian is somewhat intelligible with Old English
Bled 2
And
It's also our only island
We have no other island to show off
not true, there's one in cross cave
It would take way too many resources for that
man
dutch people do know how to shape the planet
Due to economic problems caused by Corona Croatia doesn't have any fucks left to give
Pizza burek :)
Slavic languages are related, who knew
Well, it's still kinda different in slovenian, isn't it
Because Slovenia is strange and whatnot
"Nadaljujemo
Basically derived from the same word "dalje", which means far
"Nadalje" can means further/continue
"-ujemo" in the end just means we would make/act (on it)
We can also instead say "gremo naprej", which mean we go on
Someone please correct me on this, Slovenian is not my native language
It's like some sort of hybrid between Yugoslavia and Austro-Hungarian Empire
Do we get to keep Trieste this time
> Jansa
He's on his way out at least, they're holding a vote of no confidence next week that's expected to pass
Took them fuckin long enough
Living in Slovenia I remember crossing into Austria or Italy and border controls there on both sides
Driving through those crossings after Schengen it was weird seeing those buildings empty
Not entirely abandoned because there was still activity there but no controls
Then starting few years back Austria and Germany reinstated them due to migrants so I was thinking "are we going back to square 1
" and now it's even worse with borders actually closed
I live close to Austria, and it feels so good, to just go through the border without any stopping
I was visiting Prague this weekend for Metronome festival, attended the protest spontaneously today
Full support
I got a badge also, what does it mean
T-55 has max speed of 51km/h. Unless she was going snail mode there's no way it was following her let alone aim at her
I would stop
And the idea that someone would bother to even keep a tank gun pointed at some random car for 20km at snails pace is idiotic
Even more so when you take into account that there was no auto tracking at that time
More likely she saw a tank driving with gun pointed front like it normally is during travel and it became a story for her grandchild
Thats not what he said
> Trabant
100km/h
> Polski Fiat
113km/h
With alleged tank following you at alleged gun point for 20km
What reason would that be
Freshly done lobotomy
If you see a tank driving behind you with a cannon pointed at you, what do you do
Intentionally slow down to match its speed and stay on same course, stop and move out of way or speed up even if slightly
Anyone picking 1st option is either a moron or has different agenda from merely going to his own destination
Or perhaps she just wasnt threatened by a tank that likely didnt even bother pointing a gun at her
Making excuses for unlikely scenarios doesnt lend any credibility to OP's story
UK Parliament seems to be like a sitcom at this point
Did he actually, half-heartedly shout "roar"?
Come on cis people, wake the fuck up
Yes and how many of you know the isses Germany is causing because of this stubborn no nuclear approach
How many of you know that  a few months ago we had to start up and disrupt normal operations of our power plants to "save" Germany or they would have been without power
How many of you know what Germany is doing to tha Balkans to keep up the sharade of them relying on unreliable power aources
FREUDE
Yes, yes
but what has it done for me
......brexit logic
I would love to see that in live and feel some adrenaline
I don't know why you put the mythical €500 banknote in there as well
Wheres in war some idiot with ATGM can ruin your day
Also depends on countries in question
They have a lot of common points that are not nation-specific, such as anti-immigrant, sexual minorities, liberalism/left wing policies, women's rights, vague anti-EU sentiment, racism/xenophobia
Then there are points where some care for them but others are indifferent, such as role of church
Where they are in conflict weaker ones pretend they are not in conflict
For example Italian revisionism and "we were victims
" attitude to WW2 and immediate post war period
Slovenian far right parts is close to Italian far right otherwise and when it comes to this they pretend Italians aren't saying anything rather than get upset and ruin otherwise cozy relations
Same with Hungary only Orban is more subtle about it
Jebiga, življenje ni potica
I'm wondering, what's with the police officers on the photo in the article
They're wearing body armour and weapons and all that but wearing some casual jeans and sneakers
What's up with that
Let's see if the anger is not only going to last couple of days
Thank you for your answer
Considering sexual preference isn't a choice and isn't contagious, you may sleep soundly knowing that your cat won't turn gay overnight

> That's despite events like Chernobyl being the result of a lot of human error
While I agree that dangers of Nuclear are way overblown in public perception, I don't think that is really any consolation
Human error was and will always be present
Coal contains a small amount of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes
After the coal is burned in a furnace, the non-flammable isotopes are concentrated in the ash that is left
This ash is typically dumped in the environment, contributing much more radiation above the natural background than any spent fuel from a nuclear power plant
Grinding spent fuel into a fine dust and then dumping it in the ocean would actually be a viable way to get rid of it since the volume of the ocean would dilute it to completely safe levels
Of course this would not fly with the general public
Completely agree with you
However, to get the new technology to mature and to actually build plants with that technology it would take decades
But we need to solve climate problem NOW
Slovenia has that many christians wtf
It's probably all old people
Wonder what bar would look like if we did this study on Reddit, 99% red
What is really funny is that in the light of recent events/news I can't even tell whether this is a joke or not
Iceland dealing with important issues I see
Sub of fools
I disagree
You see, pineapple on a pizza is a bit like incest - even though it can be a victimless crime in some circumstances, it so offends the moral sensibility of normal people that it ought to be illegal
Probably expecting another inevitable chicken deficit because of brexit
Kinda looks like a smaller, less depressing version of [kowloon walled city]

Spain is, imo, the best tourist destination in Europe
That's breathtaking
Dear Scots, you're more than welcome in Slovenia
I need a good drinking buddy after class
And that is 1794 years too late
(i know it's not historically accurate but you get the point)
Well this whole ordeal put the nail in the coffin on any kind of sensible discussion of these problematic areas
It’s quite rare for a Slovene to say “prekleto”... “sranje”, for example, is much more common
Prokleto
Pizda, ne me jebat
"Prekleto" literally means "damn", so
The people that consider Slovenia as Balkan usually are not from the Balkans

Slovenias should take note
Director on national public health was seen mulitple times with out the mask, few ministers that have been tested positive go about all willy nilly
One even did a short promo for a gallary
Yet when any one else is out with no mask they get finned minimal of 400eu
Christians
It's good for tax reasons
If you live with someone and plan to keep it that way, you might as well tie the knot and get something out of it
It's missing one relevant variation of the question, though: "Would you feel comfortable if one of your children were in a relationship with a person from one of the countries down south
Us too
Probably just walked away
Who would think about a question like this
Probably
I don't know about you, but Bosniaks aren't culturally almost the same as us
Not that it matters, we got used to it
Agreed, there's a big cultural difference
Nope
81% for Slovenia
(page 24 [here]
I don't know
Having a relationship of any kind is taboo now
Familiarity with a culture doesn't mean the same culture
They're definitely closer culturally than Afghanistanis (if I give an extreme example), but still not the same
Habit is not the only component of culture
Well you got a point there
Perhaps
The largest minorities are immigrants from ex-Yu countries and their children, Albanians, Roma, Italians and Hungarians
I think it's mostly how the question was phrased
> how comfortable they would feel if one of their sons or daughters was in a love relationship with a person from a different ethnic group
This would be taken to mean "anyone but Slovene". In this light, the percentage makes sense
Slovenes may not be nationalistic, but they can be quite xenophobic
Especially towards the people from 'down south'.
Music
Religion
Traditions
Ring a bell
I'm not talking about uniqueness, I'm talking about non-similarities with Bosnian culture
YOUR habits do not equal Slovene culture
You're diminishing all the cultural aspects of all European cultures and making them all the same
Bosnian culture is NOT almost the same as Slovene culture
It's like saying Slovene culture is almost the same as Norwegian culture because YOU don't listen to Slovene music and follow religion
You make no sense
Culture is culture
Ja, to je kultura
In kaj je za tebe kultura
Basanje z bureki v petek zvečer in žar enkrat na mesec poleti

Why are you bringing integration of migrants into this
The talk is about Slovene and Bosnian culture
Heritage is culture
Religion is culture
Music is culture
Tradition is culture
All that is different in Slovene and Bosnian culture
**Integration** of migrants has to do with teaching them laws and social norms, not **assimilating** them into our culture
Ne vem, a niste imeli Etike in družbe v šoli, kjer ste se učili pojme kot so nacionalnost, državljanstvo, narod in podobno
Očitno ti živiš v eni popolnoma drugi državi al pa imaš zelo izkrivljen pogled na svoje sonarodnjake
"Podeželje, kot ga jaz vidim"
Kakšna očala pa ti nosiš :)
Ker je kar malo čudno, da glede na to da se tile planšarji vsak dan pijani tolčejo malone do smrti, uradna statistika pravi da je kriminala in nasilja veliko več v lj in drugih "mestih".
Ja, najboljš, da kr vse prebivalce zemlje posplošiš. Drugje nimajo prometnih nesreč in družinskih tragedij
A potem imajo tudi v drugih državah 'kmetavze' in 'frajerje', ki dirkajo in se pretepajo vse poprek
Res zelo žalostno razmišljaš.
Glej jst sem iz Posavje in tukaj je takšnih in drugačnih ljudi, ampak velika večina je povsem normalnih ljudi
Ni treba iz enega posploševanja na drugo skakat
Ne bom trdil, da nimajo te občine svojih problemov, ampak je pa daleč od tega, da bi bila večina prebivalcev teh občin "kmetavzov
Moj oče se ukvarja s kmetijstvom in jaz sem mu (in mu še danes) velikokrat pomagal pri tem, ampak nisem zaradi tega postal kmetavz, čeprav sem bil bolj v stiku s kmetijstvom od mladih let, kot pa je večina ljudi danes v Sloveniji
Neumne ljudi najdeš v mestih in podeželju, večina prebivalcev pa je povsem normalna
In kaj naj bi tile podatki povedali
Link ki si ga prilepil kaže statistiko po upravnih enotah - nič pa ne pove, koliko so te enote urbanizirane - torej koliko je več kriminala na podeželju
Ampak tudi če vzameš te podatke in malo posredno sklepaš: regije ki so bolj urbanizirane (recimo lj, maribor, celje, novo mesto) v vseh kategorijah izstopajo navzgor v primerjavi z redko poseljenimi up
enotami zahodne slovenije
V vsakem primeru gre za bulšit
Iz riti vlečeš neke predsodke o podeželju, kjer se baje kmetavzi vsak dan, takoj ko zjutraj pomolzejo kravo in zvrnejo litr šnopsa, usedejo na kros in se gredo mortal kombat v lokalni beznici dokler eden ni mrtev
Najboljš je na eno pretiravanje odgovorit še z večjim pretiravanjem, ja

Lake Bled connoisseur
We're too small even for a number
It seems like the smaller the country is the more they like the Euro
I like our strange European monopoly money
At least we have more coast now
This poll is fake, there is no way 91% of Slovenians support the euro
Kuna is pinned to the euro
So if the euro goes down so does the kuna
Otherwise people here feel nostalgic for the old currency
After adopting the euro the purchasing power dropped
And cluntries like czech republic and poland avoided the 2008 crysis way better because they kept their own currency
They are not richer, but they avoided the crysis better than some eu countries
How do you export tourism

Yes, Trst (or as some might call it "Trieste")  belongs to Slovenia, please fix that
If they were thrown or maybe just fell on the hard ground they can't be "good as new".
I have NEVER said i wouldn't pick them up
All i said is if they fell or were thrown on hard ground they aren't good as new
They are probably damaged
I have never said they are not good to eat
great map
but the dinarske alps are not touching the Alps they end way more south

Its a sad reality that slovenia is in such a bad spot because people simply dont want to pay their bills and other shit like that instead of not being able to pay bills, but hey, at least every 2nd slovenian has a fucking mercedes, audi or bmw, gotta get them loans
Honestly sometimes i think we're the dumbest country in the eu despite our excellent education system
Kinda surprised Slovenia is this high
We're supposed to be better than this
Bruh
>second best Slavic country after Czechia
Really
IIRC we're so neck and neck it's considered a tie
At least in overall quality of life
Could just be a cultural thing, I'm not sure how this data was collected
For example, I always pay my phone bill with a 3 week delay, if it's due on the 14th, I'll usually pay early next month
I pay the rest on time, but not always, I could definitely be counted in this statistic, even if financially I am not that bad off
My mom's household also pays bills late, especially water, even if she is doing well financially
I reckon this common behaviour could amount to quite a swing in the poll
I am, Croatia *has* to be better than this
Here in Slovenia it's mostly pensioners raising the stats, the situation for the large majority of the people is much better
Would't be suprised by something similar down south
We get taxed that much and get shit pay on top of that (Slovenia)
Not surprised we're so high up
Yeah well, half of the shit written in most EULAs is like that but cannot be enforced because it's illegal in the first place

A tale of the demise of Nokia is a tale of grave incompetence
Really
I was not that long ago
I remember it
There is no mystery to it
We were watching a train wreck in slow motion
We were shouting to the driver to stop
But HE knew better
Nokia laughed at iPhone
They laughed at Android
When Samsung, HTC & Co
overtook Nokia with their Android phones, Nokia knew better: There's no money in Android
Why should we make phones and let Google take the profits
They were saying this WHILE their market share was in freefall
We'll just stick to Symbian
It's good enough
The deal with Microsoft was just the last chapter in this awful tale of incompetence
Again
There's no mystery to it

Everybody knew, what is going to happen, if Nokia won't adopt Android
Some commentators begged them to do it
They had the biggest market share
People trusted them
Were they to make Android phones at the time of HTC Desire of Galaxy I, Nokia would remain the biggest  (smart)phone maker to this day
A tale of Nokia is a tale of suicide by incompetence
Something else I forgot to mention
This whole Nokia thing always makes me mad
I mean, we had it
Europe had the biggest phone manufacturer in the world
At the time, that smartphones were getting big
We had the right processor architecture (ARM was British at the time)
Europe could have f***ing rule the smartphone market, spearheading the next technical revolution
But we squandered it
Again
At least we have the cars, right
For now
We still have SAP
Maybe not directly harmful
However the state and church should be separate to prevent potential harm to the democratic process
No organized religion or institution should have power over the state and people’s rights
Just look at the Middle East where secular and democratic nations of 70s turned much more authoritarian and religious
And if you’re going to say this thread isn’t about this, it kinda is because the fact that a priest comes to inaugurate the opening of a hospital is indicative that the state and church are not separated
Shit we bless everything from horses to warehouses
TBH, Servers need a blessing
Everybody forgets to bless their printers, that's why they always turn to evil
That what happens when you have laws protecting consumers
Unfortunately this happens
But I'm sure that supermarkets would sell spoiled food to the consumer if they weren't in place
I dont know in poland, but in slovenia they cant do anything
At least most of shops have discounts on things, that are going to go out of date
There are some organizations that collect that food, but as i know that is kinda illegal
My mum works in a kitchen and officially they arent allowed to take leftovers to home
I start to suspect foul play from you guys
I bet some people went "basement jokes heh, I guess they really like basement or whatever"

Austria is carniola
For someone that cared so much what stood besides roads he sure as hell wasn't good at avoiding those things
As a Slovenian
Fuck Jörg and fuck his FPÖ party
May that racist asshole burn in hell
Carinthian austrians always had to act more nationalist to compensate for the fact that they are germanised Slovenes
Far from it
Based
It's complicated, but Janša is still galaxies away from Jorg
He's pro anything that seems to be currently in vogue with the right because he isn't actually a true right-ish person
He's actually a leftie by heart, but the left was so stacked in Slovenia that they renamed the party from *Socialdemocrat party* to *Slovenian democrat party* (shorthand SDS in both cases)
The fascist portrayal is from our mostly left media that can still stirring up antifascist sentiment in the people from the left of the yugonostalgia
Though, I must say that pro-Trump tweeting blew up spectacularly with the Capitol debacle :-D
In Slovenia we watch home alone (guess all slavic brothers do as well lol)
American/Slovenian here
My parents’ friends’ friends’ owned the home alone house when it was filmed
That is my small connection to home alone fame
Yeah just watched home alone 2 as well
That's so cool
I always love seeing that house, it reminds me of my childhood
Yes i believe that’s right
But I actually know my parents’ friends I guess so two degrees for me
My dumbass thought this was Winterfell for a second

Oh, thanks

Can't count how long I spent sitting by Anger, watching people pass by
Well, duh
Slovenian here
In my elementary school there was 25 to 30 kids per class
The average is scew tho since we have a lot of schools in villages where they have like 10 students
We try to make it so kids don't have to commute far to school (at least in the early grades untill kids turn 10 or so) there are literally 2 schools 10km away from my small town of 10k people and my town already has 2 elementary schools
The class above mine had 3, but gained one because one of my classmates was allowed to skip 1st grade since she already knew how to read, write and do basic math
Lol best flair by far
I remember these comics being the first thing I was reading after learning to read
[I still have them :\)]
Had them in Slovenia
I still can't belive they found so many expressions in Slovenian that involve hair/mustache
"Da mi ne boš več takih v brk' metal
I am pretty sure that Putin wouldn't stand like that
This photo I think will be one for the history books
And I know May is supposedly talking and Trump is listening, but Merkel just looks absolutely miserable here, trying to gain some semblance of control
IDK why some people think he looks childish here
The man is boorish, certainly
But this, this is the very image of defiance against the old order of the day
It's like a political cartoon come to life, and it's glorious

When you don't have a mask and must think outside the box
Similar here in Slovenia
The optimistic forecasts put the temperature at 37°C, the more pessimistic put the temperature at 40°C. Worth noting that the highest temperature ever recorded was 40,8°C. It's gonna be hot hot hot
You misspelled Central Europe
Seriously though, the weather here isn't usually that hot
I think the average temperature is something like 20°c in Ljubljana, comparable to Warsaw (i think the average is 18°c, not completely sure about that)
Nothing to see here, move along
They need to man up
Holy Roman Empire intensifies
Wait can someone please explain
That is probably Slovenia
Oh shut the fuck up Slovak
Slovenija should be on the list
What is Soviet Russia
It is Socialist Russia, get it right, Capitalists

So do we
Debeli četrtek, though our donuts (krofi) are covered with powdered sugar, rather than glazed, typically
It's a holiday in preparation for pust (slavic carneval) which celebrates the end of winter and the coming of spring

They are called "krofi".
KRAAAAAPČIIIII

I’m guessing Slovenia would be mostly in the pink as well lately
Our previous prime minister stepped down in February and a new government was set up by the president and the parliament without any elections
The new right-wing ruling party (especially the prime minister Janez Janša) is very polarising - it either has a sizeable cult following or is hated
Ever since they came to power in March, there have been weekly protests in Ljubljana, demanding the government to step down
Since March there have been many allegations of corruption, allegedly exploiting the corona crisis for their personal financial gain
The prime minister is a good friend of the  equally scandalous Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban, who even previously sponsored their political campaign
He is very Trump-esque on Twitter, demeaning virtually all media and harshly criticising Slovenia's socialist past (although it was the left-wing partisans who liberated the country during WW2 - a sentiment which is still very much alive)
What he has been saying recently was very much in line with the Polish and Hungarian governments, instead of aligning with the rest of the EU and the more progressive nations
His latest hobby is trying to pass a law which would dramatically cut funding for the national TV and radio, while also trying to make them more obedient and supportive of his party
In fact, they (SDS party) even unofficially run their own TV station (Nova24)
It is basically our version of Fox news, spreading a very biased, far-right, nationalist and conservative sentiment
He pretty much refuses to appear on other stations, accusing all other journalists of spreading fake news and collaborating with the deep state
Almost immediately after taking office he/they(SDS) appointed their own people to the heads of police, army, the national institute for public health, the statistical office, the Slovene Intelligence and Security agency and many other national institutions
They also increased their own salaries to the maximum still legal amount (while the country was going through a crisis, but not increasing the salaries of health workers)
Other parties in coalition have also had their share of scandals, with both the minister for economic development and the minister of agriculture being accused of corruption, and two more ministers stepping down due to being in similar circumstances
The government is also under scrutiny regarding how they handled the corona crisis and how they have limited the rights of NGOs when it comes to environmental protection
All in all, a clusterfuck
Honestly, tempting
Are you a failed artist by any chance

Big shoutout to all the brave Polish people saving lives of Brits lately
First Greenfel Tower hero then this
Brave
If this is Italy why is there Trieste on this map
Yeah, a bit like the Gordian knot
He's a regular Alexander, Boris
Am i the only one who thinks this number is a bit far-fetched ? Like i seriously doubt theres so many pedos just in the UK for there to be 19
000 cases of sexual exploitation
Now i suppose it also depends what counts as sexual exploitation, someone touching your leg isnt a sexual exploit but some people might view it as such

Best outcome would be if UK stays in the union
I suspect the current deal, as it is, is best for the EU
It's really silly for UK politicians to expect that the EU will bend over backwards, compromise the union, throw members under the bus just to accommodate all UK demands
A deal would still result in the UK leaving and compromising the rest of the union just to make it easier for the UK is just not going to happen
Let's hope that the 4th of July 2018 will be European Freedom Day

Well that's ironic
His last name `Svoboda` means freedom in slavic languages

That's the first and the only thing that I was looking to find it here
This is more fiction than reality
Because no way we (Slovenia) will close our biggest coal power station, it only recently started operating and it costed 1,5 bn €, way too much to run only for a decade
Am 21 can confirm, started liking EU now this
Yeah, but just the thought of someone that is so detached from how the internet works in politics is worrying
Tensions are rising between Germany and Poland
Slovenia actually had that in constitution but we had to change it when joining EU
So now we extradite our citizens to other EU members for crimes committed in EU
I think that's because he might face death penalty and EU countries don't extradite people for such crimes
So US tends to go around it by asking for extradition on different crime, one that carries no death penalty, and then expanding the charge once they have them
Canada may have same reservations
One case I can think of is single terrorist who survived London Iranian embassy siege in 1980
He was released in early 2000s but UK didn't deport him to Iran as he would be executed there
I think there were similar cases regarding MKO members arrested in EU as well
As you can see from this illustration, it won't matter anyway once Brexit is reached
"Croatian Hachiko". From Croatia (City of Vodnjan) comes a story about a dog's love for a deceased friend
Even though he died four years ago, dog named "Lady" (16) comes everyday, sits and waits for him, in rain, snow or unbearable heat
in front of the door behind which her dear Salko once lived
Stop cutting onions, guys

It's back to 15 °C here
It's been raining since May here
Not in Slovenia
It's raining 90% of the time
16 degrees in Ljubljana atm
To be fair, it does seem to be rather cold in Portugal for this time of the year
It was sort of the same here yesterday
After a few days with perfect sunshine and temperatures close to 30°C, we had miserable weather yesterday with loads of rain and temperatures of around 16°C. Didn't feel like Summer at all
I would pay for 14°C right now
No I don't
Yellow circle gang (I'm from northern Slovenia)
We're melting in Koper
I much prefer the rain to 27°C heat
It kinda is 14 degrees right this moment
Well, yeaterday wasn’t any warmer here
Right, it's just that I visited Portugal (area around Porto) in late September a few years ago and the temperatures were still in high 20s/low 30s, so I was surprised to see that area have temperatures of around 23°C at the moment
Or was it just unusually warm when I was there
Me especially since my birthay is in december
Good for you, I have like 20°C rn and it's also raining
I think its very hot when its 27°C, my ideal temperature is 15°C
Where are you at
I live just North of Ljubljana and the temperature never exceeded 17°C yesterday
Same
I live near Koper
Where are you from
Interesting, i would've thought you were from a southern European country since you like the heat
Ja natürlich we can
Seems legit Italy
Slovenia: english or german; it really depends in which region you live, mine is german because i live near austrian border but students in lets say Ljubljana or Maribor have english
In my part of Slovenia, it's German
In other parts it may be Hungarian, Italian or English
In Slovenia the main second language is English (obviously), especially for the younger generations
Other than that, Serbo-Croatian is the most widely understood and spoken, while German comes third
Italian is spoken by about 10% of the population, being a co-official language in Istrian municipalities
To take your example, my parents born in 1960s in Slovene Istria have learned English, Italian and (only one year) of Serbo-Croatian in school
With the exception of Serbo-Croatian which they do not use, they are fluent in both of those languages
I too had to learn Italian since grade 1 and english since grade 3 and i can speak both quite well
I also took Russian classes later on, but i am far from fluent in it
I'm proud of you, Polishbros
Way to go
I'm glad Poland is FINALLY getting some positive press
This sub has been stuck in a hurrr durrr Eastern Europe bad, throw everyone out rut for far too long, by people that have never been close to the border, let alone actually visited the country
Why did they send so much help
Because they are awesome
I visit Poland several times a year, have driven all over the country, several times over - thank you for all the wonderful nature, super friendly people and amazing food
This is what Europe should be about
I remember when the Austrians did something similar when we needed help with ice rain a couple of years back
Seriously this means so much to the locals, go Poland
Do you seriously think changing a leader solves anything
When the leader is overthrown/changed the new leader still needs to pay the same people for loyalty, make business with immoral organizations to stay in power etc
That's just how politics work
The ruling is the goal, not ruling well
EDIT: I might have worded this a bit too harshly
But the amount of belief I see people have about changing a leader bringing better life is astounding
In western democracies it might work because the productivity of citizens is THE income that the country relies upon thus they need to spend some time in their time in office (which is not limitless) to make something to make people just a bit more productive + it's a crowd pleaser which usually results in second term
Like their situation won't change until the source from where the government gets the money changes
And as it stands right now - there were no news about it
Africa is rife with corruption not because leaders are incompentent bastards but because the productivity of the citizens is so low they are NOT the main source of income thus not worth to spend money on them
Go deeper
Read Dictator's handbook
While Rules for rulers is very clear how politics work, in the book they are written on world examples - Liberia, Zimbambwe, Bell's town in California, Iraq etc
It's so depressingly accurate you have no choice but to change POW
The problem is - the leader could say "no" to these organizations but then they will have problems with rivals who said "yes" to them
Money is needed to keep your supporters loyal - if you make deals with those organizations you have it
Imagine it this way - You have 100
000€ per month to distribute between your supporters
An organization appears that want you to fuck with Iran as much as possible in exchange for giving you 200
000€ per month until the end of your leadership
You can say no and continue distributing 100
000€ but your supporters might overthrow you because a rival came to them and said "Instead of paying you 100
000€ as it is right now if you put me in charge I will pay you 250
000€ per month". You see where I am going with this
If you want to stay in power then you need to do shady stuff to stay in power
Because if you won't then someone else will
Should and does are 2 different things
Government should be the voice of the people but it's not
Government should be filled with people wanting common good but they are not
Why
Because of the reasons written above
Let me elaborate
We all know on reddit we are all goody 2 shoes who would like common wealth to everybody BUT if you were SOMEHOW the 2nd man in the office with an offer of 100
000€ per month in exchange to fuck with the healthcare system would you do it
While morally the answer would be no I am serious practically everybody on this site would give it a thought if not accept it straight
Greed and power go hand in hand
You could jump 2 social classes with that pay and made the future of your family very nice
Or you could be moral - say no and still stay in the middle class telling other people about decision you could make but you didn't because you were moral and most of people would totally respect you for that
And if you think that was not real example - just in a simple town in California people lived in poverty while the officials of that town had 80
000€ per month
I agree with you
What I used was very basic example
In democracies there are way more subtleties than in dictatorships
But that doesn't make my words any less true
Presidents while they can be figurheads they definitely don't need to be
But to remain in the office and enjoy the benefits after it you need to play by the rules OR you pay consequences
They look more comfortable than most benches
Is possibly an art installation
