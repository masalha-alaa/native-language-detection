The founder of the car brand Porsche - Ferdinand Porsche was Czech
He was born in the town of Vratislavice nad Nisou in todays Czech Republic (1875)
Later he got German citizenship, lost the Czechoslovak one and collaborated with Hitler to support his brand
You're making this a notorious "Nikola Tesla" hassle
Yes, from today's perspective you'd call him a German Czech
But you cannot deny a citizenship
I guess that's a question for the historians
I've never heard anything about him having the Austrian citizenship at the time he was born so I don't think people had citizenships back then
Calling everybody Austrian in the whole empire would be very bold anyway
So he was at least Bohemian
>Im Jahr 1934 legte Ferdinand Porsche auf Drängen Hitlers die tschechoslowakische Staatsangehörigkeit ab und nahm die deutsche an

The EU has problems respecting its own rules, like not touching member states internal security
Unless something is done, we might start losing members
Ah well, we will see how that works out, theres a lot of differences im that regard but some basic framework would certainly help
The EU gun ban and the forced migrant quotas mainly
Especially the first one was pretty stupid and there was no reason for it
Well, the fact that it decides to randomly disregard its own rules kinda worries me
It doesnt have the means to force EU member states yet, except economic means or taking away their voting rights, their tried that with either Poland or Hungary, but luckily, that needs to be unanimous
The EU is currently suing the countries that refused them and might fine them
I claim that the development in the EU is worrying, and there are talks of creating a unified army
Maybe the EU project should stop trying to control everything
And yes, countries have different opinions, thats to be expected, the EU shouldnt be here to hammer everyone to have the same opinions, it should be here to bridge the differences
We asked for special treatment regarding the EU gun ban, we were ignored, instead they gave a special exception that can only apply to Switzerland because my country hasnt even existed for 50 years

To me, Czech Republic is an official name and should be always used in a formal way
Czechia is a nice shorted version that I'm still kind of getting used to tbh
For example when I'm introducing the country to somebody, I firstly say I'm from the Czech Republic and as I further talk about the country in conversation, I use the shorted version - Czechia
It's practical and yeah, it also makes sense
We also call it *Česko* in non-formal way

It comes from my city of Brno
When it's been invented, there were a lot of german-speaking people at the time, we were a part of Austria-Hungary so hantec is a mix between Czech and German
Nowadays nobody outside Brno speaks it or understands it and in Brno people understand most of it  but only very few can actually speak it

Hussites used firearms as an imporat part of their doctrine
Pistol comes from píšťala, which is what Hussites called their early guns
Howitzer is derived from houfnice because they were used against crowds (houf) of enemies

You can carry pretty much any other weapon openly though, even things like swords, if youre 18
Ah, a vegan soldier, then
In theory, helmets should improve your safety
In practice, research suggests that car drivers tend to drive more dangerously around cyclists with helmets
The problem is, who decides whats European identity
For example, its completely normal to carry weapons here while its unthinkable just across the border in Germany
Most Germans freak out when you tell them people even carry guns here
Who decides which of these 2 options is European
I think most of us know
But we already have a bitter history of other larger countries trying to shape our culture
We value our freedom, people from other countries value protection even if it comes at the cost of their freedom
Were not exactly gun loving, were freedom loving id say
3% of the population is pretty significant, especially compared to the rest of Europe
Besides, a lot more people carry pepper sprays or other weapons mostly banned in other countries because 'the state is here to protect you'. Overt political correctness isnt an issue here either
Btw, our gun laws arent really lenient, theyre just well made and balanced
8%? Where did you get such a high number
A couple years ago, they had fewer than 2000 carry licences for private persons and, as far as I know, that number has been decreasing steadily for years
Compared to 250,000 in a much smaller country, thats hell of a lot less
Exactly, most people dont care, in the West, they would have banned them already
And yes, most people dont really feel the need but they have a choice in that matter
Yes, but they can't carry them, they can't even have them loaded at home
Try carrying a pepper spray thats not neutered for 'use against animals' if you dont have a licence
Thats right, you need a licence for a stupid pepper spray
Taxis or taxes
I could imagine both
I was kind of thinking that the answer might be "They don't".

Czech self-defense laws arent that different from those in the US
We have no duty to retreat either
The rule here is that you can and might have to use stronger force than the attack to stop it
Not long ago, there was a case where the attacker was choking a guy on the ground, the defender shot him once and killed him
It was ruled as clear self-defense because he had no other option to save his life
The law says that the  defense must not be manifestly *disproportionate* to the attack
A 50 kg girl using lethal force against a 120 kg 2 m unarmed attacker would most likely be perfectly legal, the opposite would most likely be illegal
We can also carry guns for self-defense, almost all gun owners have the licence
In fact, as long as you meet the requirements (no mental issues, law-abiding, passing a test on the relevant laws and basic firearms safety) you have the RIGHT to own a gun for self-defense, something thats completely unheard of in most European countries
Other weapons are not regulated at all
You can even carry a sword, if you want
We are among the safest countries in Europe so I guess it works just fine
&#x200B;
You can find more information here:
>Its sad that the US actually has something called 'Gun Culture'.
Why
Switzerland and the Czech Republic also have gun culture, whats wrong with that
No, but they dont turn the country into some sort if Wild West as a lot of people like to suggest
So whats the point then
It depends, here in the Czech Republic, sport is anything thats done at a proper shooting range, from ordinary plinking to stuff like IPSC
Nobody cares if you buy an AR-15 or a .22 bolt action rifle for that as long as you have a licence
Seriously
Use pepper spray for home defense
You do realize that pepper sprays are not exactly ideal for closed spaces, right
The self-defense licence here is automatically issued if you meet the requirements and also counts as a concealed carry licence
So almost all gun owners in the Czech Republic have it
No, youd have to have it certified as a shooting range, it is possible, but not really worth it
You are technically allowed to drink bleach, that doesnt mean it makes sense or that its a good idea
Pepper sprays are mainly for outdoor self-defense
But then, laws often make no sense

True, this is more like village-city than culture thing
You guys are disciplined

Wait you guys are fully independent

That's a ridiculous number

because humility is a virtue in Christianity, perhaps

You mean Phoenician origin, then
Since this would a silly distinction to make
Then you're wrong
TIL, thank you
That was Glagolitic, not Cyrillic
About as much as the Greek script was based on Phoenician script, or as Proto-Sinaitic script was based on hieroglyphs
If you thought like that you could go straight for the claim that Cyrillic is basically hieroglyphs since it's based on them
We couldn't fight 1938 Germany even now with our pandurs and gripens

Carrying guns and other means of self-defence is ok in the Czech Republic (no laws to regulate weapons except firearms)
Also dark humour of the darkest variety
You could also say political correctness isnt well received here
Were mostly happy with the system but imho its such a huge change that i dont see that happening in the US any time soon
Weve come from almost total ban to relative freedom almost overnight and the Ministry of Interior has been building mutual trust between themselves and the shooters for 30 years
Of course
There have been a couple cases lately, a gunshop owner killing a guy with a .44 mag when he knifed one of her workers in the neck (he was lucky and survived) comes to mind
The lady in question is/was the European western shooting champion
Then a girl saving someones life by just pulling out her Glock on a tram to dissuade the attacker
And we have one of the lowest homicide rates in Europe btw
Are you pro- or anti-gun
A lot of us are just happy with the way things are, and almost all of us are very unhappy with the way the EU is trying to change things
They tried to introduce the same stupid stuff like in the US by banning guns based on their looks
We have a sturdy licencing system but if you meet all the requirements you can buy almost anything except full-autos and hollow point ammo (but thats also because of the EU)
And everything is shall issue, including the carry licence
Basically if youre a decent human being able to uphold the law, know how to safely handle a gun, and know the gun law, you should be able to pass
What we see as madness is the way your politicians are trying to prevent gun related deaths using all the wrong tools
So you could say there is some sympathy in certain aspects
On the other hand, we mostly trust the relevant state authorities and they trust us gun owners, I wouldnt trust your authorities
Thats because most people have been taught to fear and hate guns with passion, most Czechs just dont mind
We also see guns as a certain symbol of freedom, only communists and nazis banned guns here
You guys have some serious problems with organized crime and drugs, your healtcare was pretty screwed up by Reagan, and peer pressure at schools is tremendous
Our history with guns started before America was even discovered
See, thats the difference, most guns in the Czech Republic are registered (we have 800k legal vs some 500k illegal guns)
That would work in the US, people fear the government would abuse the registry, i dont think the fear is unfounded
The EU banned them for pistols and revolvers in 1991
You can buy hollow points if you have long guns but not just a pistol
Or technically you probably could but if you tried to use it for self-defence you might lose your licence (but it should technically not have any effect on the self-defence case)
Theyre shall issue just like any gun thats not Cat
A (Cat
A mostly includes full-autos)
Theyre mostly Cat
B which requires a cheap shall-issue permit (required by the EU)
More info about gun categories here:  [
But once you have a licence, you can buy as many as you have safe storage for (if you have more than 2 guns you need a safe)
The Czech law makes basically no difference between private sales and sales through licenced dealer
You need a form so they can register the gun
Registering costs about 12 USD but they are discussing decreasing the cost as they might do away with cards got each gun as the whole system is getting simplified and more reliant on computers
In a private sale the parties fill out the same form (it includes information about the gun and both parties) and while the seller uses the form to transfer the ownership to the buyer, the buyer then has 10 work days to register the ownership
Its easier when from a dealer, because they transfer the ownership in the system and print the with the information for you, so you just go to the local PD and register your gun
The same 10 day period applies here
Tradition i guess
We have a very long history and shooting and gunmaking has always been part of our cultural heritage
In the west, guns are seen as something uncivilized while in the east communists mostly taught people guns were only owned by criminals and nobody else needed one
I know its a bad mindset, but until your politics stabilize somewhat, i dont see that changing any time soon
And most gun control proponents would like to ban at least something, which is not what most gun owners would accept
When the EU came with its gun ban, gun ownership became a widely discussed topic even though majority of people didnt care one way or the other
Gun ownership in the US is much much higher
Yeah, you can find them but they shouldnt be used for pistols and revolvers, theyre OK in carbines though
This is what the EU directive says:
Pistol and revolver ammunition with expanding projectiles and the projectiles for such ammunition, except in the case of weapons for hunting or for target shooting, for persons entitled to use them
The problem is that most people would like to use JHP for self-defence because FMJ bullets suck due to deflection and penetration
The directive completely ignored that some countries actually allow carrying for self-defence, or maybe it didnt ignore it
I think Luxembourg has a total ban
But anyway its not that other countries dont allow certain guns, but the Czech Republic allows people to actually carry guns for self-defence
I bet most guns in Sweden are hunting rifles and shotguns
The Czech Republic has 250k people with a carry licence out of 300k people
And there are very few limitations on what you can buy, besides you dont need to justify the need, you just fill in a form and thats it
Yeah, its actually illegal to hunt with pistols and revolvers here, you need to have a long gun with at least 1500J energy at 100m IIRC
I dont hunt so i dont really know that law
Youre right, but it seems its almost impossible to get a licence for an ordinary person
Yeah, dedication, it takes some dedication here to get a licence but then youre almost free to buy w/e. I think the main difference is that the Czech Republic still isnt exactly rich country and guns were almost impossible to get for most people some 30 years ago
That means guns still havent had time to accumulate
Btw dont you have to justify every purchase above a certain number
MR308 is pretty sweet, I just wish it wasnt that damn expensive
Yeah, thats what i mean
I can just come to the local PD tick one or more of the boxes with reasons im authorized to own guns for and its done
Nobody cares how many and what guns i have as long as i meet the storage requirements
I can also use the same gun for w/e reason as long as its registered for that
My pistol can be used for self-defence carrying as well as sport
My friend has his Sa 58 (a former local assault rifle reworked into a semi-auto) registered for hunting, sport, and self-defence
Yeah, but Czechia has better
We do the same AND beat women with pomlazka (willow sticks)
You won't believe it, but they grew up in the same town
How would you feel if everyone around you whos 18+ was allowed to carry any weapon except firearms, and anyone who is 21+ and passes set requirements and test had to be issued a licence to carry guns
Would you feel comfortable
Same

Its the same for our state TV, but although advertising is forbidden, they get around the ban by pretending the adverts are sponsors
That said, the Czech national TV can be horribly biased, but they produce some nice documentaries
Yeah, many people here feel that ČT doenst deserve the funding either
I tend to agree but then, I dont have a TV so I dont have to pay them
When one of their reporters outright lied and they refused to fire him, I lost all my faith in them
Its the same here, except you nees to add pushing an agenda to the list

Also most of the people are against islam, so those are also against Bashar al-Assad (if they only knew FSA are more religion based)
I meant the people
I am interested in Syrian war since it started and often discuss it on internet and i can say only few people really support Bashar
There are even people who tried to sue Bashar for "using chemical weapons against his people" lol
I meant czech social media or comment sections under czech articles

Facebook sucks
We need a truly decentralized platform where people (and yes, that includes Russian and Chinese web brigades) would be able to share disinformation, fake news and other questionable content without any government intervention
Fuck censorship, even if it is for the "greater good".
Being banned or getting your post deleted on Facebook is not censorship
It is merely a retraction of services provided to you by Facebook, which has ZERO obligation to provide you with them
I would not underestimate deplatforming
Remember /r/fatpeoplehate
Used to be massive reddit community, easily over 500k very active members, since they've been kicked out they have been completely eliminated
They tried to catch on Voat but it just didn't work
Exactly why we need a platform without a central authority where fake news will rein free
Also, you're wrong
Well luckily for you there exist places that are fairly unmoderated (various chans), but they tend to turn into an absolute cespool of (mainly rightwing) extremism
The fact is that the vast majority of people have no apetite for this
If you dislike Facebook's terms of service, then you are very much free to switch to ANY other possible social network, the fact that less people use them is not Facebook's fault
No replacement for Instagram tho
They were extremely active tho,  i think they constantly had 20-30k people online
FB was supposed to be testing cross app messaging on their apps afaik, but I'm not sure if anything came out of it
Yes that was a topic as well, but I was talking about [this] plan, which wants to keep the apps as standalone separate apps, but with "unified technical infrastructure" which would allow you to message people on the other apps as well

But what he says means for Muslims that they have to accept enlightenment princples as superior to Islam
For Muslims, insult to Propeth Muhammad is worse than killing their father or mother and they feel that must be avenged and that revenge is their duty
Such insult is not something "shocking" or like insulting them personaly or insulting their feelings
It is considered a capital crime for which the only punishment is death
Islam is a theocracy in which only Allah rules and Muhammad is his only valid messenger
Every faithful Muslim saying or writting his name has to add the benediction *Peace be upon him
* They have been taught since childhood that the Prophet must always be more to them than their mother and father
They don't understand the difference between protecting free speech and approving of insult of Muhammad
Islam is the base of their identity  and they necessarily live in conflict with our society even if they don't act openly aggressive
There is no "moderate" Islam , only Muslims are more or less lax or more or less zealous or more or less hidding their contempt to our society and its morals
They can't accept enlightenment princples and stay  faithful Muslims
Their system is not based on the idea of *contract social,* it is based on what they consider to be the will of God revealed to the Prophet who preached it to the people
> I do imagine a lot of Muslims are going to ignore all the nuance and rationale in this
I imagine they're going to listen to him and say "see, that's exactly what's wrong with western society". It's not that they don't *understand* these values, they don't *want* them

25 000 people dead from crashes, 400 000 from pollution in the EU every year, totally not a death pit
Cars take away freedom, at least in dense areas
They give you freedom in rural areas of course
But,
* cars kill 25k people directly and 400k people indirectly from pollution every year in the EU
* they take away so much space from people in cities
* if you invest too much into car infrastructure over public transport, walkability, bike infrastructure etc, you fuck over everyone who can't afford a car
Cities without advertisements look really sad

Codex Gigas is the most valuable book created in Bohemia (Czechia)
It was taken by Swedes during war in 17th century and to this day they have it on display in their museum
It's infuriating we have to travel to Sweden to see one of our national treasures which is one of a kind object
Wiki page:
So while in this case it's pretty hard to argue against returning it to Greece, there are much greyer areas
For example, the British Museum has a lot of Assyrian and Babylonian stuff originally from Iraq
Seeing what happened to the artifacts there, it's pretty fair to say they are much better off in the UK and I don't see that changing any time soon
Returning them wouldn't really achieve anything if your goal is to preserve and celebrate ancient cultural heritage
I don't think this applies to unique artefacts
For example I'm Czech and I would love to see our most prized and unique historical book Codex Gigas, but the Swedes stole it and don't want to return it, so now I have to travel to Sweden to see our national treasure
And what about people that don't have the money to go to Sweden
They will never be able to see it
I am very much hoping that things turn for the better for Moldova under her leadership
Quite the opposite, my friend
It's all about leadership
She won't have that much power, sure, but politicians, despite the popular belief, don't run a country
They change laws, but that's not all there is
Every country is run by a not-entirely-controllable critical mass of people that inspire others for the better or worse and influences the public sentiments and actions
A good president can inspire the people to become better themselves, while a bad president awakens the worst impulses in them
To give an example from my country, our first Czechoslovak president, Tomáš G. Masaryk, and our first Czech president, Václav Havel, were both great philosopher-presidents that, despite all the problems, kept hope in people and brought our country closer to the West
Nowadays all our good politicans are inspired by their ideals
I'm not naive
Moldova won't be cured of its corruption problem during her presidency, but she might inspire bright young people to enter politics and do something for their country

Czech Republic had 35 years old PM
He was corrupt as fuck, and unlike other politicians he was to inept to keep his bribery hidden
This soon ended his political career
He later lived luxurious life from money he filched away, but died in age 45 due to an exotic disease
Another young Czech politician (was PM at 43) was so incompetent, that he practically destroyed his own party
Before him they were the largest one, now they may not being able even to get into the parliament

Hurr durr nazi salute
On a more serious note, there is a good Czech documentary about the life of a neo-Nazi
It's called Svět podle Daliborka (The World According to Daliborek) and it's semi-mocking them, but there was one thing that struck me and I found it quite interesting
The guy it was about said that he didn't originally believe in racism or the Nazi ideology, but after he lost his girlfriend years ago, he was so desperate and felt so betrayed that he wanted to find something to relieve his desperation and anger on
So he became a Nazi
Don't get me wrong, I've been a convinced anti-fascist ever since I found out that it was a thing and I don't want to excuse them, but it was really interesting for me to discover that a lot neo-Nazis aren't that way, because they really believe it's a great ideology, but because of some kind of emotional damage they suffered in the past
And from what I hear, it's actually not that easy to escape the neo-Nazi community, once you become one
I think anti-immigration people wouldn't mind immigrants from Belarus in my country

In the Czech Republic, you got 75 % discount on buses/trains if you are a student or senior
You can basically travel anywhere across the country for 1€.
Let's get this to European parliament
I do very much prefer trains as opposed to any other means of transport, even the way the are now
I’ve got to say though that the difference in speed and comfort between all the trains in Europe is immense
For example - here, in the Czech Republic, you can go by our high speed train from Prague to Ostrava (356 km) in just over 3 hours
That’s not so bad, but let’s look at France’s high speed trains
In the same amount of time, give or take a few minutes, you can go from Paris to Marseille, which is over twice the distance
The difference is night and day
Now let’s have a look at regional trains
A few weeks back I took a trip to Slovakia
On the way there I took the high speed train and on my way back I took the EuroNight train
When I was there, however, I did use a local regional train, which was appaling
Don’t get me wrong, nothing was falling off and there weren’t any foul smells to report, but it was VERY dated
The train had three squeaky carriages with no sound insulation and uncomfortable faux leather seats which have seen the previous regime
On the other hand, in the part of Czechia where I live, the regional trains are actually quite nice
Relatively comfy seats, enough space, clean toilets, power outlets and even wi-fi
Similar regional trains run in Germany and I would assume in most of western Europe as well
The difference, again, is night and day
The biggest problem though are the ticket prices
Some countries, Czech Republic included, have discounted fares for students and the elderly
Let’s just say that the bottle of water I buy at the station costs more than the ticket for my hour and a half long journey
Another comparison - the previously mentioned trip from Prague to Ostrava would cost me, as a student, 143 czk (5,6€)
In Germany, however, a ticket from Berlin to Hamburg, roughly the same distance, costs 60€. Of course you have to factor in the average income of Germans and Czechs, though even then, still, German train fares are way more expensive
Now, I don’t know how to solve Europe’s train related problems, but it sure needs some looking into
It would take a massive effort to change anything on such a large scale, let alone changing the whole train infrastructure of Europe, though I’m sure things can be done to better the experience of passengers
Maybe we can start with the train operators from different countries working together more closely with each other, work on synchronizing timetables, creating new, interesting connections and maybe even introduce lower fares on international journeys
Oh yes, seeing people protest for disabilities that don’t even exist is enlightening
Invited by whom
That's why almost all protests seem like just people trying to get away with destroying shit
Yeah sure the idea behind it might be nice, but it doesn't really help the owners of the cars you smashed because they dared to be in your way
Is his name Ivan by any chance
/joke
See that’s what I was hoping for as well but then they voted for BoJo
They need their lesson
> it's obviously possible to have it both ways
It's obviously not, that can has simply been kicked down the road and will have to be opened at the end of the transitional period (prediction: it'll be full of worms)
Damn it feels good to be a European
In Prague we have managed to combine the drug dealer park with the pigeon-owned Central station into one beautiful complex nicknamed 'Sherwood'.
I thought the same at first, then I realized one of the avenues next to the historical center in my city is named after Roosevelt, so I guess that falls under that
you have been in prague or what
that name or "hobo park"
I am missing exchange shops with outrageously inconvenient exchange rates
look for huge black guys edit: I was told my comment is wrong, no problem with that, I never bough any kind of illegal substances so what do I know, have a good one
Pragueee
It's a depiction of a generic [non-existent] European city which fits as close as it can to European cities and possibly as far as it can to non-European cities
That's interesting, because I actually am not able to assess if fails _to fit as close **as it can** to European cities and **possibly** as far **as it can** to non-European cities
_ Where do you get that capacity to assess it
You could say that even the successful result will be pretty much useless in characterizing a city as European vs non-European
Which should be easier to tell than the above and people could argue about it
(I don't think one could provide a definitive stance on this in reddit's comments right now
And, yes, you can disregard my understanding of this submission completely, that's just how I understand it
Cheers
glad that Poland is subsidizing our abortion-on-demand industry
What the fuck, Poland
Can someone tell me what would happen if a polish woman just travels to Czechia, gets an abortion here, and travels back
Insurance could cover it still with a good plan
They had to stand in this position for hours to be painted only to be called "photoshop" 1200 years later, poor guys
Because this meme is reposted every few hours with different numbers/country
I's in stark contrast with China
They managed to keep infection rate under 0
01% and most of them are in once province anyway
Do they think it's the end of it
It's seems so when they are dismantling the temporary hospitals already
If even 1% Chinese gets infected I don't want to see the chaos
Honestly, this election was a huge debacle for republicans
Trump's term was just a catastrophe
He failed to manage coronavirus (but I think that no president could manage coronavirus in America
), he left one of the highest death tolls in the world and the economy is in ruins
He also hasn't reacted to the Black Lives Matter protests, one of the largest protest movement in decades, in any way
In this situation, I expected Democrats to win elections landslide and even flip Senate
But victory in the presidential election was razor-thin and Biden victory was only clear after several days of counting and republicans actually WON new seats in the house of representatives
It shows that despite Trump is (politically) dead, Trumpism is not
I think that this result is probably better for the Republican party
Biden has now to fix post-covid economic fallout, which would include many unpopular decisions
And if Republicans nominate somebody competent in 2024, they have good chances to win
Here's to news without Trump
Cheers
Czech President congratulates Biden and invites him to visit Prague (Trump never did and never invited Zeman to USA either)
I'm afraid he's far from winning
Orange man will deny his victory until he completely ridicules himself, but this could go on for months
He should've congratulated Joe Biden too, just for the memes
> I always believed in you, Joe
That's quite ironic coming from a communist dictator lmao
Even if it's just Biden's skeleton sitting in the Oval Office, it's better than Trump
Certainly better than all of Europe
EU as a whole, with comparable population to the US, has on average 260,000 new daily cases the past few days compared to US's 120,000 cases yesterday
More of a dogwhistle, I'd say
Democrats have to try harder, there is no wonder they vote for a populist who tells them what they want to hear instead completely ignoring them because white males can't have any issues
I should also mention that nearly the entire Europe has masks required indoors
And most restaurants and schools are closed
And yet we are twice as bad as the US
Good luck with this revolution Belorusians
Stay strong and positive because change will come
Minsk has much larger % of protesters than outside of Minsk
And still, "only" 70 000 of people attended those protests out of 2 000 000 people in Minsk
My country has less people in capital, yet still 250 000 protested against our PM
And you know what
Most of people actually support our PM (not me tho)
All i am saying is that even if 20 % of Minsk went to protest, this means nothing
Travel to eastern Belarus and ask people there what they think about opposition
It's like he doesn't get it that people can only take so much
Does he want to become next Ceausescu or what
I don't know, kicking out Yanukovych didn't turn out all that great for the Ukrainians
I think Belarus faces the same problem, that being having a border with Russia, and is very likely to end up in exactly the same situation
Velvet Revolution was attended by almost half of population of Prague at that time
Belarus has immense strategic value as a buffer state between Russia and NATO
Russia will never allow it to align with the West, even if preventing that requires a direct military intervention
For historical examples of that sort of thing, see the Korean War and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia
>Exactly, a buffer state, therefore it is not worth it to occupy it
For historical examples of that sort of thing, see the Korean War and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia
Maybe read up on what happened during the war, then
Okay, try to follow:
Belarus is a buffer state for Russia
If it aligns with the West, it'll cease to be that, and Russia wants to prevent that from happening even at the cost of invading
Now rewind back to the Korean War
North Korea is a buffer state for China, and China wants to keep it that way
North Korea picks a fight and starts losing badly, it looks like it'll stop being a buffer state for China (by being absorbed into the West-aligned South Korea)
China invades to prevent that from happening
Is that easier to understand
Because the protests are pro-democracy, which is a Western institution antithetical to the Russian regime, and the main opposition candidate has said that she intends to move away from the Union State treaty between Belarus and Russia
Well let's see
I could believe you that it means nothing
or I could believe Putin, who has already pledged military aid to Lukashenko
I wonder which of you two has a better grasp of what is and isn't important to Russia
RemindMe
2 months
Last week we had in the city where I live the worst floods in more than 100 years
That sounds exactly like when foreigners try to pronouce "Paříž".
It took almost 30 years, but they finally figured out that Czechoslovakia is no longer
So now it's objectively true that "CNN is fake news"?
Except one small village whose inhabitants are made invincible by a magic potion
Don't worry, we replaced the pen thief with an alcoholic pig
Remember when this was the biggest embarasment of Czechia back then
Now our drunkard president Zeman embarasses us everytime he speaks
I am proud of him
He managed to transform a boring event into such enjoyable show
If only this was the worst thing he ever did
This just perfectly exemplifies the absolute lack of class this guy has
I mean, atleast he didnt steal from his country ig
He is a awfull human being, but thanks to him, we are not Ukraine or Belarus today
Ah yes, the good old days
Chileans said after this, that it was not planned for him to take it, but had he asked, he'd had been welcome to keep it (diplomacy)
Have you ever seen another statesman doing this in such a cool way
Maybe Medvedev in Obama putting pens into their pockets synchronously
He did lead the biggest movement for freedom after fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, but right now he's a retired politician who just tweets antilgbt lowkey racist stuff
Drunk Zeman looking at Crown Jewels was bigger embarrassment
Turns out chopping down all forests in a subarctic environment with volcanic soils very prone to wind erosion wasn't the smartest move the Norse ever made
In Canada, the city decided to paint an LGBT flag on road
It lasted two days before somebody did a terrible hate crime of

Haha, while I see it in the similar way as UK, I'd love to hear some opinions of fellow Americans how they view European systems (there's too many)

But no, they live in their informational bubble and looking just for this kind of info which fits into their beliefs
Pirate Party has 17 percents in polls here
Also - Populists (30 percents here) and Stalinists
That Pirate Party is actually funny for me, here, they are the 3rd strongest party in the parliament
They have less and less every election
With luck, next time they will not make to the parliament
>Populist=covert racist
No these are different populists
I would call them hmmm - technocratic marketing populists
Here its' ANO party (ANO means YES)
They are without ideology, they scan public opinion and target voters not covered by other parties and then they target them with marketing tools
It helps if the owner is a billionaire who is able to pay team of PR wizards and also he owns two big newspapers
No, simply because we are not Eastern European
Because they would have to admit their preferred party is part of the problem
It is nonsense
The problem is that the schema Conservatives versus SocDem became only deception of people long ago and they come to relize it now
>Everyone you don't like is a Stalinist
No, when I say Stalinist I mean people who adore Josif Vissarionovic Stalin, like former MP Marta Semelová or current party's vice-chairman Josef Skála
The party is The communist party of Bohemia and Moravia and they are direct  successor of the Communist party which was in power from 1948-1989
I like that you can see the Alps, the Tatras, the Czech mountain border and other mountains
>Fucked up immigration policies
You mean Germany
You can believe in climate change without agreeing that it's caused by humans or that it can be reversed by our actions
The ones in Germany are economic immigrants
Yeah, it's proven that climate change is happening
It's also proven that humans probably caused the current increase in temperatures
But is it proven that we can actually reverse the trend
But is it proven that we are actually capable of doing that
This is highly memable, but on the other hand I really dont want to desecrate this mans honour

Was this the case of a good intention that got hijacked by corporate interests or Art

Czech MEP Pavel Svoboda told Czech newspaper idnes
cz: "Some of us got more that 60
000 e-mails about this topic"
(he voted to abstain, but I'm pretty sure it was our pressure what changed his mind, because in past he very much advocated for the directive)
Well then hopefully when I get older and don't understand how something important works I shouldn't be in charge of changing said thing without proper knowledge
Or just don't be in charge and let someone younger than me that understands how these things work, he in charge

Just a few Cessnas and Pipers, which is crazy given it's central location
Look at Britain now, I hope that these antifacists are proud of themselves
The thing is, people were always a bunch of really stupid ignorant fucks
We may be slightly better in this manner as higher education is more common and people generaly know more stuff and are less ignorant, but because any idiot can write anything he wants on the internet, public forums are full of idiots telling everyone their idiotic opinions and they stay there for anyone to read
In the past, the local idiots would just sit at their idiot table in their idiot pub and would not mix much with the non-stupid folk
If they did, they would get told off and their stupid opinions would soon be forgotten
That is why it may look like people got dumber
Actualy, we just see more stupid people now because we share the same platforms with them and the opinions stay there to be read even though the idiots are already gone (twitter comments, youtube comments and, ofcourse, the worse of them all
Facebook)
Nah dude, Facebook is much worse
YouTube is horrible under many videos, but public Facebook pages (like government or public news) are so much worse
Stalinism, Leninism, Maioism are results of implementing communist/ marxist ideas into real society
None of them worked and all of them caused terror and deaths of many innocent people
I don't understand, how can somebody advocate for communism these days, when there are several proofs it is not possible to make communism work
Its very sad that even today are people who think that russians were the good ones during and specially after WW2
Basically USSR and Nazi Germany started WW2
Hitler attacked USSR later on to wipe out Bolsheviks
The only thing he succeeded in was to allow Bolshevism to be expanded in Europe

When Poland invaded east of Czechoslovakia few days before WWII, our president Beneš sent letters for help to UK and France with only limited response - they did basically nothing
Then he sent letter to Soviet Union and USSR officials offered 700 planes and sent 330 000 men to Polish border as a threat for attacking us

Yes, two Czech citizens are detained in Turkey, but those two dumbasses actually were kind of asking for it, because they went to Syrian Kurdistan to do humanitarian work (or so they say, the Turks accuse them of doing logistics and recruiting for YPG), posted all over their social media about it, including pics with YPG fighters which Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization and then had the 'great' idea to return home through Turkey
Long story short, the were sentenced for aiding a terror organization and now they're in a process of appealing the decision

I know our Government was constantly complaining how the distribution of the money was being based too heavily on unemployment numbers (we had almost problematically low unemployment prior to corona), even after the EU adjusted it to be based on a few other factors as well, so it might just be that the extra regional development funding was thrown in to shut us up

What's bugging me the most is the fact that the nations aren't at least somewhat ordered from left to right as they are on a map from the west to the east :D
[they don't know]
With Brexit, the only border between EU and UK is the "border" between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
Based on the [Good Friday Agreement] there are no enforced borders between the two Irelands
Brexit however forces the two sides to have a real border
Unless you want another civil war, IRA and other stuff, there can't be a border
So hot even the mosquitoes are hiding
Yea, that is a pretty weird association

Same shit, different day
Best timing ever too, with brexit going on
This is the time EU is supposed to look united, and what they do
Pick the single WORST issue they could have that instantly antagonises basically entire millenial generation + anyone else with shred of common sense
This is how you create single-issue voters and if there are gonna be other countries triggering referendums, they literally could not shoot themselves in the dick any more
Me too
I was always for EU, but in the past 2-3 years I have been more disappointed than ever
People are wondering why some want to leave EU and this law made me wonder if I still want to be part of it
Check this website
Happened a long time ago
...and Wikipedia
That's true
It's fucked up they call themself pro-EU and vote for shit like this
Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to EU citizens
This literally entails mass censorship of the internet
It will be challenged, I have no doubt about it
I don't stop believing in democracy because they made a grievous error
Our MPs do that all the time
...how
That really doesn't matter – all the applicants have to prove is that it has this effect in practice (this is a sort of principle in constitutional law – it doesn't matter what your intentions are, what matters is the effects and whether they are proportional to the aim)
Sadly, it will probably first have to be demonstrated in real world usage before sufficient evidence is available
Very true
This is a case of technology moving forward far quicker than human conceptual thinking
That's the case in any democratic society; boundaries exist and must exist
Nevertheless, the *interpretation* of the boundaries is carried out by independent courts based on the principle of proportionality
For god's sake, read something about it
The issue is that these days, *everything* can be considered "copyrighted material", so the inevitable result will be preventive banning (by filtering) of everything, including fair use
If I am posting a Boromir meme, am I infringing on someone's copyright
Who knows, but I'll be banned just in case because the site I am uploading to wants to pre-empt potential lawsuits
This is not freedom, this is copyright tyranny
People have always imitated and developed other people's works and ideas
It's natural for us and the present-day obsession with copyrighting and patenting every fart needs to stop
Looks like someone played Cities:Skylines with anarchy mod on (which allows objects to clip through each other)

I would say the worst war was 30 years one
Imagine there is a war for your all life
Thats unimaginable
Look at docummentary series about diary of mercenary
It is named Age of Iron- Die eiserne Zeit
Personally, I think this one was more horrifying
The second one killed more people, but what most people had to go through in the first one was imho worse
EDIT: I've already addressed the Holocaust and other WW2 stuff in another comment and explained my reasoning, so no need to be a smart ass and remind me of it, as if I've never heard of it
Even immediately after the end of WW1, as new countries were being created and competed for land and autonomy
It was worst war that have even been in the Czechia
We've lost 40% of our population
That caused massive German colonisation and ups; Sudetenland -> WWII
After watching The Apocalypse I no longer think so
Yes, WW2 had some instances when it was incredibly brutal, but the conditions soldiers had to go through on the frontlines of WW1 were in my opinion worse
The constant shelling that could go on for days, the diseases, the mutilation, the mud, the sense of impending doom, entire areas literally blown to smithereens, tens of thousands of dead in a single attack, facing some of the new horrifying weapons (the flamethrower, chemical weapons, machine guns, tanks
) for the first time
Some places in France are still poisoned by all the dead bodies in the ground
Maybe if they were cremated
But for humans the gut bacteria from dead bodies that gets into drinking water or crops can cause severe poisoning
Actually, according to Wiki it's somewhere in the 300 to 700 year range
Here you go
In the Main dangers section
It doesn't go into detail about it
I understood that they meant "clean up by natural means", not that it would take so long, if people attempted it
I will say "What the fuck are you doing here, I have no kids, go away
There was a similar campaign in Germany in 1941
Ah, the famous "Yummon". Or as we unofficially call it "Mňamón".
Am I only one who like REALLY doesn't like this
I am geniunely curious ... Like to me this thing just lacks any sort of decency or *nuance*. I can just imagine the architect told the builders to just slap random vaguely fantasy looking things on the house everywhere they could ... I think this is just another piece of highly kitschy bussiness baroque
Britain bad
10 minutes to go in UK
Personally I just kinda sympathize with the Scots for getting screwed over honestly
A big argument in the original IndyRef was that an independent Scotland might have a hard time joining the EU, which they are pretty fond of and have tried to integrate with, so staying with the UK was the safest way to secure their EU membership
Then the UK instantly turns around and pulls Brexit on them
I wasn't sold on Scottish Independence being the best idea back then, but now I kinda can't blame the Scots if they decide to say "Well screw you too, then"
Technically there was an independent Welsh Principality for several centuries, so if we assume that the Kingdom of England and Principality of Wales titles are the same tier, then does Prince Charles automatically get independence once Queen Elizabeth's empire-tier "United Kingdom" title gets revoked
What a massive waste of her "Long Reign" opinion modifier that would be
There are so many dumb and dangerous people spreading misinformation around
Several days in a row we have almost 10k cases
A country of 10M people
// update, over 11k yesterday, we are fucked
So lockdown not only killed our economy but also just moved the coronavirus to the winter when it will be even more deadly combined with the flu season
Which was really expectable, but the Lockdown crowd just ignored the warnings
I'm happy my country contributes so much these days
We're the best in the whole EU
Well it's mostly due to our efforts
Czechs are doing their part while rest of Europe is slacking off
Heyhey, don't undermine the success of Czechia
People are stupid and vocally opposed to any measures and our prime minister is a coward who overruled a lot of the measures our previous health minister tried to enact
People, intelligent people, around me still claim it’s all overblown and hysteria
Even with the numbers we have
That’s why I’m sure we’re fucked
Yeah we're beyond fucked
Our prime minister is a total conman "solving" everything just via a huge PR machinery
Who would expect the covid cant be dealt with that way
Those are rookie numbers
We, Czechs, have 9k cases per day and only 10 million people
All thanks to our star player, Andrej Coviš. Sorry jako
We even had a "Farewell, Covid" party in June
That's how cocky we were
but we don't have enough testing capacity either, our positivity rate is 30%
Only restaurants, bars, schools and cultural events are closed
Malls are still open for example as are all other stores, masks are only required indoors
There is no real plan in place so they’re ad-hoc putting new measures in place as if they didn’t have months to prepare
WOW Its big
wow, Japan is almost touching the land of Jakubmarian

General Japan, you are shorter than I expected
I only got to visit Birkenau because the trip was on short notice and we couldn’t prebook tickets
Probably a good thing, not doing the two on the same day
when you crank the water level parameter to 11 and click generate
There was this one map in the old Transport Tycoon - it was a big island with all land on sea level except on the shore that was a 1 square wide dyke all around
If you accidentally lowered a single square of land on the dyke, it would flood your whole map
Unless you managed to quickly contain it by raising land around the leak
All the men of Lidice were killed as well
All women above 16 were send to concentration camps
A several children below 16 were send to German families, the rest were gassed
It was done in a retaliation for the assasination of the third highest ranked Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, who was also in charge of the Protektorat
He was nicknamed the Butcher of Prague
EDIT: Some people pointed out that Heydrich might not have been that high in the Nazi hierarchy
So let's just say that he was among the high-ranking Nazis, perhaps not exactly the 3rd, but he was surelly an important figure in the Nazi ruling elites
Ok this is freaky to see on the front page because I was literally just here about an hour ago
Here's my photo of the children's memorial, which currently has a bunch of toys and flowers laid there (even including a fidget spinner)
Yes, it is the one
It wasn't the only massacre done as a retaliations of Heydrich's assasination, there was also the village Ležáky where all adults and 11 children were killed
Amen
Which kinda reminds me of our [memorial] to the victims of communism
He was an SS-Obergruppenführer and General of the Police as well as chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD)
He was also the main architect of the Holocaust and the Reichsprotektor in Bohemia and Moravia
At the time when he was alive, I can't think of any other Nazi leader apart from Hitler and Himmler who had as many important functions
There are even speculations that he was gonna replace Hitler at some point
It made France and the UK renounce the Munich Agreement and put the whole Czechoslovakia firmly on the victor's side after WW2 though
If you want to see a movie about the assassination of Heydrich watch Atentat from 1964 or Anthropoid from 2017
This happened when the war was coming to the end and Germans were losing control over the country
There were more of these massacres, where Czechs took revenge for the whole occupation period on German civilians
It was a horrid time to be alive overall
And yes, the whole retribution that some Czechs took against Germans after WW2 was never properly investigated let alone punished
Like most massacres of Germans
It's revolting to read about that, especially knowing the perpetrators (often former collaborators who needed credentials as anti-Nazis, so they massacred some civilians) mostly got away with it
You're correct that Czechs don't want to be reminded of this
During the entire Commie period, this topic was essentially taboo and the older generations react pretty angrily, if you want to educate them on this topic
I participated in a symbolic re-enactment the death march of Brno Germans (Versöhnungsmarsch); near the end of the 30 km walk, there were some protesters against the  event, mostly elderly Commies shouting stuff like "go back to the Reich" and "shame" at us
If they weren't oldtimers about to die soon, hopefully, I'd have shouted back something nasty at them
But they're mostly representative of what the older generations think about attempts to remember the post war events
EDIT: BTW, let's lighten this topic up a bit: my grandmother told me a funny story from post-expulsions South Moravia
A local Commie representative (whose surname was Hicl) wanted the municipal council to rename the local terrain features (hills with Czechisied German names like "Sumperk", "Kolberk" etc
) to get fully rid of the "German element". The locals told him to shut up and think about where he got his surname (which is likely a Czech form of "Hitzel", a common German surname in the area)
He never brought that up again
> Wasnt the assassination some kind of insidejob, too
Someone that thought heydrich would get to much power and wanted him dead
No, it was a joint operation of the British government, the Czechoslovak government in exile and the Czech and Slovak resistence members
Okay, so perhaps not the 3rd, but just among the high-ranking Nazis
I find it hard to blame those who actually went through the occupation as small children (and thus weren't collaborators) for not wanting to accept the guilt for what happened after WW2
It's easy to look at it from your perspective, you didn't live during that time and didn't have to suffer
Some people here lost everything as small children and I do not find it strange if they cannot get over it
It's the responsibility of the younger generations to get over it and look at the past events objectively and without biases
Both my grandmothers lived through the war and occupation as adults, one in a small village in South Moravia (she was required to grow stuff for the German army and occasionally house German officers), the other was sent for forced labour in Germany (Totaleinsatz)
Neither of them was particularly bitter about Germans
The South Moravian one expressed regret occasionally about the expulsions, saying it ruined some villages
I feel those fanatically anti-German oldtimers are mostly former Commie apparatchiks or people whose conscience about the post-war events isn't entirely clean
Okay, so your grandmothers aren't particulary bitter, does that mean no one can be particularely bitter
No even people whose family members were murdered by the Germans during the war
I'm just saying that some children who lived through the war must have experienced some severe trauma during the occupation
I can emphatise with that, the same as I emphatise with the victims of the retaliations and their family members
Some things are simply so horrible, that not all people manage to get over them
If my family was killed, I would probably also find it difficult to not be bitter about it
Sure, but I think those most pro-expulsion, rabidly anti-German ones are simply brainwashed  Commies or people who somehow benefited from odsun, most likely by gaining property
People who really suffered during the war are mostly empathetic enough not to wish the same evil on others, even Germans
Not all, but in my experience this generally applies
With a knife, ideally
There's some serious meme potential with these faces
You know you are also encouraging Le Pen voters by this, right
France (and the rest of Europe) won't get better by electing Macron
Unhappy crowd will grow stronger and stronger
Vote Le Pen
France needs you, not Europe
Come on, he won't make life easier for Le Pen voters based on his rhetoric
Shit will hit the fan
It's inevitable
By electing Le Pen now, when she has rather small number of supporters, there's at least a chance that some of them will change their opinion of her during her presidency
By electing Macron, crowd of her supporters will only grow stronger
And they won't change their opinion, no way
He just wants to be offended by something
Cool
I'd love a Mi-24 Hind in the garden just so, but I dont think the Mrs would let me
We used to have an old Wessex helicopter on the training base back in the UK when I was in the army which always fascinated me

We used to do the same when I was in the TA twenty odd years ago
The case of a LAW 94 was filled with concrete to simulate the weight and someone(usually me as the youngest) had to carry the fucking thing round all weekend
We called it the Combat Handbag
Lugging concrete around seems to be a forces SOP by this point
Had a slight heart attack the first time I saw one of those "be careful this road is bad" signs in Bavaria, since by Czech standards at the time the road was really smooth
Also in the winter you can literally see the border between South Bohemia and Austria, because the road quality and the fact that you can't salt the roads in National parks in Czechia, so you literally go from 40 km/h to 90 km/h (or 100
not sure which one is the limit)
Yeah, this is totally just Belgium and the Balkans
You wouldn't...uhm ... [find it anywhere else, especially in central Europe]
The Netherlands is the worst European country in renewable energy use according to Eurostat so they are nowhere near where they present themselves in terms of the environment

Yea the overwhelming use of gas shocked me when I lived there for 4 years
Also the amount of old houses with outdated energy concept

I traveled daily in regional bus and two city buses and
complete silence, always
I moved to USA
Any neighbor that sees me cheerfully ask me "Heeey how you dooiin'" and then go back to doing their own business without even expecting answer
My inner antisocial czechness always freeze from that terrifying phenomenon
Force out quick "good" and move on
It's weird
Czech here, I doubt we are as severe as our far northern neighbors, but I would wager that we are still pretty socially
distant
Date in a resturant is like Schrodinger's cat
kind of
It is and isn't date at the same date
If it goes poorly, nope, totally not a date we just went to hang out
But if you both enjoyed it, yes, it was totally date
Sometimes its real mental gymnastics
Terrifying
If you don't mind me asking
Czechs are just as antisocial as our Scandinavian friends and I moved to USA 2 years ago
I still can't figure out
what's up with all the "HEEEY HOW YOU DOIN'?" without people actually expecting answer
These people terrify me lmao
Don't speak to me your weirdos, I don't know you
&#x200B;
And a funny story, my wife told me I kill every conversation anyone tries with me without knowing
Dude would ask me "You doing something fun this weekend
" odd question, but I answer it truthfully "Yes

That's crazy

Love the original Thing, the prequel was alright but I dont know it was just meh
I think it would have been more claustrophobic if it was in Norwegian or like Chernobyl was in English but pretending to be in Russian
The shoehorning in of the American gung ho pilots and scientists took a bit away from the mystery of the Norwegian base from the original Thing
are you trying to provoke a civil unrest
Is she a sin-eater of some sort
Clear distinction of Western, Central, and Eastern European countries
A bit simplified, but basically: progressive society vs balanced society vs conservative society
It's not, sadly
Majority might be, but some really important stuff aren't.
At least in Czech Republic it's two different terms and two different sets of rights, so no, it's not the same
Examples of the legal differences (but there are way more): unable to adopt a child, unable to foster a child, legally you don't have in-laws, you can only get "married" at a few selected institutions and can't have legal witnesses, in case of a divorce there are no laws about dividing shared property, in case of death of one of the partners you're not entitled to the money widow(er)'s get from state
Middle ground between progressive views and conservative views
A ground that makes most people least unhappy
If half of the country wants the same-sex marriage to be legal and the other half wants it to be banned completely, then I'd say unions/partnerships are the compromise, which display a balanced solution to a population split on an issue
You can never go wrong with that
In general, middle ground will always make most people least unhappy
(unless it's the "take the worst of each" kind of situation, which obviously isn't the case here)
Or do you think that when a political issue that has a middle ground, it's best to go fully with one side
The US has been doing it like that the last decade and it didn't turn out quite well, I'd say
They both directly imply each other: A compromise is selecting the middle ground which makes all sides somewhat unhappy, but not a lot
Going with it makes sure no one will be very unhappy
>Also, the EU hasn't gone fully one side on much, wtf you talking about
Read my comment again
If you can't see the clear connection and implication between the two definitions, that's on you
/r/The_LakeBled
I planned on going there (the Alta Via 2 trail, around 150km and approx
10 days long)
Anybody been there before
Is it worth it
Spent a couple of months up there one Spring or late Winter I suppose, near Muonio in a nice little holiday village of wooden huts in the forest, skiing and sauna everyday
Lovely part of the world
Ive heard it talked about a lot and I spent a bit of time in Finnish Lapland
Personally I dont think it matters
Apart from the weekend Im stuck in some office anyway apart from an hour at lunchtime, it's dark or part dark going in and dark when I get out for months anyway
Probably time to vamos a la playa
Thankfully today some cold winds decided to cool the Czech republic so it's nice 25 °C. :-)

On the other hand - there WAS a time when it was possible to secure itself from Russia - in the 90s - and a lot of countries took the opportunity to do it
By the time of the Russians were seizing Crimea me and my friends, classmates at university and plenty of other people I know, we all did voice our protests to our politicians (we e-mailed people we voted for in our elections and/or in EU elections) to express we stand against this aggression and demand to take actions against it ASAP
We were promised they will take the matter up the ladder
But you know what
The people we voted for were minority in the parliament
It was already too late as only politically impotent talking heads or post-communist local oligarch were in charge (as they promised people more wealth for less work and that they root out corruption and frauds and, as usual, majority of the voters took the sweet bait)
Nobody with real political power cared that they just let pro-russian propagandists poison our debates, our society
It got worse since then
People just refuse to look up information, cross-check their news sources, they just simply soak in every BS they read and no longer care
Recent elections showed it up
And by now, the pro-russian crowd (not yet particularly large one, but still) is louder than ever, silencing every other opinion by threats, cyber bullying and slandering everyone
Frustrating
And nobody knows how to defend themselves against it, when (again) nobody really cares about anything by now
Stepping up NATO integration would make Russia escalate the war
If that's the price you're willing to pay, Ukraine would probably become a much better place to live at the cost of the NATO coming a lot closer to a direct confrontation with Russia
Dude I'm not saying that, I'm just saying that we should be prepared for a response if we move against Russia
I know you're gonna say "but Russia has no right to decide Ukrainian matters
" but that doesn't matter, what matters is that Russia would see it as a threat and respond appropriately
Same here
When I got to the last part of the title, I was really horrified for a moment
what happened to old minister
In Czechia, we have changed our health minister 4 times

There's this tradition of fasting on Christmas Eve
No food until the big Christmas dinner
If you manage to fast until then, you have a chance of spotting a golden pig
There was a great commercial for Kofola that mentioned this tradition
Hahaha I agree that Kofola is an acquired taste
and and it's terribly sweet
I have recently found out that soda drinks produced for the Czech Republic is sweeter than "normal". So now I'm obviously curious how the "normal" ones taste

You're meant to burn off the food a bit, eat a bigger lunch, smaller dinner
I am positively surprised
Of course this isn't a very good metric of which country it's better to live in, but still
Yeah, I'd make twice as much money in the US, but I'd also spend 6 times as much on healthcare, use 80% more electricity, 4 times likely to be murdered etc

The water at the bottom
Goes 1,200m underground
The confirmed underwater depth is actually currently at least 404 meters (473 m including the dry part) but it is true that based on the water composition/temperature or something it is expected to be as deep as 1200 m.
Yes so I heard
Any idea why It's so troublesome to reach the bottom though
Noone wants to pay for it or is technology not good enough
Probably because a) you can't see shit at that depth and b) it's not a straight shaft to the bottom
It goes sideways in some places, the walls aren't flat, there's debris, "fake" bottoms and possibly some very small openings which you have to find and fit through
Edit: But yeah, if finding the bottom was of a really significant scientific importance, like if we knew there's answer to the life, the universe and everything hidden at the bottom, we sure would have already found it
Taras Shevchenko, the most prominent nazi since 1840
Edit: Ctrl+F or find “Слава України”, you’ll find it in that poem
Read about its history here, I think it is time to finally put the arguments to an end:
> On the same day - January 22, 1919 – in parallel with the battles in Volyn, the Unification Act of the Ukrainian lands was proclaimed in Kyiv
The railroad soldiers were the first to arrive at the Sofiyivska Square carrying a large national flag, on which the words "Glory to the Ukrainian heroes
" were inscribed
(prototype of the future "Glory to the Heroes
[33]
Nah, you were right before
Слава Україні is literally transliterated to “Slava Ukraini”.
Wow, it works
As Czech, I do not know if "Eastern Europe" insults me more than having one state together with Poles
I am sorry polish brothers, but putting together most atheist nation with most religious one would be just insane idea
Yeah that eastern European Union hurts me as a Czech
Thanks
It tottaly worked
Well done
Appreciate this, Was It hard to make
We are not eastern europe we are centra
Adding Czechia to Germany would be honestly more insulting for me also Slovakia to Hungary would do more damage to be honest
But great map anyway
You should drive with both hands on the wheel though
> This type of behavior should mean you risk being banned from copyrighting works
Agreed 100%. Good luck getting legislators to pass something like that
Also, I suspect corporations affected by such a ban would just make a new company to carry on
I wish I was able to just invent a new identity and wipe away my past whenever the hell I felt like it
Happened from time to time in Czechia to me as well, it made the early morning rides much better
Isn't that on purpose
Bus drivers here always leave the lights off unless we're nearing a bus stop
It is so naive to expect that the campaign for the second referendum would be without lies and deceptions
It would be worse than the first one
I have a legitimate question: How do they keep it so clean white all the time
There has to be rain with a bit of ash/dirt or some tourists drity it
I just don't get it
The EU does an absolutely *atrocious* job of explaining what it's doing
As I see it, that's the root cause of all the growing anti-EU sentiment, because actors trying to dismantle the organization are free to claim it eats money and does nothing, and the EU doesn't bother correcting that narrative and educating people
Yet, lots of Serbs go around whining how the west wronged them, they only went genocidal in defense (nobody wanted to play Yugoslavia with them anymore)
They do not recognized their war crimes, they done nothing, maybe Russia will ride in and save them
THere is horrid Yugoslavia wars revisionism ("why did the USA not help us kill the MOOSLIMS
I met few Serbians (though born after the war and in diaspora) running around with photos of Karadzic and Milosevics in their valet
Yeah, I am a Czech and there is so much fucking CZECXIT propaganda
In a way I wish somebody would pull of fearmongering ("they will close your Kauflands and Lidls and you may face shortage of the medicines that keep you alive" on those boomers
Because it seems they do not hear rational arguments
Just "boo, EU scary, butr Russia will save you" crap
And those boomers gotten their Prague spring hopes crushed by Soviet tanks)
Dude they want to ban our ř! The ř!
So do you see a way out
I sometimes feel that there is a no way to make country democratic
Us Czechs are not a warlike nation (as my friend once said: "I am not worried about civil war here
That would take effort and this nation is too fucking lazy for that"), but we still vote for populists and communists and blame EU for everything bad (eventhough people would flip out if they stopped them on border of Croatia for five minutes while they were going for their vacation)
Anywas, wishing you luck
May our nations see the light and work on better future
I remember something about the group that ousted Milosevics trying to form some organization helping revolutionaries of the world
May I use it as a wallpaper

Oh wait
of course
Sadly the city is being besieged by chinese tourists in the past years, so it basically became a theme park
The nicest city in our country
If you go in November or Feb or March, it’s a ghost town and it’s awesome
Good bar off the square
Good food
Don't you have enough wonderful old towns in Italy
For me, France and Italy are two countries proving absolute injustice of God in distribution of wonderful natural and cultural sites
Only in Firenze or  Venezia you can stay for years to study all the artworks there
I don't understand why Italians travell abroad at all
I tolerate only those who spread Italian art in the world, like those who particpated also in building Český Krumlov and other renaissance and baroque monuments in our country (see  for exmaple [Baldassare Maggi] and others mentioned at [this site]
The main problem with tourism in Prague (and maybe some other Czech towns where it's mostly foreign tourists wealthier than us) is locals being priced out of real estate and rents and everything being owned by foreign "investors". Which obviously isn't a fault of the tourists themselves, it's happening because of missing regulations, but it's no wonder that it makes the majority of locals, who don't benefit from tourism much at all, quite salty
Litter, drunk tourists vomiting in the streets and ugly advertising are indeed just minor symptoms of what happened to the whole area's property structure
That's to distinguish between the Polish part and the Czech part of the divided city, both are Těšín in Czech language
If you'd go for the literal translation, it wouldn't be Bohemian Těšín, it would be Czech Těšín.
This one uses the other meaning of the adjective, because you're one level up
Český Těšín (Czech) as opposed to Těšín (in Poland)
Yeah, that's to differentiate between that and the polish Těšín. Wouldn't make sense to call it Silesian Těšín, would it
So it's "Český" meaning "of Czech Republic" not "Bohemian". Small difference, might not be clear for everyone, but the difference is there
The word "can" meaning a small container is the same as "can" as being able to, in English
That doesn't make them the same word
That's correct
However I didn't see anyone dispute that
Well, "in this case" would indicate there are other cases for this word too
And this meaning does fit for Český Krumlov
However I will not speak for him for that I don't know exactly how he meant it
How much of real manufacturing is still left in UK
Fun fact: Lauterbrunnen is right next to Grindelwald
Given how often I see Lauterbrunnen on Reddit, I'm surprised it's not overcrowded with Redditors

My girlfriend's uncle had about half a dozen shell casings from a PaK 38 - anti tank cannon he was using as candle holders, he gave me a couple before he died
I also have some binoculars from my great uncle who used them to look for u-boats when he was captain on a ship in the British merchant navy on the Russian convoys - Carl Zeiss, bloody German binoculars

Europe will relatively decline because other regions will develop
This is not a bad thing, but it is a reason why Europe should defend its interests as a unified entity
If you think individual nation states would be better off alone, fine, just leave already and see how it goes

seriously, it's gonna be like this here in few months :/
Babiš has a shitload of flaws, but being an admirer of Orban and Trump is not between them
Heck, he kinda despise Trump as incompetent failed businessman
Looks  sort of pretty (the dress)
Recently, budget for 2018, made by the ČSSD-ANO-KDU coallition has been approved
77 out of 78 ANO politicians were for it
I repeat, it was constructed and approved by ANO, with Babiš in lead
What does he say
> Není to náš rozpočet
(Translation: It isn't our budget
Another one:
Before the election, he was dissing all other parties very heavily
He probably made ODS look like devils that should rot in the hell for his voters
Day after the election, he said that the best possible coalltion would be the one with - you guessed it - ODS
Where am I going: His opinions are very inconsistent
I wouldn't rely on something he said just once, especially with things about other politicians like Trump or Orbán. If you look at the record of what he said, you'll see exact opposites in his opinions - many more than the two I listed above
> Babis admires Orban, he said so himself
> **he said so himself**
Just wait for a while
Once they disagree on something, they'll act like to-the-death enemies
Although you're most likely right, the fact Babiš said so adds no confirmation to it
> your PM
I hate this fact as well
Austrian problems require Austrian solutions

Sweden, are you ok
What language is this written in
Yeah I came across that a couple of times on askreddit and asked American workmates too as I just dont get it
If there is some drink, drug or mental issues I'd understand but generally there seems to be some glee about it on the parents side, tough love like they are doing the kids a favour
Im not even Czech I just live here but the UK isnt like the US on this either, I was in and out the family home till 25, my cousin moved back home after divorce and was there till 40 before getting married again
Almost everyone I know stayed at home until 25-30
Living outside of Prague now it seems three quarters of the village have their adult kids living with them, I hope my two sons convert our barn into houses and live there like the neighbours kids have done
Nah
Loads of Slovaks study and then work in Czech Rep so a lot of them have moved here or maybe to Bratislava
In the jobs Ive worked over the years(admin & now IT) in Prague and Brno there are usually more Slovaks then Czechs
I think there are more people from Kosice living in Prague, than people from Prague
Yeah Im in a village an hour from Prague and 8/12 houses have parents and their adult kids in them with their children, 5 with spouses
Also 2 new builds on the family field
I wonder if there will be any joy with these houses for one Euro you always see in the media in dying villages
With the increase in homeworking with Covid, even if it becomes popular it would still stay low hopefully
Love the Italian countryside, especially Abruzzo
Yeah I'd love to be in the middle of nowhere in the Abruzzo, Dolomites or here but it's not possible
Two young kids needing schools and Im not always guaranteed home office although I had it a lot even before Covid
Was speaking to a local in Sulmona who was saying loads of older Germans and Dutch were snapping up local mountain villas, I think this is the main way to do it when the kids are older and no need to work
But doctors and hospitals might be an issue in the countryside when getting old, especially now with Covid
Well he said yesterday literally:"I will never resign, you shall remember it
No, no no no no no NO NO NO NOOOoooooooOOOooo
I somewhat guess splitting Serbocroatia would be a nightmare compared to splitting of Czechoslovakia
I don't like that we are closer to Russia but also above Germany
Still no sea
No sea for us and still next to slovakia and germany, not much difference
Also tatranky would be called mořenky in this scenario
Czechia: Oh my god, I really hoped for some beaches
Cool idea btw
Edit: As a 'bonus'... We went a few decades back
This close to Russia
We will be annexed in few days :(
When tf is this map from
2010
Perfect beer making conditions tho
Same complaint here
I'm just glad we're still next to Slovakia
Well yes, but actually no
Many people still use Czech Republic
Czech Republic sounds better to me
The Czechia sounds worse, but it is better to use because it is shorter
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch
I’ll have you know my region is actually the most developed region in Europe, and I’ve been involved in numerous region developement projects, and we have over 300 world-famous tourist attractions
You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet
Think again, fucker
As we speak I am contacting my secret network of volunteers across the Czech Republic and we're getting ready to make our region even better so you better prepare for the storm, maggot
The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life
You’re fucking dead, kid
Our region is getting better everywhere, all the time, and I can make it even nicer in 700 different ways, and that’s just with my bare hands

I find it heartwarming that we share these embarassing, notorious habits like socks in sandals and hogging the beach with your towels
Next you’re going to tell me Germans also bring Schnitzels on holiday
German
Hello from the Czech Republic
Mor egerman ? socks and sandals ? with beer ? 10/10 Czech republic
[that's where you're wrong freunde]
Could be
I think it was originally taken in CzR because I saw it like more than a year ago on the Czech internet
And as a bonus - my nation wears socks in sandals regularly
And Czechness
It's our national embarrassment that we try to keep secret
Don’t worry, I haven’t seen a fanny pack in decades
Or at least in over a decade
Note that these fashion transgressions are inherent to men only
Might be the reason us ladies have a good reputation when it comes to looks
Because Slovak nationalists would never ever buy Czechia Chips
It is global economy - scams and manipulation
> I love Europe, because I am European
What does that even mean
What a bizarre fucking post, is this Europe's first attempt at copying Russia's propaganda
Needs work, for a start try to not make these posts on fresh accounts especially with a name like CitizenOfTheEU
EU brings you freedom to move around it’s countries
Freedom to work and study in each country without any discrimination
Freedom to run business in every country and sell your goods and services across borders without any restrictions
Access to health system and fast track to permanent residency
Now if Brit wants to work or stay longer in some European state will have to ask for visa
Don’t have qualification we want
Rejected, stay home
But that’s what they wanted
Don’t forget about the one nothing of snow in the Czech Republic
It is white and cold  and called in German [schnee]
I feel dizzy and unsteady because of the op art  and Im just sitting down and looking at a picture, cannot immagine walking on it
If you ever find yourself in Budapest, I recommend visiting [The House of Terror] museum
Respect from Czech Republic
And sadly these days many try to minimize the suffering of those times and turn to Putin as white knight protector against Muslims
V4 came so far, only to be more than ready to go back
> The museum is run by one of Orbán's most outspoken supporters
Wow, didn't know that
I liked the exhibition about the uprising and communism in general though so that's why I recommended it
That is stupid aswell, because the world does not just revolve around money
We can see that during Covid much clearer than any other time, local production is key and countries that can manufacture medical equipment on their own are much better off, if this lasts longer even stuff like growing wheat for your country gets much more beneficial
You dont want your own agricultural companies to crumble because some African dictator fuck can grow it cheaper with basicaly slave labour
That is why governments pay subsidies or straight up support for some kind of companies, to make it profitable in that country
If you pushed stocks of these companies to 0, they would crash and you would have a country that has to import all its food cause its litteraly impossible to manufacture food that can compete with import
Congratz, you all die of famine if the borders are closed
That comparison doesn't make sense, EU is not a country and doesn't have to pay for the same things as countries do
1% of GDP of whole EU is an abysmal number
Comrade soldier
you're done
Well Muricans like to say Go big or go home
Someone above you said something different
>USA has done 25M tests in total, which is around 77k tests/1M people
From major EU countries, Spain did more tests (103k), Italy about the same (77k), and others less (Germany 56k, Poland 32k, France 21k)
But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections

Which is a result of white supremacy, an ideology supported by Trump

Always play as the king of Georgia in ck2
Great start
If you are wondering like me what are those tube buildings, here is [an article] (it's a music theatre and an exhibition hall)
It's great fun but really hard sometimes
If you want to play it make sure you support the byzantines whenever you can
Without them the Seljuks crush you
I like to start by growing my own power base by conquering the small Muslim states around Georgia and then swearing fealty to the byzantines, which gives you protection and allows you to even become emperor yourself since when you join you're suddenly the most powerful person in the realm besides the emperor himself
Win the next election or win a revolt, and bam, you're emperor
Then it's off to the races as you conquer the world

I don't know about the Danish school system, but during my time at a Czech secondary school (graduated in 2013 and it was a quality school imo), the World/European history lessons basically ended with WW2
Stuff like Cold War or other 20th century conflicts were covered very loosely in the geography classes (only thanks to our great teacher), but that's about it
Kinda wish we didn't spend around 2 or 3 years, twice a week, learning about medieval times and focused on the modern times instead
I hope the curriculum will change for the future generations, as the recent history is equally, if not more, important as the 'ancient' one
Aww, Slovakia
Yeah cool Fuck nazis, but I hope you know those people who were in the streets were ordinary people who are scared to go outside during night hours, not some kind of neofascists
I'm so glad that we don't have this bullshit here
And I hope we never will

It's so sad this tradition is dying
When i was a kid, i would always wake up at about 6, threw my sister into water (with some help of her boyfriend), beat her with pomlázka, then spent whole morning (about 6 hours) walking door by door my whole village with my friends, got some money, got drunk (everyone would just give you shot of slivovice or two, chocolate and some money, usually like 20kč [$0,8], but some people would give you like 200kč), at 12:00 (traditional end) got home, went to sleep
Best day of year
For some reason, when i was like 14, people stopped opening doors
Then kids stopped going out for easter, as it was pointless - now boys only visit their relatives
Soon this tradition will die, it's so sad
It was fun :(
Perfume bottles are also a thing

You HAVE to leave a deceased patient in the respective hospital ward for at least 2 hours after pronouncing death (because determining if someone is dead is not as simple as it sounds and there have been cases of people waking up in morgue)
Now of course in normal case the corpse is moved to empty room
IF there is one
If there is not, then they have to stay in the room with other patients for the entire required time
because there is simply nowhere else to put them
Its not pretty, but it will happen even in much better hospitals simply because they are overcrowded
(and hospitals are intentionally kept at 100% capacity because empty hospital beds do not make money - only full ones do)

I see you don't subscribe to the /r/finlandConspiracy
A sad picture
I don't get Czechs who are proud about this
What are you proud about – that so many girls here end up in a highly exploitative industry where people's future lives are easily ruined
Try finding a job and maintaining decent relationships later in your life if a video of hardcore anal gangbang featuring 19-year-old you is circulating online, potentially totally humiliating you when your partner/colleagues find it
Seriously
Haha that's why we have our own category on porn sites :-D
700
thats quite OK
Wait really
I never knew we has this reputation
Oh no
When I learned about Pornhub I had one question : Is Pornhub recommending me so much Czech porn because I'm Czech, or because it's really that common
I guess I got my answer
I think I have already seen this map months or even years ago
Are the numbers up to date or is it outdated
If anyone is going into this research and compare old and current, I would also like to see the trends
Yes, Prague is the European Capital of Porn
Which is fun if you're into and yo random Czech ho
I can't stand hearing Czech in porn it's awful turn off
Native porntalk is so cringe
Religion
Considering the low unemployment, finding a job shouldn't be too difficult for those people
but when we talking 60 Euros
why would you do that
Also in a recent scandal a Prague city councilwoman was found to have made porn videos when she was younger
> That's caused by people who stigmatize and bully pornstars (...)
Which is almost everyone
The industry preys on vulnerable people who want to earn money and are (yes) often too stupid at that point to recognise the impact of that choice on their future lives
We are not and will never be at a point when "pornstar" is a normal occupation with no stigma attached
People are hypocrites
The point is, the porn is often humiliating itself (often by design)
You can be saying that blue is red all day, but that doesn't make it any redder
Holding it might, when you are a woman and your male colleagues are sniggering behind your back watching you on Pornhub; that really does wonders for the working environment
Or when your boyfriend dumps you when he finds out
Volumes have been written about how a single porn episode can seriously damage a woman's later life; suicides are not uncommon
It's a very tragic price to pay for being stupid in your teens
Were the volumes part of the smut genre, then I could imagine it, because if not, then it's interesting I haven't come across such a volume, even though there should be plenty of them
hehe
Who said it was
But who's to blame changes absolutely NOTHING about their situation
Your point
I know at least 3 girls who filmed porn and dated one
Czech Republic rules
Are you being deliberately difficult
This is NOT about whose fault it is, who's to blame, who has problems with that – this is irrelevant here
I am simply pointing out that a stint in pornography can ruin people's life, and that is a fact
Waaaait a second
I visited a big festival in Kaunas once and I was told that it was a celebration of Lithuania's independence
It had paragliders drawing the Lithuanian flag on the sky, NATO jets flying over, some Lithuanian bands playing, some important people sending their good wishes to Ukraine and such

Independence from an oppressive, evil empire

In French there's also cervoise, it's an almost extinct type of beer brewed without hops
The word "bière", like "beer" in English, was adopted with the arrival beers brewed with hops
In English Ales (brewed without or with very little hops) and Beers (brewed with hops), to the point that they were taxed differently, and IIRC, that distinction still applied in the XVIII and probably even in the XIX centuries
It does, technically
There's an unsettling trend in Czech pubs lately that if you ask for a beer, they ask you which one, which is really an unnecessary delay if you ask me
That's why I say technically
Maybe pivo doesn't mean "drinkable thing" today, but it did maybe several hundreds years ago
Well, if you want řezané, you say you want a řezané, if you want plzeň, ask for plzeň. But it used to be that if you just asked for a beer, they knew you wanted a 10° beer (desítka)

We broke all the no snow records this year
Didnt even get any cross country skiing in
Meanwhile it's 20 where i live
how much for a day of snowfall, Norway
Yet we had snow and minus ten at night a few days ago
Snow isn't a myth, it's just surrounded by a lot of unscientific bullshit, like that it's made of water or other such nonsense
Did you ever see a firepit
Yeah, that's snow all over it
It used to cover entire countries back in the industrial age
How is that "an opinion"? It's a obvious truth

> So this is how the rest of you guys felt in June last year
No, not really
Everybody knows that this won't fly with Spanish government, therefore it has no chance to be actually realized
(It is largely regarded as an internal issue of Spain
UDI is illegal according to the Spanish constitution
Internationally, it is not prohibited to declare independence unilaterally, but states have the right to protect their territorial integrity
So the only way for Catalans to have a state at this point is to engage into a military conflict with Spain and withstand the consequences -economic *and* political- along with the conflict itself, certainly neither of which will happen
On the other hand, Brexit was a legitimate, domestically and internationally recognized decision, which would/will affect not just the GB but the rest of the union as well
In that sense, Brexit felt like a more serious matter
That looks like lots of fun, I'm jelly

I agree entirely, but I do find it a little odd that everyone was more or less fine with tolerating him until *this* particular election
Like, the dude's been in office since 1994 and has won five Presidential elections before this, of which at least four were just as blatantly rigged as this one
I completely agree that his illegitimate Presidency shouldn't be recognized by the international community, but it does seem a bit hypocritical to only make a big movement out of not recognizing him now, as opposed to 20 years ago
Most underrated European country and don't @ me
That is not right

And 50 years ago, new communist government used police, the army and the People’s Militias to brutally squash massive civil protests  on the occasion of  the first anniversary of the invasion
Five young people were shot dead
The state of affairs today in Czech republic - Prime minister - ex communist secret police agent (StB) and normalization communist
(pre)resident of Czech republic - asshole who sends personal letters with best regards and best wishes every time communists and fascists have their yearly gatherings, he openly legitimizes their actions
Fun fact:The only army of the Warsaw Pact that didn't invade was GDR's because they were worried that it may remind people German's occupation from 1939
Let this be a reminder that Communism is never good in any capacity
not only soviet army
Four other Warsaw pact armies invaded with them
You know what is the best political joke
The one that even after 19 years you laugh so hard you have to hold the iron bars
Demonstrations took place in Brno, Liberec and Prague
There were dead and injured, many people were arrested and faced brutal treatment by the police and militias
Thousands lost their jobs and were persecuted by the regime until 1989
And today, the Russian troll who pretends to be Czech president is not commemorating this at all - instead, he is meeting with the leader of the Communist party
God I will celebrate so hard when he finally kicks the bucket
> **new** communist government used police
New
Are you sure
For example Oldřich Černík was the prime minister of Czechoslovakia from 8
april 1968 to 28
January 1970
It was all much more complicated game than it is now described
Bother to support that part about legitimization of their actions with some sources
Afaik he lost his job for critique of the ocupation in 1970, which was time that did actually matter
Critique of the ocupation now is useless and cheap since it's 51 years old event
Yes, these other countries were part of invasion, but really every one here understand, that their governments were partially puppets of Soviet regime, just like Czechoslovak government which was installed after the invasion
By November 4, 1968 all not-Soviet soldiers left the country
Only Soviet army stayed
Czechoslovakia was in the eastern bloc, so basically softly ruled from Moscow
In 1968, the communism here was fading with many freedoms regained, which Soviet didn't take kindly
This invasion was to reinstate full blown communism
If you wanna know more about situation before and after, search "Prague spring" and "normalization in Czechoslovakia".
The minister of interior (police) was changed in January 1969
Oldřich Černík
It took some time before all "contra-revolutionaires" was purged
Černík publicly distanced himself from his previous support of reform
It was not enough to prevent him from being forced out as prime minister in 1970
And he was "only" prime minister, not member of the  Central Committee of the Party
The Party was a place where a real power was
Also, when I say "new" - I think people with "a new perspective" - some people could stay if they revoked their "wrong opinions" and accepted "new truth".
Read Czech newspapers and talk to Czech people
I am not going to translate it for you
He is legitimizing their actions through his own action
Guess who is he meeting today
The leader of the communist party Filip
>Yes, these other countries were part of invasion, but really every one here understand, that their governments were partially puppets of Soviet regime, just like Czechoslovak government which was installed after the invasion
hmm, this is from Prague 1968 -
Also for example drunk Polish soldier killed few people in Jičín. People hated other countries for the invasion too, not as much as Russians but certainly there wasn't understanding for them
Claiming that every other country officials were 100% puppets of Soviet Union, therefore their decision is "understandable" is highly misleading and it is said today only from good manners and also to repair relationships
It is history in the end, i hope it will never repeat and we will make friends with all our neighbour countries
My parents, my teachers, and basically everyone above 30 lived under a communist regime, and they described what was intrinsic to communism
Things like empty stores where you bought nothing except hard salami because there just wasn't anything else
Bread had to be ordered, and 3 hour long lines for ham or chicken were the standard shopping experience
The only fruit you'd ever even see (besides native species) were oranges and bananas, maybe once a year on Christmas
Your kid joked about the head of state in school
He's banned from college
You listened to Beatles
No job
Everything is made worse quality because employment's guaranteed, so why should you even try
Try to leave the country
Jail
Try to connect to the western world
Jail
Did you help defeat the Nazis, but with the British
No jail
You get executed for treason
The environment is fucked because planned economies and the weather don't mix well, add´ to the fact that heavy industry is developed immensely
There used to be places where if you stood outside in a white shirt for 30 minutes the shoulders would turn grey from the smog and soot
Every building is a concrete block, which sometimes don't have the concrete panels connect, causing someones wall to just fall right off
The only people that have any peace are party members, to join simply pledge to spy on all your friends and look for any "political dissent".  If you used to go to church, you don't anymore
You try to leave, they go after you, your wife and your kids
My parent's couldn't imagine a Snickers bar
If they wore jeans in public the might get kicked out of school
This was a system so evil that a young student burnt himself alive in the capital city
There is no fair comparison between Communist Czechoslovakia and today's America
So please don't defend Communism
(That mess in Hong Kong is them btw)
They would probably stay in northern Bohemia, not go to Prague
German soldiers did participate on a small scale (capturing border posts, logistics support, liaison at the operation command)
But if you translated Cunts, you would end up with Kundy
Yes, this was more about 1969
Hard to ignore him, when he almost rules now instead of PM Babis
Our parliamentary system is getting killed by direct presidential elections
Yes, that sounds about what I am going to do
I have a bottle with his name on it waiting just for the occasion
Forgot your ideological visions of the World and read for example *Frost comes from the Kremlin*  *Mráz přichází z Kremlu* *)* by Zdeněk Mlynář to understand elementary facts of the 1968-1970 history
After 21
August 1968 the game was about minimizig impact of the catastrophe caused by idiots like Dubček was, preventing bloodshed, deportations or executions (what all had happened in Hungary)
It is necessary to admit, that even Soviet leaders preferred avoiding it
It was a game with Soviets and a radical Czechoslovak Stalinists for whom even Bilak was unacceptable "revisionist". After most of Černík's government and communist party leadership were arested, president Svoboda kicked out "leninist government" led by Alois Indra, and started negotiate directly with the Soviet leadership, went in Moscow, succeeded to force releasing Dubček and other arrested communist leaders and ministers
They all signed the Moscow Protocol and then started the uneasy complicated period which ended by "normalization" but it was actually the maximum what was possible to achieve; there were much worse alternatives than Husák and Štrougal
Despite all ideological circus, they were technocrtas focused on the economical development in conditions of the Cold War and our geopolitical situation
Such actions like Palach, riots related to hockey or demonstrations in August 1969 could help nothing
Actaully they helped Stalinists to enforce their aggressive politics
Politics is art of possible; the most dangerous people are radical idealists who prefere "ideals" to realistic compromises
Actually Adolf Hitler was also idealist believing in nationalism and "scientific" racism; by the way he din't inveted it, he only dared to force what others only wrote, the same Lenin and may other contemporary freaks
Czech newspapers even do not try to hide their hatred toward the president
Majority of people voted for him, and even the recent polls show his high popularity
it's all cool, my man
communism spun a lot of heads back then
let us take a lesson from it
>read for example Frost comes from the Kremlin Mráz přichází z Kremlu )  by Zdeněk Mlynář
Yeah, I read the book
Zdeněk Mlynář was 1968's communist himself
I'm not sure what you want to say here
Yes, Dubcek was naive if he believed Soviet Union would allow any kind of freedom to it's satellites
Majority of the people did not vote for him
Majority of the turnout
He broke most of campaign legal rules during his "no campaign", lied and took money from companies that are receiving favours now
Fuck him and his apologists
Zeman won by 152k of votes
That's hardly a majority
Stop lying
66% voters turned up
>it is silly to think they could resist the pressure of moscow if there really was a big push to do something
Romania did it as a good example
Dubček was inept as a politician
He failed to understand that Soviets fear that the whole thing will run out of control and Czechoslovakia could even leave the Warsaw Treaty
He had realistic chance to implement some sort of lasting "goulash socialism", and failed in that
Well, those who did not vote should not complain
The other claims are unfounded lies spread by our newspapers
The last sentence explains why people like you always lose in elections
Those who do not bother to vote did not show their opinion
A recent poll found that Zeman has support of [57%] people, more than other political institutions
>He had realistic chance to implement some sort of lasting "goulash socialism"
In that case he wouldn't become a leader of the Party's reform wing
They are not unfounded, but very well documented
It's like climate change, who does not want to see, does not
I will not honour stupid arguments by engaging in discussion
And your point is
How do you like Zeman meeting Filip and his communist cohort today
Or how about Zeman wiping his arse with our constitution
Zeman also met with Pirates, much more dangerous extremists
And I bet you are not constitution expert, you just read something from a yellow newspaper
And you are
I get it
You are one of those pseudo communists
Go kiss his ass
Yup, great tactic is to place nasty label on anyone who doesn't agree with you 100%. Then you will act surprised, why people do not vote as you wish
It must be because they are idiots, there's no other explanation
They did it in WW1, they did it in WW2 they'll do it now

He is still making reforms and he has been causing a lot of deaths for a long time
He didn't change much, the western perception of him did

Achievements
Building low quality infrasructure and pushing countries into debt traps
You should personally see the Chinese built infrasctructure in Africa
Well, their quality is terrible even in China
Cold War was probably the best time of human history
Well, my comment was entirely based on my personal experince from my visits of Africa and China
It was definitely not based on any headlines or propaganda
Only stuff I've seen and heard right at the location
I take this into consideration and still feel the world was mostly calm
I definitely agree my experience is anecdotal
I am willing to admit the debt trap narrative might be incorrect
This is something impossible to assess for an average visitor
On the other hand, my experience in China was different
The people didn't tell me anything because of language barrier
I saw those potholed motorways and crumbling buildings with my own eyes during my trips in 2018 and 2019
As well as those in Africa
I even saw new road being built paralell to the terrible Chinese one in Ethiopia
Why are those banned
Can we please stop using reductio ad hitlerum
For example look at the population and GDP growth of Germany and France in the 1930s and Russia and Poland in the 2010s. You'll see completely opposite trends
The comparison is not relevant

What's the word
Earthsea
This is exactly what's wrong with modern democracy and why throughout history, from ancient Greece right up to the 20th century, voting was restricted to the wealthy
Because like it or not, the fact is that wealth is very strongly correlated with the quality of one's education
As education levels increased in less wealthy classes in recent centuries, so did their involvement in political decision-making
The mistake we've made is we've gotten ahead of ourselves and given the right to vote to everyone *before* educating everyone rather than after
And that is exactly why in Czechia, you must have a respirator/mask while leaving home and at public transportation, they can actually kick you out if you don't have one
Why don't they cover their faces with something
I get they have to get to work, but that's like the bare minimum

Nobody I know puts Romania in Central Europe
It’s the Visegrad 4, the German states, and the Baltics
This is not far off the reality
I find amusing that there is 10 other examples like that on the map and somehow you are amused only about Scotland
This is not a map which shows just latitude and longitude and its borders
It is regional/cultural map of Europe
Yes sometimes it looks strange, but most of the time it makes sense and it is shown like that from a reason
In a universe where Austria-Hungary existed and pretty much all HRE Emperors since 16th century were simultaneously Kings of Hungary
Western Ukraine makes some amount of sense
Serbia doesn’t I agree
>Of course Germany is culturally closer to Romania than Denmark
No one is denying that
What point are you trying to make and why ? Quite obviously those are not hard set borders of regions with same culture, they are just very generalized regions
Estonia and Switzerland ? Iceland and Finland ? Greece and Moldova ? Northern Spain and Malta ? Crimea and Karelia ? etc etc
I dont like those kind of maps because it is always disputed, it is very inaccurate and it will only make mad pretty much everyone
On the other hand it is virtually impossible to do such map accurately without it being a complete mess and it will be heavily disputed anyway
Trans-Carpathian Ukraine was formerly part of Czechoslovakia, and culturally has more in common with Czech than it does with eastern Ukraine
Also similar to western Romania, in that there is a reasonably sized Czech minority still living there
Edit to add: There are really two Ukraines
The west is ethnic Ukrainian, Czechoslovak and Rusinian, the East is majority Russian
That’s true, yeah
Ok it makes sense then
Never been there, but Im sure this music plays there on repeat

Don’t give in
You’ve got this
Not necessarily all migration
Illegal migration for sure
You can't have people without identity all over the place and feel safe
In my opinion it extremely important to handle these illegals
People with good intentions should ASK if they can stay
Treat your country same way you would treat your house
You can, it's called allowing citizens to carry guns
But you guys don't want that
I certainly hope you’re right
You can't seriously expect to solve a complex issue with a simple solution
This is literally a terrorist attack with a gun
I'm sure the terrorist acquired it legally right
Did anyone say anything about guns being as easy to buy as in the US
I'm sure an islamic extremist wouldn't be able to pass the citizenship requirement, pass the mental evaluation and get a license that checks responsible gun handling
Terrorists also usually have a criminal record of some sorts that would automatically disqualify them from owning a gun
Gun owners, at least in the Czech republic, are often better trained than the police
The police is lucky if they go to a range twice a year, gun owners are usually at a range several times per year or even several times per month
And even an idiot can pull a trigger and kill a terrorist
Yes, because guns are difficult to get
But guess what, allowing law-abiding citizens to own guns doesn't make guns easier to get for criminals or terrorists
In the Czech republic we can own and carry guns after a short license and medical evaluation and our gun crime is practically zero
A terrorist would certainly have no way to access a gun unless he stole one, which would be hard to do with guns needing to be locked in a safe unless they're on your person
I remember reading it in a news article where they interviewed a police officer (or a police chief
) where he said they go to a range on average twice a year, it was a while ago
Your average gun owner goes to a shooting range more than that because it's also a hobby and more training automatically means they are better with a gun
And it's better if two people get shot on accident than if two people get their head cut off
You can usually recover from the former but you can't recover from the latter
Well no way to access a gun legally
The black market always exists, whether guns are legal or not
This and Bataclan attack are examples of that
Not allowing mentally stable, law-abiding citizens to own guns just ensures that the only people who have guns are terrorists and criminals that acquire them illegally
>Except it would be infinitely easier to get a gun on the right market than right now
That's simply not true and there's nothing to prove that
In Brazil you cannot carry a gun and getting a license is hard and very expensive, yet Brazil has a huge gun crime problem, way bigger than even the US
The Czech republic that allows people to own and carry guns has extremely low gun crime, basically all of it committed with illegally owned guns (and even then the crime rate is very low)

Babiš won't be ousted by these demonstrations, their importance is not in getting rid of him, because that can be done only in elections, their importance is in setting boundaries for him so that he doesn't think he can get way with misuse of power
Sort of
Babiš is a bit smarter than Trump and Trump obviously isn't a former Communist
But I'd say they are similar in terms of their mentality and understanding of democracy (i.e., "I am a democrat if it suits me and my business")
Both rely mainly on dissatisfied older rural voters and both polarise the society and mobilise voters against internal and external threats
Nope, that's just not in our mentality

Police
Regular police officer have nothing to do with Babis
It is even worse
I heard cashier in Kaufland saying that she likes Babiš, because they raised her wage while he is in power
Some people connects current prosperity with Babiš, even though it isn’t his success and he is more like chocking economy

Exactly
I don't say that often, but I'd like to thank the police in Prague for an excellent job during the demonstration (closing traffic to enable people to leave easily etc
Right, cause the ideological inconsistency has always stopped high ranking communist officials from enriching themselves through political power in the past
He did all of that using the people that used to be in power and members of STB (our version of KGB) who were never persecuted or jailed after the velvet revolution
It’s all based on corruption, buying state businesses for fraction of their value, building an empire big enough to crush or assimilate any competitor
He is a proven STB informant and his companies are full of people tied to the former communist government
He isn’t a communist, nor are his buddies from STB, they are just cronies - oligarch wannabes - with enough power and dirt to push his agenda
He also bought huge chunk of local media using it as a club to crush his political opponents (there are recordings of him giving these instructions)

How do you measure that
Our GDP PPP per capita for example was always higher than for the Soviets
Was it
Weren't the Balkans better for a while
Do you have any data for that
I believe you if we talk about Moscow and St
Petersburg, but other than that I'm not so sure
I don't have the data either, but some of my friends visited various smaller Russian cities as university students for a semester in the 80s and the areas they saw were significantly poorer than what we lived in at the time
Well, I've got some studying to do
Mostly industrial regions in Czechia, which are now poorer but at the time were above average
But the regional differences were small, because communism
> Russian village
You said that
Those were about equally sized towns which should be obvious since I'm talking about studying at a university
I'm claiming that life in an average town in Czechia was significantly better than life in an average town in european Russia with the exception of Moscow and St
Petersburg

It's stupid to blame it on Turks as a nation, however Erdogan is dragging attention to Turkey by basically acting like he is the defender of islam against the fashist West
It's probably not that shocking that some people would interpret Erdogan's statements as deliberately flaming hatred of the West in the muslim world and hence indirectly encouraging such attacks

It has a lot to do with our history, having catholicism forced down our throats after the Battle of White Mountain and forced recatholization drove off a lot of people
Czechs also dont have much faith in "authorities" like churches or larger organizations
Also a lot of people believe in something just not what organized religions tell them to
The best frenemies
Yet some dumb people still use the argument "Oh, you Czechs are atheists because of communism
Coming from Moravia eh
The 10% showing are actually all from south Moravia
User flair fucking-A czechs out
> governments deliberately make it hard to pass it on to the next generation
What
Interestingly (from what I heard) us Czechs are generally well liked in Poland, while we generally tend to really dislike Poles
I would say large organizations that like to tell you what to do too much
Be it a church or the Soviet Union or the EU
Nope
An interesting urban legend, but absolutely no
Read on Vatican relations with Czechoslovakia between the wars
Read on Masaryk's opinions on the church
Before the WWII, the church was seen as enemy of the Republic by a lot of people
Especially after Vatican praised Mussolini and later Hitler
To be honest, during the war many church leaders showed a great courage and were on a way to regain the trust of the nation
In the years after the war, the communists made a coalition with the christian party, joining hands with Catholics and presented their own version of state religion
They paid the priests, they decided which orders to disband and which to leave
The longest serving member of communist government was Plojhar, a roman Catholic priest
Going to church getting you into trouble
So how come there were people building their political careers through the christian party itself
Through going to church getting seats in the Parliament
The persecution of certain religious figures was what it was - persecution of figures, not - as the Catholics try to sell it as - persecution of the church
Stanislav Balik Ph
D. mentions it somewhere (not sure where now) that in the late 40s and early 50s, the percentage of Christians among communist party members was higher than the percentage of Christians in the general population
And he is a christian himself, and anti-communist, so he is not very happy about it
It is almost unbelievable how many religious motives and religious songs are in early 50s CS propaganda movies
Watching them, one can believe he is watching something made by Ned Flanders
Not to mention liberal/conservative, which is a whole different scale
> I see no reason for not bringing it back
Maybe because schools are for teaching, and not for brainwashing
I still find on weird that in the USA it's the catholics who are the progressive minority
No, surely not the underground groups
Although later, the stopped caring
Nice example are the mormons
As long as they were operated from USA, it was underground and dangerous
When they became just CS and pretty much independent, the state stopped watching them
Problem is we humans will never understand God or how he thinks
Why is there like hundreds of religions
What about predetermination
Many popes brought their elections does this null their decision since they weren't voted in best intent of Christianity
What about some saint that absolutely shouldn't be saints
If God exist that is completely different maybe he does or maybe he doesn't. But question about religion and God goes back into history my personal favorite is “Live a good life
If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by
If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them
If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones

How do you distinguish between different curse words though
Some (if not all) languages have multiple common curse words with different literal meanings and different usages
You're definitely not matching them on literal meaning and it seems the usage is also different between different countries
So how did you choose the words
Most of central/eastern Europe united by kurva
One word to rule them all, one word to find them, one word to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
Bold of you to include Turkey
The good old kurva belt, also known as V4
That looks so wrong with the space
LOL
Bazmek/bazmeg is a totally innocent slang word in Czech
Good to know that it comes from Hungarian and what it means
I can't agree, I absolutely use "kurva" as a general swearword equivalent to "fuck" and rarely use it in relation to a person
In Czech, Belgrade (Bělehlad) means "White Castle"
This is just blatantly incorrect
I heard they wanted to use Serbian Nigger instead of White City in the original version, but they were like naaaah
Just in case anyone is interested, [this is the spot on Google maps
Brno is an architectural mix
Most of its renaissance and medieval old town was torn down in the 19th century to make room for modern buildings and this progress continued later, so you often see Functionalist buildings in the middle of old houses
It's definitely not as glorious as what Prague has to offer, but Brno has its charms and gems
A Canadian guy who has lived here for 50 years once told me that cities are either extroverted, showing of their monuments (like Prague), or introverted, where you have to find the interesting things yourself, but then it's worth it
Brno is definitely introverted
Haha, you guys are in for a surprise
Czech Republic*
Tss, they don't even have Metro
This is sadly the best best that Brno has to offer, it pales in comparison with Prague in pretty much everything
Brno is probably the biggest village in the world
Prepare for overcrowded centrum full of under construction streets
Brno is just a big village, as we say here in Prague
*apvout

Thanks
Not a big fan of this country but nice to see a different perspective
Sleep is for the weak
Yes
It doesn't have a name as far as I know
it's from the late 19th century, there's a bank inside and I think there are apartments in the upper floors
[Map link]
I also found a side by side comparison of how the building currently looks vs
how it looked in the 19th century, it's from a website of a project that was restoring the facade
Unfortunately that's the only useful info the website gave
It's funny how people from Prague keep saying how they don't care about Brno (as the overused joke goes: "You know what Praguers say about Brno
Absolutely nothing
"), yet every time Brno is mentioned in national news or reddit or elsewhere, the discussion is always full of Praguers making fun of Brno - and it's usually clear that the last time they were there was at least 20 years ago (when it indeed was much more shitty), if at all
And just to be clear - yes, this is generalizing, not everyone is like this
[Well there is a park (albeit a poor one) about 200 meters from this spot
[And we do have a huge park around the Spielberg castle right in the city center about 10 minute walk from this spot
There's no dark side
This is one of the few bright spots on an otherwise shit smeared canvas
As much as I'm making fun of it, I don't hate the city
It's ugly, but it's not hiding it behind a fake mask like some other cities
Yes
I wonder what you would say if the government of the Czech Republic would suddenly say it decided to withdraw the name in the same manner as it announced it will submit the name
Cannot stop progress
I was living there for 4 years like 5 years ago, so I know the city well
And it's just boring small town
Why though
It's english way of saying Česko
If you look at name of Czech Republic in dozen of other languages, It's usually very close to Czechia
It's an term to be used in english not czech
Not OP, but I dislike [how it sounds]
Well Czechia became the official short form because before we only had the long form (Czech Republic) which was sometimes awkwardly shortened to "Czech" which didn't make sense
Personally it sounds a little too close to "Чехия" which is the Russian name for Czech Republic, and this brings up rather unfortunate associations
I'm not aware why others don't like it as much
Also it gets annoying when people think we were "renamed", we weren't, only now we added a short form
It also doesn't help with the whole Chechnya confusion thing we got a while back
I don't know why we didn't just use "Czesko" instead of Czechia to resemble the czech short form
It's only as boring as you make it yourself
But the possibilities are almost endless
Yes, it doesn't have the big touristic attractions like Prague (and thus streets overcrowded with tourists), but other than that
And I always laugh at the "small town" - have you ever been in a "small town"? A few tens of thousands inhabitants
Yes, Prague is really big, but it's a "small town" compared to let's say Paris
Edit: But I didn't want to argue about which city is better, bigger (there's no argument there, obviously) or less boring
It's really up to everyone what suits them
If you are an American tourist visiting Europe, Prague is definitely where you want to go in 99% cases (but even then there are people who would prefer the less touristy spots)
I was merely reacting to your original statement which amazingly contradicts itself ('overcrowded' and 'village')
There is one sense in which I consider Brno a village though - and that it is that everyone seems to know each other
And if they don't, they can always find at least one mutual friend
Hold on though, there is no X pronounciation in Czechia no
Yep it's pronounced with [k] which I'm not fond of
Ah, thanks for catching that
Unfortunately I don't think the bridge at the actual Rataje has survived to the modern day (if there even was one there to begin with, don't know) but most of the rest of the castle is still there

I feel sorry for Iceland
So proud to be Czech

How is the difference so fucking huge
Is this a joke attempt or are you serious
*Cool, I was there*
Something like that
Neither am I proud of it, nor ashamed, it was just for comedy purposes
Tbh it may be a bit controversial job, but there are much worse and more controversial jobs you can end up with and as long as you "follow your passion" and do it from your own will, I mean, why the fuck not, we're living in a free country
"F"
Rules for thee, not for me
Hypocrite
Absolute motherfuckin retard
Like the rest of our government
Sadly, he was at least a competent epidemiologist and a good health minister to have in a pandemic
I do not think his replacement will be as good
Sad thing is that he was actually doing something even tho he broke his own rules
I thought he was still hanging around, like the last fly of summer
I am going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but here I go
We should have let it slide
He’s the best person we currently have, being a valid expert, not a politician
He only took the post because he was needed, knowing it would be a shitshow
His way of announcing more strict restrictions and kindly asking people to abide by them, explaining why are they neccessary, was stellar in my opinion
He got a lot of hate for handling the mess we all helped to create
I am pissed off with the tabloids blowing it out of proportion and printing headlines like “made us go home from work and meanwhile
” as if he was meeting there with Faltýnek to down a couple beers
Yes, he shouldn’t have accepted Faktýnek’s invitation to come
I haven’t been keeping up with the news so I don’t know if their excuses are valid
But for fuck’s sake, we are the worst at covid right now and switching a health minister again, especially one who was avoiding all the real mistakes (communicating in a way that made people pissed and disobedient) is so infuriatingly dumb
It all feels like we’re a nation of snickering kids
Happy that the mean man in charge of fixing our mess made a mistake and had to go away
They're due to a public drinking ban that was issued by him as a measure against covid
That's a great example of Czech humor for you
Sounds like a dumb idea, but there was reason for the ban - people would buy a beer or two when leaving the pub at ten (when they had to close at the time) and drink them in the streets

Is the proverb "Preaching water, drinking wine", that we use in Czech, known in English

Imo draught radegast is the definition how lager beer should taste
Some say it’s too bitter, I say that’s what home taste like
Well it's said our beer is the best
No, it's not
I don't know how long it's been since you visited, but Pilsner can rarely be seen below 40 CZK (1
50 €)
Especially in Prague
If you're talking about bottled beer, it still isn't true for Pilsner, but you can buy a cheap beer in a supermarket for that
Czech guy here
Pilsner Urquell is definitely not 35 euro cents here
It goes from around 0
8-1 euro in stores and up to 2 euros in restaurants
Other pilsner-style beers can be found for the price you mentioned but unless it is a decent beer on sale, it is usually trash
I was talking about draught beer
In the second part I said even if you were talking about bottled, Pilsner is more than 35 c. Which it is
29 CZK is over 1 €.
I understand the negativity toward black (gypsies) and Muslim people here, good old xenophobic Czechia
But I'm really surprised by the negativity towards both Vietnamese and Jewish people
Vietnamese people are part of our society for decades, they are usually known as hard working and pretty much everyone is in regular contact with them in their shops
I know many mixed couples and everyone here is fine with them
And Jewish people are pretty much not known here
People usually only know them from some jokes
I don't understand that statistic at all, they aren't a much visible part of out society here, so there's no reason to hate on them imo
Oh yeah, Czech republic for the win <3
LOL and some of us still don't want to admit we're still mentally in Eastern Europe
Typical Czechs
This is quite inaccurate
Where is 0-10% section
I don't believe that 1-2 of 10 czechs would feel comfortable having their child in relationship with muslim
Damn, my country is really shitty
Source: Am Czech
The asian and jewish part is what surprises me
I get that muslims are not very popular in here, but the asian community here is pretty big and pretty much liked by everyone except a few bitter old ppl and outright nazis
Anti-semitism was also never a problem here
So WTF
Czechoslovakia stands strong
Yes, that seems about right
Looking through the whole survey, especially striking is that Czechs are apparently significantly below average when it comes to being comfortable with having an atheist coworker - 80% EU average (Comfortable or moderately comfortable), 69% Czech
Yeah, big surprise
We're racist
I do care about ethnicity
I want my grandkids to look like me and my ancestors, not someone from Egypt
Why would that make any difference
TRIGGERED
That's pretty racist dude
When we Czechs surely are at least low level racist, jumping to racism because girls were cold to you in bar is hilarious in its megalomania
There was ever an image of us being a mecca of rationality
But yeah, we're irreligous which also causes us to be fairly liberal in the matters of LGBT, abortions or light drugs
But in other things, we're indeed a conservative society (in European standards)
I think that a lot of the dislike of muslims comes from their culture, not terrorism
Vietnamese people are in a bit of a wierd situation here, some Czechs are pretty xenophobic
Also, I assume most asked imagined a Roma person under "black person", but that's just a guess
Fuck Okamura, though
At least they didn't ask about the Roma
>We need to change it
No, we don't.
Czech media help this a lot
Most people watch and read shit like televizní noviny, novinky
cz, parlamentní listy
Even though there are almost no muslims/blacks/jews in the country it still shapes the views of people against them
30% of the population will vote for ANO apparently so there is plenty ignorant and stupid people in our country
No surprise
Yes we are, look at the map and the abundant comfortable feeling around Jews
Heh, too true
I don't know if [denormal numbers] would suffice
Oh, your searing wit left me speechles
Your "experience" is that you got cold treatment from girls in club
Saying that it has *any* correlation with the data is just narcistic
There are hundreds of guys being rebuffed by girls right this second
Sharing this experience
How many of them are jumping to blame  local ethnic/racial/religious preferences instead of their undesirable character ,low attractivnes or just plain lack of damn interest
But that is indeed the primary reason why muslims are not liked
I mean lot of Middle Eastern muslims look not that different from Spanish, Italian or Greek people and those are not disliked in the Czech republic
So it's not the 'Arab' look that is the problem
Should be still there
But in all honesty it took me years before I realized he's actually half black
My mind always perceived him as Czech even though visually kinda tanned
Speaks for power of integration probably :D
Disliked is IMHO a too strong word
I would rather say a big part of Czechs feel uncomfortable around them
It's largely the fear of unknown, but you're right that Czechs are in a way tribalistic, meaning that they are worried about everyone who doesn't fit in what is 'normal' in the Czech republic
Other Europeans are nowadays considered 'normal' in the Czech republic
White immigrants from the Anglo-word as well
But Asians and blacks are unusual and thus suspicious
Defensive nationalism is very deeply rooted here, it was for centuries our passive-aggressive mechanism on how to resist Germanization
We wouldn't exist as a nation if we weren't like this and thus these knee-jerk reactions are strongly rooted in our mentality
But at the same time, it tends to be a passive, non-personal kind of reaction, i.e. people feel uncomfortable, but largely don't ventilate it on specific Asian/Black people
Many people are also perfectly fine with having this schizophrenic view that foreigners/immigrants in general are dangerous, but at the same time the few foreigners that they know personally are ok
When you point this out to them, they say something like "yeah, but this particular guy/girl doesn't count, he/she is not like them, he/she is an okay person".
For the internet, this guy was something more than just an ordinary celebrity
He was one of the most iconic people on the internet, and reddit is an internet site
He was from Iceland and Iceland is in Europe
Combination of these two make it stand out in /r/europe, compared to other european celebrities, which are not so big on the internet
Pretty sure people call those chairs
It's funny when you compare that to Czechia, whose core's borders barely changed over the past thousand years
I guess we're a never-ending soap opera

Since it's missing, it would 1,09 for Czechia
Data taken from
**Czechia** is colored grey for no data
You can find on the internet that we have **0
6** homicide rate
Oh we're *no data*, whoa, I was scared for a second
I'm assuming police use of lethal force and trespassing are not accounted for as murder
We would then need to use white fonts on the US map
"No data" color should not be that close to the max rate
That includes attempted murders too, however
So the actual number of people who died is lower
Turkey is almost completely in Asia Minor, whereas 77% of Russian population lives in Europe
In case of Turkey it's perhaps something like 13% of the population
Hence such stats as homicides which are describing the population should be attributed to the continents where the overwhelming portion of the population lives, at least until you can get a better breakdown of the data
Ah, strange that datas differ in that
Maybe your source does count attempts to murder too
And we can actually carry guns here
>crimes committed with firearms are more deadly than those committed with knives
Uh, no, not really
People understimate how deadly knives are
You just need to get a bit closer but once you are within reach
There are 3-4 people injured by guns for every killed one on average
Arent most murders gang related though
Im no sure guns would change that much
They would still just kill each other
I mean, carrying knives is also banned and they just keep happily stabbing each other
You'd need the homicide stats of the European side for that
Then again, give how many ILLEGAL guns there are in Serbia
And most of them are former military guns too
My Serbian friends family has a bunch of assault rifles hidden somewhere
It really doesnt
You just need to stab randomly
You also need to hit a critical area with a gun
Otherwise the victim bleeds out in both cases
That takes time and they can be saved
Just consider the size of ah average knife and of the average bullet
Im pretty sure a lot of gun shot wounds gets unreported
On the other hand, there is a lot of ways you can get injured by a knife that doesnt involve violence
I know a guy who cut off two of his fingers because he wasnt careful
Also, most of those US gun deaths are suicides, the sad fact is that a suicide very likely to succeed if you use a gun
But we were talking about murders
Its not really easier to kill one person with a gun
If you want to do it at range, you need practice
At very close range, it doesnt really matter
Of course, killing a lot of people with a gun is easier but, if I understand it correctly, most murders in the UK are actually just one or two victims, right
On top of that, knives are pretty much silent
Shoot a gun and everyone within miles knows about it
The *is* data for the grey countries
No idea why it's missing from the map
Except youre not just pulling the trigger, not if you want to hit
Unless its point-blank range
Ajd even then, stabbing is easy
Have you actually ever shot a pistol
If you shoot or stab someone by accident, youve done something very, very wrong
If hey both pull knives, chances are they both bleed to death before any help comes, unless one of them is much more skilled
I guess it will be the same for guns, except the faster guy has a better chances of surviving
We have a says here: In a knife fight, the lose dies on the pavement, the winner dies in the ambulance
Expansion depends heavily on the type of gun
Pistol rounds are mostly too slow to really cause hydrostatic shock
You need fast rifle rounds for that
Im sure knife injuries are also underreported but its much easier to explain a cut by saying it was an accident than doing the same for a gun shot
Especially im Europe
Yeah, accidental shootings are rare, here, they mostly involve hunting accidents because old hunters didnt have to know much about shooting to get a licence during the commie era and nobody could justify taking their licences away
6:1 is actually better than what they generally show in stats
But as I said, people tend to underestimate deadly knives can be
Bleeding is very dangerous and its not that hard to cut a major blood vessel with a long slash
Bataclan could have been done with knives really
They just blocked off the escape routes and, because the police didnt do anything, they had a very very long time to just walk around and kill everyone
The Westminster guys had what
5-10 minutes before the police arrived and killed them
They still killed 10+ people and injured dozens
>A surgeon in the UK at a London said that gunshot wounds are at least twice as deadly as knife wounds and more difficult to repair
I think he knows what he’s talking about
Yeah, that sounds about right
But people seem to think guns are somehow 100x more deadly
Both depend heavily on hit placement
> Shooting somebody is also less risky than stabbing somebody especially in gang attacks as you can fire at somebody from a safe distance away
Actually hitting someone from a safe distance requires practice, especially under stress
I saw some statistics from the US and US policemen basically hit 1 in 5 shots at ranges above some 7 meters
And although police training with firearms generally isnt that great, theyre still trained people
> Stabbing somebody requires you getting up close
Yeah, and thats all you really need along with some physical strength
In effect, both stabbing and shooting someone at point-blank range are trivially easy
Lets hope there wont be more attacks like that
And do whatever you guys want with your country
Just dont force mine to do it too
I dont think we are as similar as many people think
If you exclude the period of Czechoslovakia, then you will notice that both countries had a very different history
But yes, modern age inventions like newspapers, radio,TV or internet has bring us closer together since our language is so similar
My theory with Euro is simple, discourse about currency is a an echo chamber which is very hard to turn in opposite direction once it is set
It wasnt so controversial topic lets say 15+ years back
All you need is few eurosceptic leading figures which will influence public discourse towards negative aspects of Euro
Average person who had no opinion about Euro will of course hear some of this rhetoric some way or another
And the next time when that person will have conversation with someone else about Euro, he will present what he have heard and the next person will do the same
Once someone has presented his opinion publicly it is very hard to convince that person otherwise, people dont like to look like fools
I am affraid it will be practicaly impossible to turn opinion about Euro at this point
This echochamber mentality goes both ways and it is visible in many issues
It's the tourists who get scammed so the locals don't care
Yeah, for example we Czechs intentionally weaken our currency so Its better for export, And we export majority of products to Germany
Hello there, taky Čech
A souhlas
Did we get the Czech Corridor, for a bit easier access to the sea
Less of Africa, more Europe
The more I learn about Estonia, the more I like it
One of the reasons I can think of is that some people might cut several trees down and sell them for profit
Even a small fee like this probably discourages them
r/mapswithoutprague
Wheres Prague
Where is Prague
If any city of Central Europe should be depicted in this LotR-style map, it should be Prague
Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Europe's largest and most powerful medieval empire
Also, the Sudetes look nothing like that
I really like it and would love to see a few minor tweaks
It's beautiful and all, but the omission of Prague is kinda tough to swallow :D
Prague is apparently a mountainhome
Maybe it is hidden underground with its grand forges, where we search for the heart of the mountains
wow this is much better
Oh it's perfect
Thank you
^_^ Made my day
The Sudetes look great as well
No, but it was the capital for the longest period of time out of all the capitals
It was also considered the golden age of the HRE
/r/MapsWthoutCZ ?
They do this all the time
Last year they said that Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was "help"
Alternative facts
Why has the global version of christmas has to be that lousy Santa Claus when this exists
Wait until this guy hears about slovakian easter traditions
What the hell happened here
I bet they didn't even use their blinker to indicate they're turning downwards
Don't people get lost in a place like this
Because people like you keep applying American Left and American Right to Middle/Eastern European countries
Is it just my app that I see stars instead of your comment
The thing is "will they get covered by polish health insurance
Or will they have to pay the procedure out of their own pocket
Planned out-of-country health procedures are not covered by EHIC in most cases and emergency ones might not be covered if it's illegal in Poland
What I mean is that you can't apply American Left and Right to Middle/Eastern European countries
Ah, I was worried Relay was censoring swearing (in polish
Everyone who can think is Far Right by the American standard
I would not say far right, just a fucking moron
I am very surprised
I am genuinenly surprised how low is our number
Easy winter has to be the reason
What
Czech Republic is second
I'd say I am surprised how high Slovakia is, but I'm not really
The data is from 2016 and I am pretty sure it got worse
už vím jak se Karel Gott cítil když přebíral Slavíka číslo 46
Poster only cites Iceland from 2016 data
Every other country is from 2018 data
You're right, I still think the data for Czech Republic is wrong as my experience with people living outside of Prague is, that they are barely able to pay bills and have any money to spare
That is some strong ABBA vibes
Fuck nazis but like fuck stalin too
Didn’t they also bomb Khreschatyk while retreating from Germans with mines hidden in homes along the road
Holy crap, this just kept on giving
Magnificient
You could say uber mench
Politically insignificant
One of the main concerns in Czech media during coronavirus outbreak was the debate whether we will be allowed to visit you in summer
The worst thing about this is that Nokia was the last big European "tech company". With it, Europe ceded its relevance in this area to America and China
Such a missed opportunity for Europe, sigh
Imagine Nokia reacted correctly and in 2008/2009 came with its own good mobile OS and started releasing "modern" capacitative touchscreen smartphones
Android would have had a pretty hard time starting as in 2009, it was still pretty shitty (even though in many ways ahead of iOS)
Nokia brand was still very powerful, so had it played its cards right, we'd have three competing operating systems and large tech companies today instead of just Plague (Apple) and Pestilence (Google)
But consumer tech is critical for your image is a global technology leader
Europe now relies on two American mobile operating systems and mostly Chinese-made hardware, when it could have had both natively
Worse, it is likely that new consumer technology will be built on the existing platforms (think VR/AR, AI), and Europe again will play sidekick here
Even worse, the US tech companies are so big nowadays that they can easily gobble up startups and emerging competitors in Europe (and usually ruin them after looting their tech)
The Chinese don't bother with buying them and steal their tech right away
It's shameful
It is, but only for the enthusiasts
For the average consumer, not so much
They have two choices now: Google spyware or overpriced Apple toys
Apple doesn't need to win in sales; it still [takes about 90% of profits in the smartphone market] Nokia could have done the same: release a small number of high-end flagships to grab profits and a few entry-level phones for the masses (at the time when Android on low-end phones was utter shit, people would have flocked to buy Nokia hardware)
Build up the ecosystems so that users are encouraged not to switch and you're all set
So easily, we could have had a situation where Apple had 15-20%, Nokia another ~20% with the rest being Android
Apple's home territory would be the US, Nokia would be leader in Europe and Android would dominate in developing countries
Nokia
It actually had promising candidates, but did not give them enough support at the right time
Interesting, I thought you operated from Minas Morgul
I... I honestly always thought they just built it in dark dirty colors lol
It'll take some getting used to, but after what happened in Brazil this week, I'm just glad to see we're expending time and effort to maintain our historical institutions
*its
Did it look this uniform originally
Before the restoration, you can see some elements of the facade are darker than others, such as the columns and cornices
I always thought those were made darker deliberately to make them stand out
Now the building looks very flat, all the detail just blends in
Well the museum is closed for something like 8 years now
but they were renovatig inside most of that time
Sorry for stealing all your water to wash our museum
Our bad
[yup]
Around 2:00
Sounds like something invented by a beautician
Commie urban planners had the wonderful idea to run the highway just in front of it, so no luck in this case
But that can be used by both sides, and yet the positive side keeps winning
No reason to be so negative all the time :)
I  will probably get hated for this but that city feels like its much better on pictures and pretty boring and sort of fake or empty in person
I live in Prague though so I might be biased
Even free kapusta is expensive kapusta >:(
(but good job, I hate wasting food too)
Polish kapusta is like slovak kapusta (i.e. zelí, cabbage)
So that's nice
It's not the Czech kapusta (kale), which can go burn in hell
Cool
But what does it mean
Well, now you've awaken my inner Hussite
Roll out the wagons and flails, boys
Greece is in need of some religious reform

Oooh, that divide, already wanted to call dipps on danube
Not kidding, they made their own version a while back

This is like something from bad lip reading youtube channel :D
this is why we cannot solve stuff, because of small-minded people liek you
Ah, I remember hearing about the myth in the Seal Museum in Iceland
Look at how completely dominant EU imports and exports to the EU are in our trade
Now consider there are idiots in this country who would want a Czech-out
Anyway, technically this is a holiday celebrating Czechoslovakia, so greetings to our pals under the Tatras
Please make it a national holiday too ;-)
BTW, our fertility rate is 1,63 (year 2016)
Eurostat seems to use outdated info
Happy Indipendence Day to us all
Just a note, October 28th 1918 is the date Czechoslovak Republic got independent after the breakup of Austia-Hungary
The official day the modern Czech Republic got independent from Czechoslovak Federation Republic is January 1st 1993
I am Czech and I am honestly triggered by this exclusion of Slovakia
From A-H.
The dissolution of Czechoslovakia is not celebrated in the Czech Republic as a "real" Independence day and since it's on January 1 everyone is too hungover to think about it anyway
This particular one is the independence from A-H.
Independence "from" Slovakia is not celebrated at all
Maybe in Slovakia
Děkujeme
How much would change
In numbers if possible please
But yeah, czexit is a dumb idea
Love you guys too
I actually have a proposal
Some idiots in the newly elected parliament want to make a law about constitutional referendum
It is speculated that should it happen, sooner or later there will be a referendum about leaving the EU
we have to beat them to it with a referendum about the west of the country joining Bavaria
Would it be cool with you
It wouldn't be fair against other countries :-P
> Awesome that it falls on a Saturday
Is it
If it was Friday or any other day during the work week, most people wouldnt have to go to work, schools would be closed, all that stuff
I'm going to celebrate it by nursing my hangover from yesterday and not going outside today
Czechs have almost no Christian holidays (discounting Christmas, we would have none), so we can have more "national" ones
It all boils down to the same thing in the end
Well it depends on what exact time period you mean
The Habsburgs got in the Czech throne in 1526, so they were ruling over us for a very long time - and so naturelly it wasn't the same throughout all the centuries
There were times of really hard religious, cultural and language opression, when the Czech population was forcibly re-catholized and germanized, when the Czech language was largely pushed to the periphery of the society, when only the low educated peasents spoke it, but then there were also times when more enlightened rulers were on the throne
We keep our population more or less stable for over a century now, around 10-11 mio (with help of some wars, genocides and similar joyful pasttimes)
Demographic projection for year 2050 forecasts our population, you can guess, at 10
5 mio
Basically Slovaks wanted independence cause they felt like "the lesser one" in our relationship
I think rightfully so too
Long tradition in coal related industry and nuclear energy
It will increase but majority of the population is still in favour of the nuclear power plants
Thanks
Yes it is
1st of January is officially the day of the reestablishment of the separate Czech state
So it's *technically* a holiday
> Also WTF, wikipedia, why does it correspond to "1, 2, 3, 4, ..." in other languages
Lol, really what the actual fuck
Odcházíme
I never understood why this is so controversial in Slovakia
Do people really think it was not a great time for Slovakia as well
We got rid of the Habsburg rule which was quirky, but not entirely bad
Slovakia was far worse off under Hungary (in terms of development, support for the national culture and language, etc
Getting a common state with the Czechs was a win-win situation, even if it didn't fulfil all the hopes people had
They are planning on cutting public holidays IIRC, and besides, you have the 1st of November as a national holiday while Czechs do not
So as long as Slovakia continues to have christian holidays as state holidays, there is no real reason to add any more
Look at Britain; they actually trade more with the rest of the world than with the EU (although the EU as a whole is their single biggest trading partner), they're 6 times bigger than Czechia in terms of population and like million times in economy, and still the Brexit negotiations have been a fiasco so far
It seems that while the EU is securing new trade deals left, right and centre, Britain will be left alone without any free trade agreements with anyone, and completely at the mercy of Brussels
Now if Britain, with its centuries of history as a global trading power is in such a mess, what do people think would happen in Czechia
We are absolutely dependent economically on complete free trade with Germany, allowing for vertical integration between German and Czech businesses
If tarrifs suddenly returned, this would collapse like a house of cards
Western investments would leave for Poland and Slovakia and our position would be that of beggars asking the EU for mercy and access to its common market -- for which we'd have to pay like the other non-members, instead of getting EU funding for infrastructure and development projects
Without EU co-funding the pace of development would grind to a halt and the public budgets would freefall into debt if we still wanted to build anything here
There are literally thousands of ways Czech-out would completely crush us, and this needs to be explained in simple terms to the voters before they get totally brainwashed by the Russian age-- err, I mean "Czech patriots".
Czexit, meaning simply leaving EU, won't work for us very well
We are very dependant on trade with other countries in EU and if that stopped, we would become a 3rd world country
Anyway, I'm for czexit IF we can negotiate some trade deals
I would be voting for having a trade deal with EU or even some countries if that means having less bureaucracy, because I honestly think that's a bit too much right now
The Treaty of Lisbon basically transferred power from us to EU and I don't like that
If we could manage this while leaving EU, it would be best solution
Of course that won't happen with current political situation, either we leave EU completely (Okamura's referendum), or we stay as we are, and from those two options, I think staying in EU is much better
I don't know where to even begin
There has been no significant Muslim immigration into the Czech Republic, despite it being a member of the EU since 2004 and the Schengen Area since 2007
Our asylum/immigration laws are tough and there is no sign that people from Arab/Muslim countries are in any way interested in immigrating here
Most migrants in Czechia are EU nationals (Slovaks, Poles, Romanians etc
) followed by the Ukrainians, Vietnamese and Russians
Muslims are a negligible minority of migrants
So what the heck are you even talking about
It's not as if membership in the EU entails automatic subscription to ideological multiculturalism or whatever
This is not a binary problem: stay in the EU and become Eurabia or Leave, build the new Iron Curtain on the borders and be poor but Muslim-free
I am calling these people "idiots" because some of the most prominent ones are saying things like "we should get the hell out of the EU even if it means we'll be 30% poorer". Well, first, it would be like 70% poorer, and second, the guys saying this are millionaire businessmen/career politicians who certainly won't be the ones feeling the poverty
They're fucking imbeciles whose demagoguery could cause the greatest economic and geopolitical disaster this country has experienced since 1989
Czech fertility rate was 1
65 already in year 1937, and it was even uder 1
0 in year 1917 (exactly one century ago, hehe)
We are used to wild fluctuation of our fertility, up and down
However, we keep our total population around 1O-11 mio for over 100 years already
We will be good in future too, no worries, demographic projections for year 2050 show our population at 10,5 mio
I don't think many Czechs care about European population, if it doesn't concern us directly, we usually ignore it :-D or we argue about it over a beer, but that's usually it
Hmm no, it slowly grows since year 2000
In baby steps
I hope we get towards 1,75-1,8 soon
Yea boiii
Dont call them, I still live on the right side of the border now
I even forgot it was today until I saw it as #1 on the front page
It's even #2 on r/all currently, WTF
It will fall once the strong population groups move beyond fertile age
Here come dat boii
Hmmm
So we would start off with a bloody riot over whose beer is better

Good Friday isn't a holiday, St
Wenceslas day is the same day as Czech Statehood day
So there are two Christian holidays, arguably three even if Jan Hus day has more of a historical than christian impact
Even if I'm not sure if Cyril and Metodej are *that* Chrstian of a holiday
Good Friday is pretty new
It's been a holiday for like two years
And Easter Monday is not much a Chritian holiday, the important stuff happens before during Easter
Well you mean like right before 1918
Because at that point, it was already beyond repair
In the 20th century, the A-H empire was an dysfunctional, unreformable, bureacratic entity, unable to come up with a sustainble solution for their minorities
Czech elites held a frustration for a long time - basically ever since Hungarians managed to get a better status within the empire, but when we wanted the same thing, we were told to fuck off despite the fact that Bohemia and Moravia were (at that point) among the most developed and industrious areas in the empire
Thus in the 20th century, the Czech elites simply came to the conlusion that there's no way that we will get a fair treatment within the empire and that we are better off on your own
if you want details it is better to read something on the topic
Like wiki
Well, your comment implies that it is indeed celebrated in Slovakia when noone really thinks of New Years like that
But saying it's *technically* celebrated isn't a falsehood, otherwise we'd all have to go to work
Or does ANYONE really celebrate 5th of July by dressing up like Cyril/Method and the like
> You celebrate dissolution of Czechoslovakia on New Year's day
Do you know anyone who does
The big firework is meant to celebrate it, ever since it was moved from midnight to 6 pm
-Julius Caesar
It would be interesting to know how many people in Czechia and Slovakia have mixed ancestry (parents or grandparents from both countries)
I suspect lots and lots of people
My favourite: šrajtofle - Geldbörse
It comes from "Schreibtafel", a small writing table that was used by shop/pub-owners to write down debts
What exactly was different
Hungarians got an equal status and we didn't, that's just a fact
> is not celebrated in the Czech Republic
At least I got the feeling
Mea culpa
> Dressing up isn't part of that holiday
There is pilgramage and other stuff
Yeah, sure, but 95% of us just sit at home and enjoy the day off
We don't actively celebrate it
Masaryk himself was Czech
His wife was American
Plus we got the akward backward number telling 26 = 6 and 20, which I personally find slightly unpleasant

It might have been an unthinkable idea for most, because the Austrian empire was something that lasted for centuries and there was also a history of Czech revolts that ended really badly, so it's hardly strange that people were not keen on repeating that, but that doesn't mean that most Czechs didn't want an independent state, it just means that they didn't think it was a realistic thing
If it was something imposed on Czechs by a few men in exile as you say, the new state would never have the chance to survive
Instead,  it quickly gained support of the Czech people and the first republic was a relatively sucessful democratic country until 1938
If it didn't have the support of people, it would crumble much sooner
He was from Slovácko so his ethnicity was a bit of a mix
time for some appfel struddel, recht
Yeah, well, obviously it was the Czechs and Slovaks that accepted the idea of a Czechoslovak state
I realize that the German and Hungarian minorities living Czechoslovakia were less excited about it, but they had more rights and freedoms ensured than what Czechs and Slovaks had in A-H for most of its history
And I get that you might belong to the small minority of people who are still big fans of the A-H monarchy and who see Masaryk's declaration as something full of demagogy and hysteria, but the vast majority of Czechs are glad that we have our own country and thus we're proud and grateful for Masaryk's contribution to the formation of Czechoslovakia
Germans and Hungarians already had their own German and Hungarian-speaking countries
If they didn't like living as minorities in Czechoslovakia with full rights and freedoms (and as I said, that was more than what Czechs and Slovaks had in A-H empire), they were free to move to Germany, Austria or Hungary
Czechs and Slovaks had no other country to move to
There was just Czechoslovakia for us
We earned the right to have our own country
The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was copying the historic borders of the kingdom of Bohemia
Masaryk and others simply seized the opportunity and did something that Czechs didn't for a long time - they stood up for our nation and decided that they don't want to rely on some other, foreign government to be so kind and grant us autonomy and equal status
They took the necessary steps to build the state in a viable form and even though we took big hits in the 20th century, we are still here - as an independent nation, in charge of our own destiny - thanks to Masaryk
International law and principles were and still are applied selectively quite often
Sometimes governments just need to do what has to be done in order to secure the future of their country
Don't tell me that you beloved A-H empire was never shitting on international principles and that they were never acting hypocritical
It's something that is quite normal
Countries follow their interests and very often it's in everyone's interests that all actors follow international law and principles, but sometimes there are extraordinary circumstances, such as when you try to establish a new country - and in that situation, you mostly have to break some rules
Masaryk simply couldn't give Germans living in Czechoslovakia the right for self-determination, because if he did, Czechoslovakia would be hugely weakened by the loss of Sudetenland and we couldn't possibly afford that
So he did what he had to do
Just like the overwhelming majority of political leaders everywhere in the world
> The thing is, even without Masaryk, we would be autonomous or independent today
And possibly minus WW2, minus Aussiedlung, minus communism,...
Perhaps, perhaps not
We can of course play 'what if', but the reality is that we don't know what would happen
It's certain though that Germany would still be in economic shit post-WW1 and so Hitler would probably get in power anyway
Austrian political class might jump on that Nazi train just as easily as they did in the non-alternative history
The same goes for Sudetengermans
There is simply no guarantee that we would be in any way treated better than we were in Protektorat
There is also no guarantee that we would not end up behind the Curtain
But you can't possibly blame any of these 20th century events on Masaryk
What Masaryk did was that he managed to get international recognition for the state and that was hugely important
It was something that we could return to post-WW2
And we exist in the form until today, we have independence and thus the ability to make our own decisions - obviously we are restrained in that by the geographic, economic and political circumstances that we find ourselves in, but it's still better than having no formal authority and having to rely on someone else that they will respect our rights
I have a feeling this graph is trying to communicate that the lower the number of children in the classroom the better
There have been several studies proving that too small classes are as ineffective as large ones, mainly for the reason that they required more interaction from all students which is uncomfortable for shy/introverted students and may cause anxiety
Small class isn't a win
Several studies proved that small classes cause depression and anxiety for shy and introverted kids as they require substantialy larger amount of interaction from each individual student

No, our cells can not reproduce till infinity because of [Hayflick limit]
Between 5-12, or so your brain loses the ability to rewire and regenerate
That won't hurt you directly, but the ability to recover from brain damage is greatly reduced
This is probably necessary for the brain to mature
By puberty, your thymus atrophies
Your body will have trouble dealing with pathogens it didn't encounter before then
Nobody really knows why, but it has been succesfully reversed in animal experiments
(mostly people of European descent) Around 25-40 years, your bones reach their maximum weight and slowly start disintegrating and the minerals start accumulating in other tissues instead
Statistics show correlation with dairy consumption, but that may be a coincidence, it actually seems to have something to do with collagen metabolism
Fatty plaques start accumulating inside your veins, and can eventually block them and kill you
After the menopause in women and sometimes as early as the puberty in men, the body starts accumulating too much iron, which eventually can lead to heart attack or stroke
after 65, there is a risk your brain starts to atrophy and you die of dementia
Nobody knows why it happens or how to prevent it

A good beer in Greece is just a Mythos
We only make 6%? But hey our beer is the best B)
Now do it per capita :)
Maybe Germany is the winner in production but Czech Republic is more than winner in consumption of beer per capita
Around 147 liters per year
Data from 2018, and it's been going down now :(
I can beat that
Wait, I'm Czech, never mind
Well there are people who go through their days drinking 16 beers no problem
Yes
On the other hand it does not count beer consumed by Czech tourist in other countries so it kinda evens out
Not a factor for Czechia, tourists would probably even bring our numbers down
We drink beer like there is no tomorow
My father in law does like 6 beers a day, I do aswell when there
When at home, I dont drink much
But I can do like 6 beers an evening at the pub and that is still on the low side for czechs
Doesn't even have to be that
A lot of people just get beer for lunch and few more in the evening
It's one beer a day
Yeah, those are rookie numbers
The beer is 0,5l and the water probably 1l if not 1,5l though
No, its because they are lying
Bottled water here is 3 crowns a litre (cheap basic water, there might be cheaper alternatives even) and the cheapest beer (Which is undrinkable shit that I would not touch with a pole, you are italian so think cheap carton vine) is like 7 CzK a bottle, you get 3 Czk for returning the bottle so its 4 crowns for half a litre, so its 8 crowns a litre
The price of convenience, it's more about the price of the plastic/bottles rather than the liquid
Where are the motorcycles and rmpty streets
To be fair, in 2014, a woman ill with schizophrenia entered high school in Czech city of Žďár nad Sázavou and she  stabbed a few students, one of them died

That would mean that the current figures should be 10

First of all, any replacement of coal generation with gas generation will at least halve the CO₂ emissions from the respective generation, seeing as that we're talking mostly about lignite coal plants and CCGT plants
Second, replacement with renewables is much more likely because of their lower price in the European environment
Just the *fuel* costs for natural gas even in the CCGT plant are comparable to *full* costs of a renewable generator these days
Except [the decision was made around 2000

Although in Czech (from which the surname could come from) tlustý can and actually more often than not means thick (tloušťka then means thickness) while tučný is an adjective about fat

That's how it works in many countries that are showing up as mostly yellow, AFAIK
Only kids who go through academic-type high schools are allowed to even apply for university
(Unless those who went to vocational school obtain the same qualification later through switching schools, online school etc
) May be a German/ex-Austria-Hungarian invention
There's a pretty big difference in at what age the kids are first divided into those schools, though, in Czechia it's around age 15 and Germany typically does it much earlier
It's a system that has some positives, but it also reproduces social hierarchy either way
Not many kids really know what they want to do in their early teens vs
what the parents want or what they know from their immediate community
Because as you said, IQ doesn't mean shit
It's not inherently inferior, but we have an inflated amount of vocational schools compared to other countries, because of big industry lobbying
Contrary to popular sentiments like "all non-STEM degrees are useless, enjoy flipping burgers lol", unemployment and poverty rates of people with secondary and vocational education are still much higher than anyone with a degree
We're not yet at the level when everyone who's able and wants to is getting a tertiary education
It's not about a lack of plumbers, it's about creating an abundance of lower qualified job seekers so that industrial companies can continue underpaying them
But this map suggests that in the south, people don't even have a high (=secondary in European context) school completed and most have only primary education
That seems insane to me

Summer
I am in that cold hell in the middle
Not here really - this is chart of temperatures for the last 30 days in Prague (which is usually the warmest): [
It looks more like April/May than June - only two days with temperatures above 25 °C.
23°C for Czech Republic
nah, that's seems way too low, more like 28°C
Really
I haven't seen anything but rainclouds
>occasionally above 25, rarely above 30
Where are you from
In Prague, there were only TWO days with temperatures above 25 °C and no day at all above 30 °C. That's pretty unusual for the end of June
We literally have 14 °C right now here
I even had to close my window because I was getting little cold
Last week yeah, this week is unbearable so far
(In Zlín at least)
I prefer rain AND 27°C heat
Someone call  27°C heat
I think it's an extreme even for en European
It's a joke
Fascinating, in 15°C I am pretty much unable to do anything
I am tired and can't focus
My body is probably trying to hibernate or something
Czechia, but I really hate European climate and I'm trying to be at some warmer place whenever possible
That's why this year especially sucks
Czechs: Yeah, we can speak slovakian
Slovaks: Yeah, we can speak czech
I don't know a single Czech who could speak and write Slovak at any degree of fluency
Do you
Propably depens on where you live
I propably don't know anybody who can't.
And where is that
Because Czechs *understand* Slovak, but can't *speak* it and definitely can't *write* it fluently, which is what I was hinting at
No it's not "changing a letter here and there and then its like a handful of words". That's why this whole thing is so complicated to have a reasonable discussion about – everyone thinks they can do it, but they really can't. I've seen and proofread texts written by Slovaks who can speak pretty decent Czech verbally, and they were terrible at writing
People don't realise it, but the stylistics between the two languages is very different, not to mention Czech grammar which for Slovaks seems to be quite difficult to master (they make tons of mistakes which make them look like someone who failed primary school, it's that bad)
I don't know about you personally, perhaps you're far better, but I am speaking from experience
Speaking is easier, writing at least half-decently is way, way harder
In any case, I don't know a single Czech person who could actually speak Slovak fluently
I know some Slovaks who can speak Czech very well, but their writing in Czech is very poor
Funnily, in college this was a Slovak girl who didn't speak Czech with the other students at all, but her writing in Czech was fairly good – she had learnt the grammar well so she wasn't making stupid i/y and s/z errors everywhere like most Slovaks do; she sometimes used a Slovak idiom or collocation that didn't really work in Czech, which is what gave her away in these sorts of blind readings we were doing
But she's probably the only Slovak person I know of who could fool a competent Czech speaker in writing
(Needless to say, the exact same thing would happen the other way round
That's why you shouldn't call us Eastern Europe

No countries really retain water well enough with all our biofuel centric agriculture
That is why even with better than average rain as we have had this year there is still a draught, all the rain just evaporates or runs to the rivers
With a draught, the weather gets even hotter as there is not a lot of water and green to cool it down
We are all fucked, I tell you
Governments would rather deal with different shit than this
Water retention, people

Works the other way around as well:
If the laws are good, EU politicians will pad themselves on the back, not the national politicians
If the laws are bad, EU politicians will blame the national politicians
Your example happens more regularly, but it really works both ways
I don't watch politics too detaily, and I agree with the lack of spotlight
But that's basically a definition of a politician: they very rarely take blame for something the did
And the EU politicians, by definition, aren't saints either
Prague is beautiful in winter (I mean the whole year sure but especially in winter) but the coblestones everywhere are insanely slippery and most roads instead of being cleared just have a co-out sign "this road is not maintained during winter".

I am not from Eastern Europe, but – given that Czechs are avid tourists – the answer is that you *travel cheap* and *live off the land*. You can spend good time in very expensive countries if you just decide to sleep in a tent and buy food in supermarkets and cook it yourself using a camping stove
Accommodation and restaurants are usually the most expensive items in Western countries; if you get rid of them, the trip becomes perfectly affordable and, dare I say it, more enjoyable if you're not the lazy "stay in the hotel" type

The founder of the car brand Porsche - Ferdinand Porsche was Czech
He was born in the town of Vratislavice nad Nisou in todays Czech Republic (1875)
Later he got German citizenship, lost the Czechoslovak one and collaborated with Hitler to support his brand
You're making this a notorious "Nikola Tesla" hassle
Yes, from today's perspective you'd call him a German Czech
But you cannot deny a citizenship
I guess that's a question for the historians
I've never heard anything about him having the Austrian citizenship at the time he was born so I don't think people had citizenships back then
Calling everybody Austrian in the whole empire would be very bold anyway
So he was at least Bohemian
>Im Jahr 1934 legte Ferdinand Porsche auf Drängen Hitlers die tschechoslowakische Staatsangehörigkeit ab und nahm die deutsche an

Unless something is done, we might start losing members
Ah well, we will see how that works out, theres a lot of differences im that regard but some basic framework would certainly help
The EU gun ban and the forced migrant quotas mainly
Especially the first one was pretty stupid and there was no reason for it
Well, the fact that it decides to randomly disregard its own rules kinda worries me
It doesnt have the means to force EU member states yet, except economic means or taking away their voting rights, their tried that with either Poland or Hungary, but luckily, that needs to be unanimous
The EU is currently suing the countries that refused them and might fine them
I claim that the development in the EU is worrying, and there are talks of creating a unified army
Maybe the EU project should stop trying to control everything
And yes, countries have different opinions, thats to be expected, the EU shouldnt be here to hammer everyone to have the same opinions, it should be here to bridge the differences

To me, Czech Republic is an official name and should be always used in a formal way
Czechia is a nice shorted version that I'm still kind of getting used to tbh
For example when I'm introducing the country to somebody, I firstly say I'm from the Czech Republic and as I further talk about the country in conversation, I use the shorted version - Czechia

I can understand and speak a little bit *hantec*
It comes from my city of Brno
When it's been invented, there were a lot of german-speaking people at the time, we were a part of Austria-Hungary so hantec is a mix between Czech and German
Nowadays nobody outside Brno speaks it or understands it and in Brno people understand most of it  but only very few can actually speak it
Yes, that's the most common word
Here's basically a full [Czech-Hantec dictionary] :)

Which would probably play into their whole concept of Assassins (Hussites) and Templars (Crusaders)
Well, we did give the world the words pistol and howitzer
They did have gun powder but they didnt really use it militarily that much
Hussites used firearms as an imporat part of their doctrine
Pistol comes from píšťala, which is what Hussites called their early guns
Howitzer is derived from houfnice because they were used against crowds (houf) of enemies
America has GOPniks, too

Concealed, of course, open carry is a tactical disadvantage and it might worry tourists and some people too much
You can carry pretty much any other weapon openly though, even things like swords, if youre 18
Ah, a vegan soldier, then
In theory, helmets should improve your safety
In practice, research suggests that car drivers tend to drive more dangerously around cyclists with helmets
The problem is, who decides whats European identity
For example, its completely normal to carry weapons here while its unthinkable just across the border in Germany
Most Germans freak out when you tell them people even carry guns here
Who decides which of these 2 options is European
I think most of us know
But we already have a bitter history of other larger countries trying to shape our culture
We value our freedom, people from other countries value protection even if it comes at the cost of their freedom
Were not exactly gun loving, were freedom loving id say
3% of the population is pretty significant, especially compared to the rest of Europe
Besides, a lot more people carry pepper sprays or other weapons mostly banned in other countries because 'the state is here to protect you'. Overt political correctness isnt an issue here either
Btw, our gun laws arent really lenient, theyre just well made and balanced
8%? Where did you get such a high number
A couple years ago, they had fewer than 2000 carry licences for private persons and, as far as I know, that number has been decreasing steadily for years
Compared to 250,000 in a much smaller country, thats hell of a lot less
Exactly, most people dont care, in the West, they would have banned them already
And yes, most people dont really feel the need but they have a choice in that matter
Yes, but they can't carry them, they can't even have them loaded at home
Try carrying a pepper spray thats not neutered for 'use against animals' if you dont have a licence
Thats right, you need a licence for a stupid pepper spray
Taxis or taxes
I could imagine both
I was kind of thinking that the answer might be "They don't".

Czech self-defense laws arent that different from those in the US
We have no duty to retreat either
The rule here is that you can and might have to use stronger force than the attack to stop it
Not long ago, there was a case where the attacker was choking a guy on the ground, the defender shot him once and killed him
It was ruled as clear self-defense because he had no other option to save his life
The law says that the  defense must not be manifestly *disproportionate* to the attack
A 50 kg girl using lethal force against a 120 kg 2 m unarmed attacker would most likely be perfectly legal, the opposite would most likely be illegal
We can also carry guns for self-defense, almost all gun owners have the licence
In fact, as long as you meet the requirements (no mental issues, law-abiding, passing a test on the relevant laws and basic firearms safety) you have the RIGHT to own a gun for self-defense, something thats completely unheard of in most European countries
Other weapons are not regulated at all
You can even carry a sword, if you want
We are among the safest countries in Europe so I guess it works just fine
&#x200B;

>Its sad that the US actually has something called 'Gun Culture'.
Why
Switzerland and the Czech Republic also have gun culture, whats wrong with that
No, but they dont turn the country into some sort if Wild West as a lot of people like to suggest
So whats the point then
It depends, here in the Czech Republic, sport is anything thats done at a proper shooting range, from ordinary plinking to stuff like IPSC
Nobody cares if you buy an AR-15 or a .22 bolt action rifle for that as long as you have a licence
Seriously
Use pepper spray for home defense
You do realize that pepper sprays are not exactly ideal for closed spaces, right
The self-defense licence here is automatically issued if you meet the requirements and also counts as a concealed carry licence
So almost all gun owners in the Czech Republic have it
No, youd have to have it certified as a shooting range, it is possible, but not really worth it
You are technically allowed to drink bleach, that doesnt mean it makes sense or that its a good idea
Pepper sprays are mainly for outdoor self-defense
But then, laws often make no sense

Carrying guns and other means of self-defence is ok in the Czech Republic (no laws to regulate weapons except firearms)
Also dark humour of the darkest variety
You could also say political correctness isnt well received here
Were mostly happy with the system but imho its such a huge change that i dont see that happening in the US any time soon
Weve come from almost total ban to relative freedom almost overnight and the Ministry of Interior has been building mutual trust between themselves and the shooters for 30 years
Of course
There have been a couple cases lately, a gunshop owner killing a guy with a .44 mag when he knifed one of her workers in the neck (he was lucky and survived) comes to mind
The lady in question is/was the European western shooting champion
Then a girl saving someones life by just pulling out her Glock on a tram to dissuade the attacker
And we have one of the lowest homicide rates in Europe btw
Are you pro- or anti-gun
A lot of us are just happy with the way things are, and almost all of us are very unhappy with the way the EU is trying to change things
They tried to introduce the same stupid stuff like in the US by banning guns based on their looks
We have a sturdy licencing system but if you meet all the requirements you can buy almost anything except full-autos and hollow point ammo (but thats also because of the EU)
And everything is shall issue, including the carry licence
Basically if youre a decent human being able to uphold the law, know how to safely handle a gun, and know the gun law, you should be able to pass
What we see as madness is the way your politicians are trying to prevent gun related deaths using all the wrong tools
So you could say there is some sympathy in certain aspects
On the other hand, we mostly trust the relevant state authorities and they trust us gun owners, I wouldnt trust your authorities
Thats because most people have been taught to fear and hate guns with passion, most Czechs just dont mind
We also see guns as a certain symbol of freedom, only communists and nazis banned guns here
You guys have some serious problems with organized crime and drugs, your healtcare was pretty screwed up by Reagan, and peer pressure at schools is tremendous
Our history with guns started before America was even discovered
See, thats the difference, most guns in the Czech Republic are registered (we have 800k legal vs some 500k illegal guns)
That would work in the US, people fear the government would abuse the registry, i dont think the fear is unfounded
The EU banned them for pistols and revolvers in 1991
You can buy hollow points if you have long guns but not just a pistol
Or technically you probably could but if you tried to use it for self-defence you might lose your licence (but it should technically not have any effect on the self-defence case)
Theyre shall issue just like any gun thats not Cat
A (Cat
A mostly includes full-autos)
Theyre mostly Cat
B which requires a cheap shall-issue permit (required by the EU)
More info about gun categories here:  [
But once you have a licence, you can buy as many as you have safe storage for (if you have more than 2 guns you need a safe)
The Czech law makes basically no difference between private sales and sales through licenced dealer
You need a form so they can register the gun
Registering costs about 12 USD but they are discussing decreasing the cost as they might do away with cards got each gun as the whole system is getting simplified and more reliant on computers
In a private sale the parties fill out the same form (it includes information about the gun and both parties) and while the seller uses the form to transfer the ownership to the buyer, the buyer then has 10 work days to register the ownership
Its easier when from a dealer, because they transfer the ownership in the system and print the with the information for you, so you just go to the local PD and register your gun
The same 10 day period applies here
Tradition i guess
We have a very long history and shooting and gunmaking has always been part of our cultural heritage
In the west, guns are seen as something uncivilized while in the east communists mostly taught people guns were only owned by criminals and nobody else needed one
I know its a bad mindset, but until your politics stabilize somewhat, i dont see that changing any time soon
And most gun control proponents would like to ban at least something, which is not what most gun owners would accept
When the EU came with its gun ban, gun ownership became a widely discussed topic even though majority of people didnt care one way or the other
Gun ownership in the US is much much higher
Yeah, you can find them but they shouldnt be used for pistols and revolvers, theyre OK in carbines though
This is what the EU directive says:
Pistol and revolver ammunition with expanding projectiles and the projectiles for such ammunition, except in the case of weapons for hunting or for target shooting, for persons entitled to use them
The problem is that most people would like to use JHP for self-defence because FMJ bullets suck due to deflection and penetration
The directive completely ignored that some countries actually allow carrying for self-defence, or maybe it didnt ignore it
I think Luxembourg has a total ban
But anyway its not that other countries dont allow certain guns, but the Czech Republic allows people to actually carry guns for self-defence
I bet most guns in Sweden are hunting rifles and shotguns
The Czech Republic has 250k people with a carry licence out of 300k people
And there are very few limitations on what you can buy, besides you dont need to justify the need, you just fill in a form and thats it
Yeah, its actually illegal to hunt with pistols and revolvers here, you need to have a long gun with at least 1500J energy at 100m IIRC
I dont hunt so i dont really know that law
Youre right, but it seems its almost impossible to get a licence for an ordinary person
Yeah, dedication, it takes some dedication here to get a licence but then youre almost free to buy w/e. I think the main difference is that the Czech Republic still isnt exactly rich country and guns were almost impossible to get for most people some 30 years ago
That means guns still havent had time to accumulate
Btw dont you have to justify every purchase above a certain number
MR308 is pretty sweet, I just wish it wasnt that damn expensive
Yeah, thats what i mean
I can just come to the local PD tick one or more of the boxes with reasons im authorized to own guns for and its done
Nobody cares how many and what guns i have as long as i meet the storage requirements
I can also use the same gun for w/e reason as long as its registered for that
My pistol can be used for self-defence carrying as well as sport
My friend has his Sa 58 (a former local assault rifle reworked into a semi-auto) registered for hunting, sport, and self-defence
Yeah, but Czechia has better
We do the same AND beat women with pomlazka (willow sticks)
You won't believe it, but they grew up in the same town

It is merely a retraction of services provided to you by Facebook, which has ZERO obligation to provide you with them

But what he says means for Muslims that they have to accept enlightenment princples as superior to Islam
For Muslims, insult to Propeth Muhammad is worse than killing their father or mother and they feel that must be avenged and that revenge is their duty
Such insult is not something "shocking" or like insulting them personaly or insulting their feelings
It is considered a capital crime for which the only punishment is death
Islam is a theocracy in which only Allah rules and Muhammad is his only valid messenger
Every faithful Muslim saying or writting his name has to add the benediction *Peace be upon him
* They have been taught since childhood that the Prophet must always be more to them than their mother and father
They don't understand the difference between protecting free speech and approving of insult of Muhammad
Islam is the base of their identity  and they necessarily live in conflict with our society even if they don't act openly aggressive
There is no "moderate" Islam , only Muslims are more or less lax or more or less zealous or more or less hidding their contempt to our society and its morals
They can't accept enlightenment princples and stay  faithful Muslims
Their system is not based on the idea of *contract social,* it is based on what they consider to be the will of God revealed to the Prophet who preached it to the people
> I do imagine a lot of Muslims are going to ignore all the nuance and rationale in this
I imagine they're going to listen to him and say "see, that's exactly what's wrong with western society". It's not that they don't *understand* these values, they don't *want* them

For example, the British Museum has a lot of Assyrian and Babylonian stuff originally from Iraq
Seeing what happened to the artifacts there, it's pretty fair to say they are much better off in the UK and I don't see that changing any time soon
Returning them wouldn't really achieve anything if your goal is to preserve and celebrate ancient cultural heritage
I don't think this applies to unique artefacts
For example I'm Czech and I would love to see our most prized and unique historical book Codex Gigas, but the Swedes stole it and don't want to return it, so now I have to travel to Sweden to see our national treasure
And what about people that don't have the money to go to Sweden
They will never be able to see it
I am very much hoping that things turn for the better for Moldova under her leadership
Quite the opposite, my friend
It's all about leadership
She won't have that much power, sure, but politicians, despite the popular belief, don't run a country
They change laws, but that's not all there is
Every country is run by a not-entirely-controllable critical mass of people that inspire others for the better or worse and influences the public sentiments and actions
A good president can inspire the people to become better themselves, while a bad president awakens the worst impulses in them
To give an example from my country, our first Czechoslovak president, Tomáš G. Masaryk, and our first Czech president, Václav Havel, were both great philosopher-presidents that, despite all the problems, kept hope in people and brought our country closer to the West
Nowadays all our good politicans are inspired by their ideals
I'm not naive
Moldova won't be cured of its corruption problem during her presidency, but she might inspire bright young people to enter politics and do something for their country

Did something change
Because up until now, the video *was actually unavailable* in my country, or at least the version of it which people usually used for rick rolling
There were a few re-uploads that worked even before

Czech Republic had 35 years old PM
He was corrupt as fuck, and unlike other politicians he was to inept to keep his bribery hidden
This soon ended his political career
He later lived luxurious life from money he filched away, but died in age 45 due to an exotic disease
Another young Czech politician (was PM at 43) was so incompetent, that he practically destroyed his own party
Before him they were the largest one, now they may not being able even to get into the parliament
time for more diverse dickhead leaders

Had my birthday on the weekend, but the shops were closed and I barely had any food at my place
So I celebrated my birthday by making microwave popcorn and watching battlestar galactica

That party's going to suck
Sadly, no beets
And the zoo is closed because of Corona aswell, so no bears either
Oh for sure, but it was still not a birthday I will likely remember

I completely agreee with that and Im angry, that some people ruin these ideals
Hurr durr nazi salute
On a more serious note, there is a good Czech documentary about the life of a neo-Nazi
It's called Svět podle Daliborka (The World According to Daliborek) and it's semi-mocking them, but there was one thing that struck me and I found it quite interesting
The guy it was about said that he didn't originally believe in racism or the Nazi ideology, but after he lost his girlfriend years ago, he was so desperate and felt so betrayed that he wanted to find something to relieve his desperation and anger on
So he became a Nazi
Don't get me wrong, I've been a convinced anti-fascist ever since I found out that it was a thing and I don't want to excuse them, but it was really interesting for me to discover that a lot neo-Nazis aren't that way, because they really believe it's a great ideology, but because of some kind of emotional damage they suffered in the past
And from what I hear, it's actually not that easy to escape the neo-Nazi community, once you become one
I think anti-immigration people wouldn't mind immigrants from Belarus in my country
Because, you know
they're white
In the Czech Republic, you got 75 % discount on buses/trains if you are a student or senior
You can basically travel anywhere across the country for 1€.
Let's get this to European parliament
I do very much prefer trains as opposed to any other means of transport, even the way the are now
I’ve got to say though that the difference in speed and comfort between all the trains in Europe is immense
For example - here, in the Czech Republic, you can go by our high speed train from Prague to Ostrava (356 km) in just over 3 hours
That’s not so bad, but let’s look at France’s high speed trains
In the same amount of time, give or take a few minutes, you can go from Paris to Marseille, which is over twice the distance
The difference is night and day
Now let’s have a look at regional trains
A few weeks back I took a trip to Slovakia
On the way there I took the high speed train and on my way back I took the EuroNight train
When I was there, however, I did use a local regional train, which was appaling
Don’t get me wrong, nothing was falling off and there weren’t any foul smells to report, but it was VERY dated
The train had three squeaky carriages with no sound insulation and uncomfortable faux leather seats which have seen the previous regime
On the other hand, in the part of Czechia where I live, the regional trains are actually quite nice
Relatively comfy seats, enough space, clean toilets, power outlets and even wi-fi
Similar regional trains run in Germany and I would assume in most of western Europe as well
The difference, again, is night and day
The biggest problem though are the ticket prices
Some countries, Czech Republic included, have discounted fares for students and the elderly
Let’s just say that the bottle of water I buy at the station costs more than the ticket for my hour and a half long journey
Another comparison - the previously mentioned trip from Prague to Ostrava would cost me, as a student, 143 czk (5,6€)
In Germany, however, a ticket from Berlin to Hamburg, roughly the same distance, costs 60€. Of course you have to factor in the average income of Germans and Czechs, though even then, still, German train fares are way more expensive
Now, I don’t know how to solve Europe’s train related problems, but it sure needs some looking into
It would take a massive effort to change anything on such a large scale, let alone changing the whole train infrastructure of Europe, though I’m sure things can be done to better the experience of passengers
Maybe we can start with the train operators from different countries working together more closely with each other, work on synchronizing timetables, creating new, interesting connections and maybe even introduce lower fares on international journeys
Oh yes, seeing people protest for disabilities that don’t even exist is enlightening
Invited by whom
That's why almost all protests seem like just people trying to get away with destroying shit
Yeah sure the idea behind it might be nice, but it doesn't really help the owners of the cars you smashed because they dared to be in your way

Damn it feels good to be a European
In Prague we have managed to combine the drug dealer park with the pigeon-owned Central station into one beautiful complex nicknamed 'Sherwood'.
I thought the same at first, then I realized one of the avenues next to the historical center in my city is named after Roosevelt, so I guess that falls under that

It's a depiction of a generic [non-existent] European city which fits as close as it can to European cities and possibly as far as it can to non-European cities
That's interesting, because I actually am not able to assess if fails _to fit as close **as it can** to European cities and **possibly** as far **as it can** to non-European cities
_ Where do you get that capacity to assess it
You could say that even the successful result will be pretty much useless in characterizing a city as European vs non-European
Which should be easier to tell than the above and people could argue about it
(I don't think one could provide a definitive stance on this in reddit's comments right now
And, yes, you can disregard my understanding of this submission completely, that's just how I understand it

If even 1% Chinese gets infected I don't want to see the chaos
Honestly, this election was a huge debacle for republicans
Trump's term was just a catastrophe
He failed to manage coronavirus (but I think that no president could manage coronavirus in America
), he left one of the highest death tolls in the world and the economy is in ruins
He also hasn't reacted to the Black Lives Matter protests, one of the largest protest movement in decades, in any way
In this situation, I expected Democrats to win elections landslide and even flip Senate
But victory in the presidential election was razor-thin and Biden victory was only clear after several days of counting and republicans actually WON new seats in the house of representatives
It shows that despite Trump is (politically) dead, Trumpism is not
I think that this result is probably better for the Republican party
Biden has now to fix post-covid economic fallout, which would include many unpopular decisions
And if Republicans nominate somebody competent in 2024, they have good chances to win
Here's to news without Trump
Cheers
Czech President congratulates Biden and invites him to visit Prague (Trump never did and never invited Zeman to USA either)
I'm afraid he's far from winning
Orange man will deny his victory until he completely ridicules himself, but this could go on for months
He should've congratulated Joe Biden too, just for the memes
> I always believed in you, Joe
That's quite ironic coming from a communist dictator lmao
Even if it's just Biden's skeleton sitting in the Oval Office, it's better than Trump
Certainly better than all of Europe
EU as a whole, with comparable population to the US, has on average 260,000 new daily cases the past few days compared to US's 120,000 cases yesterday
More of a dogwhistle, I'd say
Democrats have to try harder, there is no wonder they vote for a populist who tells them what they want to hear instead completely ignoring them because white males can't have any issues
I should also mention that nearly the entire Europe has masks required indoors
And most restaurants and schools are closed
And yet we are twice as bad as the US
Good luck with this revolution Belorusians
Stay strong and positive because change will come
Minsk has much larger % of protesters than outside of Minsk
And still, "only" 70 000 of people attended those protests out of 2 000 000 people in Minsk
My country has less people in capital, yet still 250 000 protested against our PM
And you know what
Most of people actually support our PM (not me tho)
All i am saying is that even if 20 % of Minsk went to protest, this means nothing
Travel to eastern Belarus and ask people there what they think about opposition
It's like he doesn't get it that people can only take so much
Does he want to become next Ceausescu or what
I don't know, kicking out Yanukovych didn't turn out all that great for the Ukrainians
I think Belarus faces the same problem, that being having a border with Russia, and is very likely to end up in exactly the same situation
Velvet Revolution was attended by almost half of population of Prague at that time
Belarus has immense strategic value as a buffer state between Russia and NATO
Russia will never allow it to align with the West, even if preventing that requires a direct military intervention
For historical examples of that sort of thing, see the Korean War and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia
>Exactly, a buffer state, therefore it is not worth it to occupy it
For historical examples of that sort of thing, see the Korean War and the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia
Maybe read up on what happened during the war, then
Okay, try to follow:
Belarus is a buffer state for Russia
If it aligns with the West, it'll cease to be that, and Russia wants to prevent that from happening even at the cost of invading
Now rewind back to the Korean War
North Korea is a buffer state for China, and China wants to keep it that way
North Korea picks a fight and starts losing badly, it looks like it'll stop being a buffer state for China (by being absorbed into the West-aligned South Korea)
China invades to prevent that from happening
Is that easier to understand
Because the protests are pro-democracy, which is a Western institution antithetical to the Russian regime, and the main opposition candidate has said that she intends to move away from the Union State treaty between Belarus and Russia
Well let's see
I could believe you that it means nothing
or I could believe Putin, who has already pledged military aid to Lukashenko
I wonder which of you two has a better grasp of what is and isn't important to Russia
RemindMe

Last week we had in the city where I live the worst floods in more than 100 years

Except one small village whose inhabitants are made invincible by a magic potion
Don't worry, we replaced the pen thief with an alcoholic pig
Remember when this was the biggest embarasment of Czechia back then
Now our drunkard president Zeman embarasses us everytime he speaks
I am proud of him
He managed to transform a boring event into such enjoyable show
If only this was the worst thing he ever did
This just perfectly exemplifies the absolute lack of class this guy has
I mean, atleast he didnt steal from his country ig
He is a awfull human being, but thanks to him, we are not Ukraine or Belarus today
Ah yes, the good old days
Chileans said after this, that it was not planned for him to take it, but had he asked, he'd had been welcome to keep it (diplomacy)
Have you ever seen another statesman doing this in such a cool way
Maybe Medvedev in Obama putting pens into their pockets synchronously
He did lead the biggest movement for freedom after fall of communism in Czechoslovakia, but right now he's a retired politician who just tweets antilgbt lowkey racist stuff
Drunk Zeman looking at Crown Jewels was bigger embarrassment
Turns out chopping down all forests in a subarctic environment with volcanic soils very prone to wind erosion wasn't the smartest move the Norse ever made

No, when I say Stalinist I mean people who adore Josif Vissarionovic Stalin, like former MP Marta Semelová or current party's vice-chairman Josef Skála

But is it proven that we can actually reverse the trend
But is it proven that we are actually capable of doing that

Look at Britain now, I hope that these antifacists are proud of themselves
The thing is, people were always a bunch of really stupid ignorant fucks
We may be slightly better in this manner as higher education is more common and people generaly know more stuff and are less ignorant, but because any idiot can write anything he wants on the internet, public forums are full of idiots telling everyone their idiotic opinions and they stay there for anyone to read
In the past, the local idiots would just sit at their idiot table in their idiot pub and would not mix much with the non-stupid folk
If they did, they would get told off and their stupid opinions would soon be forgotten
That is why it may look like people got dumber
Actualy, we just see more stupid people now because we share the same platforms with them and the opinions stay there to be read even though the idiots are already gone (twitter comments, youtube comments and, ofcourse, the worse of them all
Facebook)
Nah dude, Facebook is much worse
YouTube is horrible under many videos, but public Facebook pages (like government or public news) are so much worse
Stalinism, Leninism, Maioism are results of implementing communist/ marxist ideas into real society
None of them worked and all of them caused terror and deaths of many innocent people
I don't understand, how can somebody advocate for communism these days, when there are several proofs it is not possible to make communism work
Its very sad that even today are people who think that russians were the good ones during and specially after WW2
Basically USSR and Nazi Germany started WW2

On the other hand my baby is frying in her stroller poor thing
South-eastern czech here, neither do we :/
I admire him
Kilimanjaro, what a beautiful place to die at
Same as making a lane into a thicc sidewalk and making people drive on tramways
Just tunneling the city budget and when someone dies in an "accident" tunneling back to fix it
And people ask why my life goal is to not pay taxes
Just another day in France
Thanks to Macron and all the other ones who cried "islamophobia" when we (the V4) said migrants are bad
Next time don't vote for leftists/Islam lovers perhaps
He screamed "Allahu Akbar". Truly such a religion of peace
Truly just cultural enrichment
The French have to be beyond delusional to think that Islam isn't the cause of all these attacks
Do what Slovakia did, ban Islam outright and deport them all
That is the only way this will ever stop

Life here is not horrible you know
Tallinn, the capital of Estonia where the guy you responded too is a wonderful city
You should go and visit once the pandemic is gone
I was very impressed by Estonia when visiting there, it's a modern and advanced country
Sure it's not as rich as Denmark, but it's above average in Europe, and and absolute paradise when compared to the world's average living standards
Happy anniversary
May no country be under Russia's thumb ever again
Let's hope for that
Or else there will be winter war II
I think few meters below there is Džirlo’s cafe and tea room
Love that place
Sarajevo is also one of my most favourite cities I’ve visited
It's great, this old quarter is especially nice
It's just, there are things that remind you of the war and siege of Sarajevo literally on every street
Bullet holes, holes in the sidewalk from grenade launchers, huge number of cemeteries
When you take this in, it can be a bit depressing
But that's just part of the experience
They translated it to us as something like "chill nirvana", which kinda went together with the vibe there
It's still all over the place if you go there
I was staying right in the city center and the first thing I saw from my window in the morning after I arrived was that the tall apartment building two streets down has panel damaged from shrapnel in the last floor
What if it was all a dream
Is it true that in marriage Hungarian women often take not just husband's last name, but also his first name
I expected a different clause at the end of the title

Thanks, China, you incompetent fucking communist run shithole of a regime
The leading theory among many doctors now is that China fucked around with Sars in Wuhan laboratories and it leaked
Not a weapon, just trying stuff
because the virus seems way too complex to just pop out of nowhere as a mutation of the common coronavirus
Is there any pushback among conservative men
Something like when people reacted to a half-black president by electing trump
They don't think that at all
They just don't equate a possible outcome of equality with equality
Reaping what they sow
Actually, "ë" is pronounced "yo".
This is a great picture

It could if we could get a second camera taking a picture of this camera being stolen by pickpockets immediately after the shot
I don't usually go for the brooding type, but Estonia is kinda doing it for me ngl

Yeah that's my favourite part as well
It has to be fake
There's no way that's true
We made it, hell yeah
Edit: Many thanks to the many anonymous members of GRU for the awards
We have truly became a thorn in Russia's heel
the fellowship
Hell yea, we made it to the cool kids club
Flattery will get you nowhere
Finaly
Fuck you, Russia
And stop fuckin around in Czechia
Finaly, after 73 FUCKIN years, we are gone from your "slavic brothers" rhetoric
Good company, too
The cool kids gang
From Russia with hate
I'm proud to be on the list
Look there is my country's flag
Proud
Let's gooo
Looks like we made it
How the fuck did us, Czechs, make the list
Like our president is the second most pro Russia person, right after Putin
Czech republic included ? Good
Veeery good
LETS GOOOOO

We've been working earnestly since 17 of April for this spot :) [Here]

Worst is that they think about everything between Berlin and Moscow as their territory
My AČR friends always enjoy their drills in the baltic countries
They say that wearing a NATO uniform makes everyone super friendly
It's not the Russian people the countries are enemies with, it's Kremlin
That just means operations in those countries to subvert local democracies are not finished yet
Doesn't mean the ones here are, they are probably just preparing to launch new ones
Czech immigration office, possibly
Russians (just like any other person) are great, if you avoid certain topics
With Ruskies, it is politics, history and criticizing anything about Russia (even things that Ruski himself will criticize in front of you)
They're still salty that we defeated them in our one and only naval battle
No, you see, the ammo depot exploded because of bad manipulation
Much like the people in Katyn just all decided to end their life coincidentally in the same place and at the same time because of depression
/s in case someone couldn't tell
Also, and I could be wrong here but I’m pretty sure I’m not, that ammo and weapons were meant to go to Ukraine during the Crimea thing
And the hockey championship in 1969
Americans are just Russians that take showers daily, no wonder you are in love <3

If your administration lasts more than 4 years, consult a democracy specialist

I for one am going to take the giant leap of suggesting the US and Germany should be friends
That would make the placement of tens of thousands of troops and weapons in Germany less awkward
Y'all acting like Germany is some third world country whose economy relies on US soldiers spending during their down time
Get fucked
Well at least you're guaranteed to have the best view from the crowd the next time a fascist dictator gets executed and strung up in your area
I'd make a joke about having a bike being a Dutch citizen's duty but considering what the police is like in my country (yes, i live in eastern europe) this is too wholesome
This is not brutalism
Matter of fact this probably can't be classified as any particular architectonic style, due to it not having any
Well, people gotta live somewhere
I think they have these in London
Yes, two Czech citizens are detained in Turkey, but those two dumbasses actually were kind of asking for it, because they went to Syrian Kurdistan to do humanitarian work (or so they say, the Turks accuse them of doing logistics and recruiting for YPG), posted all over their social media about it, including pics with YPG fighters which Turkey considers to be a terrorist organization and then had the 'great' idea to return home through Turkey
Long story short, the were sentenced for aiding a terror organization and now they're in a process of appealing the decision
That's new freedom of speech
You can with minimal to none backslash criticizes your government or politicians
But you can criticizes China and it's politicians only in private or anonymously

Honestly, the only reason why they are considered a part of the southern Slavs is that they were a part of Yugoslavia
Otherwise they are western Slavs in all but name, imho
I think the cartoon is at least one year old
*instead of home made booze
FIFY
Yeah, they are less understandable instinctively, but like with all Slavic languages, I think it's a matter of getting used to it
You learn only a couple of words and suddenly you understand a lot more
Well, what would you say makes a southern Slav in your opinion
Because I feel like culturally anything north of Zagreb has more in common with central Europe than it does with the Balkans
That's because 1) it's just a bunch of random people talking on the internet, not an academic discussion, so duh, people don't come armed with all the knowledge, and 2) you only narrowed it down to linguistics to make your point

I know our Government was constantly complaining how the distribution of the money was being based too heavily on unemployment numbers (we had almost problematically low unemployment prior to corona), even after the EU adjusted it to be based on a few other factors as well, so it might just be that the extra regional development funding was thrown in to shut us up
Because they know Babiš is going to embezzle a good deal of it; once he's done, what's left will be in line with everybody else

LOL you guys would just love to see Europe split again
WW3 incoming
And do you northdwellers even understand that most of your exports go to other EU countries
Therefore the wellbeing of other EU countries should be your concern too
Not just if YOU got the most of it
It was said that the money should help Italy, Spain etc
If they go down
I guarantee you will feel it
I understand protests against government and politics, because they are dependent on their people

With Brexit, the only border between EU and UK is the "border" between Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland
Based on the [Good Friday Agreement] there are no enforced borders between the two Irelands
Brexit however forces the two sides to have a real border
Unless you want another civil war, IRA and other stuff, there can't be a border

Pick the single WORST issue they could have that instantly antagonises basically entire millenial generation + anyone else with shred of common sense
This is how you create single-issue voters and if there are gonna be other countries triggering referendums, they literally could not shoot themselves in the dick any more
Me too
I was always for EU, but in the past 2-3 years I have been more disappointed than ever
People are wondering why some want to leave EU and this law made me wonder if I still want to be part of it
Check this website
Happened a long time ago
...and Wikipedia
That's true
It's fucked up they call themself pro-EU and vote for shit like this
Freedom of expression is one of the fundamental rights guaranteed to EU citizens
This literally entails mass censorship of the internet
It will be challenged, I have no doubt about it
I don't stop believing in democracy because they made a grievous error
Our MPs do that all the time
...how
That really doesn't matter – all the applicants have to prove is that it has this effect in practice (this is a sort of principle in constitutional law – it doesn't matter what your intentions are, what matters is the effects and whether they are proportional to the aim)
Sadly, it will probably first have to be demonstrated in real world usage before sufficient evidence is available
Very true
This is a case of technology moving forward far quicker than human conceptual thinking
That's the case in any democratic society; boundaries exist and must exist
Nevertheless, the *interpretation* of the boundaries is carried out by independent courts based on the principle of proportionality
For god's sake, read something about it
The issue is that these days, *everything* can be considered "copyrighted material", so the inevitable result will be preventive banning (by filtering) of everything, including fair use
If I am posting a Boromir meme, am I infringing on someone's copyright
Who knows, but I'll be banned just in case because the site I am uploading to wants to pre-empt potential lawsuits
This is not freedom, this is copyright tyranny
People have always imitated and developed other people's works and ideas
It's natural for us and the present-day obsession with copyrighting and patenting every fart needs to stop

I would say the worst war was 30 years one
Imagine there is a war for your all life
Thats unimaginable
Look at docummentary series about diary of mercenary
It is named Age of Iron- Die eiserne Zeit
Personally, I think this one was more horrifying
The second one killed more people, but what most people had to go through in the first one was imho worse
EDIT: I've already addressed the Holocaust and other WW2 stuff in another comment and explained my reasoning, so no need to be a smart ass and remind me of it, as if I've never heard of it
Even immediately after the end of WW1, as new countries were being created and competed for land and autonomy
It was worst war that have even been in the Czechia
We've lost 40% of our population
That caused massive German colonisation and ups; Sudetenland -> WWII
After watching The Apocalypse I no longer think so
Yes, WW2 had some instances when it was incredibly brutal, but the conditions soldiers had to go through on the frontlines of WW1 were in my opinion worse
The constant shelling that could go on for days, the diseases, the mutilation, the mud, the sense of impending doom, entire areas literally blown to smithereens, tens of thousands of dead in a single attack, facing some of the new horrifying weapons (the flamethrower, chemical weapons, machine guns, tanks
) for the first time
Some places in France are still poisoned by all the dead bodies in the ground
Maybe if they were cremated
But for humans the gut bacteria from dead bodies that gets into drinking water or crops can cause severe poisoning
Actually, according to Wiki it's somewhere in the 300 to 700 year range
Here you go

There was a similar campaign in Germany in 1941

I am geniunely curious ... Like to me this thing just lacks any sort of decency or *nuance*. I can just imagine the architect told the builders to just slap random vaguely fantasy looking things on the house everywhere they could ... I think this is just another piece of highly kitschy bussiness baroque
Britain bad
10 minutes to go in UK
Personally I just kinda sympathize with the Scots for getting screwed over honestly
A big argument in the original IndyRef was that an independent Scotland might have a hard time joining the EU, which they are pretty fond of and have tried to integrate with, so staying with the UK was the safest way to secure their EU membership
Then the UK instantly turns around and pulls Brexit on them
I wasn't sold on Scottish Independence being the best idea back then, but now I kinda can't blame the Scots if they decide to say "Well screw you too, then"
Technically there was an independent Welsh Principality for several centuries, so if we assume that the Kingdom of England and Principality of Wales titles are the same tier, then does Prince Charles automatically get independence once Queen Elizabeth's empire-tier "United Kingdom" title gets revoked
What a massive waste of her "Long Reign" opinion modifier that would be
There are so many dumb and dangerous people spreading misinformation around
Several days in a row we have almost 10k cases
A country of 10M people
// update, over 11k yesterday, we are fucked
So lockdown not only killed our economy but also just moved the coronavirus to the winter when it will be even more deadly combined with the flu season
Which was really expectable, but the Lockdown crowd just ignored the warnings
I'm happy my country contributes so much these days
We're the best in the whole EU
Well it's mostly due to our efforts
Czechs are doing their part while rest of Europe is slacking off
Heyhey, don't undermine the success of Czechia
People are stupid and vocally opposed to any measures and our prime minister is a coward who overruled a lot of the measures our previous health minister tried to enact
People, intelligent people, around me still claim it’s all overblown and hysteria
Even with the numbers we have
That’s why I’m sure we’re fucked
Yeah we're beyond fucked
Our prime minister is a total conman "solving" everything just via a huge PR machinery
Who would expect the covid cant be dealt with that way
Those are rookie numbers
We, Czechs, have 9k cases per day and only 10 million people
All thanks to our star player, Andrej Coviš. Sorry jako
We even had a "Farewell, Covid" party in June
That's how cocky we were
but we don't have enough testing capacity either, our positivity rate is 30%
Only restaurants, bars, schools and cultural events are closed
Malls are still open for example as are all other stores, masks are only required indoors
There is no real plan in place so they’re ad-hoc putting new measures in place as if they didn’t have months to prepare
WOW Its big
wow, Japan is almost touching the land of Jakubmarian

There was this one map in the old Transport Tycoon - it was a big island with all land on sea level except on the shore that was a 1 square wide dyke all around
If you accidentally lowered a single square of land on the dyke, it would flood your whole map
Unless you managed to quickly contain it by raising land around the leak
All the men of Lidice were killed as well
All women above 16 were send to concentration camps
A several children below 16 were send to German families, the rest were gassed
It was done in a retaliation for the assasination of the third highest ranked Nazi Reinhard Heydrich, who was also in charge of the Protektorat
He was nicknamed the Butcher of Prague
EDIT: Some people pointed out that Heydrich might not have been that high in the Nazi hierarchy
So let's just say that he was among the high-ranking Nazis, perhaps not exactly the 3rd, but he was surelly an important figure in the Nazi ruling elites
Ok this is freaky to see on the front page because I was literally just here about an hour ago
Here's my photo of the children's memorial, which currently has a bunch of toys and flowers laid there (even including a fidget spinner)
Yes, it is the one
It wasn't the only massacre done as a retaliations of Heydrich's assasination, there was also the village Ležáky where all adults and 11 children were killed
Amen
Which kinda reminds me of our [memorial] to the victims of communism
He was an SS-Obergruppenführer and General of the Police as well as chief of the Reich Main Security Office (including the Gestapo, Kripo, and SD)
He was also the main architect of the Holocaust and the Reichsprotektor in Bohemia and Moravia
At the time when he was alive, I can't think of any other Nazi leader apart from Hitler and Himmler who had as many important functions
There are even speculations that he was gonna replace Hitler at some point
It made France and the UK renounce the Munich Agreement and put the whole Czechoslovakia firmly on the victor's side after WW2 though
If you want to see a movie about the assassination of Heydrich watch Atentat from 1964 or Anthropoid from 2017
This happened when the war was coming to the end and Germans were losing control over the country
There were more of these massacres, where Czechs took revenge for the whole occupation period on German civilians
It was a horrid time to be alive overall
And yes, the whole retribution that some Czechs took against Germans after WW2 was never properly investigated let alone punished
Like most massacres of Germans
It's revolting to read about that, especially knowing the perpetrators (often former collaborators who needed credentials as anti-Nazis, so they massacred some civilians) mostly got away with it
You're correct that Czechs don't want to be reminded of this
During the entire Commie period, this topic was essentially taboo and the older generations react pretty angrily, if you want to educate them on this topic
I participated in a symbolic re-enactment the death march of Brno Germans (Versöhnungsmarsch); near the end of the 30 km walk, there were some protesters against the  event, mostly elderly Commies shouting stuff like "go back to the Reich" and "shame" at us
If they weren't oldtimers about to die soon, hopefully, I'd have shouted back something nasty at them
But they're mostly representative of what the older generations think about attempts to remember the post war events
EDIT: BTW, let's lighten this topic up a bit: my grandmother told me a funny story from post-expulsions South Moravia
A local Commie representative (whose surname was Hicl) wanted the municipal council to rename the local terrain features (hills with Czechisied German names like "Sumperk", "Kolberk" etc
) to get fully rid of the "German element". The locals told him to shut up and think about where he got his surname (which is likely a Czech form of "Hitzel", a common German surname in the area)
He never brought that up again
> Wasnt the assassination some kind of insidejob, too
Someone that thought heydrich would get to much power and wanted him dead
No, it was a joint operation of the British government, the Czechoslovak government in exile and the Czech and Slovak resistence members
Okay, so perhaps not the 3rd, but just among the high-ranking Nazis
I find it hard to blame those who actually went through the occupation as small children (and thus weren't collaborators) for not wanting to accept the guilt for what happened after WW2
It's easy to look at it from your perspective, you didn't live during that time and didn't have to suffer
Some people here lost everything as small children and I do not find it strange if they cannot get over it
It's the responsibility of the younger generations to get over it and look at the past events objectively and without biases
Both my grandmothers lived through the war and occupation as adults, one in a small village in South Moravia (she was required to grow stuff for the German army and occasionally house German officers), the other was sent for forced labour in Germany (Totaleinsatz)
Neither of them was particularly bitter about Germans
The South Moravian one expressed regret occasionally about the expulsions, saying it ruined some villages
I feel those fanatically anti-German oldtimers are mostly former Commie apparatchiks or people whose conscience about the post-war events isn't entirely clean
Okay, so your grandmothers aren't particulary bitter, does that mean no one can be particularely bitter
No even people whose family members were murdered by the Germans during the war
I'm just saying that some children who lived through the war must have experienced some severe trauma during the occupation
I can emphatise with that, the same as I emphatise with the victims of the retaliations and their family members
Some things are simply so horrible, that not all people manage to get over them
If my family was killed, I would probably also find it difficult to not be bitter about it
Sure, but I think those most pro-expulsion, rabidly anti-German ones are simply brainwashed  Commies or people who somehow benefited from odsun, most likely by gaining property
People who really suffered during the war are mostly empathetic enough not to wish the same evil on others, even Germans
Not all, but in my experience this generally applies
With a knife, ideally
There's some serious meme potential with these faces
You know you are also encouraging Le Pen voters by this, right
France (and the rest of Europe) won't get better by electing Macron
Unhappy crowd will grow stronger and stronger
Vote Le Pen
France needs you, not Europe
Come on, he won't make life easier for Le Pen voters based on his rhetoric
Shit will hit the fan
It's inevitable
By electing Le Pen now, when she has rather small number of supporters, there's at least a chance that some of them will change their opinion of her during her presidency
By electing Macron, crowd of her supporters will only grow stronger
And they won't change their opinion, no way
He just wants to be offended by something
Cool
I'd love a Mi-24 Hind in the garden just so, but I dont think the Mrs would let me
We used to have an old Wessex helicopter on the training base back in the UK when I was in the army which always fascinated me
I had the Czech defence ministry's website open from an earlier thread I saw they were selling old bunkers, no decommissioned aircraft there but I see they are selling some "Hazardous waste - kerosene sludge" but I think Ill give that a miss

We used to do the same when I was in the TA twenty odd years ago
The case of a LAW 94 was filled with concrete to simulate the weight and someone(usually me as the youngest) had to carry the fucking thing round all weekend
We called it the Combat Handbag
Lugging concrete around seems to be a forces SOP by this point
Had a slight heart attack the first time I saw one of those "be careful this road is bad" signs in Bavaria, since by Czech standards at the time the road was really smooth
Also in the winter you can literally see the border between South Bohemia and Austria, because the road quality and the fact that you can't salt the roads in National parks in Czechia, so you literally go from 40 km/h to 90 km/h (or 100
not sure which one is the limit)
Yeah, this is totally just Belgium and the Balkans
You wouldn't...uhm ... [find it anywhere else, especially in central Europe]
The Netherlands is the worst European country in renewable energy use according to Eurostat so they are nowhere near where they present themselves in terms of the environment
Which is so sad
But people believe it because of stereotypes without checking the data

I misinterpreted that as an environmental claim, my bad
Yea the overwhelming use of gas shocked me when I lived there for 4 years
Also the amount of old houses with outdated energy concept

I traveled daily in regional bus and two city buses and
complete silence, always
I moved to USA
Any neighbor that sees me cheerfully ask me "Heeey how you dooiin'" and then go back to doing their own business without even expecting answer
My inner antisocial czechness always freeze from that terrifying phenomenon
Force out quick "good" and move on
It's weird
Czech here, I doubt we are as severe as our far northern neighbors, but I would wager that we are still pretty socially
distant
Date in a resturant is like Schrodinger's cat
kind of
It is and isn't date at the same date
If it goes poorly, nope, totally not a date we just went to hang out
But if you both enjoyed it, yes, it was totally date
Sometimes its real mental gymnastics
Terrifying
If you don't mind me asking
Czechs are just as antisocial as our Scandinavian friends and I moved to USA 2 years ago
I still can't figure out
what's up with all the "HEEEY HOW YOU DOIN'?" without people actually expecting answer
These people terrify me lmao
Don't speak to me your weirdos, I don't know you

And a funny story, my wife told me I kill every conversation anyone tries with me without knowing
Dude would ask me "You doing something fun this weekend
" odd question, but I answer it truthfully "Yes
" -awkard silence- "Okay\~" ... Now apparently, I am meant to unravel all my plans to him to start conversation
That's crazy

I think they are quite cool, was on a long holiday in Lapland once and they had a shop selling wooden carved stuff, cups, knives, bottle openers etc
Got a moose head beer bottle opener still going strong after years of excessive use
Love the original Thing, the prequel was alright but I dont know it was just meh
I think it would have been more claustrophobic if it was in Norwegian or like Chernobyl was in English but pretending to be in Russian
The shoehorning in of the American gung ho pilots and scientists took a bit away from the mystery of the Norwegian base from the original Thing
are you trying to provoke a civil unrest
Is she a sin-eater of some sort
Clear distinction of Western, Central, and Eastern European countries
A bit simplified, but basically: progressive society vs balanced society vs conservative society
It's not, sadly
Majority might be, but some really important stuff aren't.
At least in Czech Republic it's two different terms and two different sets of rights, so no, it's not the same
Examples of the legal differences (but there are way more): unable to adopt a child, unable to foster a child, legally you don't have in-laws, you can only get "married" at a few selected institutions and can't have legal witnesses, in case of a divorce there are no laws about dividing shared property, in case of death of one of the partners you're not entitled to the money widow(er)'s get from state
Middle ground between progressive views and conservative views
A ground that makes most people least unhappy
If half of the country wants the same-sex marriage to be legal and the other half wants it to be banned completely, then I'd say unions/partnerships are the compromise, which display a balanced solution to a population split on an issue
You can never go wrong with that
In general, middle ground will always make most people least unhappy
(unless it's the "take the worst of each" kind of situation, which obviously isn't the case here)
Or do you think that when a political issue that has a middle ground, it's best to go fully with one side
The US has been doing it like that the last decade and it didn't turn out quite well, I'd say
They both directly imply each other: A compromise is selecting the middle ground which makes all sides somewhat unhappy, but not a lot
Going with it makes sure no one will be very unhappy
>Also, the EU hasn't gone fully one side on much, wtf you talking about
Read my comment again
If you can't see the clear connection and implication between the two definitions, that's on you
/r/The_LakeBled
I planned on going there (the Alta Via 2 trail, around 150km and approx
10 days long)
Anybody been there before
Is it worth it
Spent a couple of months up there one Spring or late Winter I suppose, near Muonio in a nice little holiday village of wooden huts in the forest, skiing and sauna everyday
Lovely part of the world
Ive heard it talked about a lot and I spent a bit of time in Finnish Lapland
Personally I dont think it matters
Apart from the weekend Im stuck in some office anyway apart from an hour at lunchtime, it's dark or part dark going in and dark when I get out for months anyway
Probably time to vamos a la playa
Thankfully today some cold winds decided to cool the Czech republic so it's nice 25 °C. :-)
Vamos a la Slapy
It makes sense when you look at the [Keeling Curve]
Finnish coffee isn't that bad imo
This would be a proper reaction to mämmi though
This is hideous

Fucking refugees, coming here, living with OUR horses, bringing their CAMEL CULTURE into OUR LAND
edit: I can bet 500 dollars someone blamed refugees, somewhere, in a facebook comment or [Novinky

Why are here so many Czech posts these days
Ne že bych si stěžovala teda
hOLY SHIT IS THAT SNOW
Wait what the hell
what
The news article about him I read mentioned that the camel violated road laws, as it did not have anything reflective on itself
Well it was snowing in Prague yesterday
Yeah, snowed yesterday in prague
Another Israeli - Czech
>A few weeks back, an emu escaped its breeder in Brno (the second-largest city in Czechia), the emu was on the run (in a fucking city) for 10 days before it was caught
That's like the most normal thing that happened in Brno in a while
You forgot the mamba who killed a woman in Prague - Hlubočepy last year
But the best are [Prague mouflons]
also the cougar that escaped around june and is wandering around somewhere in Vysočina right now
Yeah, couldn't look out the windows because it was blocked by snow

Genocide:

That's what i am saying
I just provided definition
Wow, now I see it does make sense
The colour scheme always looked weird to me
excited and naughty
I expected a some woman appliance
Which is something hilarious of course, this whole famine
On the other hand - there WAS a time when it was possible to secure itself from Russia - in the 90s - and a lot of countries took the opportunity to do it
By the time of the Russians were seizing Crimea me and my friends, classmates at university and plenty of other people I know, we all did voice our protests to our politicians (we e-mailed people we voted for in our elections and/or in EU elections) to express we stand against this aggression and demand to take actions against it ASAP
We were promised they will take the matter up the ladder
But you know what
The people we voted for were minority in the parliament
It was already too late as only politically impotent talking heads or post-communist local oligarch were in charge (as they promised people more wealth for less work and that they root out corruption and frauds and, as usual, majority of the voters took the sweet bait)
Nobody with real political power cared that they just let pro-russian propagandists poison our debates, our society
It got worse since then
People just refuse to look up information, cross-check their news sources, they just simply soak in every BS they read and no longer care
Recent elections showed it up
And by now, the pro-russian crowd (not yet particularly large one, but still) is louder than ever, silencing every other opinion by threats, cyber bullying and slandering everyone
Frustrating
And nobody knows how to defend themselves against it, when (again) nobody really cares about anything by now
Stepping up NATO integration would make Russia escalate the war
If that's the price you're willing to pay, Ukraine would probably become a much better place to live at the cost of the NATO coming a lot closer to a direct confrontation with Russia
Dude I'm not saying that, I'm just saying that we should be prepared for a response if we move against Russia
I know you're gonna say "but Russia has no right to decide Ukrainian matters
" but that doesn't matter, what matters is that Russia would see it as a threat and respond appropriately
Same here
When I got to the last part of the title, I was really horrified for a moment
what happened to old minister
In Czechia, we have changed our health minister 4 times
This is going to be a really cool thing to find like 30 years from now
Imagine a kid in the 2050's using it to by a Cola or something thinking: "Huh, nice coin, wonder what the pandemic was like
There's this tradition of fasting on Christmas Eve
No food until the big Christmas dinner
If you manage to fast until then, you have a chance of spotting a golden pig
There was a great commercial for Kofola that mentioned this tradition
Hahaha I agree that Kofola is an acquired taste
and and it's terribly sweet
I have recently found out that soda drinks produced for the Czech Republic is sweeter than "normal". So now I'm obviously curious how the "normal" ones taste
To mam trochu z ruky, jsem z Ostravy :) je to dost mozne, tady ten sirup cpou vsude
"Minister of state-approved communication"
Too bad that plenty of EU politicians would like to do the same
Have you ever bothered to read the sidebar of this sub
Wait, German Unity Day isnt about Bismarck, true unifier of Germany
I feel disappointed :(

Priceless
It's treason then

oh, I'm ashamed
I'd like to see the EU average of these graphs
This looks better than it is
This graph shows generation, not consumption
Many of the "green" countries are buying big portion of electricity consumption from other not so green states
I´d like to see more nuclear everywhere
Isn't the waste incineration air pollution captured as well
Think I read an article on these recycling power plants once
It's actually more light gray than Denmark
Can you build one by ours
I have to drive past a landfill each morning I drive to work, prefer to drive a bit of a longer way home to miss it as its an eyesore and it stinks so cant thave the window down in the summer
Its in a nice patch of forest and is even 5 mins from Franz Ferdinand's castle
I think they are doing some half arsed methane capture but its a grim sight and smell
I don't think you understand how big an investment it is for resource-scarce islands like Cyprus to import expensive fuels
I dont think we will see Kievan Rus again
Current owners of Minsk and Kyiv have different problems
The Chonk Republic
Oh, well
My country is pretty fat :(
Eating too late
Tried a few diets/meal plans
Eating after 2000 is a big no no on one of them
You're meant to burn off the food a bit, eat a bigger lunch, smaller dinner
I am positively surprised
Of course this isn't a very good metric of which country it's better to live in, but still
Yeah, I'd make twice as much money in the US, but I'd also spend 6 times as much on healthcare, use 80% more electricity, 4 times likely to be murdered etc
This might not be the greatest country on Earth, but I am pretty happy to live here
~~At least make a comparison between the EU and the US
EDIT: Apparently biased on purpose

I mean, the stone ceiling does have some substantial holes in it right now
I wouldn't be against turning those into skylights, honestly
And I do have a soft spot for buildings that blend old stone or brick architecture with modern steel and glass, especially where the steel and glass is used to 'fill in' missing bits of the old structure
[Like this] where the new parts don't pretend to be old but are like transparent 'ghosts' of what used to be there

It sounds like you're talking about placeholders
Czechs did that
Castle Houska was built on crack in the mountain because they thought It's entrance to hell
They made a throne for Satan in the cellar, too
Just for the good measure
I present you Hranická propast
The water at the bottom
Goes 1,200m underground
The confirmed underwater depth is actually currently at least 404 meters (473 m including the dry part) but it is true that based on the water composition/temperature or something it is expected to be as deep as 1200 m.
Yes so I heard
Any idea why It's so troublesome to reach the bottom though
Noone wants to pay for it or is technology not good enough
Probably because a) you can't see shit at that depth and b) it's not a straight shaft to the bottom
It goes sideways in some places, the walls aren't flat, there's debris, "fake" bottoms and possibly some very small openings which you have to find and fit through
Edit: But yeah, if finding the bottom was of a really significant scientific importance, like if we knew there's answer to the life, the universe and everything hidden at the bottom, we sure would have already found it
Taras Shevchenko, the most prominent nazi since 1840
Edit: Ctrl+F or find “Слава України”, you’ll find it in that poem
Read about its history here, I think it is time to finally put the arguments to an end:
> On the same day - January 22, 1919 – in parallel with the battles in Volyn, the Unification Act of the Ukrainian lands was proclaimed in Kyiv
The railroad soldiers were the first to arrive at the Sofiyivska Square carrying a large national flag, on which the words "Glory to the Ukrainian heroes
" were inscribed
(prototype of the future "Glory to the Heroes
[33]
Nah, you were right before
Слава Україні is literally transliterated to “Slava Ukraini”.
Wow, it works
As Czech, I do not know if "Eastern Europe" insults me more than having one state together with Poles
I am sorry polish brothers, but putting together most atheist nation with most religious one would be just insane idea
Yeah that eastern European Union hurts me as a Czech
Thanks
It tottaly worked
Well done
Appreciate this, Was It hard to make
We are not eastern europe we are centra
Adding Czechia to Germany would be honestly more insulting for me also Slovakia to Hungary would do more damage to be honest
But great map anyway
You should drive with both hands on the wheel though
> This type of behavior should mean you risk being banned from copyrighting works
Agreed 100%. Good luck getting legislators to pass something like that
Also, I suspect corporations affected by such a ban would just make a new company to carry on
I wish I was able to just invent a new identity and wipe away my past whenever the hell I felt like it
Happened from time to time in Czechia to me as well, it made the early morning rides much better
Isn't that on purpose
Bus drivers here always leave the lights off unless we're nearing a bus stop
It is so naive to expect that the campaign for the second referendum would be without lies and deceptions
It would be worse than the first one
I have a legitimate question: How do they keep it so clean white all the time
There has to be rain with a bit of ash/dirt or some tourists drity it
I just don't get it
The EU does an absolutely *atrocious* job of explaining what it's doing
As I see it, that's the root cause of all the growing anti-EU sentiment, because actors trying to dismantle the organization are free to claim it eats money and does nothing, and the EU doesn't bother correcting that narrative and educating people
Yet, lots of Serbs go around whining how the west wronged them, they only went genocidal in defense (nobody wanted to play Yugoslavia with them anymore)
They do not recognized their war crimes, they done nothing, maybe Russia will ride in and save them
THere is horrid Yugoslavia wars revisionism ("why did the USA not help us kill the MOOSLIMS
I met few Serbians (though born after the war and in diaspora) running around with photos of Karadzic and Milosevics in their valet
Yeah, I am a Czech and there is so much fucking CZECXIT propaganda
In a way I wish somebody would pull of fearmongering ("they will close your Kauflands and Lidls and you may face shortage of the medicines that keep you alive" on those boomers
Because it seems they do not hear rational arguments
Just "boo, EU scary, butr Russia will save you" crap
And those boomers gotten their Prague spring hopes crushed by Soviet tanks)
Dude they want to ban our ř! The ř!
So do you see a way out
I sometimes feel that there is a no way to make country democratic
Us Czechs are not a warlike nation (as my friend once said: "I am not worried about civil war here
That would take effort and this nation is too fucking lazy for that"), but we still vote for populists and communists and blame EU for everything bad (eventhough people would flip out if they stopped them on border of Croatia for five minutes while they were going for their vacation)
Anywas, wishing you luck
May our nations see the light and work on better future

Don't you have enough wonderful old towns in Italy
For me, France and Italy are two countries proving absolute injustice of God in distribution of wonderful natural and cultural sites
Only in Firenze or  Venezia you can stay for years to study all the artworks there
I don't understand why Italians travell abroad at all
I tolerate only those who spread Italian art in the world, like those who particpated also in building Český Krumlov and other renaissance and baroque monuments in our country (see  for exmaple [Baldassare Maggi] and others mentioned at [this site]
The main problem with tourism in Prague (and maybe some other Czech towns where it's mostly foreign tourists wealthier than us) is locals being priced out of real estate and rents and everything being owned by foreign "investors". Which obviously isn't a fault of the tourists themselves, it's happening because of missing regulations, but it's no wonder that it makes the majority of locals, who don't benefit from tourism much at all, quite salty
Litter, drunk tourists vomiting in the streets and ugly advertising are indeed just minor symptoms of what happened to the whole area's property structure
That's to distinguish between the Polish part and the Czech part of the divided city, both are Těšín in Czech language
If you'd go for the literal translation, it wouldn't be Bohemian Těšín, it would be Czech Těšín.
This one uses the other meaning of the adjective, because you're one level up
Český Těšín (Czech) as opposed to Těšín (in Poland)
Yeah, that's to differentiate between that and the polish Těšín. Wouldn't make sense to call it Silesian Těšín, would it
So it's "Český" meaning "of Czech Republic" not "Bohemian". Small difference, might not be clear for everyone, but the difference is there
The word "can" meaning a small container is the same as "can" as being able to, in English
That doesn't make them the same word
That's correct
However I didn't see anyone dispute that
Well, "in this case" would indicate there are other cases for this word too
And this meaning does fit for Český Krumlov
However I will not speak for him for that I don't know exactly how he meant it
How much of real manufacturing is still left in UK
Fun fact: Lauterbrunnen is right next to Grindelwald

My girlfriend's uncle had about half a dozen shell casings from a PaK 38 - anti tank cannon he was using as candle holders, he gave me a couple before he died

Sounds like the standard operating procedure when you step on a mine: jump 30 feet into the air and scatter yourself over a wide area
I think Japan is way more relevant than Brazil
Europe will relatively decline because other regions will develop
This is not a bad thing, but it is a reason why Europe should defend its interests as a unified entity
If you think individual nation states would be better off alone, fine, just leave already and see how it goes

Babiš has a shitload of flaws, but being an admirer of Orban and Trump is not between them
Heck, he kinda despise Trump as incompetent failed businessman
Looks  sort of pretty (the dress)
Recently, budget for 2018, made by the ČSSD-ANO-KDU coallition has been approved
77 out of 78 ANO politicians were for it
I repeat, it was constructed and approved by ANO, with Babiš in lead
What does he say
> Není to náš rozpočet
(Translation: It isn't our budget
Another one:
Before the election, he was dissing all other parties very heavily
He probably made ODS look like devils that should rot in the hell for his voters
Day after the election, he said that the best possible coalltion would be the one with - you guessed it - ODS
Where am I going: His opinions are very inconsistent
I wouldn't rely on something he said just once, especially with things about other politicians like Trump or Orbán. If you look at the record of what he said, you'll see exact opposites in his opinions - many more than the two I listed above
> Babis admires Orban, he said so himself
> **he said so himself**
Just wait for a while
Once they disagree on something, they'll act like to-the-death enemies
Although you're most likely right, the fact Babiš said so adds no confirmation to it
> your PM
I hate this fact as well
Austrian problems require Austrian solutions
Yes
Totally wasted that opportunity to say “I am not going home and your vehicle is parked over here at the orbit by the way” :)
Nice, let's hope it will get to my town as well

Nice to get these things fast
AFAIK these are not shampoos but laundry detergents tho

Sweden, are you ok
What language is this written in
Yeah I came across that a couple of times on askreddit and asked American workmates too as I just dont get it
If there is some drink, drug or mental issues I'd understand but generally there seems to be some glee about it on the parents side, tough love like they are doing the kids a favour
Im not even Czech I just live here but the UK isnt like the US on this either, I was in and out the family home till 25, my cousin moved back home after divorce and was there till 40 before getting married again
Almost everyone I know stayed at home until 25-30
Living outside of Prague now it seems three quarters of the village have their adult kids living with them, I hope my two sons convert our barn into houses and live there like the neighbours kids have done
Nah
Loads of Slovaks study and then work in Czech Rep so a lot of them have moved here or maybe to Bratislava
In the jobs Ive worked over the years(admin & now IT) in Prague and Brno there are usually more Slovaks then Czechs
I think there are more people from Kosice living in Prague, than people from Prague
Yeah Im in a village an hour from Prague and 8/12 houses have parents and their adult kids in them with their children, 5 with spouses
Also 2 new builds on the family field
I wonder if there will be any joy with these houses for one Euro you always see in the media in dying villages
With the increase in homeworking with Covid, even if it becomes popular it would still stay low hopefully
Love the Italian countryside, especially Abruzzo
Yeah I'd love to be in the middle of nowhere in the Abruzzo, Dolomites or here but it's not possible
Two young kids needing schools and Im not always guaranteed home office although I had it a lot even before Covid
Was speaking to a local in Sulmona who was saying loads of older Germans and Dutch were snapping up local mountain villas, I think this is the main way to do it when the kids are older and no need to work
But doctors and hospitals might be an issue in the countryside when getting old, especially now with Covid
Well he said yesterday literally:"I will never resign, you shall remember it
No, no no no no no NO NO NO NOOOoooooooOOOooo
I somewhat guess splitting Serbocroatia would be a nightmare compared to splitting of Czechoslovakia
I don't like that we are closer to Russia but also above Germany
Still no sea
No sea for us and still next to slovakia and germany, not much difference
Also tatranky would be called mořenky in this scenario
Czechia: Oh my god, I really hoped for some beaches
Cool idea btw
Edit: As a 'bonus'... We went a few decades back
This close to Russia
We will be annexed in few days :(
When tf is this map from
2010
Perfect beer making conditions tho
Same complaint here
I'm just glad we're still next to Slovakia
Well yes, but actually no
Many people still use Czech Republic
Czech Republic sounds better to me
The Czechia sounds worse, but it is better to use because it is shorter
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch
I’ll have you know my region is actually the most developed region in Europe, and I’ve been involved in numerous region developement projects, and we have over 300 world-famous tourist attractions
You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet
Think again, fucker
As we speak I am contacting my secret network of volunteers across the Czech Republic and we're getting ready to make our region even better so you better prepare for the storm, maggot
The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life
You’re fucking dead, kid
Our region is getting better everywhere, all the time, and I can make it even nicer in 700 different ways, and that’s just with my bare hands

sadly
What's up with Sjælland

I find it heartwarming that we share these embarassing, notorious habits like socks in sandals and hogging the beach with your towels
Next you’re going to tell me Germans also bring Schnitzels on holiday
German
Hello from the Czech Republic
Mor egerman ? socks and sandals ? with beer ? 10/10 Czech republic
[that's where you're wrong freunde]
Could be
I think it was originally taken in CzR because I saw it like more than a year ago on the Czech internet
And as a bonus - my nation wears socks in sandals regularly
And Czechness
It's our national embarrassment that we try to keep secret
Don’t worry, I haven’t seen a fanny pack in decades
Or at least in over a decade
Note that these fashion transgressions are inherent to men only
Might be the reason us ladies have a good reputation when it comes to looks
Because Slovak nationalists would never ever buy Czechia Chips
It is global economy - scams and manipulation
> I love Europe, because I am European
What does that even mean
What a bizarre fucking post, is this Europe's first attempt at copying Russia's propaganda
Needs work, for a start try to not make these posts on fresh accounts especially with a name like CitizenOfTheEU
EU brings you freedom to move around it’s countries
Freedom to work and study in each country without any discrimination
Freedom to run business in every country and sell your goods and services across borders without any restrictions
Access to health system and fast track to permanent residency
Now if Brit wants to work or stay longer in some European state will have to ask for visa
Don’t have qualification we want
Rejected, stay home
But that’s what they wanted
Don’t forget about the one nothing of snow in the Czech Republic
It is white and cold  and called in German [schnee]
I feel dizzy and unsteady because of the op art  and Im just sitting down and looking at a picture, cannot immagine walking on it
If you ever find yourself in Budapest, I recommend visiting [The House of Terror] museum
Respect from Czech Republic
And sadly these days many try to minimize the suffering of those times and turn to Putin as white knight protector against Muslims
V4 came so far, only to be more than ready to go back
> The museum is run by one of Orbán's most outspoken supporters
Wow, didn't know that
I liked the exhibition about the uprising and communism in general though so that's why I recommended it
That is stupid aswell, because the world does not just revolve around money
We can see that during Covid much clearer than any other time, local production is key and countries that can manufacture medical equipment on their own are much better off, if this lasts longer even stuff like growing wheat for your country gets much more beneficial
You dont want your own agricultural companies to crumble because some African dictator fuck can grow it cheaper with basicaly slave labour
That is why governments pay subsidies or straight up support for some kind of companies, to make it profitable in that country
If you pushed stocks of these companies to 0, they would crash and you would have a country that has to import all its food cause its litteraly impossible to manufacture food that can compete with import
Congratz, you all die of famine if the borders are closed
That comparison doesn't make sense, EU is not a country and doesn't have to pay for the same things as countries do
1% of GDP of whole EU is an abysmal number
Comrade soldier
you're done
Well Muricans like to say Go big or go home

From major EU countries, Spain did more tests (103k), Italy about the same (77k), and others less (Germany 56k, Poland 32k, France 21k)
But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections

If you are wondering like me what are those tube buildings, here is [an article] (it's a music theatre and an exhibition hall)
It's great fun but really hard sometimes
If you want to play it make sure you support the byzantines whenever you can
Without them the Seljuks crush you
I like to start by growing my own power base by conquering the small Muslim states around Georgia and then swearing fealty to the byzantines, which gives you protection and allows you to even become emperor yourself since when you join you're suddenly the most powerful person in the realm besides the emperor himself
Win the next election or win a revolt, and bam, you're emperor
Then it's off to the races as you conquer the world

I don't know about the Danish school system, but during my time at a Czech secondary school (graduated in 2013 and it was a quality school imo), the World/European history lessons basically ended with WW2
Stuff like Cold War or other 20th century conflicts were covered very loosely in the geography classes (only thanks to our great teacher), but that's about it
Kinda wish we didn't spend around 2 or 3 years, twice a week, learning about medieval times and focused on the modern times instead
I hope the curriculum will change for the future generations, as the recent history is equally, if not more, important as the 'ancient' one
Aww, Slovakia
Yeah cool Fuck nazis, but I hope you know those people who were in the streets were ordinary people who are scared to go outside during night hours, not some kind of neofascists

It's so sad this tradition is dying
When i was a kid, i would always wake up at about 6, threw my sister into water (with some help of her boyfriend), beat her with pomlázka, then spent whole morning (about 6 hours) walking door by door my whole village with my friends, got some money, got drunk (everyone would just give you shot of slivovice or two, chocolate and some money, usually like 20kč [$0,8], but some people would give you like 200kč), at 12:00 (traditional end) got home, went to sleep
Best day of year
For some reason, when i was like 14, people stopped opening doors
Then kids stopped going out for easter, as it was pointless - now boys only visit their relatives
Soon this tradition will die, it's so sad
It was fun :(

You HAVE to leave a deceased patient in the respective hospital ward for at least 2 hours after pronouncing death (because determining if someone is dead is not as simple as it sounds and there have been cases of people waking up in morgue)
Now of course in normal case the corpse is moved to empty room
IF there is one
If there is not, then they have to stay in the room with other patients for the entire required time
because there is simply nowhere else to put them
Its not pretty, but it will happen even in much better hospitals simply because they are overcrowded
(and hospitals are intentionally kept at 100% capacity because empty hospital beds do not make money - only full ones do)

I don't get Czechs who are proud about this
What are you proud about – that so many girls here end up in a highly exploitative industry where people's future lives are easily ruined

Seriously
Haha that's why we have our own category on porn sites :-D
700
thats quite OK
Wait really
I never knew we has this reputation
Oh no
When I learned about Pornhub I had one question : Is Pornhub recommending me so much Czech porn because I'm Czech, or because it's really that common
I guess I got my answer
I think I have already seen this map months or even years ago
Are the numbers up to date or is it outdated
If anyone is going into this research and compare old and current, I would also like to see the trends
Yes, Prague is the European Capital of Porn
Which is fun if you're into and yo random Czech ho
I can't stand hearing Czech in porn it's awful turn off
Native porntalk is so cringe
Religion
Considering the low unemployment, finding a job shouldn't be too difficult for those people
but when we talking 60 Euros
why would you do that
Also in a recent scandal a Prague city councilwoman was found to have made porn videos when she was younger
> That's caused by people who stigmatize and bully pornstars (...)
Which is almost everyone
The industry preys on vulnerable people who want to earn money and are (yes) often too stupid at that point to recognise the impact of that choice on their future lives
We are not and will never be at a point when "pornstar" is a normal occupation with no stigma attached
People are hypocrites
The point is, the porn is often humiliating itself (often by design)
You can be saying that blue is red all day, but that doesn't make it any redder
Holding it might, when you are a woman and your male colleagues are sniggering behind your back watching you on Pornhub; that really does wonders for the working environment
Or when your boyfriend dumps you when he finds out
Volumes have been written about how a single porn episode can seriously damage a woman's later life; suicides are not uncommon
It's a very tragic price to pay for being stupid in your teens
Were the volumes part of the smut genre, then I could imagine it, because if not, then it's interesting I haven't come across such a volume, even though there should be plenty of them
hehe
Who said it was
But who's to blame changes absolutely NOTHING about their situation
Your point
I know at least 3 girls who filmed porn and dated one
Czech Republic rules
Are you being deliberately difficult
This is NOT about whose fault it is, who's to blame, who has problems with that – this is irrelevant here
I am simply pointing out that a stint in pornography can ruin people's life, and that is a fact
Waaaait a second
I visited a big festival in Kaunas once and I was told that it was a celebration of Lithuania's independence
It had paragliders drawing the Lithuanian flag on the sky, NATO jets flying over, some Lithuanian bands playing, some important people sending their good wishes to Ukraine and such

In French there's also cervoise, it's an almost extinct type of beer brewed without hops
The word "bière", like "beer" in English, was adopted with the arrival beers brewed with hops
In English Ales (brewed without or with very little hops) and Beers (brewed with hops), to the point that they were taxed differently, and IIRC, that distinction still applied in the XVIII and probably even in the XIX centuries
It does, technically
There's an unsettling trend in Czech pubs lately that if you ask for a beer, they ask you which one, which is really an unnecessary delay if you ask me
That's why I say technically
Maybe pivo doesn't mean "drinkable thing" today, but it did maybe several hundreds years ago
Well, if you want řezané, you say you want a řezané, if you want plzeň, ask for plzeň. But it used to be that if you just asked for a beer, they knew you wanted a 10° beer (desítka)

> So this is how the rest of you guys felt in June last year
No, not really
Everybody knows that this won't fly with Spanish government, therefore it has no chance to be actually realized
(It is largely regarded as an internal issue of Spain
UDI is illegal according to the Spanish constitution
Internationally, it is not prohibited to declare independence unilaterally, but states have the right to protect their territorial integrity
So the only way for Catalans to have a state at this point is to engage into a military conflict with Spain and withstand the consequences -economic *and* political- along with the conflict itself, certainly neither of which will happen
On the other hand, Brexit was a legitimate, domestically and internationally recognized decision, which would/will affect not just the GB but the rest of the union as well
In that sense, Brexit felt like a more serious matter

Like, the dude's been in office since 1994 and has won five Presidential elections before this, of which at least four were just as blatantly rigged as this one
I completely agree that his illegitimate Presidency shouldn't be recognized by the international community, but it does seem a bit hypocritical to only make a big movement out of not recognizing him now, as opposed to 20 years ago

And 50 years ago, new communist government used police, the army and the People’s Militias to brutally squash massive civil protests  on the occasion of  the first anniversary of the invasion
Five young people were shot dead
The state of affairs today in Czech republic - Prime minister - ex communist secret police agent (StB) and normalization communist
(pre)resident of Czech republic - asshole who sends personal letters with best regards and best wishes every time communists and fascists have their yearly gatherings, he openly legitimizes their actions
Fun fact:The only army of the Warsaw Pact that didn't invade was GDR's because they were worried that it may remind people German's occupation from 1939
Let this be a reminder that Communism is never good in any capacity
not only soviet army
Four other Warsaw pact armies invaded with them
You know what is the best political joke
The one that even after 19 years you laugh so hard you have to hold the iron bars
Demonstrations took place in Brno, Liberec and Prague
There were dead and injured, many people were arrested and faced brutal treatment by the police and militias
Thousands lost their jobs and were persecuted by the regime until 1989
And today, the Russian troll who pretends to be Czech president is not commemorating this at all - instead, he is meeting with the leader of the Communist party
God I will celebrate so hard when he finally kicks the bucket
> **new** communist government used police
New
Are you sure
For example Oldřich Černík was the prime minister of Czechoslovakia from 8
april 1968 to 28
January 1970
It was all much more complicated game than it is now described
Bother to support that part about legitimization of their actions with some sources
Afaik he lost his job for critique of the ocupation in 1970, which was time that did actually matter
Critique of the ocupation now is useless and cheap since it's 51 years old event
Yes, these other countries were part of invasion, but really every one here understand, that their governments were partially puppets of Soviet regime, just like Czechoslovak government which was installed after the invasion
By November 4, 1968 all not-Soviet soldiers left the country
Only Soviet army stayed
Czechoslovakia was in the eastern bloc, so basically softly ruled from Moscow
In 1968, the communism here was fading with many freedoms regained, which Soviet didn't take kindly
This invasion was to reinstate full blown communism
If you wanna know more about situation before and after, search "Prague spring" and "normalization in Czechoslovakia".
The minister of interior (police) was changed in January 1969
Oldřich Černík
It took some time before all "contra-revolutionaires" was purged
Černík publicly distanced himself from his previous support of reform
It was not enough to prevent him from being forced out as prime minister in 1970
And he was "only" prime minister, not member of the  Central Committee of the Party
The Party was a place where a real power was
Also, when I say "new" - I think people with "a new perspective" - some people could stay if they revoked their "wrong opinions" and accepted "new truth".
Read Czech newspapers and talk to Czech people
I am not going to translate it for you
He is legitimizing their actions through his own action
Guess who is he meeting today
The leader of the communist party Filip
>Yes, these other countries were part of invasion, but really every one here understand, that their governments were partially puppets of Soviet regime, just like Czechoslovak government which was installed after the invasion
hmm, this is from Prague 1968 -
Also for example drunk Polish soldier killed few people in Jičín. People hated other countries for the invasion too, not as much as Russians but certainly there wasn't understanding for them
Claiming that every other country officials were 100% puppets of Soviet Union, therefore their decision is "understandable" is highly misleading and it is said today only from good manners and also to repair relationships
It is history in the end, i hope it will never repeat and we will make friends with all our neighbour countries
My parents, my teachers, and basically everyone above 30 lived under a communist regime, and they described what was intrinsic to communism
Things like empty stores where you bought nothing except hard salami because there just wasn't anything else
Bread had to be ordered, and 3 hour long lines for ham or chicken were the standard shopping experience
The only fruit you'd ever even see (besides native species) were oranges and bananas, maybe once a year on Christmas
Your kid joked about the head of state in school

Everything is made worse quality because employment's guaranteed, so why should you even try

Did you help defeat the Nazis, but with the British
No jail
You get executed for treason
The environment is fucked because planned economies and the weather don't mix well, add´ to the fact that heavy industry is developed immensely
There used to be places where if you stood outside in a white shirt for 30 minutes the shoulders would turn grey from the smog and soot
Every building is a concrete block, which sometimes don't have the concrete panels connect, causing someones wall to just fall right off
The only people that have any peace are party members, to join simply pledge to spy on all your friends and look for any "political dissent".  If you used to go to church, you don't anymore
You try to leave, they go after you, your wife and your kids
My parent's couldn't imagine a Snickers bar
If they wore jeans in public the might get kicked out of school
This was a system so evil that a young student burnt himself alive in the capital city
There is no fair comparison between Communist Czechoslovakia and today's America
So please don't defend Communism
(That mess in Hong Kong is them btw)
They would probably stay in northern Bohemia, not go to Prague
German soldiers did participate on a small scale (capturing border posts, logistics support, liaison at the operation command)
But if you translated Cunts, you would end up with Kundy
Yes, this was more about 1969

Forgot your ideological visions of the World and read for example *Frost comes from the Kremlin*  *Mráz přichází z Kremlu* *)* by Zdeněk Mlynář to understand elementary facts of the 1968-1970 history
After 21
August 1968 the game was about minimizig impact of the catastrophe caused by idiots like Dubček was, preventing bloodshed, deportations or executions (what all had happened in Hungary)
It is necessary to admit, that even Soviet leaders preferred avoiding it
It was a game with Soviets and a radical Czechoslovak Stalinists for whom even Bilak was unacceptable "revisionist". After most of Černík's government and communist party leadership were arested, president Svoboda kicked out "leninist government" led by Alois Indra, and started negotiate directly with the Soviet leadership, went in Moscow, succeeded to force releasing Dubček and other arrested communist leaders and ministers
They all signed the Moscow Protocol and then started the uneasy complicated period which ended by "normalization" but it was actually the maximum what was possible to achieve; there were much worse alternatives than Husák and Štrougal
Despite all ideological circus, they were technocrtas focused on the economical development in conditions of the Cold War and our geopolitical situation
Such actions like Palach, riots related to hockey or demonstrations in August 1969 could help nothing
Actaully they helped Stalinists to enforce their aggressive politics
Politics is art of possible; the most dangerous people are radical idealists who prefere "ideals" to realistic compromises
Actually Adolf Hitler was also idealist believing in nationalism and "scientific" racism; by the way he din't inveted it, he only dared to force what others only wrote, the same Lenin and may other contemporary freaks
Czech newspapers even do not try to hide their hatred toward the president
Majority of people voted for him, and even the recent polls show his high popularity
it's all cool, my man
communism spun a lot of heads back then
let us take a lesson from it
>read for example Frost comes from the Kremlin Mráz přichází z Kremlu )  by Zdeněk Mlynář
Yeah, I read the book
Zdeněk Mlynář was 1968's communist himself
I'm not sure what you want to say here
Yes, Dubcek was naive if he believed Soviet Union would allow any kind of freedom to it's satellites
Majority of the people did not vote for him
Majority of the turnout
He broke most of campaign legal rules during his "no campaign", lied and took money from companies that are receiving favours now
Fuck him and his apologists
Zeman won by 152k of votes
That's hardly a majority
Stop lying
66% voters turned up
>it is silly to think they could resist the pressure of moscow if there really was a big push to do something
Romania did it as a good example
Dubček was inept as a politician
He failed to understand that Soviets fear that the whole thing will run out of control and Czechoslovakia could even leave the Warsaw Treaty
He had realistic chance to implement some sort of lasting "goulash socialism", and failed in that
Well, those who did not vote should not complain
The other claims are unfounded lies spread by our newspapers
The last sentence explains why people like you always lose in elections
Those who do not bother to vote did not show their opinion
A recent poll found that Zeman has support of [57%] people, more than other political institutions
>He had realistic chance to implement some sort of lasting "goulash socialism"
In that case he wouldn't become a leader of the Party's reform wing
They are not unfounded, but very well documented
It's like climate change, who does not want to see, does not
I will not honour stupid arguments by engaging in discussion
And your point is
How do you like Zeman meeting Filip and his communist cohort today
Or how about Zeman wiping his arse with our constitution
Zeman also met with Pirates, much more dangerous extremists
And I bet you are not constitution expert, you just read something from a yellow newspaper
And you are
I get it
You are one of those pseudo communists
Go kiss his ass
Yup, great tactic is to place nasty label on anyone who doesn't agree with you 100%. Then you will act surprised, why people do not vote as you wish
It must be because they are idiots, there's no other explanation
They did it in WW1, they did it in WW2 they'll do it now

Building low quality infrasructure and pushing countries into debt traps
You should personally see the Chinese built infrasctructure in Africa
Well, their quality is terrible even in China
Cold War was probably the best time of human history
Well, my comment was entirely based on my personal experince from my visits of Africa and China
It was definitely not based on any headlines or propaganda
Only stuff I've seen and heard right at the location
I take this into consideration and still feel the world was mostly calm
I definitely agree my experience is anecdotal
I am willing to admit the debt trap narrative might be incorrect
This is something impossible to assess for an average visitor
On the other hand, my experience in China was different
The people didn't tell me anything because of language barrier
I saw those potholed motorways and crumbling buildings with my own eyes during my trips in 2018 and 2019
As well as those in Africa
I even saw new road being built paralell to the terrible Chinese one in Ethiopia
Why are those banned
Can we please stop using reductio ad hitlerum
For example look at the population and GDP growth of Germany and France in the 1930s and Russia and Poland in the 2010s. You'll see completely opposite trends

What's the word
Earthsea
This is exactly what's wrong with modern democracy and why throughout history, from ancient Greece right up to the 20th century, voting was restricted to the wealthy
Because like it or not, the fact is that wealth is very strongly correlated with the quality of one's education
As education levels increased in less wealthy classes in recent centuries, so did their involvement in political decision-making
The mistake we've made is we've gotten ahead of ourselves and given the right to vote to everyone *before* educating everyone rather than after
And that is exactly why in Czechia, you must have a respirator/mask while leaving home and at public transportation, they can actually kick you out if you don't have one
Why don't they cover their faces with something

This is not far off the reality
I find amusing that there is 10 other examples like that on the map and somehow you are amused only about Scotland
This is not a map which shows just latitude and longitude and its borders
It is regional/cultural map of Europe
Yes sometimes it looks strange, but most of the time it makes sense and it is shown like that from a reason
In a universe where Austria-Hungary existed and pretty much all HRE Emperors since 16th century were simultaneously Kings of Hungary
Western Ukraine makes some amount of sense
Serbia doesn’t I agree
>Of course Germany is culturally closer to Romania than Denmark
No one is denying that
What point are you trying to make and why ? Quite obviously those are not hard set borders of regions with same culture, they are just very generalized regions
Estonia and Switzerland ? Iceland and Finland ? Greece and Moldova ? Northern Spain and Malta ? Crimea and Karelia ? etc etc
I dont like those kind of maps because it is always disputed, it is very inaccurate and it will only make mad pretty much everyone
On the other hand it is virtually impossible to do such map accurately without it being a complete mess and it will be heavily disputed anyway
Trans-Carpathian Ukraine was formerly part of Czechoslovakia, and culturally has more in common with Czech than it does with eastern Ukraine
Also similar to western Romania, in that there is a reasonably sized Czech minority still living there
Edit to add: There are really two Ukraines
The west is ethnic Ukrainian, Czechoslovak and Rusinian, the East is majority Russian
That’s true, yeah
Ok it makes sense then
Never been there, but Im sure this music plays there on repeat

That doesn't seem plausible from the physics perspective, considering the existence of mean gas molecule velocities (for the same reason why guns using gunpowder can't fire projectiles at arbitrary velocity and even at just several km/s, you already have to switch to [pure hydrogen] to accelerate projectiles further)

Don’t give in
You’ve got this
Not necessarily all migration
Illegal migration for sure
You can't have people without identity all over the place and feel safe
In my opinion it extremely important to handle these illegals
People with good intentions should ASK if they can stay
Treat your country same way you would treat your house
You can, it's called allowing citizens to carry guns
But you guys don't want that
I certainly hope you’re right
You can't seriously expect to solve a complex issue with a simple solution
This is literally a terrorist attack with a gun
I'm sure the terrorist acquired it legally right
Did anyone say anything about guns being as easy to buy as in the US
I'm sure an islamic extremist wouldn't be able to pass the citizenship requirement, pass the mental evaluation and get a license that checks responsible gun handling
Terrorists also usually have a criminal record of some sorts that would automatically disqualify them from owning a gun
Gun owners, at least in the Czech republic, are often better trained than the police
The police is lucky if they go to a range twice a year, gun owners are usually at a range several times per year or even several times per month
And even an idiot can pull a trigger and kill a terrorist
Yes, because guns are difficult to get
But guess what, allowing law-abiding citizens to own guns doesn't make guns easier to get for criminals or terrorists
In the Czech republic we can own and carry guns after a short license and medical evaluation and our gun crime is practically zero
A terrorist would certainly have no way to access a gun unless he stole one, which would be hard to do with guns needing to be locked in a safe unless they're on your person
I remember reading it in a news article where they interviewed a police officer (or a police chief
) where he said they go to a range on average twice a year, it was a while ago
Your average gun owner goes to a shooting range more than that because it's also a hobby and more training automatically means they are better with a gun
And it's better if two people get shot on accident than if two people get their head cut off
You can usually recover from the former but you can't recover from the latter
Well no way to access a gun legally
The black market always exists, whether guns are legal or not
This and Bataclan attack are examples of that
Not allowing mentally stable, law-abiding citizens to own guns just ensures that the only people who have guns are terrorists and criminals that acquire them illegally
>Except it would be infinitely easier to get a gun on the right market than right now
That's simply not true and there's nothing to prove that
In Brazil you cannot carry a gun and getting a license is hard and very expensive, yet Brazil has a huge gun crime problem, way bigger than even the US
The Czech republic that allows people to own and carry guns has extremely low gun crime, basically all of it committed with illegally owned guns (and even then the crime rate is very low)

it doesn't matter at all, he is buying elders slash rurals and they are going to stay loyal to him no matter what because Czech retirees care only about their welfare checks, migrants and nothing else - rurals are very similar in this regard
Prague is the last place that protests are meaningful since he's got little to no support there - people from Prague aren't going to be bribed by few hundred crowns and overlook his corruption and dismantling of institutions

We need to keep this up so that Babiš et al

I was there and it looked like half a milion
Eventhough those protests are huge, it can't cause much damage to our prime minister, or minister of justice, because they are getting support from higher places
Also to our current situation led lot of events and we pretty much caused it ourselves
*At least, we don't get beaten up by the police*

Those old farts are doing just a mess for some time
Pretty much this
Babiš won't be ousted by these demonstrations, their importance is not in getting rid of him, because that can be done only in elections, their importance is in setting boundaries for him so that he doesn't think he can get way with misuse of power
Sort of
Babiš is a bit smarter than Trump and Trump obviously isn't a former Communist
But I'd say they are similar in terms of their mentality and understanding of democracy (i.e., "I am a democrat if it suits me and my business")
Both rely mainly on dissatisfied older rural voters and both polarise the society and mobilise voters against internal and external threats
Nope, that's just not in our mentality
And violence against who
Police
Regular police officer have nothing to do with Babis
It is even worse
I heard cashier in Kaufland saying that she likes Babiš, because they raised her wage while he is in power
Some people connects current prosperity with Babiš, even though it isn’t his success and he is more like chocking economy

Exactly
I don't say that often, but I'd like to thank the police in Prague for an excellent job during the demonstration (closing traffic to enable people to leave easily etc
Right, cause the ideological inconsistency has always stopped high ranking communist officials from enriching themselves through political power in the past
He did all of that using the people that used to be in power and members of STB (our version of KGB) who were never persecuted or jailed after the velvet revolution
It’s all based on corruption, buying state businesses for fraction of their value, building an empire big enough to crush or assimilate any competitor
He is a proven STB informant and his companies are full of people tied to the former communist government
He isn’t a communist, nor are his buddies from STB, they are just cronies - oligarch wannabes - with enough power and dirt to push his agenda
He also bought huge chunk of local media using it as a club to crush his political opponents (there are recordings of him giving these instructions)

Well, I've got some studying to do
Mostly industrial regions in Czechia, which are now poorer but at the time were above average
But the regional differences were small, because communism

It has a lot to do with our history, having catholicism forced down our throats after the Battle of White Mountain and forced recatholization drove off a lot of people

Be it a church or the Soviet Union or the EU
Nope
An interesting urban legend, but absolutely no
Read on Vatican relations with Czechoslovakia between the wars
Read on Masaryk's opinions on the church
Before the WWII, the church was seen as enemy of the Republic by a lot of people
Especially after Vatican praised Mussolini and later Hitler
To be honest, during the war many church leaders showed a great courage and were on a way to regain the trust of the nation
In the years after the war, the communists made a coalition with the christian party, joining hands with Catholics and presented their own version of state religion
They paid the priests, they decided which orders to disband and which to leave
The longest serving member of communist government was Plojhar, a roman Catholic priest
Going to church getting you into trouble
So how come there were people building their political careers through the christian party itself
Through going to church getting seats in the Parliament
The persecution of certain religious figures was what it was - persecution of figures, not - as the Catholics try to sell it as - persecution of the church
Stanislav Balik Ph
D. mentions it somewhere (not sure where now) that in the late 40s and early 50s, the percentage of Christians among communist party members was higher than the percentage of Christians in the general population
And he is a christian himself, and anti-communist, so he is not very happy about it
It is almost unbelievable how many religious motives and religious songs are in early 50s CS propaganda movies
Watching them, one can believe he is watching something made by Ned Flanders
Not to mention liberal/conservative, which is a whole different scale
> I see no reason for not bringing it back
Maybe because schools are for teaching, and not for brainwashing
I still find on weird that in the USA it's the catholics who are the progressive minority
No, surely not the underground groups
Although later, the stopped caring
Nice example are the mormons
As long as they were operated from USA, it was underground and dangerous
When they became just CS and pretty much independent, the state stopped watching them
Problem is we humans will never understand God or how he thinks
Why is there like hundreds of religions
What about predetermination
Many popes brought their elections does this null their decision since they weren't voted in best intent of Christianity
What about some saint that absolutely shouldn't be saints
If God exist that is completely different maybe he does or maybe he doesn't. But question about religion and God goes back into history my personal favorite is “Live a good life
If there are gods and they are just, then they will not care how devout you have been, but will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by
If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want to worship them
If there are no gods, then you will be gone, but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the memories of your loved ones

How do you distinguish between different curse words though
Some (if not all) languages have multiple common curse words with different literal meanings and different usages
You're definitely not matching them on literal meaning and it seems the usage is also different between different countries
So how did you choose the words
Most of central/eastern Europe united by kurva
One word to rule them all, one word to find them, one word to bring them all, and in the darkness bind them
Bold of you to include Turkey
The good old kurva belt, also known as V4
That looks so wrong with the space
LOL
Bazmek/bazmeg is a totally innocent slang word in Czech
Good to know that it comes from Hungarian and what it means
I can't agree, I absolutely use "kurva" as a general swearword equivalent to "fuck" and rarely use it in relation to a person
In Czech, Belgrade (Bělehlad) means "White Castle"
This is just blatantly incorrect
I heard they wanted to use Serbian Nigger instead of White City in the original version, but they were like naaaah
Just in case anyone is interested, [this is the spot on Google maps
Brno is an architectural mix
Most of its renaissance and medieval old town was torn down in the 19th century to make room for modern buildings and this progress continued later, so you often see Functionalist buildings in the middle of old houses
It's definitely not as glorious as what Prague has to offer, but Brno has its charms and gems
A Canadian guy who has lived here for 50 years once told me that cities are either extroverted, showing of their monuments (like Prague), or introverted, where you have to find the interesting things yourself, but then it's worth it
Brno is definitely introverted
Haha, you guys are in for a surprise

Tss, they don't even have Metro
This is sadly the best best that Brno has to offer, it pales in comparison with Prague in pretty much everything

I also found a side by side comparison of how the building currently looks vs
how it looked in the 19th century, it's from a website of a project that was restoring the facade
Unfortunately that's the only useful info the website gave
It's funny how people from Prague keep saying how they don't care about Brno (as the overused joke goes: "You know what Praguers say about Brno
Absolutely nothing
"), yet every time Brno is mentioned in national news or reddit or elsewhere, the discussion is always full of Praguers making fun of Brno - and it's usually clear that the last time they were there was at least 20 years ago (when it indeed was much more shitty), if at all
And just to be clear - yes, this is generalizing, not everyone is like this

I wonder what you would say if the government of the Czech Republic would suddenly say it decided to withdraw the name in the same manner as it announced it will submit the name
Cannot stop progress
I was living there for 4 years like 5 years ago, so I know the city well
And it's just boring small town
Why though
It's english way of saying Česko
If you look at name of Czech Republic in dozen of other languages, It's usually very close to Czechia
It's an term to be used in english not czech
Not OP, but I dislike [how it sounds]
Well Czechia became the official short form because before we only had the long form (Czech Republic) which was sometimes awkwardly shortened to "Czech" which didn't make sense
Personally it sounds a little too close to "Чехия" which is the Russian name for Czech Republic, and this brings up rather unfortunate associations
I'm not aware why others don't like it as much
Also it gets annoying when people think we were "renamed", we weren't, only now we added a short form
It also doesn't help with the whole Chechnya confusion thing we got a while back
I don't know why we didn't just use "Czesko" instead of Czechia to resemble the czech short form
It's only as boring as you make it yourself
But the possibilities are almost endless
Yes, it doesn't have the big touristic attractions like Prague (and thus streets overcrowded with tourists), but other than that
And I always laugh at the "small town" - have you ever been in a "small town"? A few tens of thousands inhabitants
Yes, Prague is really big, but it's a "small town" compared to let's say Paris
Edit: But I didn't want to argue about which city is better, bigger (there's no argument there, obviously) or less boring
It's really up to everyone what suits them
If you are an American tourist visiting Europe, Prague is definitely where you want to go in 99% cases (but even then there are people who would prefer the less touristy spots)
I was merely reacting to your original statement which amazingly contradicts itself ('overcrowded' and 'village')
There is one sense in which I consider Brno a village though - and that it is that everyone seems to know each other
And if they don't, they can always find at least one mutual friend
Hold on though, there is no X pronounciation in Czechia no
Yep it's pronounced with [k] which I'm not fond of
Ah, thanks for catching that

Sadly, he was at least a competent epidemiologist and a good health minister to have in a pandemic
I do not think his replacement will be as good
Sad thing is that he was actually doing something even tho he broke his own rules
I thought he was still hanging around, like the last fly of summer
I am going to get downvoted into oblivion for this but here I go
We should have let it slide
He’s the best person we currently have, being a valid expert, not a politician
He only took the post because he was needed, knowing it would be a shitshow
His way of announcing more strict restrictions and kindly asking people to abide by them, explaining why are they neccessary, was stellar in my opinion
He got a lot of hate for handling the mess we all helped to create
I am pissed off with the tabloids blowing it out of proportion and printing headlines like “made us go home from work and meanwhile
” as if he was meeting there with Faltýnek to down a couple beers
Yes, he shouldn’t have accepted Faktýnek’s invitation to come
I haven’t been keeping up with the news so I don’t know if their excuses are valid
But for fuck’s sake, we are the worst at covid right now and switching a health minister again, especially one who was avoiding all the real mistakes (communicating in a way that made people pissed and disobedient) is so infuriatingly dumb
It all feels like we’re a nation of snickering kids
Happy that the mean man in charge of fixing our mess made a mistake and had to go away
They're due to a public drinking ban that was issued by him as a measure against covid
That's a great example of Czech humor for you

Imo draught radegast is the definition how lager beer should taste
Some say it’s too bitter, I say that’s what home taste like
Well it's said our beer is the best
No, it's not
I don't know how long it's been since you visited, but Pilsner can rarely be seen below 40 CZK (1
50 €)
Especially in Prague
If you're talking about bottled beer, it still isn't true for Pilsner, but you can buy a cheap beer in a supermarket for that
Czech guy here
Pilsner Urquell is definitely not 35 euro cents here
It goes from around 0
8-1 euro in stores and up to 2 euros in restaurants
Other pilsner-style beers can be found for the price you mentioned but unless it is a decent beer on sale, it is usually trash
I was talking about draught beer
In the second part I said even if you were talking about bottled, Pilsner is more than 35 c. Which it is
29 CZK is over 1 €.
I understand the negativity toward black (gypsies) and Muslim people here, good old xenophobic Czechia
But I'm really surprised by the negativity towards both Vietnamese and Jewish people
Vietnamese people are part of our society for decades, they are usually known as hard working and pretty much everyone is in regular contact with them in their shops
I know many mixed couples and everyone here is fine with them
And Jewish people are pretty much not known here
People usually only know them from some jokes
I don't understand that statistic at all, they aren't a much visible part of out society here, so there's no reason to hate on them imo
Oh yeah, Czech republic for the win <3
LOL and some of us still don't want to admit we're still mentally in Eastern Europe
Typical Czechs
This is quite inaccurate
Where is 0-10% section
I don't believe that 1-2 of 10 czechs would feel comfortable having their child in relationship with muslim
Damn, my country is really shitty
Source: Am Czech
The asian and jewish part is what surprises me
I get that muslims are not very popular in here, but the asian community here is pretty big and pretty much liked by everyone except a few bitter old ppl and outright nazis
Anti-semitism was also never a problem here
So WTF
Czechoslovakia stands strong
Yes, that seems about right
Looking through the whole survey, especially striking is that Czechs are apparently significantly below average when it comes to being comfortable with having an atheist coworker - 80% EU average (Comfortable or moderately comfortable), 69% Czech
Yeah, big surprise
We're racist
I do care about ethnicity
I want my grandkids to look like me and my ancestors, not someone from Egypt
Why would that make any difference
TRIGGERED
That's pretty racist dude
When we Czechs surely are at least low level racist, jumping to racism because girls were cold to you in bar is hilarious in its megalomania
There was ever an image of us being a mecca of rationality
But yeah, we're irreligous which also causes us to be fairly liberal in the matters of LGBT, abortions or light drugs
But in other things, we're indeed a conservative society (in European standards)
I think that a lot of the dislike of muslims comes from their culture, not terrorism
Vietnamese people are in a bit of a wierd situation here, some Czechs are pretty xenophobic
Also, I assume most asked imagined a Roma person under "black person", but that's just a guess
Fuck Okamura, though
At least they didn't ask about the Roma
>We need to change it
No, we don't.
Czech media help this a lot
Most people watch and read shit like televizní noviny, novinky
cz, parlamentní listy
Even though there are almost no muslims/blacks/jews in the country it still shapes the views of people against them
30% of the population will vote for ANO apparently so there is plenty ignorant and stupid people in our country
No surprise
Yes we are, look at the map and the abundant comfortable feeling around Jews
Heh, too true
I don't know if [denormal numbers] would suffice
Oh, your searing wit left me speechles
Your "experience" is that you got cold treatment from girls in club
Saying that it has *any* correlation with the data is just narcistic
There are hundreds of guys being rebuffed by girls right this second
Sharing this experience
How many of them are jumping to blame  local ethnic/racial/religious preferences instead of their undesirable character ,low attractivnes or just plain lack of damn interest
But that is indeed the primary reason why muslims are not liked
I mean lot of Middle Eastern muslims look not that different from Spanish, Italian or Greek people and those are not disliked in the Czech republic
So it's not the 'Arab' look that is the problem
Should be still there
But in all honesty it took me years before I realized he's actually half black
My mind always perceived him as Czech even though visually kinda tanned
Speaks for power of integration probably :D
Disliked is IMHO a too strong word
I would rather say a big part of Czechs feel uncomfortable around them
It's largely the fear of unknown, but you're right that Czechs are in a way tribalistic, meaning that they are worried about everyone who doesn't fit in what is 'normal' in the Czech republic
Other Europeans are nowadays considered 'normal' in the Czech republic
White immigrants from the Anglo-word as well
But Asians and blacks are unusual and thus suspicious
Defensive nationalism is very deeply rooted here, it was for centuries our passive-aggressive mechanism on how to resist Germanization
We wouldn't exist as a nation if we weren't like this and thus these knee-jerk reactions are strongly rooted in our mentality
But at the same time, it tends to be a passive, non-personal kind of reaction, i.e. people feel uncomfortable, but largely don't ventilate it on specific Asian/Black people
Many people are also perfectly fine with having this schizophrenic view that foreigners/immigrants in general are dangerous, but at the same time the few foreigners that they know personally are ok
When you point this out to them, they say something like "yeah, but this particular guy/girl doesn't count, he/she is not like them, he/she is an okay person".
For the internet, this guy was something more than just an ordinary celebrity
He was one of the most iconic people on the internet, and reddit is an internet site
He was from Iceland and Iceland is in Europe
Combination of these two make it stand out in /r/europe, compared to other european celebrities, which are not so big on the internet
Pretty sure people call those chairs
It's funny when you compare that to Czechia, whose core's borders barely changed over the past thousand years
I guess we're a never-ending soap opera
(which doesn't mean the Poles shouldn't return Kladsko to us
Gib clay
Procure 1000 years of history first
Love how you can always tell where the Czech borders are on these maps
That dot is close to, but not quite the Vaglaskógur so what is it
And still there's no trace of Hallormsstaðaskógur
Czech Republic used to be more green
Here we started making face masks
Gonna donate some to the hospitals and stores probably
And just like that, Brexit does not look that absurd anymore
if it is going to shutdown shame of our country like Ulozto,hellshare and similar services I am fine with it
Why can't the EU generate a tech corporation like Google, Apple, Uber, Amazon
is the question the EP should ask themselves instead of trying to pass this nonsense
Aw fuck, I can't believe they've done this
Do I have to pay a tax now
Seriously, who the fuck in their right mind thinks this is a good idea
Fucking traitors
No more shitty memes
Thank you Kanye, very cool
Czech Republic here, also my vote goes to the pirate party,  and many friends and acquaintances also will vote for them
Raw protocols are [here]
[votewatch
eu] makes it more palatable
(You need to be registered
However, I don't know about any OLAP (or better generally Business Intelligence) website where a citizen could easily analyze what MEPs resp
the whole EU does w.r.t. themself
Since it's missing, it would 1,09 for Czechia
Data taken from
**Czechia** is colored grey for no data
You can find on the internet that we have **0
6** homicide rate
Oh we're *no data*, whoa, I was scared for a second
I'm assuming police use of lethal force and trespassing are not accounted for as murder
We would then need to use white fonts on the US map
"No data" color should not be that close to the max rate
That includes attempted murders too, however
So the actual number of people who died is lower
Turkey is almost completely in Asia Minor, whereas 77% of Russian population lives in Europe
In case of Turkey it's perhaps something like 13% of the population
Hence such stats as homicides which are describing the population should be attributed to the continents where the overwhelming portion of the population lives, at least until you can get a better breakdown of the data
Ah, strange that datas differ in that
Maybe your source does count attempts to murder too
And we can actually carry guns here
>crimes committed with firearms are more deadly than those committed with knives
Uh, no, not really
People understimate how deadly knives are
You just need to get a bit closer but once you are within reach
There are 3-4 people injured by guns for every killed one on average
Arent most murders gang related though
Im no sure guns would change that much
They would still just kill each other
I mean, carrying knives is also banned and they just keep happily stabbing each other
You'd need the homicide stats of the European side for that
Then again, give how many ILLEGAL guns there are in Serbia
And most of them are former military guns too
My Serbian friends family has a bunch of assault rifles hidden somewhere
It really doesnt
You just need to stab randomly
You also need to hit a critical area with a gun
Otherwise the victim bleeds out in both cases
That takes time and they can be saved
Just consider the size of ah average knife and of the average bullet
Im pretty sure a lot of gun shot wounds gets unreported
On the other hand, there is a lot of ways you can get injured by a knife that doesnt involve violence
I know a guy who cut off two of his fingers because he wasnt careful
Also, most of those US gun deaths are suicides, the sad fact is that a suicide very likely to succeed if you use a gun
But we were talking about murders
Its not really easier to kill one person with a gun
If you want to do it at range, you need practice
At very close range, it doesnt really matter
Of course, killing a lot of people with a gun is easier but, if I understand it correctly, most murders in the UK are actually just one or two victims, right
On top of that, knives are pretty much silent
Shoot a gun and everyone within miles knows about it
The *is* data for the grey countries
No idea why it's missing from the map
Except youre not just pulling the trigger, not if you want to hit
Unless its point-blank range
Ajd even then, stabbing is easy
Have you actually ever shot a pistol
If you shoot or stab someone by accident, youve done something very, very wrong
If hey both pull knives, chances are they both bleed to death before any help comes, unless one of them is much more skilled
I guess it will be the same for guns, except the faster guy has a better chances of surviving
We have a says here: In a knife fight, the lose dies on the pavement, the winner dies in the ambulance
Expansion depends heavily on the type of gun
Pistol rounds are mostly too slow to really cause hydrostatic shock
You need fast rifle rounds for that
Im sure knife injuries are also underreported but its much easier to explain a cut by saying it was an accident than doing the same for a gun shot
Especially im Europe
Yeah, accidental shootings are rare, here, they mostly involve hunting accidents because old hunters didnt have to know much about shooting to get a licence during the commie era and nobody could justify taking their licences away
6:1 is actually better than what they generally show in stats
But as I said, people tend to underestimate deadly knives can be
Bleeding is very dangerous and its not that hard to cut a major blood vessel with a long slash
Bataclan could have been done with knives really
They just blocked off the escape routes and, because the police didnt do anything, they had a very very long time to just walk around and kill everyone
The Westminster guys had what
5-10 minutes before the police arrived and killed them
They still killed 10+ people and injured dozens
>A surgeon in the UK at a London said that gunshot wounds are at least twice as deadly as knife wounds and more difficult to repair
I think he knows what he’s talking about
Yeah, that sounds about right
But people seem to think guns are somehow 100x more deadly
Both depend heavily on hit placement
> Shooting somebody is also less risky than stabbing somebody especially in gang attacks as you can fire at somebody from a safe distance away
Actually hitting someone from a safe distance requires practice, especially under stress
I saw some statistics from the US and US policemen basically hit 1 in 5 shots at ranges above some 7 meters
And although police training with firearms generally isnt that great, theyre still trained people
> Stabbing somebody requires you getting up close
Yeah, and thats all you really need along with some physical strength
In effect, both stabbing and shooting someone at point-blank range are trivially easy
Lets hope there wont be more attacks like that
And do whatever you guys want with your country
Just dont force mine to do it too
I dont think we are as similar as many people think
If you exclude the period of Czechoslovakia, then you will notice that both countries had a very different history
But yes, modern age inventions like newspapers, radio,TV or internet has bring us closer together since our language is so similar
My theory with Euro is simple, discourse about currency is a an echo chamber which is very hard to turn in opposite direction once it is set
It wasnt so controversial topic lets say 15+ years back
All you need is few eurosceptic leading figures which will influence public discourse towards negative aspects of Euro
Average person who had no opinion about Euro will of course hear some of this rhetoric some way or another
And the next time when that person will have conversation with someone else about Euro, he will present what he have heard and the next person will do the same
Once someone has presented his opinion publicly it is very hard to convince that person otherwise, people dont like to look like fools
I am affraid it will be practicaly impossible to turn opinion about Euro at this point
This echochamber mentality goes both ways and it is visible in many issues
It's the tourists who get scammed so the locals don't care
Yeah, for example we Czechs intentionally weaken our currency so Its better for export, And we export majority of products to Germany
Hello there, taky Čech
A souhlas
Did we get the Czech Corridor, for a bit easier access to the sea
Less of Africa, more Europe
The more I learn about Estonia, the more I like it
One of the reasons I can think of is that some people might cut several trees down and sell them for profit
Even a small fee like this probably discourages them
r/mapswithoutprague
Wheres Prague
Where is Prague
If any city of Central Europe should be depicted in this LotR-style map, it should be Prague
Prague was the capital of the Holy Roman Empire, Europe's largest and most powerful medieval empire
Also, the Sudetes look nothing like that
I really like it and would love to see a few minor tweaks
It's beautiful and all, but the omission of Prague is kinda tough to swallow :D
Prague is apparently a mountainhome
Maybe it is hidden underground with its grand forges, where we search for the heart of the mountains
wow this is much better
Oh it's perfect
Thank you
^_^ Made my day
The Sudetes look great as well
No, but it was the capital for the longest period of time out of all the capitals
It was also considered the golden age of the HRE
/r/MapsWthoutCZ ?
They do this all the time
Last year they said that Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968 was "help"
Alternative facts
Why has the global version of christmas has to be that lousy Santa Claus when this exists
Wait until this guy hears about slovakian easter traditions
What the hell happened here
I bet they didn't even use their blinker to indicate they're turning downwards
Don't people get lost in a place like this
Because people like you keep applying American Left and American Right to Middle/Eastern European countries
Is it just my app that I see stars instead of your comment
The thing is "will they get covered by polish health insurance
Or will they have to pay the procedure out of their own pocket
Planned out-of-country health procedures are not covered by EHIC in most cases and emergency ones might not be covered if it's illegal in Poland
What I mean is that you can't apply American Left and Right to Middle/Eastern European countries
Ah, I was worried Relay was censoring swearing (in polish
Everyone who can think is Far Right by the American standard
I would not say far right, just a fucking moron
I am very surprised
I am genuinenly surprised how low is our number
Easy winter has to be the reason
What
Czech Republic is second
I'd say I am surprised how high Slovakia is, but I'm not really
The data is from 2016 and I am pretty sure it got worse
už vím jak se Karel Gott cítil když přebíral Slavíka číslo 46
Poster only cites Iceland from 2016 data
Every other country is from 2018 data
You're right, I still think the data for Czech Republic is wrong as my experience with people living outside of Prague is, that they are barely able to pay bills and have any money to spare
That is some strong ABBA vibes
Fuck nazis but like fuck stalin too
Didn’t they also bomb Khreschatyk while retreating from Germans with mines hidden in homes along the road
Holy crap, this just kept on giving
Magnificient
You could say uber mench
Politically insignificant
One of the main concerns in Czech media during coronavirus outbreak was the debate whether we will be allowed to visit you in summer
The worst thing about this is that Nokia was the last big European "tech company". With it, Europe ceded its relevance in this area to America and China
Such a missed opportunity for Europe, sigh
Imagine Nokia reacted correctly and in 2008/2009 came with its own good mobile OS and started releasing "modern" capacitative touchscreen smartphones
Android would have had a pretty hard time starting as in 2009, it was still pretty shitty (even though in many ways ahead of iOS)
Nokia brand was still very powerful, so had it played its cards right, we'd have three competing operating systems and large tech companies today instead of just Plague (Apple) and Pestilence (Google)
But consumer tech is critical for your image is a global technology leader
Europe now relies on two American mobile operating systems and mostly Chinese-made hardware, when it could have had both natively
Worse, it is likely that new consumer technology will be built on the existing platforms (think VR/AR, AI), and Europe again will play sidekick here
Even worse, the US tech companies are so big nowadays that they can easily gobble up startups and emerging competitors in Europe (and usually ruin them after looting their tech)
The Chinese don't bother with buying them and steal their tech right away
It's shameful
It is, but only for the enthusiasts
For the average consumer, not so much
They have two choices now: Google spyware or overpriced Apple toys
Apple doesn't need to win in sales; it still [takes about 90% of profits in the smartphone market] Nokia could have done the same: release a small number of high-end flagships to grab profits and a few entry-level phones for the masses (at the time when Android on low-end phones was utter shit, people would have flocked to buy Nokia hardware)
Build up the ecosystems so that users are encouraged not to switch and you're all set
So easily, we could have had a situation where Apple had 15-20%, Nokia another ~20% with the rest being Android
Apple's home territory would be the US, Nokia would be leader in Europe and Android would dominate in developing countries
Nokia
It actually had promising candidates, but did not give them enough support at the right time
Interesting, I thought you operated from Minas Morgul
I... I honestly always thought they just built it in dark dirty colors lol
It'll take some getting used to, but after what happened in Brazil this week, I'm just glad to see we're expending time and effort to maintain our historical institutions
*its
Did it look this uniform originally
Before the restoration, you can see some elements of the facade are darker than others, such as the columns and cornices
I always thought those were made darker deliberately to make them stand out
Now the building looks very flat, all the detail just blends in
Well the museum is closed for something like 8 years now
but they were renovatig inside most of that time
Sorry for stealing all your water to wash our museum
Our bad
[yup]
Around 2:00
Sounds like something invented by a beautician
Commie urban planners had the wonderful idea to run the highway just in front of it, so no luck in this case
But that can be used by both sides, and yet the positive side keeps winning
No reason to be so negative all the time :)
I  will probably get hated for this but that city feels like its much better on pictures and pretty boring and sort of fake or empty in person
I live in Prague though so I might be biased
Even free kapusta is expensive kapusta >:(
(but good job, I hate wasting food too)
Polish kapusta is like slovak kapusta (i.e. zelí, cabbage)
So that's nice
It's not the Czech kapusta (kale), which can go burn in hell
Cool
But what does it mean
Well, now you've awaken my inner Hussite
Roll out the wagons and flails, boys
Greece is in need of some religious reform

Oooh, that divide, already wanted to call dipps on danube
Not kidding, they made their own version a while back
Sächsisch odar nix
This is like something from bad lip reading youtube channel :D
this is why we cannot solve stuff, because of small-minded people liek you
Ah, I remember hearing about the myth in the Seal Museum in Iceland
Look at how completely dominant EU imports and exports to the EU are in our trade
Now consider there are idiots in this country who would want a Czech-out
Anyway, technically this is a holiday celebrating Czechoslovakia, so greetings to our pals under the Tatras
Please make it a national holiday too ;-)
BTW, our fertility rate is 1,63 (year 2016)
Eurostat seems to use outdated info
Happy Indipendence Day to us all
Just a note, October 28th 1918 is the date Czechoslovak Republic got independent after the breakup of Austia-Hungary
The official day the modern Czech Republic got independent from Czechoslovak Federation Republic is January 1st 1993
I am Czech and I am honestly triggered by this exclusion of Slovakia
From A-H.
The dissolution of Czechoslovakia is not celebrated in the Czech Republic as a "real" Independence day and since it's on January 1 everyone is too hungover to think about it anyway
This particular one is the independence from A-H.
Independence "from" Slovakia is not celebrated at all
Maybe in Slovakia
Děkujeme
How much would change
In numbers if possible please
But yeah, czexit is a dumb idea
Love you guys too
I actually have a proposal
Some idiots in the newly elected parliament want to make a law about constitutional referendum
It is speculated that should it happen, sooner or later there will be a referendum about leaving the EU
we have to beat them to it with a referendum about the west of the country joining Bavaria
Would it be cool with you
It wouldn't be fair against other countries :-P
> Awesome that it falls on a Saturday
Is it
If it was Friday or any other day during the work week, most people wouldnt have to go to work, schools would be closed, all that stuff
I'm going to celebrate it by nursing my hangover from yesterday and not going outside today
Czechs have almost no Christian holidays (discounting Christmas, we would have none), so we can have more "national" ones
It all boils down to the same thing in the end
Well it depends on what exact time period you mean
The Habsburgs got in the Czech throne in 1526, so they were ruling over us for a very long time - and so naturelly it wasn't the same throughout all the centuries
There were times of really hard religious, cultural and language opression, when the Czech population was forcibly re-catholized and germanized, when the Czech language was largely pushed to the periphery of the society, when only the low educated peasents spoke it, but then there were also times when more enlightened rulers were on the throne
We keep our population more or less stable for over a century now, around 10-11 mio (with help of some wars, genocides and similar joyful pasttimes)
Demographic projection for year 2050 forecasts our population, you can guess, at 10
5 mio
Basically Slovaks wanted independence cause they felt like "the lesser one" in our relationship
I think rightfully so too
Long tradition in coal related industry and nuclear energy
It will increase but majority of the population is still in favour of the nuclear power plants
Thanks
Yes it is
1st of January is officially the day of the reestablishment of the separate Czech state
So it's *technically* a holiday
> Also WTF, wikipedia, why does it correspond to "1, 2, 3, 4, ..." in other languages
Lol, really what the actual fuck
Odcházíme
I never understood why this is so controversial in Slovakia
Do people really think it was not a great time for Slovakia as well
We got rid of the Habsburg rule which was quirky, but not entirely bad
Slovakia was far worse off under Hungary (in terms of development, support for the national culture and language, etc
Getting a common state with the Czechs was a win-win situation, even if it didn't fulfil all the hopes people had
They are planning on cutting public holidays IIRC, and besides, you have the 1st of November as a national holiday while Czechs do not
So as long as Slovakia continues to have christian holidays as state holidays, there is no real reason to add any more
Look at Britain; they actually trade more with the rest of the world than with the EU (although the EU as a whole is their single biggest trading partner), they're 6 times bigger than Czechia in terms of population and like million times in economy, and still the Brexit negotiations have been a fiasco so far
It seems that while the EU is securing new trade deals left, right and centre, Britain will be left alone without any free trade agreements with anyone, and completely at the mercy of Brussels
Now if Britain, with its centuries of history as a global trading power is in such a mess, what do people think would happen in Czechia
We are absolutely dependent economically on complete free trade with Germany, allowing for vertical integration between German and Czech businesses
If tarrifs suddenly returned, this would collapse like a house of cards
Western investments would leave for Poland and Slovakia and our position would be that of beggars asking the EU for mercy and access to its common market -- for which we'd have to pay like the other non-members, instead of getting EU funding for infrastructure and development projects
Without EU co-funding the pace of development would grind to a halt and the public budgets would freefall into debt if we still wanted to build anything here
There are literally thousands of ways Czech-out would completely crush us, and this needs to be explained in simple terms to the voters before they get totally brainwashed by the Russian age-- err, I mean "Czech patriots".
Czexit, meaning simply leaving EU, won't work for us very well
We are very dependant on trade with other countries in EU and if that stopped, we would become a 3rd world country
Anyway, I'm for czexit IF we can negotiate some trade deals
I would be voting for having a trade deal with EU or even some countries if that means having less bureaucracy, because I honestly think that's a bit too much right now
The Treaty of Lisbon basically transferred power from us to EU and I don't like that
If we could manage this while leaving EU, it would be best solution
Of course that won't happen with current political situation, either we leave EU completely (Okamura's referendum), or we stay as we are, and from those two options, I think staying in EU is much better
I don't know where to even begin
There has been no significant Muslim immigration into the Czech Republic, despite it being a member of the EU since 2004 and the Schengen Area since 2007
Our asylum/immigration laws are tough and there is no sign that people from Arab/Muslim countries are in any way interested in immigrating here
Most migrants in Czechia are EU nationals (Slovaks, Poles, Romanians etc
) followed by the Ukrainians, Vietnamese and Russians
Muslims are a negligible minority of migrants
So what the heck are you even talking about
It's not as if membership in the EU entails automatic subscription to ideological multiculturalism or whatever
This is not a binary problem: stay in the EU and become Eurabia or Leave, build the new Iron Curtain on the borders and be poor but Muslim-free
I am calling these people "idiots" because some of the most prominent ones are saying things like "we should get the hell out of the EU even if it means we'll be 30% poorer". Well, first, it would be like 70% poorer, and second, the guys saying this are millionaire businessmen/career politicians who certainly won't be the ones feeling the poverty
They're fucking imbeciles whose demagoguery could cause the greatest economic and geopolitical disaster this country has experienced since 1989
Czech fertility rate was 1
65 already in year 1937, and it was even uder 1
0 in year 1917 (exactly one century ago, hehe)
We are used to wild fluctuation of our fertility, up and down
However, we keep our total population around 1O-11 mio for over 100 years already
We will be good in future too, no worries, demographic projections for year 2050 show our population at 10,5 mio
I don't think many Czechs care about European population, if it doesn't concern us directly, we usually ignore it :-D or we argue about it over a beer, but that's usually it
Hmm no, it slowly grows since year 2000
In baby steps
I hope we get towards 1,75-1,8 soon
Yea boiii
Dont call them, I still live on the right side of the border now
I even forgot it was today until I saw it as #1 on the front page
It's even #2 on r/all currently, WTF
It will fall once the strong population groups move beyond fertile age
Here come dat boii
Hmmm
So we would start off with a bloody riot over whose beer is better
Best beer in the world, And all those sausages
Let the new empire rise
I only realized it when I walked up to Tesco and the automatic doors did not open :(.
That makes at least two of us :) It probably got a bit more upvote action in light of the whole Catalonia thing thats going on
Good Friday isn't a holiday, St
Wenceslas day is the same day as Czech Statehood day
So there are two Christian holidays, arguably three even if Jan Hus day has more of a historical than christian impact
Even if I'm not sure if Cyril and Metodej are *that* Chrstian of a holiday
Good Friday is pretty new
It's been a holiday for like two years
And Easter Monday is not much a Chritian holiday, the important stuff happens before during Easter
Well you mean like right before 1918
Because at that point, it was already beyond repair
In the 20th century, the A-H empire was an dysfunctional, unreformable, bureacratic entity, unable to come up with a sustainble solution for their minorities
Czech elites held a frustration for a long time - basically ever since Hungarians managed to get a better status within the empire, but when we wanted the same thing, we were told to fuck off despite the fact that Bohemia and Moravia were (at that point) among the most developed and industrious areas in the empire
Thus in the 20th century, the Czech elites simply came to the conlusion that there's no way that we will get a fair treatment within the empire and that we are better off on your own
if you want details it is better to read something on the topic
Like wiki
Well, your comment implies that it is indeed celebrated in Slovakia when noone really thinks of New Years like that
But saying it's *technically* celebrated isn't a falsehood, otherwise we'd all have to go to work
Or does ANYONE really celebrate 5th of July by dressing up like Cyril/Method and the like
> You celebrate dissolution of Czechoslovakia on New Year's day
Do you know anyone who does
The big firework is meant to celebrate it, ever since it was moved from midnight to 6 pm
-Julius Caesar
It would be interesting to know how many people in Czechia and Slovakia have mixed ancestry (parents or grandparents from both countries)
I suspect lots and lots of people
My favourite: šrajtofle - Geldbörse
It comes from "Schreibtafel", a small writing table that was used by shop/pub-owners to write down debts
What exactly was different
Hungarians got an equal status and we didn't, that's just a fact
> is not celebrated in the Czech Republic
At least I got the feeling
Mea culpa
> Dressing up isn't part of that holiday

Masaryk himself was Czech
His wife was American
Plus we got the akward backward number telling 26 = 6 and 20, which I personally find slightly unpleasant

how about mitfára /copilot/? :)
It might have been an unthinkable idea for most, because the Austrian empire was something that lasted for centuries and there was also a history of Czech revolts that ended really badly, so it's hardly strange that people were not keen on repeating that, but that doesn't mean that most Czechs didn't want an independent state, it just means that they didn't think it was a realistic thing
If it was something imposed on Czechs by a few men in exile as you say, the new state would never have the chance to survive
Instead,  it quickly gained support of the Czech people and the first republic was a relatively sucessful democratic country until 1938
If it didn't have the support of people, it would crumble much sooner
He was from Slovácko so his ethnicity was a bit of a mix
time for some appfel struddel, recht
Yeah, well, obviously it was the Czechs and Slovaks that accepted the idea of a Czechoslovak state
I realize that the German and Hungarian minorities living Czechoslovakia were less excited about it, but they had more rights and freedoms ensured than what Czechs and Slovaks had in A-H for most of its history
And I get that you might belong to the small minority of people who are still big fans of the A-H monarchy and who see Masaryk's declaration as something full of demagogy and hysteria, but the vast majority of Czechs are glad that we have our own country and thus we're proud and grateful for Masaryk's contribution to the formation of Czechoslovakia
Germans and Hungarians already had their own German and Hungarian-speaking countries
If they didn't like living as minorities in Czechoslovakia with full rights and freedoms (and as I said, that was more than what Czechs and Slovaks had in A-H empire), they were free to move to Germany, Austria or Hungary
Czechs and Slovaks had no other country to move to
There was just Czechoslovakia for us
We earned the right to have our own country
The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was copying the historic borders of the kingdom of Bohemia
Masaryk and others simply seized the opportunity and did something that Czechs didn't for a long time - they stood up for our nation and decided that they don't want to rely on some other, foreign government to be so kind and grant us autonomy and equal status
They took the necessary steps to build the state in a viable form and even though we took big hits in the 20th century, we are still here - as an independent nation, in charge of our own destiny - thanks to Masaryk
International law and principles were and still are applied selectively quite often
Sometimes governments just need to do what has to be done in order to secure the future of their country
Don't tell me that you beloved A-H empire was never shitting on international principles and that they were never acting hypocritical
It's something that is quite normal
Countries follow their interests and very often it's in everyone's interests that all actors follow international law and principles, but sometimes there are extraordinary circumstances, such as when you try to establish a new country - and in that situation, you mostly have to break some rules
Masaryk simply couldn't give Germans living in Czechoslovakia the right for self-determination, because if he did, Czechoslovakia would be hugely weakened by the loss of Sudetenland and we couldn't possibly afford that
So he did what he had to do
Just like the overwhelming majority of political leaders everywhere in the world
> The thing is, even without Masaryk, we would be autonomous or independent today
And possibly minus WW2, minus Aussiedlung, minus communism,...
Perhaps, perhaps not
We can of course play 'what if', but the reality is that we don't know what would happen
It's certain though that Germany would still be in economic shit post-WW1 and so Hitler would probably get in power anyway
Austrian political class might jump on that Nazi train just as easily as they did in the non-alternative history
The same goes for Sudetengermans
There is simply no guarantee that we would be in any way treated better than we were in Protektorat
There is also no guarantee that we would not end up behind the Curtain
But you can't possibly blame any of these 20th century events on Masaryk
What Masaryk did was that he managed to get international recognition for the state and that was hugely important
It was something that we could return to post-WW2
And we exist in the form until today, we have independence and thus the ability to make our own decisions - obviously we are restrained in that by the geographic, economic and political circumstances that we find ourselves in, but it's still better than having no formal authority and having to rely on someone else that they will respect our rights
I have a feeling this graph is trying to communicate that the lower the number of children in the classroom the better
There have been several studies proving that too small classes are as ineffective as large ones, mainly for the reason that they required more interaction from all students which is uncomfortable for shy/introverted students and may cause anxiety
Small class isn't a win
Several studies proved that small classes cause depression and anxiety for shy and introverted kids as they require substantialy larger amount of interaction from each individual student

No, our cells can not reproduce till infinity because of [Hayflick limit]
Between 5-12, or so your brain loses the ability to rewire and regenerate
That won't hurt you directly, but the ability to recover from brain damage is greatly reduced
This is probably necessary for the brain to mature
By puberty, your thymus atrophies
Your body will have trouble dealing with pathogens it didn't encounter before then
Nobody really knows why, but it has been succesfully reversed in animal experiments
(mostly people of European descent) Around 25-40 years, your bones reach their maximum weight and slowly start disintegrating and the minerals start accumulating in other tissues instead
Statistics show correlation with dairy consumption, but that may be a coincidence, it actually seems to have something to do with collagen metabolism
Fatty plaques start accumulating inside your veins, and can eventually block them and kill you
After the menopause in women and sometimes as early as the puberty in men, the body starts accumulating too much iron, which eventually can lead to heart attack or stroke
after 65, there is a risk your brain starts to atrophy and you die of dementia
Nobody knows why it happens or how to prevent it
If nothing above kills you, you die of amyloidosis some time after 100
There is probably more
Oh, yes, the amount of brown fat start declining relatively early in life
Not sure if and how it can kill you, but animals which keep more tend to live longer
That only limits functional cells, not those that replace them
A good beer in Greece is just a Mythos
We only make 6%? But hey our beer is the best B)
Now do it per capita :)
Maybe Germany is the winner in production but Czech Republic is more than winner in consumption of beer per capita
Around 147 liters per year
Data from 2018, and it's been going down now :(
I can beat that
Wait, I'm Czech, never mind
Well there are people who go through their days drinking 16 beers no problem
Yes
On the other hand it does not count beer consumed by Czech tourist in other countries so it kinda evens out
Not a factor for Czechia, tourists would probably even bring our numbers down
We drink beer like there is no tomorow
My father in law does like 6 beers a day, I do aswell when there
When at home, I dont drink much
But I can do like 6 beers an evening at the pub and that is still on the low side for czechs
Doesn't even have to be that
A lot of people just get beer for lunch and few more in the evening
It's one beer a day
Yeah, those are rookie numbers
The beer is 0,5l and the water probably 1l if not 1,5l though
No, its because they are lying
Bottled water here is 3 crowns a litre (cheap basic water, there might be cheaper alternatives even) and the cheapest beer (Which is undrinkable shit that I would not touch with a pole, you are italian so think cheap carton vine) is like 7 CzK a bottle, you get 3 Czk for returning the bottle so its 4 crowns for half a litre, so its 8 crowns a litre
The price of convenience, it's more about the price of the plastic/bottles rather than the liquid
Where are the motorcycles and rmpty streets
To be fair, in 2014, a woman ill with schizophrenia entered high school in Czech city of Žďár nad Sázavou and she  stabbed a few students, one of them died
As a result, the government invested millions in school security

First of all, any replacement of coal generation with gas generation will at least halve the CO₂ emissions from the respective generation, seeing as that we're talking mostly about lignite coal plants and CCGT plants
Second, replacement with renewables is much more likely because of their lower price in the European environment
Just the *fuel* costs for natural gas even in the CCGT plant are comparable to *full* costs of a renewable generator these days
Except [the decision was made around 2000

Only kids who go through academic-type high schools are allowed to even apply for university
(Unless those who went to vocational school obtain the same qualification later through switching schools, online school etc
) May be a German/ex-Austria-Hungarian invention
There's a pretty big difference in at what age the kids are first divided into those schools, though, in Czechia it's around age 15 and Germany typically does it much earlier
It's a system that has some positives, but it also reproduces social hierarchy either way
Not many kids really know what they want to do in their early teens vs
what the parents want or what they know from their immediate community
Because as you said, IQ doesn't mean shit
It's not inherently inferior, but we have an inflated amount of vocational schools compared to other countries, because of big industry lobbying
Contrary to popular sentiments like "all non-STEM degrees are useless, enjoy flipping burgers lol", unemployment and poverty rates of people with secondary and vocational education are still much higher than anyone with a degree
We're not yet at the level when everyone who's able and wants to is getting a tertiary education
It's not about a lack of plumbers, it's about creating an abundance of lower qualified job seekers so that industrial companies can continue underpaying them
But this map suggests that in the south, people don't even have a high (=secondary in European context) school completed and most have only primary education
That seems insane to me

Summer
I am in that cold hell in the middle
Not here really - this is chart of temperatures for the last 30 days in Prague (which is usually the warmest): [
It looks more like April/May than June - only two days with temperatures above 25 °C.
23°C for Czech Republic
nah, that's seems way too low, more like 28°C
Really
I haven't seen anything but rainclouds
>occasionally above 25, rarely above 30
Where are you from
In Prague, there were only TWO days with temperatures above 25 °C and no day at all above 30 °C. That's pretty unusual for the end of June
We literally have 14 °C right now here
I even had to close my window because I was getting little cold
Last week yeah, this week is unbearable so far
(In Zlín at least)
I prefer rain AND 27°C heat
Someone call  27°C heat
I think it's an extreme even for en European
It's a joke
Fascinating, in 15°C I am pretty much unable to do anything
I am tired and can't focus
My body is probably trying to hibernate or something
Czechia, but I really hate European climate and I'm trying to be at some warmer place whenever possible
That's why this year especially sucks
Czechs: Yeah, we can speak slovakian
Slovaks: Yeah, we can speak czech
I don't know a single Czech who could speak and write Slovak at any degree of fluency
Do you
Propably depens on where you live
I propably don't know anybody who can't.
And where is that
Because Czechs *understand* Slovak, but can't *speak* it and definitely can't *write* it fluently, which is what I was hinting at
No it's not "changing a letter here and there and then its like a handful of words". That's why this whole thing is so complicated to have a reasonable discussion about – everyone thinks they can do it, but they really can't. I've seen and proofread texts written by Slovaks who can speak pretty decent Czech verbally, and they were terrible at writing
People don't realise it, but the stylistics between the two languages is very different, not to mention Czech grammar which for Slovaks seems to be quite difficult to master (they make tons of mistakes which make them look like someone who failed primary school, it's that bad)
I don't know about you personally, perhaps you're far better, but I am speaking from experience
Speaking is easier, writing at least half-decently is way, way harder
In any case, I don't know a single Czech person who could actually speak Slovak fluently
I know some Slovaks who can speak Czech very well, but their writing in Czech is very poor
Funnily, in college this was a Slovak girl who didn't speak Czech with the other students at all, but her writing in Czech was fairly good – she had learnt the grammar well so she wasn't making stupid i/y and s/z errors everywhere like most Slovaks do; she sometimes used a Slovak idiom or collocation that didn't really work in Czech, which is what gave her away in these sorts of blind readings we were doing
But she's probably the only Slovak person I know of who could fool a competent Czech speaker in writing
(Needless to say, the exact same thing would happen the other way round
That's why you shouldn't call us Eastern Europe

No countries really retain water well enough with all our biofuel centric agriculture
That is why even with better than average rain as we have had this year there is still a draught, all the rain just evaporates or runs to the rivers
With a draught, the weather gets even hotter as there is not a lot of water and green to cool it down
We are all fucked, I tell you
Governments would rather deal with different shit than this
Water retention, people

Works the other way around as well:
If the laws are good, EU politicians will pad themselves on the back, not the national politicians
If the laws are bad, EU politicians will blame the national politicians
Your example happens more regularly, but it really works both ways
I don't watch politics too detaily, and I agree with the lack of spotlight
But that's basically a definition of a politician: they very rarely take blame for something the did
And the EU politicians, by definition, aren't saints either
Prague is beautiful in winter (I mean the whole year sure but especially in winter) but the coblestones everywhere are insanely slippery and most roads instead of being cleared just have a co-out sign "this road is not maintained during winter".

I am not from Eastern Europe, but – given that Czechs are avid tourists – the answer is that you *travel cheap* and *live off the land*. You can spend good time in very expensive countries if you just decide to sleep in a tent and buy food in supermarkets and cook it yourself using a camping stove
Accommodation and restaurants are usually the most expensive items in Western countries; if you get rid of them, the trip becomes perfectly affordable and, dare I say it, more enjoyable if you're not the lazy "stay in the hotel" type
