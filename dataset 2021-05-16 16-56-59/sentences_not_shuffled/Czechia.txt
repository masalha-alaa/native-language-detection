What is a dark fact about your country not many people know about
I have recently found out Czechia ranks as [the third worst slavery haven] in Europe
Kind of a shock, if you ask me
What about you
Forced and coerced sterilizations of Romani women were happening from the 1970s until 1990s, with at least one known case as recent as 2007
I mean, I'm afraid that most Czech have at least heard about this on the news, but they would agree
Holy shit
I didn't know that
I thought, that the forced relocation of German speaking Czechs after WWII or Hilsneriáda were the worst, but this is equally bad or worst
Definitly didn't expect us to be that high, but interesting on how that correlates with the recent crackdown by the police on PublicAgent porn
Why is Těšín gone
Also still a thing in Czechia
Sigh
So did we
We learned about it a little in school, though
But the way Germans who lived in Sudetenland were threated after Czechoslovakia regained the teritory was quite cruel, too
Same
Most Czech people still get angry if you suggest that there might have been any problems with the deportation of Germans from our territory in 1945 and with how they were treated before it (in some towns, people got straight up shot or thrown into the river just on the basis of their nationality, and it used to be taboo to even research these deaths; some of the deported were German-speaking Jews who had just returned from concentration camps, women were being raped as "punishment", all kinds of messed up shit)
Yeah it's pretty bad
I hope people in charge are actually doing something about it, but as I know our beloved government it will probably go at a snail's pace
I mean 3rd
Only better than Albania and Montenegro
Come the fuck on
Why do you think that's the case
Other Baltic countries don't have it as bad
Damn
This should be definitely more talked about
I read that people did this normally, they believed in healing powers of blood of any executed person, of positive effect on pregnancy when hanged man touches your belly, I read they tried to steal parts of bodies of executed, that executioners sometiems even allowed sick people to take the blood etc
Czechia
Wouldn't be nice to have sea in middle of Europe
Spain
Portugal deserves to become an island with access to Mediterranean
That would make them a top tourist spot
Poland
It’ll give access to the sea and that’s good enough reason to me
Poland
Nothing personal, guys, we just want to have a sea
Well since the only reason to do that would be to finally get sea access the only logical choices would be Poland and Germany
And since Germany is historically known for trying shit and the fact that they have not for 70 years is quite unsettling, I'd go with them
Sorry guys
Poland
Poland or Germany, I wanna sea
Bye Austria
We finally have glorious sea
Cons: Parts of Alpes gone
Pros: We can claim ownership of schnitzel
I mean, if Poland becomes sea, we will have access to sea
Slovakia
Austria
Sorry, we want some sea
Slovakia
It's not connected to the sea, so the water wouldn't be salt, it would be interesting to have this giant lake next door in this drought aand
we would have nice beaches on the border
Sorry Germany, but we really need that sea
Iceland would make no difference
If its even part of EU in the first place
We can pack up and move west
Germany can accomodate, right
Bavaria has nice beer and all that
You'd kill grandayy by erasing Malta, are you sure you wanna do that
We could also say farewell to another tax haven
I am not complaining
I am in if we get Arnold Schwarzernegger to return to his drowning homeland, shooting the water with a giant automatic from a helicopter and shouting at the drowning Austrians "Get to the choppa
" and "Get aaut of hieah
" at the legions of elderly German tourists rushing in with the water
Ok, I have no idea how to write "here" in his accent, but you get the point
Budelípland
Cant wait for yall to be gone
Of course
He has five minutes
Starting now
Seen any map made after you fucked up the war in 1918
It may surprise you
That sounds like a lot for such a small island
That's some WaterWorld shit right there
Munich real estate prices tho
Well, you kind of should have expected that once you suggested Hungary becoming a slovak sea resort
Ok, five and a half minutes, then
. . .
He is already dead, isn't he
You have to be more subtle
Just start a "Balaton expansion initiative", bury everyone in paperwork and accidentally put a few more zeroes after the figure for the total area
Protection of property, health and life are valid reason to get a gun license and a gun permitting a concealed carry
I am sorry but why can't those women just buy tampons
€ 170 to € 350 here
There is a fixed budget of around € 8,600 and the parents can choose to take it 2 to 4 years
And I think they raised it to € 11,700 this year so it's even more
We have up to 4
And can't drink a beer in public
But you pretty much can't use it unless they point a gun at you first
That's cool
We have a tax break of € 43 per child
It can last until 26 if the person is studying
Edit: Just learned that it was raised to € 50 and that it's 63 for 2nd child and 80 for more childs (per every child)
It's also one of the tax breaks that can go below zero so even low income families can enjoy the benefits
By that logic tampons should be free for everyone, not just the poor
HA HA

My reactions was "Finally someone who will finish Brexit" and also
"LOL dat hairs
Who is this clown
I hope Scotland will become independent from UK
Because screw these brexit lads
But what will be his next steps after no deal brexit
After that it will be even harder to find a deal
When French gave up Czechoslovakia to Germans and then Germans defeated French with Czechoslovakian weapons
The Munich Betrayal, or more specifically what followed it
I guess that was more like everyone else's bruh moment though
Same for Yalta Conference
One rebelious religion group didn't like the parlament, so they went there and literally yeeted everyone out of the window
Well, the worst possible scenario looks like this
You are working lowest manual job available
You have much more kids than is usual, and your name shows that you are not ethnically czech
This combined causes, that no one wants to rent you a decent living
But there is an option, you can rent a trashy room in building that is falling apart, for rent that costs like a fine apartment in fashionable area of city
How the hell can you afford this
You can’t, but the government can
They pay for the living in said hellhole for you
The owner of this building never tries to make it liveable, you are lucky if electricity and water is working
When your trashy neighbors steal the pipes to sell them, you aren’t getting a replacement
then hygiene office comes, and decides that it isn’t acceptable, and decides to torn the house down
You are moving again
The smart owner already bought another ruin to move you into
And the cycle repeats
Making money of poverty is huge issue here, and integration of Roma people often fails
Towns and cities now can prohibit this kind of business, but it just move it elsewhere
Sad fact - there were a politicians who were making money in this business
For example in far-right party that often attack gypsies verbally
Reading all these, there is a jarringly stark contrast between post-Soviet countries and the rest of Europe
Fuck communists
I think you're confusing terms, they are not talking about communist buildings as a whole
They are talking about concrete blocks of flats - like [this] not apartment buildings - like [this]
As a Czech person (75% ethincally Czech) that has lived here his whole life, I do agree
&#x200B;
EDIT: No, I'm not poor
I agree with the Roma part
My wording is kinda bad
This
So much this
I think we can say this about the entirety of the former communist countries in Europe
This isn't really the case in Czechia, I'd say (or Prague at least), lower middle class at best
Upper middle class either has a mortgage for a house in some satellite town or at least a better flat, not in an apartment block
Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Only one thing bothers me - capital letters
&#x200B;
The rules for writing capital letters are already mess in czech grammar, and each other language I learn have a different rules for writing them
In czech grammar handbook there are several pages for it
how the fuck I am supposed to remember that and other languages as well
i do often, but i dont really mind since i will be leaving this place in a few years and have no use for it anymore
We use more and more English expressions in our language these days,  but I can see I tend to use quite a bit of English words that are not actually common and slap czech conjugation on it, baffling non English-speaking people around me
I feel like I'm getting worse at both English and Czech
I’m byelingual
I mainly use English on daily basis on internet, almost never write in native language there, plus, when I'm in Germany for a long time, I mix up Czech, German and English
I would not say worse, just mixing English and German words to my native language
Yes
It happens pretty regularly that I first recall a word in English and only then in Czech
I also sometimes catch myself thinking in English, which is pretty weird
Also, because I learned English words mostly through media sometimes I really struggle translating English text to Czech even though I know exactly what it says
Yes, definitely
Luckily my friends know english well enough to understand it in english most of the times
Yes
I *sometimes* use at least 1 or 2 English words in a Czech sentence
> Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Pullnout, pušnut, uploadovat etc
Despite my efforts to normalize the phrase "natlačit do chobotu", people in my office still use "pušnout do trunku" :(
Well, since I got my accent from watching British and American movies and TV shows combined with Czech, I'm technically drowning in Atlantic ocean when I'm speaking, but besides of that, I like mine
I hate my accent
It sounds like a mixture of Swedish, British, German, American an maybe a bit of Australian
I dont care that much to be honest, and i dont mind if someone speak with accent at all
Surprisingly many people thought that i am from Germany based on my accent :-D
Many people think that Czech accent sounds similar to Russian one, that is actually furthest from the truth, the accent is dramatically different despite being from the same language group
So i assume if we don't sound like Russians then Germans is the next easiest answer
Unlike English, I don't hate Czech accents in German, for whatever reason
Might be cause my German isn't nearly as good as my English, or because German seems much easier to pronounce to me and many other Czechs who learn it
Some English words are just plain weird, whereas German is mostly consistent
But that's my fault because I learned a lot of my English from YouTube
Because electronics are more expensive here, and Apple products even more so, so most of us can't afford Macs
The difference is pretty significant even for rich European countries, I'd guess it's mostly because of our high VAT rates
You can go on about various other reasons, but I think the price is most significant, kids who could afford iPhones and Macbooks in my high school/college would mostly pick them over high-end Android devices (those who didn't study in IT-related fields, anyway)
Germans specifically are also very into online privacy and tend to favor open software, which could play a part in it, but I'm not sure if selling your soul to Google is that any better than Apple these days
Money
Our prices are about 30% more
Network providers are usually offering just full price or something like 5% off when you subscribe for most expensive plan
(the "discount" I can have from Vodafone with my plan is about 40eur more than buying it anywhere else) Last interesting offer on iphone was for iphone 5
We are not wealthiest part of EU so 11pro is for average czech salary
But have to say I see more and more people switching to iphone in my circles but they don’t buy latest stuff
Because given the average income, taxes, exchange fees and such, it easily gets more expensive for Europeans (especially Eastern countries) than it is for Americans
As well, lot of Americans buy it on credit, while I think most of Europeans buy the phone upfront
As well there is the effect of American company
> Well, you'll notice that more then 45 minutes have passed and the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
9 hours passed and there isn't really any war here
lot of nonsenses about Apple and Android but discussion is civil
well if you really believe one platform is objectively better than another not considering everyone has his own subjective needs then it is not really surprising people don't want to listen how objective you are :)
Technically Czechia is also a whatsapp country but I don't know anyone who uses it
it's really weird
Exactly this
I always have to laugh when people make fun of me for "wasting" money on Apple products, but then they buy a new crappy Android every 1-2 years, while I still use my over 6 years old iPhone 6
So, I am not quite sure who is the one "wasting" money here
Same works for Android, unless you want to use just app which came with phone you will end up at situation where new app will simple not work with old os due lack of features of old os
There isn't real difference if life cycle is determined by IOS releases or Android releases
I am not expecting every piece of software on old hardware is going to be supported endlessly, these more than five years of support on iphones are more than enough for me so I was never forced to update phone because of that
For you it is objectively worse phone because of that, for me it is objectively not even the criteria I care about
I don't see buying Samsung as being somehow „tech savvy“ because you are also paying for a brand with Samsung and Google phones
I think it means that price-performance ratio comes first, brand after that
Maybe you, because you can buy an Android which will last for the same amount of time and the price will be on par with an iPhone, but that Android most probably will have better specs
Ashamed
None really
Few cities with bad reputation but only a very few that I wouldn’t be able to comfortably live in (it’s mostly parts of cities that are pretty bad - like Chánov
My personal is that the subway got stuck in the tunnel
(I actually does happen sometimes
I study in Prague, so I mostly say something about bad traffic/the tram being late
Sometimes the train/bus just arrived early and it drove off before it should’ve
Damn trains
(But in reality, I just like oversleeping lol)
EDIT: As a girl, I don’t recommend "morning sickness" as an excuse for being late
Trust me, I’ve been there

The tech guy who always complains
He also gossips and secretly informs the boss about his coworkers not working
A drunkard
But you have office together with Switzerland
So we sometimes forget you are there too
Don’t forget he also hoards stuff stolen from the company
Most likely retired, arguing about everything, know solution for every problem, but never do anything about that
Not has to, he just does because he just likes to fuck /w everybody and everything ;)
especially pens
Well statisticly we have the biggest alcohol problem
Well at least we drink the most beer
Yes, we learn British English, but the influence of internet, movies and searials is big
Yep, but in my case it was because I had in total 3 different English teachers
All my USA visits were for business purpose so I can only tell how insanely toxic is US working environment
also as someone born and grown behind iron curtain, young stupid me idealised USA as country of freedom not as a country where people like to all aspects of their lives to be dictated and policed
The number of arrests in the US every year is something completely absurd to me
and one more thing, I was told I should follow some urinal etiquette which means use every second one for no reason but I don't know if that was real or some sort of joke against me
I has surprised to discover that the majority of the offices had no windows
Like, the rectangular building was split into even rows od offices, and only the ones on the edge had natural light -- and the company was considered quite friendly to the employees
Nope, you would say "Mr
/ Mrs
teacher". You would not address most people with their first name, unless you're quite familiar
At most, you'd call them "Mr
/ Mrs
[last name]".
> As is the “no cappuccino after noon” rule
11AM actually
Nürmberg laws come to mind
we had to be an excellent company then as our office didn't have this
But once I've been in some reddit thread about classrooms without windows
Well it has to be hard for other groups then
All what I can see from here are some statistics,  like your officials sayings you are arresting more than 10 millions people every year and till around year 2010 it was close to 15m. With the population a bit above 300milions people it is completely insane number
A bit of everything you can see in this thread, the company I was working for was British with British management, no one really forced US office works in this way, they set up these rules on their own
We mostly use bricks and mortar, not stones
We are not in the middle ages
Also you don't need to rebuild brick and mortar house after a tornado, because it fucking survives without taking too much damage
The roofing is obviously the same in wooden and brick houses, so no difference there
Czech person would be surprised rather in an opposite way as our gun owners are used to carry their guns everywhere
No, "pana" is the accusative form of "pan", meaning mister, sir
We have the same thing in czech - pán for men and paní for women
You can carry a firearm in Czech Republic but I've never met anyone with a gun besides the police
There are very strict laws about that
And I only know one person with a firearm at home and he didn't even buy it himself, only inherited it from his grandpa
Set of nazi laws establishing the famous racial profiling in the Third German Empire

The others are only for hunting or sport shooting
Just a clarification that open carry for self defense (southern US style) is not legal
Russia digging up soldiers of ours from the first world war and putting them in a literal landfill
Edit: first world war
Kids after 1 month of quarantine be like:
It's WW1 soldiers
The Czech legionnaires fought against the Red Army alongside the remnants of the Russian imperial army
Yes
We remove a statue of a man of a foreign military, and they desecrate our soldiers
We have a bunch of old Slavic names that are rarely used
but there are a few problems
The more popular ones are routinely shortened, and the shortened form have very different feel
*Miroslav* sounds like a king, *Mirek* just like a regular guy
*Slavomír* sounds like a pagan warrior-poet, *Slávek* like a simpleton
Similarly *Boleslav* \> *Bolek*, *Lubomír* \> *Luboš*, *Rostislav* \> *Rosťa*...
At least there are options in male names
Most Slavic female names are just weird
Kajetán, Havel, Zvonimír, Cyril for males
Ida, Hermína, Apolena for females
even though now it's kinda fashionable to give your kids rarely used names to make them more "unique"
Some names are from the old Testament
Like Adam and Eva
I know a guy who is about 23 years old and is named Adolf
It's kinda taboo here as well, but when we were talking he said that he never had a problem with his name
Good question
It's a Polish cartoon, not a Czech one
And Lolek is apparently short for Karol
Don't ask me why, I have no idea :D
Yeah, it was a bit of an exaggeration on my part
Of course, a person's name has a negligible effect on one's qualities
And believe me, I know a bit about that, because my name (Honza) is used by a universally known fairy tale character "Simple Honza".
It's just that the shortenings have trivialized these ancient beautiful names laden with symbolism, and it's difficult to translate this effect across a language barrier, so I have used a strong tool to break through :)
Zořena, Žizňava, Hněvka, Hodava, Kvašena, Nětka, Pluhava, Božetěcha, Bratruše, Bratřice, Ctěna, Černice
Yeah there are several versions for many names
Miro sounds like the Slovak form though, was he Czech
I mean, I won't be throwing stones from the glass house that is Czech
The familiar form of Jan is Honza
The familiar form of Karel is Kája, the familiar form of Josef is Pepa
Ignác used to be shortened to Nácek (but that is now used as a derogatory word for Nazis, so
haven't heard that one in a while)
Yeah, especially since our languages are quite closely related
In Northern Czechia (N. Moravia and Silesia) many folks actually understand Polish
Sure you can
Just be aware that people may think that you are Czech if you do :)
It's mostly things you don't think about
Like in English, you don't think it's weird that Jack can be a diminutive of Jonathan and Jacob and James
It only gets weird when you start explaining it to an outsider :)
And there are reasons behind all of those, they're just obscured by several layers of historical development, so if you take your time you can uncover them
E.g. Honza for Jan is derived from the German Hans
As I mentioned, German used to have a substantial, even dominant position in this country, so that's why it stuck
Pepa for Josef is apparently from Italian Giuseppe, where it was shortened to Beppe
Not sure how exactly it spread here, but it did
I think many languages do this, in fact
Names too long are unwieldy so are shortened
In English, Jonathan is shortened to John, James to Jim, Benedict to Ben, Timothy to Tim, Thomas to Tom
I am quite sure common examples in other languages can be found
Some have occurred in this very thread :)
They should do this in China, Russia and the US as well
Europe is quite green already
It's good that they're trying to implement policies like this here, however i fear that the taxes will raise and it won't help unless other continents join as well
I almost feel like everyone here really think we only have 8 years left
These ecological countermeasures could have catastrophic impact on economy and our European standard of living
But people here live in fantasy world
Its all about green energy and electrical cars saving our planet
If 9 years pass, then earth will be disappearing
Thats the only way
Everybody lobbies for Green energy but solar and wind are shit
With their efficiency they will never pay for their costs
be it ecology or power produced
Nuclear powerplants are the only way for now
Why use 10 000 grasshoppers when we can have 1 horse
European economy is fully depending on German economy
And German economy is fully depending on fossil car production
Planning for 2050 is waste of time
Next economic crisis, which are some people trying purposefully start, will decide
Or tornadoes
or strong earthquakes
or hurricanes
Sometimes but more often I can’t tell if the laguage I’m reading or hearing is English, Czech or Slovak unless I really focus on the language
I had encountered this with French, which is my third language
After six weeks in Switzerland I came home and I could have sworn every conversation I overheard in the tram was in French
My brain just kept trying to pick up French speech patterns from Czech conversations
It was quite disconcerting
Never gotten to this point but I'm literally bilingual now
1 - we invented contact lenses
2 - we invented sugar cubes
3 - we invented semtex
4 - we drink the most beer in the world
5 - ěščřžýáíéúůďť
We have the biggest beer consumption per capita
We invented contact lenses, sugar cubes and semtex
There were three defenestration in Prague
We had a protestant religion almost a century before Luther wrote 95 thesis
You can find almost all major architectural styles in Prague

That beer will be 5 CZK cheaper because of a new clusterfuck of a law about beer VAT
Just a little insight: Bottled beer is 21%, draught beer is 10% if served in a restaurant with facilities, 21% if not
Alcohol-free beer is 15% and Radler type stuff (beer mixed with lemonade) is
well *nobody knows but jesus* i guess
10% VAT is only used on stuff like baby diapers to help moms
The prime minister said that this will result in beer being cheaper if the pubs are generous, but the real outcome is probably that everyone will just do it randomly, just like they did before and the accountants will have to deal with that shit
Tbh replacement migration is a real thing
Very dark is the other side, very dark
Shut up Yoda, just eat your toast
That is wonderful idea
We should have it try
Won’t be in it that much difference, but I can think of something really weird
Like, if you want we can but what from that we will get
Don't-know(i) what will(i) write, nor don't-know(i), if it doing(i) right, but is it kinda fun
If want(you), reply(you) with a sentence, which would have(i) write next
Ok, bye
I don't know what will I write, nor do I know if I'm doing it right, but it's kinda fun
If you want, reply with a sentence I should write next
Ok, bye
The (i) and (you) represents the verb conjugation
The don't-know is put together because in my language, it's only one word - nevědět - ne means no; vědět means to know
You just think about the sentence in your language and then translate it word from word
Or as others might say: Just think about the sentence and word from word translate it
(with Czech it is not that funny)
Have wierd wordorder and thatway used personal pronouns am yet seen’t.
Yes

Few days ago, our PM Andrej Babiš praised our coping with COVID and accidentally made zombie cure when he said "we saved thousands of dead people".
There was tv debate before last elections on topic of culture
Most parties sent usual gray mice, but far right SPD sent weirdo, who wasn’t able to speak fluently on his own
This nominee for minister of culture wasn’t even able to read from paper, and when show host told him not to read it, he kept going
He wasn’t able to pronounce some of words he had written on his paper, and his speech became meme
This guy got elected, and later he turned out to be gypsy holocaust denier
...from his book "On the Nature of Things".
Businessman Babiš also once said he won't do politic, no way, because he'd be really terrible at it
He is the PM now
He's a goldmine when he speaks by himself
"Yes, not everything is perfect, I understand and I too don't understand, I was looking for a vet on Monday and they were full everywhere, then we've found out that saloons, dog saloons, are closed, which is nonsense and when we've fixed that everyone was lauhue at us"
To be honest, he wasn't wrong
He IS really terrible PM
At least once, and mostly by accident
haha, no
It's really bad and we're not doing fine
our country is changing into babišstan sadly
True
Especially with the LGBT+ stuff
Pubs being closed
And yes, they have been closed since Saturday
Pubs getting closed
They also closed the pubs here
You know we're already in some deep shit when they close the pubs, the next step after that is probably cutting the food supply chain
Yeah they also banned protests here
The prime minister is trying to abuse it to sneakily pass laws to get him out of his conflict of interest allegations
Really sucks, tf am I supposed do at home, drink alone
Still better than catching corona tho
I don’t forget that it’s out there but I forget that it’s a part of Europe
No I always wanted to visit Iceland since I was kid and we learnt that they have heated pavement and wonderful nature
It's definitely on my bucket list
Yeah, I'd support high speed railways anywhere
It would also be great for us going on summer holidays, so I think there are some strong arguments
ETA: I would also insist that it has to be affordable when it's finished, though
I'm usually more than willing to take trains or even buses instead of planes for the sake of our environment, but when plane tickets are 4 or 5 times cheaper than public railways, that makes me a bit salty
I would rather see high speed network Berlin-Prague-Vienna
I think this should be priority
I absolutely support it
It is fast, comfortable, and environmentally friendly mean of transport, and it will increase quality of travel for both locals and visiting people
High speed trains should connect as many major cities as possible, both in new and old member states
In long term good infrastructure is always good for business as well
> high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe
Sad Czech noises
Sounds like the Prague airport
We only have one major airport in the country, and the only options for getting there are bus and taxi
Population density definitely has to be taken into account, most countries can't have train connections to every village like Germany, but HSR connecting the largest cities
I feel like that would bring large boosts to tourism and business
Obviously it couldn't work as a commercial project, but I find it hard to imagine that it would be a loss overall if we include other investments in the long term and the externalities of flying (also, we should tax the hell out of aviation fuel, that shit is ridiculous)
What's your standard for a "working" high speed rail, if the TGV doesn't qualify
Like
the Shinkansen and nothing else
You don't know how good you have it
Sure, but why not do both
If the question seems to me that there will be Czech response I'll try to find one
Yes, as I didn't find any czech reply, I shall give mine
Yes I skim to czech answers, but I read few upvoted answers aswell
Yeah, its pretty common
There are two big charity organizations, UNICEF and Czech based People in Need, both running on monthly subscribstion model
Its quite common as a gift to give someone for example 1 year subscribstion to UNICEF
One example of the campaign in Africka with Czech YouTuber shopaholic Nicole
Its kinda cringy
Well there are local NGOs which helps in Africa and they place these ads
You can check it if you believe they are not correct - [
Yes and so did our parents
And because of that particular thought is creeping around
Thought that cause of african poverty aren't Europeas but, and I beg Africans for forgiveness, Africans
It really took me a long time to come to terms with some non-English surnames being pronounced the English way (esp

Oxford dictionary explains lollygagging as "dawdling".
Thank you so fucking much, Oxford dictionary

Weirdly enough, both meaning would be translated as "stolice" to czech

I don't know, I am in Madrid now, and today really feels like the usual winter day here (10°C during the day, and slighty above zero during the night)
a thing i also find irritating, its September 10th and i already see Christmas shit in supermarkets, not even to October,
and once Christmas ends, Easter stuff just immediately appears in stores, like what the hell
Fuck harsh winters, Mediterranean temperatures are the best
But the "Christmas since October" is really annoying
Yeah, it made winters interesting and pretty
Now they are just cold and depressing
\> supermarkets seem to begin putting up christmas stuff earlier every year
And literary every year are people complaining that Christmas shopping starts at late September/October
We used to have at least 1
5 metre of snow and at least some snow during whole winter
In the last 10 years, I don't think it ever got over 0
5 metre, and it melts right away anyway
It is shit
Without fake snow, ski-resorts would bankrupt very fast
Previous winter I didn't have to shovel at all - all snow was rained off immediately
I grew up in Northern Bohemia, never really heard anyone being anti-German, I think we've switched to anti-Russian
Some people are irritable whenever Sudeten Germans are brought up, or when they comment on our internal politics or have contact with our politicians, as it is, quote, "not their business anymore". But no, there isn't any public sentiment against Germans anymore outside of that
I don't think so, after all, it was 81-75 years ago
We still have memorial ceremonies about WWII war crimes (Lidice, Životice, all the ghettos like Terezin or Jewish Quarter in Prague, mass executions, etc
), but like I said, it was long time ago
Also, if we had to keep grudge against every nation, whose armies either attacked or pillaged through our country, we wouldn't be speaking to almost any Europian nation
In czech republic I still encounter it, but very rarely
Usually it is about World war 2, anexing of Sudet and Munich agreement, or as we call it Munich betrayel
Not really, actually German tourists are usually very polite and the give much bigger tips, plus we hate the Russians more
Not really, Czechs and Germans get along pretty good these days I'd say but whenever my dad sees a group of Germans he says "The fascists are invading again
" or something equally as unfunny
Yes, it went down a lot, but people still complain about "Damn skopčáci"
I have no idea if this is very common in CZ but where I grew up (Vysočina and Prague) it seems like Germany fucked us so hard there was a buffer overflow and not counting the old folk it really isn't a thing here
I'd say it's still quite present, especially with our older generations
It's not only because of events "70 years ago" - living in the Eastern Bloc, WW2 was reflected differently, there was an emphasis on the Soviets being our allies because they liberated us in WW2, so of course you needed to still dislike the enemy they saved us from
East Germans were our friends, if course, but we all had to be on the lookout for any attempts at revenge from the imperialist West Germans
in the former Sudetenland areas, this was further amplified by fearmongering about the deported Germans coming back and "taking your houses"... We didn't have any insight into changes that were going on in the West German and western European societies for 40 years
Czech communists created their own interpretation of history, in which the villains have always been Germans or Austrians in some capacity, and at least 2 generations grew up with these narratives
Obviously nowadays most Czechs are gonna be civil and perfectly fine with dealing with Germans in business, tourism or everyday life, but I'd say that some of the negative sentiments are still lurking under the surface, especially in Sudetenland
I can't really imagine we'd attack somebody for speaking German in public, though, it's more snide remarks like "see, they've never actually changed" when our media report about cases of far-right extremism in Germany, and stuff like that
It seems to me that people are more angry at the UK and France for their betrayal in 1938
And at the Soviet invasion in 1968
From his point of view, no one is angry on the Germans
Depends
In general I think there isn't much anti German sentiment, definitely not among young people
Occasionally you can find someone who is bitter about Sudeten Germans / Beneš's decrees (our current scumbag president Zeman used the decrees against his opponent Schwarzenberg as a dirty scaremongering strategy in the presidential election back in 2013)
The extremes both on far left and far right also hate Merkel due to the migrant crisis
Other than that I think we get along well, we have lots of German tourists here, never heard anyone say anything bad about Germans in real life
For me personally, I am in intense contact with Germans due to work (my boss is German, before the coronavirus I used to travel to Düsseldorf every month), also live in north west Bohemia, 10-15 km from German border so people around here go to Saxony often for shopping or hiking in the mountains
Generally I feel like at home there
We are quite similar in many regards
Yeah, it pops up from time to time, especially among people with strong "slavic nations unite" or "fuck EU" mentality
Yes, not as big, but a thousand years under the German boot will take a while to heal
Yeah, I think we hated them more mainly because the German thing was a thing everyone knew of but no one could anything about
The Russian thing was a bit of a backstab
Why Poles
Interpreting last thousand years as living "under the German boot" is a perfect example of the bullshit that was rammed down our throats last 150 years by our nationalist elites
Maybe, but very few people wanted that
Hungarians didn't like Habsburgs and there were revolts against Austrian rule, Czechoslovaks were so fed up with Austrians, that big chunk of our units just switched sides and went fighting for allies as Legionaries (really Interesting stories actually
Especially Russian legions) and Balkans hated Austrians so much, that they assasinated Franz Ferdinand
The Empire would probably fallen apart in big civil war sooner or later
I thought that Fanta was from USA
Actually it’s quite interesting that worldwide known beer Budweiser is American
Name Budweiser directly refers to the Czech town České Budějovice (Budweis in German)
There is beer company in the town named Budweiser Budvar, that is really Czech
There were disputes over the brand name in the past and American company won - they can use word Budweiser referring to the Czech city (I think that it is okay as well)
I thought for a long time Tic Tacs were Czech until I started travelling and seeing then literally everywhere
The games Mafia and Mafia II are Czech games
Many people don’t know it
When I was a kid, the Disneyland could have been in the freaking Atlantis for all I cared, I just knew I'd never visit it
It is brewed in eponymous Moravian town
I thought the same thing as a kid
You should look up how much baked beans the UK consumes
It's unreal
No one is even remotely close to you
Boggles my mind
Can't disagree with that
They as indeed delicious
I think it's an absolutely necessary thing for any country to have, but our healthcare system is still far from perfect, at least from my experience
The main problem is that we don't have enough healthcare professionals, I've heard so many stories about nurses having to cover two more shifts just to make everything look good in the papers, I don't really know how to explain it properly
And it's basically impossible to find a new GP, especially for children
I've also heard bad things about our mental health care, but I don't have any first hand experience so I don't want to really say much
And this problem is also starting to appear in schools and post offices, I know some people who teach at public schools and one of them said that throughout the last 5 years 8 teachers left and they only managed to hire 3 new ones
And the Czech Post (Česká pošta) is kind of a running joke, because there's basically zero chance of your package actually being delivered to your house, they just give you a piece of paper saying that you weren't home and to pick it up at the post office (and those are often really busy because of it)
It is funny that USA is claiming how christian is and doesn't have it
Perhaps I am wrong and real Jesus's teaching is to mooch enough money so you can afford jet, nice house, ...
It's good idea fo US
Yes of course, universal healthcare is something all countries should have
The issue is how you achieve that and there is great diversity in the actual systems
Some countries have private insurance companies, some don't etc
From my understanding Bernie wants Medicare for all with virtually no private insurance
That might or might not be the best path forward especially  considering the difficulty he is gonna face passing any bill
However the need for universal healthcare shouldn't be controversial at this point
In Czechia you have to be privately insured but the health insurance companies are very controlled
You pay some 16% of your income for health insurance
When you're unemployed/child/retired/student the state pays it for you
If you're unemployed and not registered as seeking a job, you have to pay some minimal amount (I think around 80€) on your own
If you're self employed you either pay the minimum amount of your income is lower than some threshold or based on your income if it's more (the minimum is slightly bigger than for the unemployed, around 100€)
You also pay some small fees that exist to prevent abusing of the system (e.g. 3€ per night staying in hospital, I think they already cancelled the 1€ per doctor visit, but I'm not sure)
Pretty much anything prescribed is either free or really cheap
When you go to doctor, the doctor either has an agreement with the insurance company (the better option) and thus you don't pay anything, or they don't and you first pay it out of your pocket and then file a case with your insurance company which will pay it back
You can even get some nonstandard procedures for free if your doctor and the insurance company agree (e.g. breast enlargement if your psychologist agrees that it would help with your low self-esteem and the insurance company's expert agrees, too)
I probably forgot something since it's a pretty complex topic, feel free to ask
I absolutely agree with you, my point was just to share my own experience with healthcare where I live, not to say that the same thing would happen in the US as well
In my opinion, implementing a universal healthcare system is the best thing they can do
Absolutelly, I think there are some small places with quality (or distribution) problems here and there but generally tap water it is
I never bought bottled water to drink at home
Bottled water is the most sold thing in my local Tesco, but many people do drink tap water
I don't know about other people, but tap watter is basicaly the only thing I drink at home
As you said, I buy bottled water when I need it on travels but at home
tap watter all the way
Everyone I know drinks tap water - don't see a reason why someone would drink bottled water when tap water is often of superior quality and taste
The quality of water depends on area, city, type of buildings etc
The city I live in is lucky as we get our tap water from a water reservoir in the mountains - the quality is great
We call these fridges "american fridges" and they are not really common in my experience
I would say 95%+ people have the normal non-dispensing fridge (ymmv)
The only benefit I see in that type of a fridge is the ice dispenser, that's what I use when I visit someone with that fridge
I still get the water from the tap just because it is faster to fill a glass/jug due to faster flow
As for the filtering pitchers, that's also not very common
My flatmate got one recently because she's a coffee enthusiast and wanted to see if having filtered water would improve the coffee taste
But for normal drinking tap water it is
We have both, but just because I don't like the taste of tap water in Prague (we had well water back home, which wasn't chlorinated, or not as much) and the ice is just so convenient
Plus the Brita really helps keep limescale down to a minimum
Maybe only "[google
dk] shows that
Google shows me this for "best tap water": [
Only once Denmark is mentioned
Way too often and it's so damn frustrating
The problem is that these days, I probably consume more English than Czech during day from videos to podcasts, reading stuff
It gets especially bad when I am talking about an area that I almost exclusively encounter online in English
And the worst part is that my English proficiency is completely fucked up
I think I have almost 100% understanding of any text at this point and almost the same level with listening
Translating Czech to English is usually fine but translating English to Czech is sometimes very hard for me even if I know exactly what that sentence means
Same here
It got really bad during quarantine because I spent all day in my room watching movies, reading books, posting online etc
all in English
I used some Czech with my family and during online lessons but not nearly enough
I now prefer to discuss topics in English instead of Czech
It’s pretty embarrassing and also worrying because maturita is coming up in a few years and I can’t see myself passing the Czech language/literature part of it lmao
Well look on the bright side, you'll ace the English part
The Czech part is also so on-rails (or atleast that's what it felt like to me) that it's impossible to go very deep into the subject, so rudimental Czech will probably do lol
Don't tell others what they should or shouldn't do
Mind your own business
We feel the same way
Sadly experienced this while visiting our company's office in Düsseldorf
What a barbaric crime to put sauce on perfectly fine, crispy schnitzel
I find it hilarious that the Finnish have a sauna code of ethics
>Calling us bigger, neighbouring nationality
No Southern Czechia or Western Hungary
Aww man
Can we keep refering to you as Upper Hungary
You guys don't speak Czech in Slovakia
Is it ok, to speak Czech in Slovakia, or should I try my best to speak Slovak, or just avoid them and speak English
Wait
You can order milk for a drink in a restaurant
Czech children with ketchup
It sound weird, but after my one year stay in Germany I love it with sauces now
But it's common in other parts of the world too
Last year I had a great schnitzel in curry sauce in Thailand
idk why but this question is so weird you asked that question like we were foreigners to each other
That's kinda sad
So if you dislike someone, the way to go is visiting their sauna and breaking the sauna code of ethics in it
I hope they said "no homo".
Sorry, I think I watched too much US politics, that I even thought of this question
Well
I guess our restaurants have milk for cooking too, but it is not on the drinks menu, so no one ever orders it
I think that if anyone did, they would get some funny looks from fellow diners as well
I think people who say "Eastern Europe" just mean Former Eastern bloc, they just think it's the same thing (it's not)
It's quite easy to pronounce
It is a bitch to read tho, háček ftw
Every passenger buying a ticket from the driver
Or even showing the ticket to the driver
Sounds terribly inefficient
(The other north)
Here in Prague standard-length buses have 4 doors, articulated buses have 5
All are used for entering and leaving
Even stopping to show your ticket to a driver is terribly long process, even if it takes 3 seconds, for a dozen of people -- normal amount for entering/leaving on every stop -- it's half a minute
With stop on average every two to three minutes, it makes bus 25% slower
That's why purchasing tickets from the driver in Prague is penalized: you can only purchase more expensive ticket and you pay 20% premium on top of the regular price
The thing is that cyprus is sometimes considered an asian country, so you might be last
Ovidijus
Like the Roman author Ovidius Naso
Mostly not, people who interact with other nationals - and know either English or German and are therefore mostly of younger generations - don't sweat over it
It's interesting to compare different perspectives, and if there is contention, you'd just agree to disagree, since different things are important to others and that's cool
Things might get heated or rather awkward if the topic gets on the Sudeten Germans though, yeah
Germans might call it unlawful exodus of millions blamed for crimes of a slim minority, Czechs might call it as an inevitable consequence of a century of clashes and, you know, the dismemberment of our freedom and danger to independence
It's an uncomforable topic even when Germans are not involved, so
I can thing of two things that Czech people are somewhat sensitive about
First, it would be the Beneš decrees and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war, the second would be the invasion of Warsaw pact armies in 1968
Speaking of the former, the Czech interpretation sees it as a necessary consequence of german irredentism and the crimes of Nazi Germany, the German interpretation sees it a crime that was done on civilians, many of whom did not support the Nazis
I agree
In fact, the only slightly awkward conversations I've had with someone abroad about history were with Russians
I don't think most people are really salty about history anymore, but the Soviet occupation of 1968 is still a living memory for some
Otherwise, talking about the old wars, paradoxically, makes me feel hopeful about today, because if people from two countries that used to be at war can now sit together and drink beer, then something must be going well
EDIT: Fixed the year
Nah you get off the hook for this one of course
We'll criticise you enough when it comes to facilitating tax avoidance
People from two different countries were drinking beer together even during the times these countries were at war
It was 1968, but you are right
Yeah, you're right, embarassing
I genuinely mistyped
It’s ok, I remember it because of the eights
1938: Munich agreement
1948: victory February (communism in power in Czechoslovakia)
And 1968
Probably because of the diet
If I am not mistaken Central European countries like Germany have significantly more cases of esophageral, stomach and bowel cancer that say Greece or Italy
I guess it depends on why you are speeding
I am gonna go ahead and admit that I am driving faster than a speed limit on a highway (obviously when the road is clear, safe and the traffic is mild), but not because I have places to be, but because I enjoy driving a little faster
So I would take the time out instead of a fine every time
Honestly speaking, knowing that I could just stand on a side of a road, have a smoke and browse reddit for an hour wouldn't deter me from speeding again
Do I understand it correctly that they have a big display there showing when you can leave
I don't know why, but it looks hilarious
Switzerland too
I think the three strike rule is a pretty good deterrent
Three speeding tickets and you can wave your license goodbye for a year
We already have something like that for speeding 20 km/h+ in a city or 30 km/h+ out of a city
For 40/50 km/h+ you can get a driving ban for up to a year on your first offense
But one of the best deterrents that we inadvertently already have is the quality of our highways
State of some literally doesn't allow speeding unless you have no regard for your vehicle
Also, to clarify, when I say I am speeding, I don't mean I am doing 200 in a 130 zone
I am talking 140 - 150 and of course there is some leeway until your speeding becomes worthy of cops' time
140 - 150 usually isn't, not on the highway anyway
We have this thing called "poslední zvonění" (last ringing) where you wear costumes (soldier, worker, witch, whatever
) And stand in front of some school and spray vinegar and paint stuffs on kids' faces (appropriate stuffs like the name of your class, hearts, etc
) with lipstick
Nothing harmful, noone complains
I liked planning my way to school beforehand so I wouldn't get sprayed and painted on felt like an assassin
Yeah, calling police there is a bomb in the building
And it is happening whole academic year
Except the beginning when no tests are being written,
Uniformy z druhé světové jsou povoleny
I s dobovou výbavou :) plně funkční při nejlepším.
K98 stojí pouze 15k, to jde :D
Danny DeVito had few Czech lines in some movie and he learnt it very well that you cannot tell it's not his language
But there are no more significant roles in Czech because it's really hard to learn for foreigners
If the actor speaks well and tries not to speak with his accent, ok, but otherwise no please
I don't remember movies where they tried Czech really, only now I remember one single line in the last Spiderman when they were supposed to be in Prague and some extra told him in Czech that he dropped (the pivotal) glasses, but none of my friends understood her, we were just confused why this sentence wasn't subtitled and WTF and it took time to realize it was supposed to be Czech sentence
No idea if it was Czech or foreign girl but it was really butchered - and they should keep English
looks to me it is either some Russian like gibberish or a basic three words sentence from second chapter of beginners language book
I mean, to be fair, this is what French people tell me all the time, too, and I'm not even an actor
In Anthropoid the actors spoke English, but they got the accent pretty spot on, I was afraid they were going to do some pseudorussian abomination
I can't think of a foreign movie where anyone speaks Czech, maybe except for a few lines in Saving Private Ryan (but those were actual Czech people), but in video games, the Czech language gets absolutely butchered pretty much every time
The worst offender that comes to mind is the latest Deus Ex, which takes place in Prague
If it was a line or two, I wouldn't care, but since there is a lot of Czech dialogue, it makes me cringe a lot
I know it's japanese, but damn is it funny and kinda good at the same time
My sister watched this show and she was very mad by their Czech
She told me that there are also a lot of mistakes when they write something
Yup
We say "Dobrý" nebo "Dobrý den", meaning Good day
Essentially everywhere except for towns and cities
When you're hiking, but also just walking through a village
Explains the weird looks I've been getting from people when I greeted them when walking by, in a small town
I'm more familiar with people saying "Ahoj" than "Dobrý den" while I'm cross country skiing and also while canoeing
On water and snow yes, but like when you are hiking people(and me) usually say dobrý den
When I go up to the mountain Kleť everyone says "ahoj" ("hey"), except for elderly people and families
and some people don't say anything at all
Prime Minister who is currently being prosecuted by the police for fraud with EU subsidies and investigated for number of further crimes while also having around 30% in polls
It's insane
Still a thing here
A lot of people say they do it "for kids to have fun" (and usually just torture the carps, my little brother once straight up poisoned them - he poured them the washing powder to "eat") and it is terrible, especially if they keep the carps for like day or even more
And considering they already were fished out the ponds long ago and sold in huge cisterns, starving for who knows how long, packed with all the other carps and then taken home most times in plastic bag and in the end, they are lucky if the person is actually able to kill them quickly and on the first try
I don't like this tradition and we personally (I'm always with my parents on Christmas) don't do that luckily (they are some attempts from my dad but I just throw huge fit that he won't block the bathroom with carps for days so we can't even bath, so
Not just any film
Try some 80s porn, it was also dubbed this way
Aren't these both things common in whole Europe
And I thought we have premature Christmas when all shops start selling decorations in November
Oh he is trying to
He also shipped a witness in this case - his own son - to Crimea and then to Switzerland so the police wouldn't find him
That sounds like something I'd be very uncomfortable with
Here it's handshake for everyone
Yeah, that's pretty much it
I don't know the extent since I didn't really watch any, but I saw some clips from such movies and it was a thing
Well, I know it's not common in Spain, but that's because they don't have the sauna culture (because of the warmer weather I believe)
But do you go to sauna
Before the Ausgleich nonsense, the whole country was called the Austrian Empire or just Austria
Idk, just a thought, but what about no alcohol in blood while driving
Ok, so the comment was about not going to sauna at all
I was thinking that you are going there fully clothed (or with swimsuits which is even worse)
Veselé Vánoce a šťastný nový rok
Veselé Vánoce
Pije jako Dán (He drinks like a Dane) - Someone who is drinking too much alcohol and behaves inappropriately
Španělská vesnice (Spanish village) - Something you are totally unfamiliar with or confuses you
Švédská trojka (Swedish threesome) - Basically a threesome
Čínská kvalita (Chinese quality) - something of a very poor quality
Americký úsměv (American smile) - a wide smile showing bright white teeth
Jednou za Uherský rok (Once every Hungarian year) - when something with a repeating nature happens after a very long time
Ruský kapesník (Russian tissue) - Sneezing into your bare palm
(Added the last two in an edit)
"That's a spanish village for me" means I don't understand that
I have no idea where it originated, but I believe germans have the same saying, just with czechs (czech village)
We have plenty more, but this was the first that came to my mind
We have few
"To be Scottish" means to be cheap and greedy, "Drinks like Dane" means to drink a lot, "It's all Spanish village to me" means I know nothing about this and others
*Odejít po anglicku* (leave in English way) - leave without saying goodbye
*Mít se jako pánbůh ve Frankrajchu* (have youself like lord the god in Frankreich) - like a pig in the rye, live in luxury
I think it's older than that
I've heard it from a plenty of older people
We have the same thing but with Oklahoma
never heard this one, where are you from
Northern Moravia near Jeseníky, but maybe it's not that common in general
propably, I'm from southern Moravia but I will ask my friends if they know it or if it is just Jeseníky thing lol
What
Orban is a thug and criminal who belongs behind bars
Quite often, when our prime minister speaks
His sentences often make no sense
Shy FX - Original Nuttah
For all you who wonder how UK + Jamaican accent sounds like
I woke up after a very long afternoon nap and turn on the news on TV
I could not comprehend a single word
Since I'm living in dorms, I meet people from every corner of the republic and sometimes I understand Slovaks more than someone from my country, but we always find some way to understand each other
Often when in a film or a show from the US they try speaking Czech it takes me few sentences to recognize it's supposed to be Czech
From my head I can think of examples like Jane the virgin or The Vampire Diaries
In these cases it really didn't sound like Czech at first, and even the word order was a bit off (when the wrote something) and also some mistakes in translation but yeah, can't really blame them hah
Yeah, my dad is expert with this
Once he was speaking with some Hungarian guy and for 30 minutes
He doesn't speak any other language than Czech, so I have no idea, how they were communicating, but my grandpa was always saying, that alcohol connects people
From what I've heard, pretty much, yeah
You will end up sweeping the streets in an orange vest
The same, or garbage man or "You'll be digging holes".
Before they closed down all the mines we had in my region we used to say that if you don't study well you will end up working as a miner
Same in Czech, "budeš kopat kanály".
I think we will all end up digging trenches
You know what, I never thought about it that way
brb, dropping out of law school
I think we will experience another war in Europe during our life time
There won't be enough machinery to dig all the trenches
Before some high school exchange with Danish students these guys were curious if we have electricity in our country and were told by their parents not to eat home made food because of hygiene
(Paradox: I stayed in let’s say very alternative life-style family that lived in semi-squat with many pets and dogs living in the house as well)
No, we are not Russains nor Germans, we don't speak any of those languages
No, Czechoslovakia is not a country anymore
Yes, we are civilized place like THE REST OF THE FUCKING WORLD FUCKING AMERICANS
It seems that americans think that there can't be civilization anywhere in the world excecpt the USA lol
You don't?
Is [this] best clothing against drop bear
It is costume of THE castle ghost and look at hat
Czech Rep
also isn’t communist, nor in south America
Probably because some Slavic languages User it as a toast
In czech it ist a toast And not anything liek thank you
Its just a meme, don’t feel offended
No wonder - no interesting pictures like in Yugoslavia
/r/WrathOfRichardStallman
A good move, if you are an anti-vaxxer you’re a moron
To be honest I like it
I don't understand people who don't do research or if they do research the 'research' is only from Google and articles they won't confirm themselves
It's like flat earthers but it kills children instead of humiliating yourself
Also
I'm 13 so take this with a grain of salt I don't know shit about this stuff just saying what I think about it from what I know
Couscous, the semolina pasta, is called kuskus in czech
But word 'kus' means also 'a piece'. So some genius translated kuskusový salát (couscous salad) as piece piece salad
We have a Camembert-style cheese called Hermelín, which is also the name for ermine fur
And one restaurant translated fried Hermelín as fried ermine
I live in dorms and usually through summer holidays there are mostly foreign students and staff can't speak English that well, but they try
For example, one guy wanted to say "Be right back
" And wrote "I will be soon" instead
Also I've heard, that they once wrote "...toilet will be constipated
" instead of "...this will clog the toilet
In Czech it's Smrtonosná past (lethal trap) and people always confuse it with lethal weapon
Woaw, what do you guys drinK
Nazarbajev did resign
What's going on
No but congrats I guess
Please just don't puke and piss on our sights
Děkujeme
Never heard that Prague was a "party" destination
(And I live 50 km away from it) Could someone please explain the claim to me
This is probably the best idea ever
You know, we have beautiful architecture everywhere in the city centre
You don’t have to puke all over it and scream like a banshee when you get out of a bar in the middle of the night
Most of the bars/pubs are overpriced anyway
Just go see the Prague Castle, then buy alcohol in a local shop and go get wasted to the Petřín hill, like everyone else does lol
And for other Czechs who live outside of Prague
Go visit it now while it's not overflowing with foreign tourists, it might be once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
Just go see the city centre on a weekend night (especially Národní Třída)
It’s disgusting, I found it hard to believe coming from a small town
I mean part of the problem is them being expats and not just immigrants as anyone else
'real low drinking age'? Its 18
I think thats just normal number across europe
Oh yeah it's not as empty as it was few months ago, still not as extremely packed as pre-covid tho
I'm not a local either, just really enjoyed the city when I was there around July iirc
Even better are the Russian memorabilia stores, they are oh so great
Who doesn't love buying Russian stuff in a completely unrelated country
It's like going to Britain and buying the French flag as a souvenir
In Czech republic, they usually sell fake weed (illegal even when fake but cops can't be bothered when everyone is doing it) or matryoshka dolls
Well, this year there were only two days with temperatures above 25 °C so far here, and that's quite below average
Right now it is 24 °C, which is actually nice
It's colder here (than  last 5 years)
And I am glad it's like that 23°C max is ideal
Not hot, but still comfortable warm
The weather was so beautiful today
The sun was shining while it was raining from a giant grey cloud
The temperature was around 25°C. But tomorrow
oh boy
It’s gonna be 30°C. I’m gonna melt
It's about 25 degrees here (77° F) and sunny but last weeks thunderstorms caused some flash floods in some places, the Vltava cascade is full of water and still the weather is really volatile
Hot but not unusual for a beginning of summer holidays
Nobody died so far and the floods are already over
Some millions czk in property damage and a few dozen people without homes ://
Oh hell yes
Are you going to tell somewhere if you'll decide to do it
Like I really would like to read it
We have a saying that every Czech is a musician (Co Čech to muzikant)
Shame I am totally tone-deaf
I read somewhere that there are two types of poles - those born with a bottle in their hand who drink all their life and die of lung cancer and those born with cigarette in their hand who smoke all their life and die of liver cirrhosis
I think it fits czech people more
Being tone deaf never stopped me from professing my fondness of alcoholic delirium through a rude song
[Karviná] Consistently voted worst place to live by various metrics, it's still characterized by the heavy industry and coal mining that raised the town out of obscurity in the 19th century
Orlova, Karvina, Havířov and honestly the entire county
That looks like every city in my county, so you don’t have it that bad
They also has the highest amount of COVID cases in the republic
What a place to live in
I personally find Kladno really ugly (haven't yet had the pleasure of visiting Karviná) and some people say that they don't like Bruntál, Nymburk, Most, Rakovník and Hrubý Jeseník
Honestly the entire
district is ugly in general
u wot
Ye i work in usti and its really digusting
to be fair Ostrava most likely looks more shit but the smog hasn't lifted since the 90s so we can't really see how shit it looks
It looks like the unrevealed sections of a map
I mean some places in the Karvina District are fine, but generely nothing special
I think europeans are much more calm and peaceful
Boi you don't have to blame the entire right wing
It's the republican party
European right is much different from american
Article 1

Česká republika dodržuje závazky, které pro ni vyplývají z mezinárodního práva
The Czech Republic is a sovereign, united and democratic state based on the respect of law and freedoms of man and citizen
The Czech Republic follows the commitments which are given to her by international law
Article 1
(1) The Czech Republic is a sovereign, unitary, and democratic state governed by the rule of law, founded on respect for the rights and freedoms of man and of citizens

some czech(?) politicians should read this
I have a question on german - what does the mansait (manzeit, I dont know) means
My colleagues from germany is saying that almost from 9am to 2pm
WTF is that
We have "Středa, je ho tam třeba" (Its wednesday, he is needed over there)- meaning that "your GF needs a dick"
This is exactly whats happening at my workplace :D
Everyone in Egypt wanted a photo with me
Maybe because I’m blonde
I’m not really sure
But I have a photo with an entire female class somewhere
Actually your memory on acid can get kinda loopy
Probably anything involving our president and alcohol (or [these] [two] ) I don't know if anyone else finds them Czech enough, but that is something I would show to someone if they asked what are Czechs like
There's plenty beautiful things about Britain and noone can claim otherwise with any seriousness
But you do have to admit that the drunk thug culture is overwhelmingly common among people in Britain
I have personal experience with British tourists in many countries I was to and the drinking problem is very prevalent
He joked with Putin about "liquifiyng journalists", so one supporter made him a wooden gun with Becherovka supplier (Becherovka being Zeman's favourite liquor) and on the side there is written ( 'on journalists')
I live in a town with a Hydrogen cianide factory, I would feel safer if we have just a simple nuclear reactor here
All of them, to be honest, but the surprise that the Hussite Wars were a thing is by far the most egregious
The assassination of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich
He was a chief of the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a big time cunt
He was called the butcher of Prague for a reason
He was assassinated by Czechoslovak paratroopers who were flown over Bohemia by the British
He was the 2nd highest ranked nazi official in the protectorate with only Hitler being above him
LOADS, from Hussite wars to Velvet Revolution, if you tell any person outside of Czech Republic about it you'll just get weird looks
There's a movie about this, right
I believe youtube advertised it to me
The spanish civil war(s) is the main theme of one of the most popular books of all time, I wouldn't say it's that unknown to people
El ministerio del tiempo demonstrated me that there's a huge period of Spanish history I know shit of
A few carlist wars, coups d'êtat, Bourbons replaced by an Italian guy, all this stuff
Well, at least I knew about "the desired king", liberal revolution and reaction in early XIX century
Actually the Turkish independence war is an unknown fact itself, you don't even need to go into details
Halifax explosion is not that unknown, because of its scale you will surely find it in any "sensationalist educational" material, you know what I mean, "the biggest catastrophes", "the unwanted records", like this
Why don't you link this  ?
Eating on Christmas day, you're not supposed to eat anything before the Christmas dinner (so that you can see the Golden piggy
It's a saying for children, so that if they would not eat anything before the Christmas dinner, they would see a golden pig
You should visit Cyprus
I didn't know it is possible but they have even more strays than Greece
Our language has a letter "Ř" ([r̝]) which is pretty unique to our country, not even slovakian, a language most similar to ours, has it
Czechs will often try to get foreigner to say "řeřicha",  since it's a very hard letter to pronounce correctly even for many Czechs
It's also the reason why many Czech kids need to go to a speech therapist
I'm not sure how unique it is to our langue, but we can make entire words with no vowels
We have a whole tongue twister based around that "Strč prst skrz krk
" Our longest word without vowel is "scvrnkls" with eight letters
What's also quite different about our langue is that when we put C and H together it's considered it's own letter "CH" ([x])
I live in the Czech Republic and we have the letter ř Ř. I'm pretty sure none other than us has it
Czech can use some consonants (r,l,m) as syllabic and therefore function as a syllable nucleus (usually a vowel), so sentences without vowels aren't unusual
A common Czech tongue twister is Strč prst skrz krk (stick your finger through your mouth), but even more bizarre creations exist;
Blb vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
A perfectly valid sentence
Ve have "měsíc" with lower case M for "natural satellite oribiting planet - like moon" and "Měsíc" with capital M for "Earth moon"
You have it wrong
The longest word without wovel is "čtvrtsmršť" with 10 letters
Zdrh krt zkrz drn zprv zhltl čtvrthrst zrn
Čtvrthrst is longer by one letter
It means quarter-hand
My teacher said it is because peasants rised cows and nobles ate beef
Czech have this too
But as per usual it's not as simple as adding -je or -tje
The suffixes are different for different genders, different endings in the base word etc
Dům - domeček (house, small house)
Kočka - kočička (cat
Pes - pejsek (dog
Kuře - kuřátko (chicken
And sometimes you can even go few levels further and make up words like pejsánek, pejsáneček for even smaller cuter dogs
Happy cake day
Happy cake day
Is it actually used anywhere or is it artificially created to be the longest word without a vowel
It's actually quite funny to see people struggle with the tongue twister after growing up here
It uses very basic words "strč" put, "prst" is finger, "skrz" is through something and "krk" is neck
So it's, "put a finger through a neck". Very basic to us but a nightmare to look at
Ale to nic neznamená xd to reálně nikdy nikdo nepoužije xd
PIE had dual, so all descendants had dual in some form
Czech lost its dual in the high middle ages, retaining only a few forms of "irregular plural" for eyes, hands, legs, breasts etc
It is challenging a bit for me to say
It is a compound of two words "čtvrt" and "smršť". The first means "quarter" and the second means something like "whirlwind".
I would say it's easy to pronounce by itself but when it's in a sentence it more difficult
I think, no
I prefer keeping changing times which is more natural (you have sunrise closer to the time when you wake up), but generally summer time is better for me (more sunshine/daylight in the afternoon after work)
Winter time is the original, so winter time
But it would be best if it is as it is
I like my light not at 4 am
So summer time sounds great
Even with standard time it was dark when I went to school in winter, so whatever that it gets light bit later
I'd love it to be the standard, so called winter, time because I hate getting up early
Winter
I can live without late summer sunsets
The idea of having to wake up before sunrise the whole winter
I hate it
Standard time (winter)
People who prefer to wake up and go to work earlier can do so, but those who hate it cannot do the opposite
I find the seasonal change annoying, so I'm in favor of abolishing it
We are mainly doing it for health reasons so the decision which time to keep should be up to specialists not common people
Also, one hour move this or that way doesn't significantly help anyway
Some people here say the sun comes out at 3-4am in summer
And 4-5am is better
It sucks just as much
And during winter it can be dark by 5-6pm, while in summer it's still pretty bright at 9
One hours does shit to help
Get yourself some blinds
I just moved and my new bedroom gets so much more sunlight in the morning and I love it
Waking up has been so easy since
You have daylight until 23
The latest sunset here in late June is around 21:15 already with summer time
With winter time all year long it would be at 20:15
Yeah, but here only like within 15 minutes after sunset you can still read, but at 22h (after 45 minutes) it is practically dark - only at the west, the sky is not fully black but dark blue
400 m² is not that big
It was actually Gorbachev who stopped our bolsheviks from basically gunning down protesting students
There absolutely were these tendencies in the party until the end
God bless him
Actually no, but I've been in France only for a week or so
Here in Czechia, I often go to so called hypermarkets, because the variety of foods is much bigger than in small ones
And one of the things annoying me in say central Vienna is that all shops are really small
Bratislava
London or Moscow
1990s Ústí nad Labem or Most would be interesting
Palermo, no discussion
And if they if they set it in the 80s (Including murder of Falcone and stuff), I'd buy new computer just to play that game
Does it have to be just one city in one country
It could be more fun to have multiple
Most probably
Even shady looking neighborhoods where the protagonist can have his 1st safehouse
Also traffic would be fun, and a subway you can use
Ah yes, Semir Gerkhan as the main cop antagonist
1st quest, steal yourself some Polonez
Like
all of the old Prague centre
Overpriced food, scamming taxi drivers and exchange offices, kitschy "street artists" on the Charles Bridge, souvenir shops full of ushankas with Soviet emblems, private museums of wax figurines or whatever that have nothing to do with local culture
don't get me wrong, there's still a bunch of really nice historical buildings and things to see, but the commercial zone that surrounds them is hell
Don't go there without some prior research and common sense
You can go only a few hundred meters away to some side street and find lunch that is 4 times cheaper, etc
Whole centre of the capital city of Prague
Including food, souveniers, transportation and especially historical sites
Let's no forget to mention the marijuana products and imagery in even single one of these *gift shops*. It's ridiculous
I was showing around a friend from Japan recently and haven't been to the center myself, since like high school and I was flabbergasted
It's awful
The gift shops look all the same and are on every single corner
Yes, the sights are great, but the areas surrounding them are an eyesore
I wouldn't have though I would care, but I genuinely found the state of the historical center quite sad
I hope that coronavirus help change the abomination that tourism in Prague have become
It is an opportunity to let tourist traps go bankrupt, and to rebuild them from scratch
Airbnbs flats are already changing to long-time rent, and rent prices are decreasing
That is win for locals, both rents and apartment prices were getting out of hand before the pandemic
My dad is Turkish and whenever we visit Istanbul he immediately starts talking in Turkish so that we don't get ripped off
It's funny
I actually kinda got the "lonely Paris" experience - by going there during the big public transportation strikes last December :D Now I can't imagine coming back at a time with a normal amount of tourists, I think I'd have even more of a shock
Oh yes, and hemp flavoured absinthe, the traditional Czech drink of choice
I had to run straight across the Old Town Square on my way between classes in different faculty buildings several times a week, and I kind of developed a hatred for everything to do with mass tourism in just a few years
People from places where public transportation is really bad, so they don't even think of it as an option
To be fair, the system has its quirks too, I've seen a good deal of very confused tourists getting scolded in Czech by ticket inspectors for not stamping their tickets or buying the wrong type
I mean it wasn't intentional, we were visiting family in western France for Christmas and just spent a few days in Paris along the way, but I guess most other tourists cancelled because of the strike
I thought there would be still quite a lot of people for Christmas time, isn't that supposed to be a romantic thing
I don't wear sandals, socks or not and never been in Croatia by car or bus
Everyone likes cheese
Cheese is life, cheese is love
Are you thinking raw beef perhaps
Raw pork is dangerous to my knowledge (parasites)
Not just nordic
I hate it too
But when I think about it, I'm pale blond with blue eyes, almost all of my furniture is from IKEA, I don't really like people being close to me
I also really like hockey
I guess I just might be nordic
Czechs also think it's their trait
I guess almost whole central Europe thinks that suprisingly
Well . . . been looking for some czech comments
and I found none
So I guess in the films we just don't exist
They alredy have the Germans for the beer trope
Is it because Slovenia is the most developed country from the Eastern Bloc, but a lot of people still thinks it is a "shithole"? It is the similar to Borat, where every "Kazakh" character actually speaks in different language, but average American viewers cannot tell the difference, because to them it is some "third-world language".
Only movie including Denmark I remember is the one where some American girl marries the prince
Lodz moment
The name is strange, because according to one old Czech folk tale, there were 2 brothers, who led Czechs in Czechia, Czech and Lech
Lech then went to east and founded Poland
Maybe there's some relation
Also the tale says something about third brother and that they came from Balkans
But it's just some folk tale
Why Latvia, tho
Hungarians are from outer space
That would explain why no one can understand them
Yeah, the old chroniclers had to take the names from somewhere and since Poland was the closest independend slavic country, it could explain the names
a - but without the serif, it's basically a flipped 6
In school we teach α
That's when a turns into ə.
Sure, but that's cursive, isn't it
I stopped writing cursive when I got into high school
In Czech Silesia, we sometimes joke about wanting the rest, which is now in Poland, but it isn't really national joke
Just small regional joke
I personally “joke” about taking Silesia and Lusatia back
Would be nice
You actually care about Eurovision
In my country nobody gives a fuck
Jist curious
Ah shit, here we go again
What about Moravia reclaiming you (only North, but Alps aren't that important)
I wanna Great Moravia back
But you wouldn't be able to change sides here
Would it even be fun without helping to start/starting war and then changing side to the attacked countries
Jo, mimochodem nechcete ho zpátky
Přihodíme i prezidenta a jeho mluvčího zadarmo
Yeah, we also sometimes joke about wanting Polish Silesia, but mostly we Czech Silesians do
I’m from Prague and I’d take it back too
Not even Ireland
You can have Brno
It was one of the top topics yesterday
But then again, we had a large building fire that killed several people, so it obviously wasn’t the very top one
They had foreign relations expert to talk about it
All I know is that they arrested a close person to the opposition candidate and that she is hiding somewhere, that they minimalised public transport, so people can’t protest, they’re arresting people, and that around 40 % voted before the election date
They also banned independent people so that they can’t see what’s going on
I personally think that the results are rigged af
EDIT: Belarusians, who live in Czechia, had a small protest in front of the Belarusian embassy while they waited in the line to the voting room
It’s so angering, honestly
He gave himself almost 80 %. How dare he
When I see what he’s doing to your beautiful country, I just wanna punch him in his pig face
And there’s no way in hell she got only 7 %. Wtf
Btw, what are your thoughts on the opposition candidate
P. S. With your English, I think a lot of employers would want another Belarusian
I heard about the internet
It’s awful
But also laughable because it doesn’t work when people use VPN, which is such an easy tool to use
It somewhat reminds me of 1984 by G. Orwell
But the book was meant to be a warning, not a guide
Maybe you can overthrow him like we overthrew the commies
Please, stay safe
Why is their "small coffee" so huge
The concept of home owner associations and how much power they apparently have over what you do with your property
No clothes hanging outside
No basketball hoops
Fines for having a damn VEGETABLE PATCH
I have no idea how common those rules actually are, but when I see articles about them online, it's pretty confusing
Also super specific dresscodes in schools, I've never seen anyone care so much about what kids/teenagers (let's be honest, girls
) wear
Everybody keeps saying how insane the drinking age is, but they don’t actually know shit about the reason
It’s biological
Consuming too much alcohol before you reach 21 years of age is fucking bad for you
We have an all-volunteer military too and no one really gives a shit about it
If anything, that makes the people who join less of a "hero", they voluntarily chose a dangerous occupation for the money
What developed countries even still have a military service, besides Israel
Not everything
At least bottled beer looks quite small to me (like a kids version)
Or Serbia or Lithuania
Haven't been to the US, but I've never seen anyone flying more flags than those guys
Serbia is the winner in Europe, I'd say
Yeah
I've always loved flags, too
When I was 7, I knew the flags of all the countries in the world
The only difference between communism and other ideas is that other ideas didn't lead to 100+ million corpses and devastation of dozens of countries
Trust me on that one
be glad that your snow speaks Finnish
My words exactly
Most times, when I speak to Americans, I just have a weird feeling that they're only being polite
It's something in the way they speak
Like the words they say are kind, but their tone of voice sounds kinda insincere
There is literally a notable difference between how your body deals with alcohol consumption when you’re 16 and when you’re 21
Can't speak for Germany, but the closest thing to this that we have on our census is "nationality" and it's optional
Most people don't even fill it in
In fact, I think that gathering information about race is illegal in most European countries
Though don't quote me on that
Can confirm
Disregarding Pa, I rather like kg/cm^2 (technical atmosphere) which is very close to the standard atmosphere
Probably Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Velké Losiny or Písek [*literally translates to sand*]
I think Brno
Even though we make fun of it, the city center is beautiful
It’s also a really short train ride from Český Kras (beautiful cave system)
And it’s definitely not full of foreign turists
I'd say Mikulov, it's quite the way away (about 4-5 hours from Prague), but it's a really beautiful town
I loooove Bamberg and the beer
We went there during advent (a few weeks before Christmas)
The architecture is so beautiful
Jeseníky mountains is a hidden gem that nobody outside of Czechia and maybe few Poles really know about
Šukat
In Czech it means to fuck
In Polish it means to search
Droga
In Czech--Drug
In Polish--road
This is not a word, but it's fascinating to me nonetheless, compare the Japanese `ん` and European `n`, they're so frickin similar and represent the same sound
Body - points in czech
Host - guest in czech
And example by pornhub: Horní Police ~ upper shelf in czech x horny police
In colloquial Czech people frequently say "Fakt, jo
" meaning roughly "Oh, really
". The pronunciation is very similar to fuck you
Foreigners listening to Czech conversation might think we swear all the time
"(Die) Kurve" sound like "Kurva"
(Die) Kurve= curve
Kurva=slut
Mbabaram for "dog" is
you guessed it, "dog"
Same here
*Pusa* is "mouth/kiss" and ***pusy*** are "mouths/kisses".
If we're talking about our words for cat, don't forget to mention "mačka". It means a cat in Slovak, but in Czech, it means a crampon
Also Finnish seitsemän looks very similar but once again, there is no proved relationship between those langauges
Also list - leaf in Czech
Otrok in Czech means slave too
It's not Czech but Slovak
In Czech departures (of buses, trains) are "odjezdy". Also "autobusov" is Slovak, in Czech it's "autobusů".
Yeah, there Is plenty more
Pass read as [pa:s]  means belt
Two [tu] And ten Are indexing pronoun in czech
More doesn't mean anything related to moře (sea) etc
Well, we have our own language (Czech), but we have a lot of news about Germany and Poland
You know, I think it's better
We need only one big country to see all bullshits of our president (stupid idiot with dementia) and prime minister (thief, murderer and ex-agent of communist police)
I hate them
Ireland
Language wouldn't be that much of a problem as my English isn't that bad and I am trying to learn Irish, but there are other things holding me back home
Finland
I love the nature, the weather, for the first time in my life I would be the outgoing person in the group, and t education system is a dream
Right here
Somewhere in France, closer to sea the better
Awesome language and I could use a different setting
No, it's just a hobby
But just the idea of relocating to different country is scary to me
I am not very adventurous type
I do have commitments, but who knows how it will be in the future
I bet he felt safe
Like who speaks Irish
Five people
Ten
Here in Czechia we are using [German deck] and French too
Never seen them
We call the French ones "normal" or "standard" (didn't even know they are French)
We also use the German ones (which I also didn't know were German) which we call "mariášové" which is derived from the card game "mariáš" (funny thing I learned today, the name comes from the French word "Mariage", so we use German cards to play a game with French origins but use French cards for almost everything else)
We have our own Bohemian deck, vastly similar and coming from Bavarian (south german) deck
Fun fact, Bavaria (Bayern) was Bohemia’s best friend for a long time in the middle ages
We use it too (Czechia)
I think something like that is in Czechia at the age of 65
But I could be wrong so correct me
Here they have to do it when they are 65, then 68 and then every two years
I think for people that are getting in the senior age around now even that won't be necessary
The grocery deliveries are pretty much everywhere
We just need to teach our moms to make few clicks
For me it's below 10°C during longer stays outside (let's say 30+ minutes)
Also it depends on alcohol level in my blood, physical activity or wind
30°C is my limit
Anything below that is very uncomfortable for me
Given the fact I live in Central Europe, I was apparently born at very wrong place
20+ is t-shirt weather
15-20 is denim jacket weather
5-15 is denim jakcet with a hoodie weather
5 and lower is I should've bought something warmer than a denim jakcet weather
So that would be cold for me
When my old diesel has problem to start
So below 8°C
I'm The type of person who likes it colder so around 20C is comfy for me
Below 10C I usually wear somewhat thick hoodie and below 0 thin hoodie + jacket and gloves or hat depending on the temperature
I'd say under 8, generally speaking
It's 6 degrees right now and I just started wearing an autumn/winter coat this week
For me it entirely depends on what the temperature was yesterday
Czechia confirms
European Union, the map of Europe and Germany for some reason
Ha, in my place we didn’t even have snow this year
Gatekeeping coldness like a pro
In Czech we wouldn't use "having big balls" (mít velký koule), we would only say "having balls" (mít koule)
And it would mean being brave
I believe in the party I vote for, but of course some members of it can be corrupt or incapable
No one is a saint
I was unironically a hardcore edgy libertarian in my teens/early 20s, so I voted for our small and irrelevant libertarian party once or twice with great enthusiasm
Later on, I believed in the Pirate Party for some time
Nowadays it would definitely be a lesser evil kinda vote, and it always is in presidential elections
I don't believe in politicians, so it is always the lesser evil
It is always a bit of both
Of course there are parts of the party that I don't quite like, making it the 'lesser evil' - but still I believe in the party as a whole, else I'd just sit the elections out
I don't know, if that counts, but I agreed with their program, because it looked doable, so there was little chance of empty promises
I didn't believe, that they would win, but I agreed with their opinion
Lesser evil
Parties that align with my beliefs the most are too small to succeed (meaning nowhere near 5% of votes necessary to get in the Parliament)
I always had that kinda "I have no clue what am I doing here" from Pirates
That sounds pretty cool, I always wondered what it's like living in a country with less than 1 mil people
But then, I live in a city of 400k and I don't even know my municipal politicians at all, maybe I just go to the wrong saunas
Yeah IDK, they're bland centrists, I guess I thought they would be a part of some huge pan-European reform movement, but that just didn't go anywhere
About 25%.
Generally seen as bad habit, but generally accepted
way more than that probably, whenever i go outside there are tens of people smoking, in restaurants basically everyone is outside because smoking indoors was banned
I live in Czech republic
I have a long weird history with Czech republic
It started after the end of the cold war, when some czech people came to my small town to work in factories
Then I became intrigued with the country
Came when I was 17, and for some reason it keeps pulling me back
"Where are you from
"The Czech Republic
"Ah, Czechoslovakia
For the love of god, don't say that Polka originated in Poland
Calling our country "Eastern European". It's central European
I might be ignorant here, but what exactly is wrong with this
Finland is geographically in Scandinavia, isn't it
even better yet Czechia
yep, even worse we have a fuck ton of memorials as well and no one says "Well I can't visit the CZ because there are too many memorials for concentration camps
" fucking dumb honestly
totally understand, reddit likes that dad joke with czech check
I've heard way too many times as a kid that the Roma originate from Romania
Same with us
Calling us Eastern European or outright Russian triggers me to no end
sure they do, time ago I read some interview with Slovakian ambassador here in Prague, he said something like once per week there is a meeting of people from Slovakia and Slovenia embassy where they just exchange wrongly addressed mail
(and have some beer and booze because it is in Prague after all
Czechia FTW
To answer your question, both Czechia and Czech Republic are completely valid/official names
You can choose whichever you like more
No, Czech Republic is still the official name, as is Czechia
Czechia was accepted as an official shorter version a few years ago, since a lot of the countries around us are also republics but have other, more convenient names (e.g. people call it Slovakia and not the Slovak Republic)
However, the name only partially caught on and a lot of people don't like it, including me
I'll keep calling us by the longer name
And to answer your first question, no, it's not the same thing
Czechoslovakia split into two separate countries in January 1993 - the Czech Republic and Slovakia
Czechs, all the time, intentionally
Prague people to Brno people: North Slovakia
Oh, okay, thanks for the explanation
I always assumed that everything north of the Baltic was Scandinavia
It wasn't for a long time but nowadays it's official
People aren't usually very angry when you call it that, but they might consider it a bit rude
Yeah we didn't create that flair
Borrowed from Polish and used without regard for actual Czech word rules
For example, some countries are female some male and some neutral
To Německo (Neut), ta Amerika (fem), (actually can't come up with male on the spot but it exists)
In Czech Čechy or Česko is neutral
However, in English, it's used as female
That is my personal problem with it
Another one is that we have been a part of many, many, many countries over the span of our existence and we like to show off that we are on our own now
That is quite easy when you just add Republic on the end and are done with it
But nooo NATO just HAD to have a shorthand name
We put Czech republic as our shorthand name and said fuck it that will do, but our new politicians really wanted to help our branding by doing the great thing of adding another name to the list to add to the confusion, now you can call us any of these and are guaranteed to piss off someone
\- Bohemia
\- "Basically just another part of Eastern Europe"
\- "Basically Russia"
\- Czechoslovakia
\- Austria-hungary
\- Yugoslavia (for some fucking reason)
\- \*insert any middle eastern country because no one has any basic geographic knowledge\*
\- and now newly Czechia
Also, you know, the fact that people mistake us for Checnya REALLY doesn't help
Like when some terrorists from Chechnya a few years back bombed a public place and a bunch of idiots on twitter started going hard against the Czech republic
Even though we had fuck all to do with it
yes
sauce: am a Czech who says that all the time intentionally
love you bratia
I mean when you look into our history, we have nothing to do with Eastern Europe except for those 41 years under communism
You guys have a lot of history with it as Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a major Eastern European power
It's because Czechs don't speak Swedish
Ten Uzbekistán.
That’s dumb
Maďarsko, but Uhry too
cool, most people living there don't tho
Czechia, in Czech it would be basically Čechia which is female
And yes I know that Czechy in polish makes sense
What I am saying is that in English saying Czechia makes none
When the crisis come ppl need to craft protective equipment to survive because state is unprepared to protect the nation
You can throw in to the sea and expand the state
Yeah, but most of what you consume is consumed in Prague
We have subway
I think only positive thing is we can work together and help each other to provide protective equipment for everyone if state was not able to
It is also scary
when the war come what we will do
Craft weapons
Shelters
>So in this perspective I'm quite positive about this
It shows that our people are eager to fight together
That's always a good thing
Yeah you are right
Definitely not 50%. I’d say 10-20% and that is in the country known for not caring about nudity
Been in Croatia, depends on which beach you're going to, usually the big beaches noone is but swim a few meters farther and basically every single one
nude beaches are still a thing here, dozens of people lying around completely naked, kinda creepy to walk through when you randomly come across it honestly
50% is too much
Yes, you'll always see 1 maybe 2, but the big majority are not
Definitely not 50%. Probably some wishful thinking by the British redditor
If a woman takes her top off while sunbathing she will generally be the only one in the group or she is prone (face down) in which case she is not actually showing anything, she just doesn't want to have lines from the straps on her back
I have a feeling that 20 years ago more girls in their 20s went topless than now; now it feels like a domain of middle-aged women
How is LEGO expensive in your country compared to your wages
I honestly like LEGO, one of the best toys kids can get these days
But in my country it is very expensive
The bigger sets range from 1000 - 3000 Kč (40€ - 120€)
For a normal job you get like 800€. I know it sounds like we are underwaged but our country is pretty cheap to live in
But since LEGO is internation product i think it sells at relatively same prices everywhere
How is it in your country
Actually median pay in Czech Republic is around 30000 kč, so ~1125€
I quickly searched for the Millennium Falcon
The price is 650€. Honestly i didn't expect such a difference
If someone was to arrive into my home for a long time, I would definitelly try to find out who is it and not only by what he himself is saying to me
It's stranger
And if it's information given to all public to find by simply putting your name into regular browser, it's not really private, everyone can see it
But without finding anything worrying, it seems weird to tell you about that
Middle quite, Early modern no problem, then nothing and the last bit also not really a problem
All written, I don't think it would be easy spoken for me since I generaly have bigger problem with spoken word
If I can name the authors and the poem without looking up in google, am I disqualified from answering
* Macbeth: unknown word here and there, but otherwise perfectly ok
* Canterbury tales: a bit more of unknown words
One quickly adapts to the spelling, and I have enough exposure to German to survive some declensions more resembling German than modern English
* Beowulf: total gibberish
Here and there I *feel* like I understand the grammatical construction, but words
very few and far between
Early Modern and Middle are doable
Beowulf is impossible for me
And Scots can be understood but I have to fill in some words that I cannot make out and hope I got the context right
I study English though, idk if it’s relevant
> Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, and then I don't really get anything, but it still looks like English more or less
From the times he sat on the horse, he was a cavalier, truth-loving, honorable, etc, and these positive qualities made him one of the most famous in the christian and arab worlds
Too lazy to translate word-by-word
I believe that the most notable holiday in Czechia is 17th of November, due to two events that happened on that day
In 1939, the Czech students protested that the Nazis closed down Czech universities
About 50 students died iirc
That’s the reason that the International students day exists
50 years later, in 1989, there was the Velvet Revolution — a peaceful attempt to overthrow the totalitarian regime we had here since 1948
It succeeded (though it was more of a symbol, the Communist party was in ruins already back then)
In conclusion, not as interesting as many pagan holidays mentioned in this thread, but really important for the Czechs
We celebrate it too in Czechia
Bonfire, music, chill-out and witch costume party for kids
Similar thing in Czech Republic
Here it’s called Morana
Yes, Pálení čarodějnic
IIRC people made a figurine of a witch/winter, threw it in a river and then burned it on a huge pyre
But I might be confusing it with another folk tradition
Now that I think about it most Czech folk traditions sound absolutely insane when we explain them to foreigners, like whipping women on Easter, or Devils, Hell and Water spirits who drown people and keep their souls are common children stories protagonists
Oh yeah, Easter (Velikonoce)
It’s mostly on the villages nowadays, but it’s about men going door by door, slap women’s butts with pomlázka (“a braided whip made from pussywillow twigs”) to make them young and get rewarded with a shot of slivovitz
Additionally, they may throw the woman into a river (or at least a bathtub)
It may sound a bit savage, but it’s mostly fun
For the men, of course
Women (especially the younger ones) hate it
Our former prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka:
Our current president Miloš Zeman:
There is also the famous interview with our minister of finances Alena Schillerová, who couldn't even understand a simple question:
[Ex- Prime Minister Sobotka]
[Sobotka's rap (remix of the previous vid)]
[President Zeman]
Now, Zeman's English is actually pretty good, but this one sentence on 5:45, to this day nobody really knows what did he meant by
whatever he said right there
[Alena Schillerová - Minister of Finance]
Shorter versions - [1] [2]
So, this is a long video, a big part of it is in Czech, but basically, she doesn't speak english that well
When she has a prepared talk, it is written phonetic Czech
Otherwise, she doesn't know what to say at all, and if you ask ger something in english, she just runs away
On her Twitter tho, she claims that she speaks fluently
And that's all I can remember from the top of my head
Of course, there is [Stanislav Řezáč] but he's not a politician
Also this [
It is mostly famous for saying “Bubble bum” instead of “Bubble gum” and for the immensely weird quotes about steaks and bubble bums
He actually used to be extremely smart and well educated man
The aging and alcoholism just counted that in the last years
Also the [pasy] riot gate
this was a giant clown fiesta
It was so big, that it is a meme for like 5 years
The expulsion of most ethnic Germans (about 1/3 of population of the country) after the WW2, especially its first "wild" phase with lynchings and mass murders (for example at least 800 civilians in the town of Postoloprty)
It was mostly seen as a just retribution for all the Nazi atrocities and German separatism that was tied to Nazism until the 1990s and is still a popular rallying issue for nationalist and communist parties today
The communist regime rule can be seen as one big atrocity too, especially the purges of 1950s.
Then there are some medieval things, for example various massacres during Hussite wars, but that can be mostly seen as a standard medieval wartime stuff nowadays - cities razed, religious opponents being executed en masse etc
Probably deportation of 2mil Germans because of "bad man with moustache", apart from that I can't really think of anything
I would add the systemic sterilizarion of gypsies during the communist rule
That's some pretty evil shit
It was being prepared and there were some unorganized attempts, but GB and USA objected against it during the Potsdam conference
There was, however, an exchange programme of citizens with Hungary later, they were stripped of most civil rights and some of the Hungarians were also dispersed inside the state, mostly to places vacated by Germans
Many Hungarians were expelled as well, it's just not remembered much
It's mostly because Slovakia had it's own independent legislation for postwar retribution, so all that happened in nowadays Czechia between 1945 and 1948 cannot be applied there
Edit: It's worth noting taht Czech retribution was one of the most severe and bloody in all of Europe, whereas Slovak was very mild
We cannot assume some moral high ground here, especially after voting another awful regime to power
I really don't feel like they deserved to be killed
I can understand moving the to Germany
But killing them
I mean most of them were probbably regular citizens
I think there is quite a big leap from not liking someone to systemic extermination
They were sterilised after already having 2-3 kids though
I am not saying it was ethically OK, but it certainly wasn't a "systemic extermination".
That's interesting
It's a bit hard to find info on this and I never really bothered to dig deeper, but now that I know what to look for it does indeed seem to be that way
Personally I think the deportation of Germans living on czechoslovakian soil directly after world war 2
Thousands of innocent civilians were brutally murdered and slaughtered for no reason, those actions were often very organized
The murderers have never been punished
Definitely the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after WW2
It was allowed to do ANYTHING to Germans, so people taking German babies and throwing them in the river, for example, was really common
Most fucked up thing
Trust
We trusted our western allies, ( looking at you France and Great Britain ) only to betray us at Munich
Then we turned to east and trusted Soviet Union, and they taken our freedom and we became practically a colony inside Europe
Maybe thats why we are the most atheist country in the world (by some estimates)
I feel kinda embarrased i can't think about anything for czech rep
/czechoslovakia/bohemian kingdom etc
What do you know
You did some crazy shit in WW2 too
Personally, I rank our willing participation in the Roma genocide above that
The ethnic cleansing and post-war violence were a result of previous circumstances, and while abominable, they didn't fall out of the blue sky
Meanwhile, the fact that we ran the Lety concentration camp so brutally it shocked even the Nazis, and the population invented reasons to get their Roma neighbours willy nilly into it had no justification other than that we really, really, really didn't want any filthy gypsies around
Exactly
This is way worse in its nature than the retributions after the war
And the fact that the massacres agains the Germans are probably more recognized than the ones against Roma people tells a pretty bleak picture about our own awareness of our history
I dont understand
What do you mean
The trust also led to many deaths but its kinda complicated thats why I mentioned it
Its simple to say, yeah it was that time we went and killed x men and woman, we also have those
We're much closer ;)
But I wanna
We make bonfires on April 30, children dress as witches, and in some places a figurine of a witch is burned in the bonfire
So like a mashup of pre-Christian traditions (Beltane) and Walpurgisnacht, it must be a pretty old holiday
As someone who practices witchcraft, I practice more traditions than others
Or at least I know the meanings behind them
Like Beltane (Walpurgisnacht)
Most people just burn a fake witch and do bbqs
When in reality it’s mostly a celebration of fertility and love (like a May day, which comes right after)
So yeah, I like to celebrate pagan holidays (mostly Celtic and Slav)
Yeah, this is practiced in some parts of Czechia (mostly eastern Moravia I think), but only in certain villages
The figure is called Morana or simply Smrt - Death
You mean Laurel
My favourite celebration
Wow, thanks for the award  [u/FiveDaysLate] Very cool
Syllabic r go [brrrr]
Me, abstinent Czech person who doesn't like the taste of beer, wine or any other alcohol really
A Czechperson who is a vegetarian
I know that they exist, but that doesn't mean that it's just weird
Czech that doesn't like beer
I don't drink beer
I'm Czech
I don't like alcohol
I also don't enjoy watching hockey (or any sport really)
a Czech who doesn't like beer
a czech who doesn't drink beer
Me, a Czech who doesn't like svíčková
Dude Czechia is one of the best countries for vegetarians and vegans in Europe
It could be worse
You could be enjoying hugs
Burn this heretic
beat me to it
Slunce, the Sun, is neutrum, Měsíc, the Moon, masculinum inanimatum
The Sun (Slunce) is neuter and the Moon (Měsíc) is masculine
I haven't really seen them depicted as significantly gendered entities, like in kids' books they mostly had generic smiley faces or something like that
They were never distinctly feminine, for sure, either vaguely masculine or neuter - in the same way that cartoon characters default to male unless they have a pink bow and eyelashes
The ancient Slavic religion had a Sun god depicted as masculine (Dazhbog)
To Slunce a ten Měsíc. So the Sun is "it" and the Moon is "he". The Earth (ta Země) is "she".
In language the sun is neutral (to Slunce) and the moon is male (ten Měsíc) but in culture they symbolize man and woman principles like basically everywhere where pagan religions mixed with christianity
Czech has 3 genders
He, she, it
So the sun is "it" and moon is "He"
Isn't the word месяц used for moons other than earths
Also 'luna' - feminine is sometimes used in poems and stuff (not really in normal speech)
Because except Latin, I know it only in Czech :)
Definitely the era of Charles IV king of Bohemia (1346 - 1378) and Holy Roman Emperor
He rebuilt Prague, found the Charles University, the first university in cental Europe, built many castles (including Karlštejn) as well
Most of the well known sights in Prague are from his era
The interwar period
We belonged to the 10 world’s largest economies and we were a hugely proud nation
We were the “beacon of democracy” in central europe and everything worked as it should
People gave up their retirement money/military pay from the state so they can rebuild the nation
Industry was booming and even to this day we have the record of “most vehicle industries per area”.
And I agree with this
Probably during the rule of Charles IV and in recent history in the First Republic (1918-1938)
I agree
Charles IV
was pretty good king
So was Ottokar II
King of Iron and Gold (Přemysl Otakar II
) reign was also good
We had the biggers area expanse, all the way to adriatic sea, foreign masters came and taught us various crafts and also started mining of silver
He was so powerfull, that no other duke or king wanted him as Holy Roman Emperor, so they voted for little known Rudolph Habsburg as their puppet
Which went well
Also reign of Rudolph II
who was the last Bohemian king and invited lot of alchymists, astronomers and other smart people to Prague
We had many small gold glitters rather than 1 long golden era
That was some 300 years later tho
More like 50 years, since the game takes place in 1403
Damn, my bad
I thought Hussite Wars took place after Bitva na Bílé hoře in 1620
You can see history wasn’t my favourite subject
On the other side of the spectrum is Finland
A friend of mine told me that she forgot her phone in a bathroom in a club and when she came back looking for it about half an hour later, it was still there
Too many to count in Prague, lemme think of something
I took a bike ride from Liberec to the Baltic sea following the German-Polish border, or more like the Oder and Nisa rivers
The nature is spectacular
I was stunned the moment we arrived at the Dreiländer and things looked pretty great since
Not to mention the perks of living off of German food and Polish booze for a week
Apart from at least the basics of local language of whichever country you want to work in, I'd say German
French is definitely worth knowing as well
Russian can help in some countries of Eastern Europe
Most people know Pat & Mat
Polish people keep arguing, that their government is worse than ours
Serbia has a lesbian prime minister
It is somewhere illegal to pick mushrooms
American beer is sh*t
Blackpool is apparently some sort of a ghost town and not British Hollywood as I initially thought
Your government also apparently hates satire, immigrants and East Timor

We do
You're part of many jokes in our country - the Czech word "malta" means "cement grout" in English
This reminds me of Ukrainian friend
She told us she was born near Chernobyl, and when we asked if she is irradiated, she answered that ‘near’ means 200 km
In Czechia that’s a huge distance, out borders are closer that 200 km from capital
Distance scales sometime feels weird
And since last week I actually believe it
Children's animated cartoon from Czecho-Slovakia
Yeah that happens, I did the same for "Maya the Honey Bee" which I thought was Czech (probably because of the opening song by Karel Gott) and many years later I found out it was actually Japanese anime
I have no idea which one you mean, but most likely it was us
I personally know it from Strictly and on this subreddit, they say it's a place where young people go to lose virginity (or smth like that)
Reminds me of a coworker in my previous job - he said he was "from a small city near St
Petersburg" - turned out the small city had 500,000 people (which would be the 2nd largest city in Czechia) and near was 300 km
Who dat
I, too, have no idea which one they mean
I mean, just look at them:
* Chrt pln skvrn zdrhl z Brd
* Chrt pln skvrn vtrhl skrz trs chrp v čtvrť Krč, prv zhltl čtvrt hrst zrn
* Chrt pln skvrn zhltl hrst zrn
* Plch zdrhl skrz drn, prv zhltl čtvrthrst zrn
* Zdrhl krt skrz drn, zprv zhltl hrst zrn
* Vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
* Škrt plch z mlh Brd pln skvrn z mrv prv hrd scvrnkl z brzd skrz trs chrp v krs vrb mls mrch srn čtvrthrst zrn
Right, and what does medium-sized mean in Russia
In Czechia I would call a city of 50,000 medium-sized
yes, and there is also a group "We want sea instead of Poland" :)
Only one of the kids was almost bald in Lolek and Bolek, but yeah, different cartoon
Yep, pretty much my reaction the first time
Just wanted to say that I love your cheese and envy you the easy access to the Alp mountains
50 000 má Jihlava, medium je pro mě třeba Rakovník, nebo Nymburk (15 k)
Oh yeah, I thought it was a person
Thanks
Did it work
Are you offended
If not, I have something to say about the "hen" pronoun
Not only r but l as well
It's called "syllabic consonant" (sometimes also "vocalic consonant"), English has them as well
Well, mission accomplished then, I could offend a Swede (though it would be much easier in person)
Heh, it's not really that important in real life
Using i/y is much more (lucky you you don't have the same shit in past tense as we do)
Yep, a guy
And I didn't really want to offend you
But based on your replies, it worked anyway
Maybe it's not so hard to offend a Swede after all
Nah, I meant more of you using "lol" and going into offensive
We Czech would really fight about anyone connected to communism, lot of (especially elder) people say it wasn't that bad back then
Even Hitler would probably get some advocates, since we are one of the most xenophobic nations in Europe, but I think that we could all agree on the **Stellvertretrender Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren Reinhardt Tristan Eugen Heydrich**
I dont know about a single person from the past we'd hate, but maybe the Habsburgs
They were kinda shitty on the czech people, but idk, nobody's really out there saying how he hates them
Rn many people hate our premiér Andrej Babiš, but he also has his supporters, so thats kinda mixed
My picks would be Emanuel Moravec, Zikmund Lucembursky, or just Habsburgs in general to name a few
Though Heydrich and communists are some strong contenders too
I’d say that Heydrich is kinda forgotten, but I’m not sure
Oh, I totally forgot about E. M., agree, this fucker is the worst (as most traitors (not Snowden and others alike tho))
Habsburgs were bitches too, but in my opinion still not as bad as nazis/commies, and I also think that Metternich was a lot worse than your averidge Habsburg
But those are only my impressions from history lessons
Maybe Jiří Paroubek or David Rath could be added to the list too
EDIT: misstype
Well yes, kinda
But I really couldn't think of anyone else who would be hated by the most Czechs
We cannot agree whether communism was good or bad so anyone from this era kinda fails
Zeman and Babiš are the ones currently holding power, so they had to be elected, so it's as if American said Trump
-> nonsense (certainly for A LOT of people, but it divides people so much that it certainly is not the most hated persob in US)
Any former president, prime minister etc had their upholders and protestors, and it was usually almost 50/50
And anyone from anything older than 20th century is way more forgotten than Heydrich
So I chose him
But I'm really curious what would other Czechs, who's our archnemesis :D
Don't worry I paused there for a second as well
Other Slavs are able to master the pronunciation, for example my mum had a coworker from the Ukraine and he learned Czech in couple of months and now when he speaks you wouldn't know he isn't Czech
However I have never met anyone whose native language wasn't Slavic who would pass for native Czech
Well, if you include an _indistinguishable_ accent, it's very hard to achieve for any language
Probably like 10+ years of full immersion
But yeah in general, Czech is considered one of the more difficult European langauges
There's a lot of declination (7 cases, 4 genders and 5 verb classes with very different patterns + a bunch of irregularities), verb aspects, hard to pronounce consonant groups, and Czech native speakers are not very used to talking with non-natives so they may not have enough patience
The biggest difference is always in motivation, though - if you really need to, you'll learn any language to decent fluency
Speakers of other Slavic langauges tend to have a much easier time than everyone else, obviously, but their accent will always be at least a bit recognizable
I've personally never met anyone who could pass for a native speaker and didn't live here since at least elementary school age
Same as you, but our pronunciation is harder because of "ř"
This
I love languages and I’m currently trying to learn Norwegian
The grammar is easy and I see a lot of similarities in the vocabulary with German (bc their both germanic languages)
The pronunciation is however kicking my ass
Haha, yeah, usually it's like that
I know one person who is truly bilingual in Czech and Slovak with native accents, but he spent his youth moving back and forth (preschool in one country, elementary school in the other, etc
Well yeah, we learn it as part of the masculine, but since the declination is different I'd still kinda count it as "another gender" for the purpose of foreigners learning the language
I'm sure linguists have a more specialized term for that sub-category
Oh yeah, we have these paradigms too
6 of them for masculine nouns (4 animate, 2 inanimate), 4 for feminine and 4 for neuter
Sure, it's not necessarily about the number of days, but I think it's a good idea to gradually reduce full-time working hours
France has 35 hours instead of 40 and it seems to be working fine
Work hours haven't changed for the last 100 years, while technology and productivity continued improving, I think we just have to accept it can't stay the same forever and that there won't be as much human labor needed in the future
We should incentivize shorter hours, more PTO, and also come up with a realistic UBI scheme
Yes
Last year I had almost whole old vacation days so I needed to take it all to the end of the year
I choose to have free friday every week for more than 3 months during summer and it was awesome, 3 days weekend was great, I enjoyed free time much more,  and I did all my job all right in time anyway
I truly feel it was much better for work/personal life balance
But it would have to be figured out about economy of this and I'm not qualified to talk about this aspect
Are they cutting the hours as well
I don't want to have a 10-hour shift, not even for an extended weekend
Sure, but first I like to have 8 hour workday, Monday to Friday
I mean, they already can and the 4 day work week isn't happening, so
Absolutely
I worked a 5 x 8 week for like three months some 3 years ago and I hated it
I've never had a "regular" full time job since and I don't miss it at all
As a freelancer I also probably work more than what is the average, but I love that whenever I feel like it, I can just do all my work for the rest of the week on Wednesday and then slack all I want
Or take it easy and stretch the work all the way to Saturday
Even if the weekend was 4 days of the week, knowing that you "have to" go to work on a certain day, even if you really don't feel like it, would be crap
Yeah, I definitely wrote that in the most optimistic voice I could muster
I don't actually believe it will happen anymore
Sure
I freelance, so for me this is not an issue, but you're right
People tend to forget that there are many other options out there
Thanks Romania, Albania and (Yugoslavia) for refusing to take part in the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact troops in 1968
Slovakia for keeping up with our shit, Luxembourg and Austria for our royal dynasties, Poland and Hungary for the V4 and Charless de Gaulle Eurovision and Jeux sans Frontières
Thanks to our brothers and sisters from Slovakia for Korbáčiky
I would like to thank Romania for not invading us in 1968
I would like to thank Slovakia and all the Slovaks for not disowning us after the split like a bad father we essentially were
Thanks Slovakia for being bros and for our peaceful divorce
Czechs understand better with Slovaks, but I am able to communicate with Poles too, it takes much effort though
spoken polish is complete gibberish for me
Sometimes there is some familiar word but it is going to be a false friend most likely
if it's written, looking for some time into it, remember how czech looked about 500 years ago, add some knowledge of slovak and other slavic language and I get some idea what is it about
But honestly all my tries were on some multi lingual product labels or leaflets out of pure boredom so I know what I am looking at from other language versions
Not sure if this is going to work with some random text
Yeah, if they speak slow enough
But it takes much more effort than communicating with Slovaks
My understanding of Polish is not bad
I don't understand every word, but I can always derive meaning from context
Poland/Czech is incorrect
Correct is Czech/Slovakia
Before we split, we was Czechoslovakia
P.S.: We can understand Poland little bit, but Slovak language is like Czech language and conversely
My dad once had long conversation (like 40 minutes) with Hungarian guy
Dad was speaking Czech, guy was speaking Hungarian and none of them cared, mostly, because they were both superdrunk
Also my dad eas speaking this way with few French and Swedish people
As my grandpa always says, alcohol brings people together
Also I should add, that my dad speaks only Czech and few words in english
You are right, the languages are so similar, that some people even said there is no czech language and slovak language, they said it's czechoslovak language
I could go to slovakia, pick up first person i meet and have endless coversation in which I would understand 99,9% of words
The fact we were once one country also helps, because we also know the meaning of slovakian words, that are different, because it became part of our culture
There are also many slovaks, that didn't learn czech at all, still get jobs and have a normal life and czech friends
if I remember stuff from school correctly both czech and polish used to be very similar languages hundreds years ago but we did lot of language reforms, they don't or in different way than us
That's my experience as well
When I met Poles on vacations or at my work when visiting our Warsaw office, I usually had little problems understanding Poles but they had problems understanding me
Tried watching and reading Polish news and I could understand the general meaning (understanding was higher when written)
I know, I just wanted to show how similar our languages are
But I don't think they are the same
Slovak is often perceived as some sort of "esperanto" of Slavic languages, I guess that's understandable given its central position among all the 3 slavic language subgroups
Not in the news that often, but it feels like the internet is drowning in US politics despite Americans being the minority
It infiltrates even the most innocent sites and subs like r/pics or r/murderedbywords or r/whitepeopletwitter
There was even a political post in r/idiotsincars
I hate it
I think daily we have a few
It's "usa this" and "usa that". It's very often about Trump
Yeah, I personally don't mind too much
Whether we like it or not, America is economically and militarily the most important country in the West
I just scroll past the news that I don't care about
>Understandably, there have also been teething problems with our breakneck growth
Members of the community have written in to comment on the quality of submissions and some of the less respectful debate that has been hosted on the subreddit
As moderators, we see this and recognise it as an issue
And how do you want to solve this issue
At least not in the sense you are refering to
I traveled a lot over the years and lived in 4 countries so let me chime in with a non-western European opinion
I am factually from Europe, therefore at some level of analysis, I am European, it's just a matter of how much I identify with that label
And the answer is not a lot
I feel 0 connection to Dutch people even after living there for years
Feel 0 connection to people from Greece (just as a representative country) just because we are on the same side of the Pangea split
However I feel connection to west Slavic countries (Slovaks and Poles) everywhere I go
Similarly with Serbians
So I would say I identify with like-minded people, then with nationality, then perhaps with some form of Slavic identity
and only then maybe as European to a small degree
But I'm definetely heavily against any form of federation or superstate
Our country has been ruled and ordered around by pan-european superstates for decades and I don't like them or trust them
No, I do not, and imo something like federation is never gonna happen, but I'm all for European cooperation
> Hello everyone,I would like to know what do you think about this topic: The so called "Common European identity".
People who were outside of Europe and surroundings usually understand how much do Europeans have in common
Ant-fucking about the tiny differences between neighbours is the pastime of people who never left their village
> First of all,do you believe that this actually exists and do you believe also that it is possible in the future that this common identity could be the basis of a hypothetical "European state/federation" ?
Let me quote from the "Demon-Haunted World" by Carl Sagan, chapter 25, "Real patriots ask questions":
Some  of  the  opponents  of  the  US  Constitution  insisted  that  it  would never work;  that  a  republican  form of government spanning a  land  with  'such  dissimilar climates,  economies,  morals,  politics,  and peoples,'  as  Governor  George  Clinton of New York  said,  was  impossible;  that  such  a  government  and  such  a  Constitution,  as  Patrick  Henry of Virginia declared,  'contradicts  all  the  experience  of the  world'.
I would prefer to be called European over my nationality
I have friends all over Europe and besides language I don't see much difference
If it was widely accepted, I’d state my “nationality” as european
I have been learning european languages, history, culture, cuisine, geography, and politics since kindergarden
Pre-covid, travelling abroad in Europe was not a big deal, I’d leave the country 2-4 times a year, and that was before I started dating across borders
My family’s nostalgic places are strewn across the continent
Though I go into drunken ramblings about the unfair history we’ve had with out neighbours, I love y’all, even if you did my country wrong or if you’re passing some concerning laws
There is some kind of European identity, because after all, nearly all of our languages came from one family
When you look at european mythologies, you can see some simmilarities
But I don't think it's a full identity
There are still differences between us
I can see that we share something in common with countries who used to be in Austria-Hungary + with Germans
I can see it with Slavic nations and Eastern European nations as a whole
But for example I just can't see simmilar identity between us and Spain, Portugal, Ireland, UK, France or southern Italy
It just doesn't click
What I personally hate about this European identity is to see how people, who we call here "europhiles", fetishize it
They basically don't approach it as something naturall, but rather they try to artificially create their vision of the true European identity and that's just no go for me
I think it exists
I've never had a cultural shock when travelling in the EU or meeting people from European countries who come here
Sure, it is not quite like home, but it is similar enough
I did, however, have several cultural shocks when talking to people from came here from other continents
However I think that European identity is not as strong as American identity, so not sure if we can ever have a true federation - even now, there are bigger countries who have a tendency to just take over and try to bully smaller countries into agreeing with whatever they decided
Maybe it's not because they are Asians, but because they are locals
I did my exchange in Germany, but never had any local friends
I befriended many Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Americans or other Europeans, but no Germans
Hm interesting
I think I feel much bigger connection to, for example, Austria and Germany, than to Serbia
I feel like our mentality is much more similar to Germans, we have over a thousand years of common history, we have a very similar beer culture xD
With Serbia I have not much to say
The only connection I feel to them is that somewhen one and half thousand years ago we split from the same Slavic branch and now we speak a vaguely similar language, but the mentality is different, culture is more distinct and overall I just feel more like home when I’m in Austria
You're absolutely correct mate
And Czech Republic has the same minority in superpower problem
While I agree with most of what you said, I think you are thinking of western Europe
Go to Poland and ask them about LGBT, go to Russia and ask them about democracy, go to Serbia and ask them about pacifism, go to balcans and ask them about accepting history
There is still notable divide between east and west
East tends to be more conservative and anti EU
Many eastern countries were for centuries opressed by their neighbours and don't want to give up their independence again
Fair, that has been my experience of knowing Serbians for decades
I always click instantly
But I agree with you that with Austrians and Germans there is a bond
Just more complicated due to all the wars, envy and disparity
Yes, that is definetly true, but still, our values differ throughout the continent
I was really disapointed by Pisa
Other places in Tuscany are much better imo
I love Pisa
It was beautiful
The white building really poped up after we reached the entry to the area
Then we had great lunch for a quite good price and while eating we were listening to the cliche Italian music played by busker
It was the most beautiful lunch of my life
I’m sorry for the horrible shoes some of us wear
I don’t get that either
The Czechs approve lol
I personally like Brighton and Hastings
But I’ve been to England only once and I really want to visit other places
Prague is great, but it's a way better experience if you understand the language a know all the cool hidden non-touristy places to go to
yeah Ayia Napa was kinda a shock, still very nice but it felt like I was in Ibiza
The beaches were beautiful but so crowded
I loved Tenerife
I guess Russia
Not really sure
Slovaks are our bros and we're kinda cool with all our neighbours, so Russia is the best pick, especially when it comes to sports
Wassup Slovakia
We have strange fraternal/rival relationship with Slovakia
Most hated country is probably Germany
Not really a country but Moravia
It's mainly Praha vs Brno but it applies to the the whole country
I was also thinking Russia
Germans gave us Sudety back so we are cool, Austria is nice quiet neighbour, Slovakia is our little brother and Poland is a big weird guy but friendly
I think I'll disagree on that one
You need to be an equal first to be a rival
I love our country, but c'mon
It's like ants thinking they are rivals with humans because they stepped on an anthill once
I visited Russia last year and you know what their reaction mostly was
"Oh, you are from Czechoslovakia
So yea
I have the same feeling, for everything Russia have done to us
With Slovaks it is like friendly rivalry
Next prove of Russia is that, what happened today
Russian extremists ,,attacked'' our embassy in Moscow
Never heard of it
Drunk people here usually go to bed, no to shower
I have
Had been drinking hard night before, went to bed around 5, woke up at 7 to get to work, still drunk obviously
Tried to gather myself, failed and decided that shower would freshen me up
Went there and passed out unconscious, woke up soon enough in my shower cabin and thanked God I was sitting
Terrible experience, never drank gin afterwards
In German, Meer sometimes means lake, and See sometimes means sea
So it is not that clear-cut
Otrok in Slovenian means child, in Czech it means slave
Eventually - in the end in English
Eventuálně - at some instance in Czech
Slavic languages have lots of them
Hladna pića = cool drink on croatian And hungry pussy in czech
Otrok = children in croatian And slave in czech
Host in czech means guest
Čerstvý means Fresh in Czech, Cherstviy means rotten in Russian
The pronunciation is very similar
German - der Stuhl - a chair
Czech - stůl - a table
This made me so confused when I first heard it
Pronounced the same, a small difference in meaning
Polish: Szukat = To look for something
Czech: Šukat = to fuck something
I've got one
CURVA means in Spanish an italian curve or corner
KURVA In Czech and Slovak and KURWA in Polish and Sorb means bitch
Robota drogova would remind me selling drugs as robota means work in Slovakia
Also remember that dívka means girl in czech And děvka Is a bitch
In Polish these meanings Are reversed
Trus in czech means shit
Kačka can be either duck or familiar nickname to crown (currency)
Trus in Czech means excrement
> Trus in Russian is a coward
Trus in Belarusian is a rabbit
And in Czech, it's manure
Pila in czech =saw (the tool)
Children are technically slaves
They do a lot of works around house and parents dont pay them minimum wage
They just provide them clothing, food and shelter
In the past, children did a lot of works around farms just to support family
Families didnt have any buypower to buy machines, so they they got "bio-robots".
I remember in Bulgaria I saw a dish named "nervozno köfte". Googled it, it's a thing:
Imagine a dish called "nervous köfte".
It literally means: "I fuck drugs into the toilet"
I heard that from NFKRZ I don't speak Russian but I was just curious
It's not that bad, but of course I'd like to move away eventually
Ideally, pretty much any of the  "dark green" countries would be great (Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, possibly northern Germany, New Zealand, Canada,...), I'm not too attached to any particular place
Realistically speaking, France is probably my best option because my partner being a French native makes things easier
I've never been a francophile, but Duolingo is going pretty well so far
EDIT: As for why, obviously higher purchasing power is a big factor, but also the quality of public services, real estate prices (Czechia is insane in comparison with incomes), and more progressive open-minded societies
I'm really not vibing with the Czech mentality, especially in the 2010s...
I kinda like living in the Czech Republic
It's close to every other country in Europe, in case I feel like traveling, I like the countryside and the multitude of old castles and chateaus everywhere, there is a lot to do in the cities, our standard of living is not half bad, even though our wages are much lower than in Western Europe, and overall I don't have all that much to complain about
Of course, we have our problems
I wish people were a little warmer and the politics wasn't such a mess
But seeing what problems some of the more western countries have, I'd say we're not in a bad position
I certainly do
Yes, there are problems in politics, but that happens everywhere and yes, not every public service is perfect
I still like living here, the rural areas are beautiful, there’s a lot of things to see and do and because we’re in the middle of Europe (I know that’s technically Lithuania) we don’t have to travel too long to go to other places
I love living here
I love how things (in day-to-day life) work, the countryside, architecture, etc
I'm not so thrilled about the political situation and the relatively low GDP (and wages) compared to the EU
I constantly get confused by people's opinions and I can't say whether most people piss me off or whether I just see input from the loud minority
Although I am probably going to have the same issue anywhere
I'm thinking about moving abroad for a couple years, depending on how I perfect my German
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, UK, Belgium
though I only know Germany and Austria well enough to actually consider moving there
The cultures are similar to mine, the language isn't that hard, living standards are higher according to some lists
And I legitimately miss Germany's trash collection and recycling system
It's a pain at first but later it's so, so satisfying
I like the monuments that are everywhere here and our colourful nature and culture too (it's mix of a lots of anothere cultures)
I like the living standarts - living here is cheap, but we're developed (it's somethink that you can't see at most countries)
Similar here :D
(But we aren't TOO small and don't have too high mountains, but we have similar culture and living standarts)
Yeah that's only thing I miss here too
Your English is great for that age
Haha, you know what
I visited Finland in 2013 (absolutely loved it) and back then I thought that Finland was one of those utopian countries with pretty much no problems
My friend, with whom I was staying the first couple of days, cured me of that illusion right quick
He told me about all the things Finnish people were complaining about and that was the moment when I realized that no matter where you go, there are always problems and issues to be solved
And that people elsewhere complain just as much as in my country
In the end it's about being content with what you have and improving what is within your power to improve
I believe that a couple of years back, there was a petition to replace Poland with sea, lol
Perfect location for travelling, everything in Europe is close be it UK, Spain or Bulgaria
Lack of sea sucks, always thought what it would be like to live close to the sea and just casually go there whenever I'd like to
I love our borders, almost all of our borders are natural, formed by mountain ranges
This also creates a bit of a problem especially during autumn/winter, our country is basically one big bowl/valley and clouds/fogs tend to be trapped here during the colder months so it can happen I don't see sun for several weeks
Being located in the center of the continent is cool now when we have peaceful neighbours but historically it was a big mess and we got caught in power battles all the time
I wish we had a more Atlantic climate, I hate the big differences between suffocating summers and freezing winters that we get here in the middle of the continent
Also having to own clothing for all temperatures, both heating and AC/fans, etc
I just want a stable 10-25 C temperature range and an oceanic breeze, that would be perfect, even without being directly at the sea
We have a saying that Czechia is the grain of sand between the gearwheels of west and east
Czechia kinda sucks for renewables - not enough wind, not enough sun, relatively small rivers
That's why we need nuclear
Yeah, Ano is just a scheme to rob the country of as much money as possible
From one countryman to another, I just have to ask: do you actively dislike our country as a whole, or do you just have a feeling of not belonging (being apathetic, I guess)
I'm not gonna judge you either way, I just wanna know since I honestly love it here
you can lay the cable (položit kabel), you can throw a poop (hodit bobek), jump away (odskočit si), or go for the big one (jít na velkou)
Trůnit - sitting on the throne, literally "throning".
Also - going where even the king has to walk
Ztrestat porcelán - punish the porcelain
"Oh god, he is calling me again
" "Who is calling you
" "Poopin
" "Who the hell is poopin
" "What
You don't know him
The Russian man, Vladimir Poopin
He's calling me like every day
Now in Czech, it's not actually Vladimir Poopin but instead Italian man Franchesco Serruti
I had to change it a little because of translation to keep the joke
In Czech: "Ty jo, už mi zas volá." "Kdo ti volá?" "Serruti
" "Kdo je Serruti
" "Cože? Ty ho neznáš? Ten Ital
Franchesco Serruti
Volá mi snad každej den
My uncle owned one when I was a kid
He was swearing about it constantly, though
Best car on the normal market
Especially with 1500 engine as Skoda didn’t produce these
I wouldn't necessarily call it the best car
so what was better
(From normal network, not expecting answer like Ford Escort from tuzex
Wanna go out
Yeah
*ordering* I'll have a coke please
EXCUSE ME WHAT
Italian cars don't bother you if you don't have a seat belt
I remember an interview from a lady who came here over from the US and her mother was freaked out that she's flying to soviet czechoslovakia so she packed her bags with cans of various foods to survive
She expected there to be no cars or clean water
Not even Kofola
You could always buy a Kofola
Non-alcoholic beer is everywhere in CZ and considered an acceptable choice if you've got a reason for it
Non-alcoholic beer is everywhere in CZ and considered an acceptable choice if you've got a reason for it
Cola is a kids drink
What the fuck
What the fuck
Yeah, but Coca Cola is just crazy sweet and that's the main reason why adults usually don't drink it (but kids love it)
We have Kofola which is little better
Same here
We're earlier gen Z, and my schoolmates get wasted weekly

Many, even the most classics of classics, like Cinderella's sisters choping chunks of their feets off, Red Riding Hood and grandma being actually eaten and cut out of wolf's belly, evil queen put into hot iron shoes, Jeníček a Mařenka who put the evil witch in burning oven
then some Otesánek who ate everything starting with his parents and I would surely find more, I vaguely remember some fairy tale where goat intstines and murdered step sister played a role I read around 10
But since they are child stories, these things in them are said in such manner that I don't think it disturbs children, only parents who think about it as adults, I certainly didn't find anything weird about girls cuting off toes and heels to fit in shoe as a child, because I didn't think about it more than "it's just magical story".
We have nice movies
As a child I loved books from Finish author Hannu Mäkelä about Mister Hoo( *Herra Huu* /  *Herra Huu saa naapurin*  /  *Herra Huu muuttaa* )
It's about small wizard living in present times, but don't understand them much, who  sometimes experiences quite scary adventures
I remember some TV movie fairy-tale with blinded prince who had to roam the world too, but it wasn't Rapunzel I think
I don't know but it was there
Also, every story gets many variations and some pieces are taken and made into another story so you can find many other kind of similar
If I remember correctly:The girl is living with her grandma
A message arrives from her father, saying they finished the house and grandma should send their daughter to them
The daughter travels to a deep space colony,  but when she arrives her parents aren't there, only robotic grandma, who will say her that her father will return at 1:30PM
But the father will not arrive and something goes wrong with the robot
At the end - the real grandma arrives and saved the girl from the robot - presumably because she had got a new message, that parents will not be available
And there is also some metaphor there I believe
> Logan's run
Logan's run book was published 5 years latter and the movie 16 year latter, but the 60s was a fountain of inspiration in general
Depends
Was the place easily accessible by public transportation
I wouldn't call anything further than 1
5 km "nearby" unless you can get there under 15 minutes
Well, in here (at least in the younger generation) day drinking is not really a thing
We just call it drinking and we don’t really care what time it is
That being sad, it usually doesn’t really have negative connotations
But the drinking usually consists of beer and some shots anyway, so it’s not really drinking
But getting drunk is (at least in my social circle) okay
If you do it alone, it's not good, but it's normal to go with friends in pub
I would add that lot of people drinks after sport during the day
It's common to make bike trip to pub/restaurant and have a Beer or two
Nobody usualy gets hammered during the day
In my fields it is most common, that people drink mainly when together at pub and would not have a beer at home
I'll give you a kind of a Czech answer - letting minors drink in bars
Not that they changed the legal age or anything, it's been 18 as long as I can remember, but the first time I got drunk was when I was 14
It wasn't even in a horrible dive bar, it was in a major club in my hometown
That was about 14 years ago
I vaguely remember that when I was around 16, they suddenly tightened the laws around the penalty for letting minors drink and it became extremely difficult to find a place to illegally drink, if you were a minor, so we had to resort to drinking at home
Then I turned 18 and stopped caring about it
In fact, it seems like a weird dream that it was a thing in the first place
Nowadays I fully approve of the tighter checks, because I certainly don't want to sit one table ovee from the likes of 15 year old me in a bar
They sometimes ask me for an ID card when I'm in a pub/restaurant I've never been to and order beer
I'm 23
Huh, I recently turned 18 and it was still pretty easy to find a put where minors would get served
To je smutný. Je mi líto současných teenagerů.
Can I hear the sound of that whistle anywhere
They keep asking me in shops to this day
I'm fucking 28
People tell me I look 24 at the most, though, and that's when I'm not wearing a mask
But surely they wouldn't sell you beer just anywhere, right
Where are you from
Yeah they're asking me in stores aswell
At one hand it's nice to know I'm not aging too much, on the other it's annoying to carry ID every time I wanna grab some beer
not anywhere, but it's not like Večerky and pubs that serve minors are rare
It raises question
Why does god need advertisement
No, some religious weirdo (mostlikely jehova whiteness) might have something written on the house but I didn't see a billboard
I haven't seen any in Czechia
So I don't think there are
In all of Europe, I’ve seen one semi-religious billboard
It was a commercial for a new edition of Bible that was special in some way
I think
Not this kind of things but we do have posters with butchered fetuses from time to time (Prague here)
Well, you can guess how it is in Czechia
Ah yes the gynecomastia Jesus
I've seen one by some cult, not sure if it was by Jehova witnesses, but definitely by some weird christian cult
we had family nearby with house like this and they were openly jehowist (and probably something else) but yes If I remember correctly these nonsenses on the house was just nonsenses, not jehova related
I think the government wanted to ban advertisements along roads so that people wouldn't stare at them when they are supposed to pay attention to the road
I can understand Slovak probably like 99%, the easiest one after that is probably Croatian, then all the other Slavic languages
Most slav languages (not the Balkan slav tho)
Slovakian, Polish, Russian and Ukranian (in that order)
Slovak, both spoken and written is mutually inteligible with Czech
It's almost identical
. | Singular CZ | Plural CZ | Singular PL | Plural PL
nominative | voda | vody| woda | wody
genitive | vody | vod| wody | wód
dative | vodě | vodám| wodzie| wodom
accusative | vodu | vody| wodę| wody
vocative | vodo | vody|wodo| wody
locative | vodě | vodách|wodzie| wodach
instrumental | vodou | vodami| wodą| wodami
Who were these people
I always hear about Czech people not understanding Slovak, but I've never met any
I was born in '88 and so I never had much Slovak on TV, but I still find it very easy to understand
(Even if I'm not foolish enough to try and speak it)
TV is completely irrelevant nowadays
Ask any kid or teenager if they watch regular TV stations
I bet you will find very few
People watch  Youtube, Social media etc
They have more contact with Slovak than I had in the 90s.
Not always always, it depends on grammatical gender and each of them have ["template nouns"] and after that you have each of the suffixes
They're very similar in all those aspects, so you should understand one when you know the other
(Apparently, that's not true for younger people, but otherwise, it's usually fine
) They're not as close as dialects of the same language, because some vocabulary is rather different, there are some variations in their grammar, but to me, the core thing stays the same and they're as close as two languages from the same family can be, probably also because of the shared history
They do sound different, which is probably why Polish or Russian people have an easier time understanding Slovak
I'd say those are all 'softer sounding' Slavic languages, while Czech is pretty harsh
Sometimes a person can say a few words in one and it takes you a few moments to realise they're not speaking the other
And we can totally spend an evening together drinking and understanding each other, even if the topic of "what's that word" or "why would you write an i there, it should be a y, it seems wrong" will come up pretty often
Misspelling of cigarette brand names
No matter how well you speak English
Camels are /kamelky/, Viceroys are /vícerojky/, P&S are /pé-eska/, etc
Deep fried cheese
[Párek v rohlíku] would be the most iconic one
It's like a hot dog, but the sausage is stuffed in a [roll]
But a simple "klobása" with bread, which is just like Polish "kielbasa", is probably more commonly purchased at festivals, hockey matches etc
If you are in a buffet then it’s probably smažák (fried cheese) served with fries and tartar sauce
But as someone mentioned it’s párek v rohlíku or klobása with bread and mustard or ketchup
Fried cheese in a roll
Langoš - deep fried dough with cheese, garlic and tomato sauce on it
Here's a picture of our prime minister eating one
It’s pretty fucking good but I think more national one is svíčková.
See, I always thought bramboračky were a more ubiquitous fast food
Common fast foods are also bramboráky - sort of potato pancakes or originally hungarian langoš - often with cheese, garlic and  ketchup / tartar sauce on top
Maybe one of those is the thing you mean :) Fried bread and garlic is what we call topinka but it's not really sold on it's own, it's usually served along meals like beef steak tartare
I wouldn't call svíčková fast food
That's not a fast food though, it's considered a standard meal (well, you occasionally can get burgers with fried cheese, even McDonalds tried it)
But yeah, it is one of our most defining culinary pieces, whether we like it or not
Oh I didn’t notice it said fast food
And why are we talking in English
It is a fast food
You can get it at almost any food stall on the street
Even our highschool kantyna offered it during velka prestavka
So they will understand
This ain't r/czech
I guess so
Owning one
I don't know a single person that actually has one
But when It comes to Ice hockey people usually paint them on their face and also wear scarfs with czech flag
Having it no, having it on the wall inside not really if you are sport fan (my brother used to be a big football fan (meh, soccer, ok
) and he had our flag on the wall of his room) or if you have it like decoration in some not crazy way
Having it outside, waving it outside, heck yes, most people would think it's pretty weird
Only some important days it may be "forgiven" but a lot of people would still think you are overreacting, that it's just for government offices to put it on without being cringy
Having it is fine I guess, but displaying one in public is odd, unless there's some kind of a major sports championship going on
I would assume that that person is a nationalist
Really
I had the same feeling in Lithuania - they are really really proud of their independence - but I don't recall seeing a single one in Latvia
And I was in Riga
But maybe I just didn't pay any attention to them
Damn
I spent half a year in Lithuania and thought that the Lithuanian flag was everywhere
And when I told this to other Lithuanians, they were like "what are you talking about
Yeah
And they do have one, they often hold it upside down
I hear the pride of the Croatian flag is a bit controversial
Because of the checkered bit and what it's supposed to represent
I am no expert on Balkan politics, though, so I don't know, if that's true
A proč? To sem nikdy neviděl
Haha, yeah, what's the deal with that
It's a thing in pretty much every country where people are allowed to protest
If people of all opinions wave the flag at protests, what's the point
Like, I get it, you are from this country
Yeah, I was fascinated to see that people even had it on their luggage and pillows on a plane
Thanks for helping me keep my sanity
I suppose not
It's always about context and the beholder
[This] is the beginning of Velvet revolution on 17th October 1989 - peaceful protest soon to be violently ended by communist regime's forces
Alternatively, [this] is from October 1938, after the Munich agreement, which stripped Czechoslovakia of its borderlands, ring of defensive fortresses and any hope for help against German aggression
Search for the Slovak one here - the Bratislava picture is the most famous in regards to 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
I would say that it could be one of these three:
[Hitler looking out  of a window at the Prague Castle]
[People at the Wenceslas Square on 27 of October 1918]
[Soviet tank crashing into a house in Liberec] or [a protester standing in defiance on a Soviet tank
Knew I'd find it here
I've seen that first one in some youtube video
It said it should be a historical photo, not a work of art
What is the worst specific thing about your country that affects you personally
In my case it's the absurd prices of mobile data
I knew you were Czech just by reading the post lol
I would also say our government uncapable of actually doing anything that is prosperable for the people
I read the text and I was like
Must be a fellow Czech
Yup
For me it's more of urban design and the roads
Even after a part of a city is closed forever for repairs sometimes I feel like people who made those decisions didn't think about any access options
I'm not disabled but I've got a pram and sometimes it's such a hassle
Good distinction
I hate when people conflate faith and church (usually Catholic) dogmatism
The former can exist without the latter and usually when people are annoyed at a religion, they are annoyed at actions of corrupt or politically motivated church body that often doesn't even reflect the belief system itself
I can't for the life of me understand why churches get so politically involved and desire to control lives through legislation, rather than through the social fabric and traditional tools of their functioning
The second one hits way too close home
News articles comment sections and the comments under Facebook posts are prime examples
>The botched response to the coronavirus
Are you challenging us
>I don't think it's too bad
*Cost similar to that of Switzerland and the US, where salaries are multiple times higher*
Germany has huge surpluses yet refuses to invest money, preferring sitting on a bag
It's all weird to see
Prague is pretty awful regarding housing prices
You basically need to have a relative there or find someone to live with you and share the cost, otherwise you won't be able to afford it as a student or someone without large savings
That said the dorms are nice and there's lots of them
So it's not all that terrible while you are a student
Same here
American tourists in Prague can get pretty startled at the fact
I actually prefer this because it makes people more polite to the staff, because you know they will treat you the same way if you aren't.
On the other hand you then hear comments about how rude and unprofessional the service here is
€23 monthly = 4GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
€31 monthly = 15GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
€43 monthly = 40GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
There are some bonuses attached to it like discounts on electronics, but the point is data are expensive if you don't care about the other stuff
But why
It's not like you can't get rid of it and people surely know it's a health hazard
I've grown up in peaceful Europe, so I wouldn't say it feels strange
However almost everything here was shaped by wars in a way, so that is definitely a reminder that peace is something to be grateful for
It is just how things was
Remains of WW2 are all around where I live and you can't unsee them
Not really, maybe some really ancient ones that only historicians know about
None used or within public consciousness
Wonder is, that we're still alive and there wasn't WWIII yet
The Stonehenge and surrounding landscape
The Acropolis of Athens
The St
Jacob's route(s)
The urban lanscape of Paris
The landscape of Iceland
The Danube
The Auschwizt camp, to remember that cultural heritage aren't only things we would like to have
Yeah, something worth living for
You need to escape the number like this: `\7
dude wtf` otherwise the reddit Markdown will renumber it
(Also pinging /u/onlinepresenceofdan)
Yes, the idea was that all the places are in one or another way representing something characteristic and monumental related to European identity or civilizational feats
The Auschwitz is ugly, but is, unfortunately, a pinnacle of most bad trends in history, a representation of persecution, industrialized killing, prejudice, corruption and complex social organization that allowed it to grow so much
It inspires emotions, just different kind than the other places, and serves as a reminder and warning
Says that we can not pick only good achievements when thinking about our cultural identity, but have to be aware that there bad things that share roots with the good ones
It is actually already an UNESCO site because of some some of these reasons
So the hypothetical alien can wonder and ponder what we are
Leberkas-Pepi from Austria
any broodje haring place from Netherlands
There are a few Nordsees in Czechia, but I have feeling that they are worse than in Germany
I'd like to see some burger chain better than BK/MCD here
Also [Puzata Hata] from Ukraine
Not an entire chain, but I'd like triple cheeseburger from German McDonalds
Second that
So simple, cheap yet so efficient
But they would need Austrian Leberkäse
Have you ever saw non-homemade *sekaná* as good as they sell in Austria
>There's not even enough Leberkas Pepi within Austria
I know I know, we often choose Linz route to Alps instead of Munchen one (a bit longer but fully on highways so you save at least an hour) just to stop in Linz branch
I think it would be quite success here (in Prague) and they would not have to be dependent on tourists
It is basically a streetfood lot of people want's here
A good butcher here sell some meatloaf in a bun, globus (german supermarket chain) have this as well and that's more or less all
> Have you ever saw non-homemade sekaná as good as they sell in Austria
Yes but it is quite rare and only one option
Billa used to sell absurdly cheap (20Kč?) sekaná v housce
But the taste is lagging behind Pepi
Older generation would have no idea what it is and the younger generation if they use e-mail say just mail
Or e-mail, but mostly just mail
In official setting, "electronic post" is also often used
Many people also often write it as "email" but that's enamel, the hyphen is important
No, we say "mail", so "gmail" would just make it longer
But I still hear people say "skype" (skypovat) for video calls in general, even though Skype isn't really popular anymore, right
(right
I don't know)
People say "mejl" or just "e-mail".
Mainly because largest email provider is seznam
cz and not gmail
Lots of people are using company emails for private mails
Never heard somebody say "to gmail somthing"
Also I'd say a good portion of people still use seznam as their email provider, gmail is not as ubiquitous as it might be elsewhere
Imo the hyphen thing is a bit nitpicky, it'd be extremely difficult to confuse to two
Interesting and uncommon
Why is that, if you don't mind me asking
I do that too
I have Gmail is for spam and other bs and my Seznam account for serious emails
I see
And would you consider it immoral to use a free service and block ads
Isn't Seznam free, though
I would also like to know what that means
It is
However, I didn't finish reading the first comment so I do the same only with Gmail
Slovakia
Austria
Germany / HRE
Soviet Union
Poland or USA (Poland because of proximity, USA because of its general influence on world history)
This is difficult, but I tried my best (in brackets are reasons)
Austria (royal marriages, Ottokar II
, Havsburgs, Austria Hungary, neighbouring nation
Various German states (mostly Bavaria and Saxony; because of HRE, neighbouring countries)
Poland (royal marriages, Cieszyn, Boleslav the Piast)
Slovakia (Duchy of Nitra, Czecho-Slovakia)
Hungary (Neighbouring country, royal marriages, Matthias Corvinus)
France (House of Luxembourg, post WW1 allies, art influence)
Russia (Pan-Slavism, USSR)
Slovakia, Germans, Soviet Russia, Austria and maybe France
You Aren’t right at all
Definitely Austria
Germany
I would say France because of the wars with Franks during Samos ages and the Napoleonic wars
And maybe Slovakia here, definitely not 1
Here would be Poland or Hungary
The top 5 you typed is maybe during the WWII, but the medieval history is mostly about Austria and Germany
I would swap Poland with Hungary, due to history
What's slovakia doing there
We learn about hungary as a whole not about specific upper hungary history
If you count only post 1918 history this might be true but our country history didn't start in 1918
I think giving all games featuring loot boxes 18+ rating and treating them accordingly with local online gambling laws should be enough
Maybe make them unbuyable with real money
If it's gambling (such as slot machines), it should be handled by gambling legislation
Otherwise what is the point of such legislation
In premium games 100% I don't pay for game to pay more
Even lot of micro transactions are pushing it
In freemium, ehhh, probably
Maybe not ban the mechanic itself but regulate it so it doesn't fuck over people more than trading cards or kinder surprises or whatnot
(Disclosure: I freelance as match 3 level designer)
Also ban lottery
Also ban Kinder Surprise
Also ban raffles
Also ban everything random
This is why socialism is coming from the west, not from the east as it was in the past
Government should know better than people what is good for them
Yes but if you just ban it, then EU game developers using loot boxes will likely move where they are legal or find subsidiaries there, people will buy the games from abroad and use proxy servers to play them, nothing will change and we will have even less control over it
If we say: okay, use this damn game mechanic but admit it's a gambling and behave accordingly, there's a better chance the companies will abide to the laws, will make players register their IDs, pay proper gambling taxes from each microtransaction and whatever else online gambling laws require
It will lower the number of children being advantaged on this (though of course, some of them will always borrow their parents' or whovever's ID but even that's okay if it will raise parents' interest in what their children are doing online), and in a long run, the loot box mechanism may cease to be a profitable model for the companies
>F2p will take over gaming by 2025 no matter what, lootbox ban or not
LOL no it won't, single player is making a comeback as gamers push against this games as service nonsense
At least there are not getting diabetes from chocolatte
Now seriously
They can gamble for free
There are apps at google store simulating all popular game lootboxes (CSGO, FORTNITE
), also there is free roulette, poker
We dont need bans on gambling if you raise children right
The same is with alcohol, drugs
It can be fun if you do it occasionally with small amounts
But it can be deadly fast
You have to teach children money discipline
Start with pocket money cash for sweets
"You have this money for whole week" If they spend it, they will not have a sweets for the rest of the week
Then extend it for month
After they are able to budget, try to give them money for example for commuting to school, food
and be backup
If they fail, reduce their money and repeat
If they want plastic card, give them debit card
I dont know why people who have kids doesnt have this basic idea how to teach budgeting to their kids
If kids are forced to buy skins or food, they will not spend it on skins
If you give unlimited access to your funds to your kid, you are either stupid or have strong belief that you raised your kid responsibly
So if they spend this much, its your fault and you have to pay for it
You raised them wrong
As far as I understand, childcare
It used to be you got lower (capped) the more babies (future taxpayers) you had
They also do grandma childcare more
Which is easier if they go early
My mom still has few years till retirement and it sucks with our 1 year old
It's nice when grandmas can babysit
Iam not buying any cosmetics in game, Iam just opening free ones when i receive some
Didnt spent a penny to buy them and didnt buy even key to open them in CSGO
I miss the time when you could sold unopened boxes on market for some small or big money
But Iam still for lootboxes
If person is not responsible with their money, they dont deserve the money
Bonus points if they pay for development of game which i dont need to pay for because its free because people are buying lootboxes
I would go for another solution
If there are lootboxes, there have to be official marketplace for items found inside
Its always cheaper to buy item than to gamble because lots of people are overbuying randomness and the items on the market are undervalued
There is some kind of natural ratio of hard to get which is rewarding and fun as you are making progress and on the other side is stupidly hard grind
These games are balanced very well in fact
When you discover after some time this nonrewarding grind, you either stop playing or take out credit card and realize it few hunred bucks later
For people enjoying gameplay its nothing neckbreaking
For example take this Apex Legends
Game is free, everything is inside free
You unlock new heroes after some acceptable time or at instant when you pay
Everything else is just pattern
jpg on weapons or character
You dont have any advantage
Even basic skins are better for hiding that expensive ones
Same is for Heroes of the Storm
Only impatient people pay and what they get is instant gratification which depletes very quickly
Federalisation is the only viable future
Its going to hurt, especially countries like Germany as we create common fiscal policies, but it is the only way Europe will survive and prosper
I agree with you
When I read this sub it seem to me EU means more for you than for us
I do hope there will be friendly relations and cooperation between nations, but I don't want us to become one nation
We have fictional character Cimrman  I reccomend to read it whole
There is huge [memegroup] quoting any quote which was used during theatre displays to comment anything in real world
**Basically anyone on the street knows at least 20+ quotes from the plays
Many people know and recognize word by word any moment from the play when someone is saying expression used there
Its commedy, but really funny full of inside jokes, for example Cimrman's Ten Commandments for Novice Actors
Cimrman's theatrical company (called Lipany) had a significant share of untalented and inexperienced actors
In the lecture preceding the play The Stand-In (Czech: Záskok), a list of Cimrman's "Ten Commandments for Novice Actors" is presented, after which the commandments are broken one by one throughout the rest of the play
Do not drink for courage
Even the part of a drunkard is better played sober
Remember that on the stage you generally have a different name than in real life
It is good to know the names of the other characters also
It is best to express strong emotions with your back to the audience
You can best portray both laughter and tears by shrugging your shoulders
Do not thank the audience for objects thrown on the stage
After a cue do not repeat everything
Some lines are for other actors
Go to the bathroom before the performance so that you do not slouch during the play
If you play a devil, remember before sitting down that you have a tail
During applause on an open stage do not bow
It is most likely for someone else
Remember that some doors are just painted
Do not eat during meals on the stage
Everything is rubber
During the final applause make bows deep enough for the audience not to notice it is you who shouts "Bravo
Documentary about pedophiles on social sites was released
(In site - V Síti) All predator faces are blured but eyes and mouth
There Is a famous memed scene where little girl asks: don't you mind I'm 12
He replies: 12
That's cool
"When you forget how many beers you have had, So you ask the bartender… 12, that's cool"
Tak to je v pohodě (translation : 12
That’s fine
It’s quote from documentary, it was told by pedophile commenting on age that actress told him she was
Cool fact Is you can pick Jára Cimrman at oral part of school leaving exam in czech language
Then there is the president, and Hamáchad and lately České dráhy (about the train crashes)
This one
Cimrman did sculpture himself but later it was used by hat-maker (hatter) Lešner to iron shapes of the hats, which lead to destroying all the recognizable features of his bust sculpture so noone knows how he looked
He was portryed on many photos at that time but either from huge distance (100s of meters) or standing facing back to camera
You are right but It is called high school "final exam".
I agree
While our economy is a tiny bit better I must say culturally you are ahead
Whenever I see the "memes" around here it physically hurts
It feels as if people just left rage comics and discovered Facebook
Come here, bro, gimme a hug
Say Czechia one more time, I dare you
I'd say they are, because only a few words are different
It's like American and British english
It's all definitions, politics and "agreed upon lies"... The fact that Arabic and Chinese are considered one language but Czech/Slovak and the Scandinavian languages are independent is a proof of that
Cross the border from western/north-western Slovakia into eastern Moravia and tell me where Slovak language ends and Czech one starts
I am pretty sure you will not be able to tell
I am not saying Czech and Slovak are one language but often the definition of what are separate languages and what are two dialects of one language is quite blurry
Zatímco švagrová štrikuje svetr a fotr plundruje špajz, sestra v ešusu ukuchtila fašírku s erteplema
Snad nám ta šlichta bude šmakovat
> que cada una haga
it's subjunctive of "hacer". Here subjunctive expresses desire
"let everyone do".
> lograr
to reach, to achieve
Lo llamo stereovisión. Cuando hablas dos idiomas de familia, entiendes lo que es importante y lo que no, que es un atributo común para la familia y que es un específico para la lengua, así que puedes concentrarte en las partes importantes
Lo sabe de las lenguas esclavas, hablo dos y así puedo entender mucho de las otras
(espero que arriba tenía sentido, castellano es mi cuarto idioma)
Eating from the same plate with one spoon and also sterling the bride
The groom needs to find her quickly because he must pay for alcohol that get drink until the bride is found
If the groom has good friends, they even put him in house collar
The husband and wife, side by side, share one bib around their necks and then eat one meal together (usually soup) where they take turn in feeding the other
We do this as well
I wouldn’t change anything on the Czech one
It’s simple and easily recognisable
Remove the blue
Those filthy Poles made us change it and I don't like it
I like the one we have, though the old Bohemian style [flag] would be cool too
Remove the blue part (It was the representation of Slovaks anyway) So that people would have no chance to tell if it is Polish or Czech and the best part is that we wouldn't get confused with Philippines anymore
I wouldn’t. But I would change the anthem's pace so it’s right again
I would add a blue horizontal line to the middle - from one side to the other
Just a little wide
Yeah because UK left the EU
It always bothered me that the two small red stripes arent symetrical so maybe change that
There would be another defenestration I suppose
I agree, but the roaring lion is just badass
Not on the official flag tho
If you have a full-time job and live at your parents, they would likely want you to pay at least your part of expenses
Not a full rent though, it would be weird
I don't think full rent, but part of expenses yes
If the house/apartment is theirs, it's usually some contribution to water and energies, if not, some contribution to their rent
Idea of getting of paying full rent is crazy
But in an argument, you can throw them out lol
I've heard anything from: "Your language sounds like a mix of French and Swedish
" to "Stop speaking Spanish
Yeah, close enough
Polish people always claim it sounds cute and child-like to them
It's kinda weird for them, because we have accent on the first syllable, so when we are talking faster it sounds like machine gun fire
To me, Hungarian, as well as Finnish, sounds like it has no intonation
Like, you can't tell when a sentence is going to end, haha
I think some of us call you "Pšonci" for the exact same reason
Lol, what
Who was that person and what planet were they from
I commonly get told that Czech sounds either like a machinegun, when I speak normally, or like Russian, when I try to sound good
Oh yeah, that's definitely true and occasionaly irritating
I always wondered what's the origin of that name
Kinda unrelated, but when we come to visit you in summer, many of us giggle like idiots in restaurants and fast food stands, because you word for drinks "pića" is the same as our word for pussy - "piča" xd
So seeing the prices for sparkling pussy, alcoholic pussy, hot pussy
is a little bit funny
Some dude from the US
He also thought Czech Republic is an island
Maybe because včela is pszczoła.
This is pretty accurate
I remember when I was a kid, I just sang along gibberish to english songs that sounded aaaalmost right (to my ears)
but were complete nonsense
Thank you Croatia for being such a great vacation destination and being welcoming and all
Thank you Romania for being such good pals throughout the 20th century (1919, 1945, 1968)
Don't forget the inspiration for croissants to go with the coffee
Best bro countries forever
Do you lock the door of your house/apartment when you're at home
I live in a small town in Czechia and I think it varies
My parents often argued about this - dad didn't really care during the day but would lock it at night
My mom always wanted the door locked, especially after one of dad's colleagues who was looking for him just entered because nobody heard his knocking and basically went through our house without anyone noticing while my mom was showering
No, you can't enter building and the flat without key anyway so there isn't any risk someone will randomly walk in
Home with parents on the countryside - no, only for the night, we were never used to lock otherwise
Home with just myself in the city - yes
You can't get into the main door of the building without a key from outside and there is only few people living here but I still lock the door and leave the keys in for a simple reason - I easily lose my things "somewhere inside" and I always remember where my keys are this way
I lock the door all the time even though the door can't be opened from the outside and you need a key
I also leave the keys in the lock
This way I never forget my keys when going out
When at home where you can’t open the unlocked door from the outside, no
In my student appartment where you can unless it’s locked and where neighbours and workers leavse the downstairs entry open, yes
Living in a village, we don't lock the door during daytime since anyone who wants to enter the house needs to walk through the front yard first and it's *very* unlikely that someone with bad intentions would just enter our property like that as they could be easily seen in the open by neighbours or random passersby
True, occasionaly someone (usually a friend or a relative) enters the house itself uninvited when looking for one of us (like if they are not sure that the doorbell works) but they usually just open the door into the entry hall, shouting "is anybody home
" without actually entering when there's no reply so we've never seen that as a problem (also, this obviously used to happen more before we had mobile phones - it's pretty rare these days)
We do lock at night
And I did lock my front door when I was living in a city
I mean I only actually *locked* them at night too but there usually isn't a door handle or a knob you can use to open the door easily without a key from the outside on front doors of houses which you enter directly from the street or flats in apartment buildings
I'm also from small town/big village and I lock my doors only when I go sleep
Nope, there is a handle on both sides and you have to lock them with a key
Coutryside
Sure, but an apartment won't have a door handle at the outside
About [this] Left is from outside so no need to lock yourself

We are changing our Health Minister once again
He just went to a restaurant at night even though he himself closed them the day before
Our Minister of Health breaking his own goddamn Anti-Covid state of emergency rules
He went to a pub (they are closed now) after 22:00 (absolutely forbidden) and he was photographed getting into his car without a mask on (also forbidden since his driver was around)
It's fucking hilarious
It has to be, otherwise it would be really sad and we can't take that right now
Edit: Forgot to mention the government wants him to abdicate from the post, but he don't wanna and it seems like they don't have anyone, literally no one who would want his job now
Also he's only been the minister for like a month because the previous guy couldn't take it anymore (he got blamed for our current "Best in Covid" situation which, to be fair, is mostly the fault of our government having no fucking idea what they're doing
They're only there to tunnel, after all, so they don't have a fucking clue how to actually govern shit)
The only things we talk about here are things that have something to do with covid
We had news about in Czechia as well, the LGBT situation too
It's horrible what is happening
It's like going back to the dark ages
For technical sciences it's Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT) and for everything else it's Charles's University (UK)
Charles University in considered more prestigious because it is the oldest university in Central and Eastern Europe (it was founded in 1348)
That would be Charles University
It's, I think, the 9th oldest in the world, and it's also 100th most prestigious in the world (that doesn't sound impressive, but given, how many universities exist worldwide, it is impressive IMO)
The Charles University is the most famous one (and definitely the oldest one), I would say
If has lots of different faculties (from sciences to theology)
They definitely have one of the best natural sciences (geography, geology, chemistry, biology) faculty and the faculty of mathematics and physics is good too
The law faculty is great (from what I heard)
There is also ČVUT, which is mostly tech oriented
There’s a lot of universities you can choose from
I might be a liiittle bit biased
I actually study at the CU (or UK, as in Univerzita Karlova)
I also applied for MUNI (also a good university) and UPCE
Basically every big city has a university
Also ČVUT for STEM subject and AMU for arts
Sadly, it only enjoys and maximizes its former glory
They are completely outdated and out of touch
Teaching there is not great or  good
Masaryk uni, olomouc, cvut, vscht all are better choices
>Brno
>prestigious
(we still love you, your beloved ČVUT)
If I learned one thing in my (not so many) years, it's that every country has something interesting going for it
I didn't think a lot of Estonia, Lithuania or Bosnia, before I visited them, but I was always surprised by the interesting things that they have and that I had no idea about
But I guess I'm easy to please
I loved Denmark for the bicycle culture and overall positivity, Romania for the countryside, Lithuania for the language and fascinating history etc
If I absolutely had to go with my gut, I would say that Andorra, Luxembourg, Belarus or Malta don't really draw my interest all that much, but I am pretty sure that if I visited them or did a bit of research, I would inevitably find something interesting about them
Probably Luxembourg
I understand it’s beautiful, well-maintained, and rich, but I feel like I don’t belong and that I can see more of what it has to offer in neighbouring countries
Also expensive to visit
Same with Lichtenstein and even Switzerland
I’ve spent plenty of time bleeding my wallet dry in Germany and Austria and feel like I would get to see a more extreme version of what I’ve already seen
I’m torn about Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, Slovenia, Albania, and Slovakia
I’m generally disinterested in the Balkan countries save for the food and pictures of lanscapes etc
I have visited Slovakia many times but I’d say the only interesting part is the Tatra mountains, which have worse services and same prices as the Austrian Apls
Eastern Europe makes me sad
Oh, and Spain and Portugal, as I’ve mentioned elsewhere
Least interesting
I would definitely say Romania
It's the last country I can think of and I can't even try to find something interesting about it
I would love to hear some cool things about Romania, though
If anyone has any
Epic Sax guy is from there
Don't forget Transnistria, beautiful country in its own way
Don't they sell cheap booze and cigarettes
I, your czech neighbour, can absolutely say that I love the Tatras
You also have great spas
Never been to one though
Slovakia is famous here for Halušky, cheese and recently TatraTea, also for Wild animals coming across the border
Slovakia has great mountains
Do you find the language uninteresting just because we are slavic
Zdob şi Zdub is epic too:
This sounds very bad without context
You thought I mistook Bosnia for Latvia
Haha, no, they were not supposed to be related
Oh yes
I only learned about it yesterday and it kind of blew my mind
Seconded
I knew next to nothing about Bosnia before I visited it and now it's one of my favorite countries in Europe
Have visited it three times and am planning to go again
Did anyone said Beer
Mluvil jsem o medvědech a vlcích, ne o premiérech
Halušky are the shit
No idea why, but even here, in a country next door, one can't get good halušky
But that's the fun, and you better shouldn't sneak any schwas there
You could also try to say the glorious ř, hmm like in this word: třtina
(Btw
ř, rž, žr all sound different to our ears)
Yep the dual number is nice, and it sounds interesting in archaic Czech
I'd be cool with it if were productive in Czech
At least we have the vocative case productive, which is nice
But what do you mean by odd Slovenian pronouns
For all Czechs I can only say, Yes, all of it
I see, do you have any particular pronouns in mind
Because they're mundane to me as there's like almost 1:1 correspondence to Czech ones
I'd say we're corrupt the same way we've always been, be it middle ages or current year
Nepotism, tax evasion, embezzlement, bloated budgets for public works that receive EU grants, bribes, overpriced roads and highways that fall apart constantly, conflict of interest
It's a czech nature to skim the law and find new ways of bending it to our will
We are the master lawbenders
Smetana - Vltava (moldau)
I would say Vltava from Bedřich Smetana
Vltava = Moldau
Foolish choice
It's obviously [*Hejtrs v rohu*] by *Metrix Steel, legenda Hroznové lhoty*.
Nope, it's [this
To je klenot no nebo Praha žije byla jedno dobu celkem hitovka jeste:D
Don't worry, we are too
Well, I don't visit Prague city centre often, so only thing I can tell that I am really in large city is that my commuting to work is with metro which frequently goes in 2-3 minutes intervals
I get woken up almost everyday around 6:30 because that's apparently a prime time for pigeons to have a swingers party at my balcony
Also it's hot as hell, especially when there are no trees in my street
Other than that, fine
Would switch it for a nice house somewhere outside of the city in a blink of an eye if I could tho
Prague is full of tourists in the city centre
The city transport is fine
It gets progressively uglier towards the city’s periphery
There is a lot of housing estates, warehouses and some factories
Some parts are more beautiful than the others
It’s a diverse city, I would say
Some Prague residents are kinda arrogant about being from Prague lol
It’s a beautiful city though
I visited Vienna once for a day
Its like Prague but better in nearly every way
I absolutely loved it
Definitely considering moving there in the future, though your dialect makes my German feel a tad useless sometimes
The problem is probably that there are a lot of mountain ranges in between
For sure, to some extent
I think we are (or were) selling some electricity from one of our nuclear powerplants, Temelín, to the Austrians
Ironically, they were vehemently protesting against its construction back in the 2000s or so, though
Brno
Or Prague-countryside
Or Šalingrad (šalina is the term for tramway there for whatever reason real people can't comprehend)
It is the mythical land of spirits
Many, many spirits
Beer too I guess
It is Florida of the Czechs
Brno and sometimes Ostrava, even though Brno is usually called a shithole etc
I've heard people call it non existent etc
I would say the city of Brno
It’s kind of a punching bag of a city
It’s the center of a lot of jokes
Ah, I remember that
It was quite the topic back in the day, since it's just across the border
My teacher often talked about her visit there
She was stopped on the street by old women eager to speak in Czech they still remembered because they learned it in childhood
She travelled there some 20 years ago
I think we'll pass, Slovaks would get a bit nervous
Can't be stressing our lil' bro
Václav, Karel, Jiří, Otakar, Vladislav, Boleslav, František
Marie, Anežka
I'm named František, a czech version of German "Franz" after Franz Joseph I.
Those sound too normal
We need to go deeper: Mojmír, Rostislav, Svatopluk, Slavomír, Bořivoj, Spytihněv, Vratislav, Oldřich, Jaromír Břetislav
Počítají se Habsburkové?
Jasně. Pokud jsou korunovaní, což vylučuje Ferdinanda V., Františka Josefa a Karla
, podle českého číslování - myšlen je poslední král (bez korunovace a z podstaty závislosti koruny na císařském titulu) Karel Habsburský (1916-1918)
V seznamu chybí Jan (Lucemburský) a Ludvík (Jagellonský)
A hromada knížat
Myslíš Karla VI
[Jiří z Poděbrad] husitský král.
Karel VI
je český Karel II
je jako císař Svaté říše římské.
Ta nejednotnost v číslování je někdy k vzteku - Karel IV
je IV
, protože si ho rádi pamatujeme jako skvělého císaře, ale jeho syn Václav je v učebnicích jako IV
, protože jeho císařské angažmá stálo za starou bačkoru - Němci ho sesadili
Jako císař je pochopitelně I.
Náš Karel III
je vévoda bavorský, zvolený jako protikrál, když chtěli všichni sousedi roztrhat Rakousko, protože Habsburkové jako původní rod vymřeli po meči otcem Marie Terezie (Karlem VI
/II
Že se to nepovedlo je celkem zázrak, a pro nás super věc, protože Česko a Morava se měly rozdělit mezi vítěze
Technicky jeho korunovace byla dost pochybná záležitost a Habsburkové ji samozřejmě neuznávali, ale král aspoň chvíli v Čechách byl
To z Karla I. (jako rakouského císaře) dělá českého Karla IV
- až na to, že se nikdy nenechal korunovat
Ale nikdo mu nikdy Karel IV
neřekne z dost jasných důvodů. Když o něm mluvíme jako o českém králi (jako v tomhle kontextu), tak bychom technicky měli
Bordel, co
V historii se docela význam, jen jsem myslel že mluvíš o jiném Karlovi, a to o posledním českým královi Karlovi VI
Ale poslední český král je Karel I., císař rakouský, 1916-1918
Proč Karel VI
Pokud nepočítáš nekorunované, tak je to František I.
Myslím že v Rakousku byl I. a v Česku VI
, ale možná se pletu
Já jsem právě dopočítal IV
Karel Lucemburský, Karel Habsburský - poslední Habsburk, Karel Bavorský, tenhle Karel
Nemám pocit že někoho zapomínám?
Hele to se dá lehce zjistit
Tak jsme se sekli oba
V Česku to byl Karel III
Pokud se nepočítá Karel Bavorský, tak jo
Habsburkové ho nepočítali, tak se asi tak tituloval
Na rozdíl od něj byl ale Bavor korunovaný, tak si udělej vlastní obrázek, jak to brát.
In Futurama, French is a dead language like latin

Whether *koprovka* ("dill cream sauce") is great or terrible
One half of people love it, the other half hate it
[With rose hip sauce or with sauerkraut
A whip
Once again, I am forced to laugh at the Polish language
I'm team sour cream
It ain't proper borsch without sour cream
If it's not a Czech beer, it sucks, so they suck both, solved it for ya
We call it "patička", literally "little heel" or "Hacke".
I always thought in German the gender of brands is based on the gender of the product
Nutella is feminine, because Haselnusscreme is feminine
There Is only two types of czechs
Those who hate koprovka And those who Are Wrong
It's all good until weird people start putting yogurt there
I like "die Nutella" more for some reason but it may be just that I don't like Nutella
Also feminine in Czech
I imagine people who like it as someone who grew in the woods unnoticed and never went to school, and their mom was making it for them
Because once you have it in school canteen, you hate it and there's no going back
Koprovka is good, but I never ate it at school, only from fresh ingredients, made by my mom
We usually put butter on bread, so it feels more "kosher" to stick cheese on butter (both milk products) than to put ham on butter
Yes
It sounds like serník, which would derive from srát, which means to shit
This would make any kind of spread including possibly butter masculine too
Alright, this rule has some flaws
My dad makes the best koprovka
Koprovka is plain awesome
Never had issue with it even in school
We had pretty good food in school
Now horseradish sauce, that's just plain evil
here, we have sýr.
Except platypus - ptakopysk - birdylip, for example raccoon - mýval - literally "used to wash". Or sloth - lenochod - lazy walker
Also whale - "velryba" - literally "megafish".
We call raccoon Mýval - washer
First thing that came to mind is Žijeme len raz  It is a Slovak song but it played everywhere and all the time in 2012
Žijeme Len Raz by EGO
Even though its a Slovak song, here in czechia it blasts every summer too, all day long, baby
Tbh not only 2012, I still hear it blast from the radio sometimes
Blanka tunnel, Prague subway line D, Subway or rail line to the (Václav Havel) Ruzyně airport,  trams on Václavské náměstí, I could continue to the infinity, and that's only Prague
Oh yeah
Not as many badly executed projects as not executed at all for years/decades because of political squabbles
That applies to most of our unfinished highways, a new train station for Brno, any high speed railways, P+R systems, metro/railway connection to the Prague airport (currently, your only options are buses and taxis, and that's a pretty big airport),... We always have something like this going on
Sometimes there are environmental activists delaying the construction of a highway, for example, sometimes it's just an excuse from incompetent politicians
Now things that were badly executed: the introduction of electronic public transport passes in Prague ("Opencard") was known as a giant overpriced scam, they have since been replaced by a different provider
Then there was the "toll gate controversy", revolving around the government singing very disadvantageous deals with the private company that was going to administer a new automated system of collecting highway tolls from trucks
All the way back in the 90s, we had "Internet for schools", a similar scam involving famously overpriced IT equipment for public schools
And while we're on the topic of schools - "státní maturita", an attempt to standardize high school final exams, started in 2012 and has been quite a mess ever since
The number and selection of subjects have changed, test difficulty is always criticized as too low and too high at the same time, and ministers of education flip flop on the inclusion of a mandatory maths exam almost every year
I also remember there was some controversy about a renovation of the Charles Bridge in Prague, like some people thought it was badly done and damaged, but I don't remember what the conclusion of that was anymore  You can barely keep track of all the nonsense in this country, honestly
I don't see how Metro D, rail line to Vaclav Havel airport or trams on Václavské náměstí are badly executed projects, since the construction works on them didn't even properly start
I mean yeah, the planning of these is really drawn-out, but isn't that to be expected for every big infrastructure project
Media says yes, but personally, I haven't noticed any panic
Some people do, some people don't. My nation is good at having fun out of it
People at my work stay calm and we are all tired of all-going news with nonsense numbers
Heck yeah they do
Also one thing
It looks like everyone here is fucking panic buying plane tickets the fucking to italy smh
Yes, and its crazy
Yes, but shops are refilling stock quickly and some of them started even discounts of these particular items
>There is toilet roll everywhere
I can't help myself, but this sounded like a horror movie quote in my head when I read it
"Toilet rolls
they
they are EVERYWHERE
" \*Wilhelm scream as a giant tide of TP buries everyone alive\*
They are just really easy to slide under the quarantine doors
I don't know about European, so I'll just submit a Czech one - *čtyřlístek*.
(cztyř lees tech - you really can't transcribe ř into English)
It means four-leaf clover
And it's the perfect combination of a rough consonant grouping and a soft deminutive
Kurva
It's the only word you need, it can mean anything
Half French, half Germanic, weird spelling, many silent letters - it truly represents
Terry Pratchett almost did just [that
In Czech republic Herbert, Bohumil and Ernest
They are all German XD
I rly don’t Tomáš (male) and Hedvika (female)
Květoslav (essentially Florian) a Chrudoš (the one who weakens)
Did you not hear about the angry parents who named their daughters Daenerys
The word "robot" is probably the most regularly used thing a Czech man invented
Contact lenses, lightning rod, ship propeller or blood types* are also cool tho
Contact lenses and beer that doesn't taste like shit
Many good stuff, but the most important worldwide are: Contact lenses, modern-ish propeller (first one, that was better than paddle wheel), Silon, and others
Also blood plasma, cytoplasm, sweat glands and many other anatomical things were first described by Jan Evangelista Purkyňe
And Řehoř/Gregor Mendel discovered genetics and the laws of trait inheritance
[Top 10 Czech inventions]
Yeah I was wrong about that, our guy just added to the research with the AB group
(alongside other people who discovered it around the same time)
Yep, robota is the word it originates from, which is an unpaid unfree work in Czech language
(and regular work in many other Slavic languages afaik)
Fun fact: I live in town where he was born
We have a lot of things named after him there
We invented meth
Jeez
Franklin and Diviš invented it independently two years apart
Yeah, in the play they're used as slaves/cannon fodders that eventually revolt and kill all humans
Yeah, they're basically "workers".
Well from Russian point of view at least, because Russian is one of the languages where работа means regular work, so the word origin might seem kinda innocent for them
But when you keep in mind it was invented by a Czech, the robots are basically meant to be slaves
They were biological robots in the original work, humanoids similar to Frankenstein's monster
I'm sorry but *Carel Capec* hurts my Czech eyes
With no offense, makes sense
Long spoon
Tiny spoon
Sorry
ATM fees and the DCC scam
It's crazy that I am punished with ridiculous additional fees for not being a local citizen
Just because my card was issued in another EU country
Maybe not the most important, but elections could use some
Czech 2 day long elections are the most useless thing ever, and I'm sure the methods of counting votes could be improved as well
Standardized mail-in or electronic voting for citizens living in other EU countries
Can't we all just copy the e-government stuff from Estonia or something
Not politicians, but customers too
Demand for international travel is much lower than the domestic one
Both railway and roads
Personally, I rather believe politicians push for international connections of any way more than necessary
I don't think many countries in the EU are ready for it yet
It might cause a massive unemployment problem
> Power systems, track gauges, signals, platform heights, etc
These aren't standardized on the national level either :( Two different platform heights in Germany, 2 (+2 more unique single line each) electrification systems in Czechia
Train control
I'd rather point to the official map:  (and in general
Revolut doesn't help here
It's the fee charged by the ATM itself, not your bank
When the ATM detects your card is issued abroad, it adds a fee 2-7 EUR
This is very common especially in tourist destinations
Have you ever tried it
I have a Revolut card with a Brittish BIN, I have tried to withdraw money many times
In Czechia, Moneta Money Bank ATMs ask for additional 7 EUR, ČS ATMs asks for 5 EUR, on Rhode, the Pireus Bank ATM asked for 3 EUR and so on
There is reason this list exists:
Unfortunately more and more banks are using this trick to rob tourists and more and more terminals offer DCC to confuse you and trick you into using unfavorable conversion rate
It's like a plague, I've been also offered DCC few times when paying contactless, which is pure evil
We used to insult people by marking them as StB [estébák] (civil associates of secret police)
It faded away, but it's back again now, as prime minister was one of 'em and he's a great example of those fucking rats
Not in that sense
Czechs use "estébák" more
The StB was kind of like Gestapo, but during the socialist era
So the term collaborator is mostly meant like a collaborator with the communists rather than nazis
But we do use "fašista" (a fascist) and "nácek" (a nazi) as an insult too
And there actually is a neonazi group
Fun fact: We allegedly (most likely lol) have an "estébák" as our prime minister now
There are StB papers with his fake StB name and everything
It’s wild
Yes, it's still done, usually reserved for people with questionable ties with China and Russia
I'd say "estébák" is used here
Basically it is a communist version of Gestapo
It's used when someone reports something totally not harmful to anyone
Did you park your car on a sidewalk at 1am for 5 minutes and someone called the police
That person is a fucking estébák. I hope you kinda understand it
We have an ongoing argument here (sort of) about whether "Vlasovci" (the soldiers around Vlasov) were Nazis or not
The "main face" in this argument is the mayor of Řeporyje - Pavel Novotný. He even made a memorial for them
Idk what to think about it, but Novotný seems like a cool dude
He’s sort of controversial but he knows what’s up
That’s the thing
On one side, people say that they helped liberate Prague
On the other side, people say that they were Nazis
But Koněv also did help with the liberation, and most people don’t like him, because he was a Soviet (and with all the stuff that happened here after the war - the socialist era
And I don’t know what to make of it
They both liberated us
Euro truck simulator, Factorio, Mafia 1, Arma, Beat saber, Kingdom come deliverance, Space engineers, someday you'll return, Vietcong, Samorost
I only know Space Engineers, but there may more well known video gamеs out there
Euro truck Sim is a check game
Damn I never had any idea
Although I did know Arma was
and Operation Flashpoint, Original War, Inqusitor, Polda, Spellcross etc
all Czech gems
I love everything from Remedy Entertainment
I finished Control recently and it is awesome how it fits into the same universe as Alan Wake
I would love to play the remaster of the first three Killzone games on PS5
Hopefully one day
TIL, thanks
Yeah these type of people can spend their whole day in a truck and when they come home, they play ETS on their triple monitor setup with direct drive steering wheel and a racing chair and what not
But I mean, if they enjoy it, good for them
Punching above our weight
I have finished mafia 1 so many time I lost count
But I am kinda afraid about the remake, I am afraid I will be disapointed
Oh are they really
I didn't know that, good to know
SCS has a really nice HQ in Prague
Yeah Daniel Vavra has the tendency to stick his nose into everything
I don't know what opinions he has and what he prophets to public
But I don't really care
I follow the rule, judge the art, not the artist
And what matters is that KC:D and Mafia are just great games
Although it is understandable it could leave a bad taste in someones mouth knowing
He's not though
Quick question, how does a political viewpoint of a dev change a game so much that you cannot like it
If you gonna throw around these serious accusations like confetti, they will eventually become meaningless
You can disagree with others opinions but you should be really careful before calling someone "alt-right adjacent cunt".
The main guy is actually slovak, but the rest of the team is czech and their studio is in Prague
Not sure, if there are, they are probably a minority in the team
Yeah no, basically no one from Czech republic denies the holocaust
And for good reason too, [we have many cities that were used as concentration camps] and memorials for fallen man, women and children
You get taken to these places as a child with school fairly early
Terezín is a place everyone goes to before being 15 at least
I was there with our whole class when I was in middle school
Everybody in the country knows it's real and fucked
I'd be surprised if more than a thousand people in the whole country deny it
Also, you know, Kingdome come wasn't made by a single fucking person
It's made Warhorse Studios which has let me see \*rustles through the 1st page of google you could have fucking looked up\* oh you know, 131 employees
So no, the viewpoint of a single dev on the game, even a main dev on the game doesn't fucking destroy it
One Czech Journalist prove that out eight out of ten slices of bread fall to the grease sight
The report took more than 4 minutes
Here a link:
Here is the report:
She is also saying things like, there is now relatively high temperature minus 11C° (don't remember last time were it was so cold, I nearly haven't seen snow this winter but I don't live in the mountains)
But this is going to be much worse, the temperature will drop to minus 40C°! (Don't know how she got that number, It would be a record)
Its the best Netflix show imo
I still don’t why I enjoyed it so much given the fact I was totally lost for 80% of the show
I eventually lost interest in it, would have preffered if there was more vilain action and less “nobody knows what to do”. Maybe I stuck out with it for so long was because one of the characters has my BF’s name and I smiled whenever someone called out for him
I found it to be mediocre
The soundtrack was good, but other than that it's nothing we haven't seen many times before
The dialogue is a bit cringy at times, too
Completely lost interest after the first season
It was kinda pain to watch because of how long and confusing the episodes were, my brother literally had to drag me in front of the screen and make me continue watching lol
But I'm so glad he did because it was a very unique experience
The ending left me absolutely speechless
I don't think it's very popular here, feel like only hardcore series fans know it but those who do love it
I also watched the other German stuff available on Netflix, like How to sell drugs online or Issi und Ossy and loved all of it
I think their production is really good and very relatable to me too, unlike some US or UK shows
I watched it, but I've not yet seen season 3 for various Reasons
But
I can Tell that the first two seasons Are great
I’d like to thank Slovakia for the beautiful Tatra mountains and being together with us for a long time, Germany for trading with us, Poland for cheap sweets and mayonnaise and Austria for Alps
I would like to thank Romania for not participating in invasion of 1968
As a good ol' bitter Czech I have noone to thank cuz everyone sucks/sucked
Germany is buying a lots of our products
Like 100 billions euro per year
Thanks Germany
Something similiar here in Czechia
Austrains complain for us having a nuclear power plant near Czech-austrian border
Lmao it doesn't matter where is the power plant in Czech Republic, It's so small that where ever will it be it will still hit Austria with the nuclear fallout
(the name of the powerplant is either Temelín or Dukovany, cant remember which one is it rn)
Yep, it’s called Winiary, if you ever go to Poland definitely try it, it’s really good
I see we have pretty much the same look on history haha
But they buy our stuff
About 30 percent of Czech export is to Germany
Yeah man they compelety fuck us over, both of us
Zero fucks given, they didn't want to save europe from war, they wanted to save their asses from war
Yeah they moved a bunch of their industry in WW2 here, thx much <3
Probably not, I hope you enjoy the trip
It has to be Kofola for the Czech Republic for sure
Kofola is literally the greatest soda on planet earth and every living being should drink it instead of water
Here in the czech republic we have kofola, a cola with herbs
It is extremely popular here
I love it
Pepsi nebo coca-colu seženeš všude, kofola je klasika
I undestand Youtube can be confused because I switching between three languages
But damn I want results in language I am curently using, not some shity auto-translate which dont make sense
I think I've seen that once on someone elses computer
It was awful
I force Youtube to use English locale, so that likely disables the feature
Never ever seen that
I absolutely hate it
> Don't you hate Youtube auto title & description translations to your local language
Yes, I don't.
> Apparently you can't disable it
Huh
I don't understand
All videos with auto subs have them are off by default for me and I can switch them on and off as I please
Titles are always in their original language
I see
I assumed "titles" means subtitles because title being translated is alien to me
And apparently being unfamiliar with this issue is offensive
The same here
Ours wasn't a famous dictatorship, just a regular run-of-the-mill communist dictatorship, but making fun of it, not to mention talking about it, is pretty commonplace and not taboo at all
In fact, it's a subject of some of the popular films and books and generally people make jokes about communism on a daily basis
Again, it's mostly only the old people who are nostalgic of communism and it's very rare to run into someone who'll you get into a heated argument over it with
Exactly, if I had a crown each time I said "za tohle jsem klíčema nezvonil tyvole" I could get a meal in a cheaper restaurant
I fully agree
For the most part you have dealt with it great
I don't understand the occasional re-emergence of the Schuldkultur, as people today have not that much in common with the past and think they shouldn't be penalised in any way for it
The only time where I think more work has to be done is if sometimes you see people opening up old unnecessary wounds
Like some Bavarian politicians, aristocratic Germans and once even the chancellor herself talking about CZ compensating the Sudeten Germans (which is a completely idiotic proposition given the context and complexity)
Or when you still see instances of people having Nazi confiscated Jewish artwork and wealth (like the art dealer who's father got it from the Nazis
Gurlitt family they're called I believe)
But those are small individual issues and not reflective of the whole development
That's great to hear
I also visited the Auschwitz memorial around 4 years ago and it's really powerful stuff
And not feeling guilt but instead responsibility and awareness of what humans are capable of if pushed to limits is a healthy attitude that I think most people who know a thing about history should adopt
Kudos to you
Depends, if there's a Czech dub I'm DEFINITELY playing it with that but I mostly use English subtitles
English
I enjoy more complex strategies and rpgs and I usually need to search in English walkthroughs and wikis or want to use English mods
I have no problem with English and prefer consistency
Czech language is actually translated quite often, but I don’t mind having it in english
English is my 2nd nature so I don’t even notice it sometimes
Kingdome Come is such a awesome game
, I wish they'll add Czech dubbing later to make it perfect tho
How far in are you
I have a story mission related question
Vietkong
Warcraft 3
I think you forgot about the Witcher
There is Czech localisation in a bit, all menus and interface is is Czech, as well as subtitles
The Witcher 1 does
I see
I'm currently in Rattay, the watch with Slavík mission, I picked up a armor, went to the guy and it said rep lost, and he went along the lines that I'm unprepared
I dunno what to do
Thanks
I swear the amount of Pražáci on holidays here kills me
I speak four foreign languages and I definitely feel it's not enough
I would like to learn at least few more
I like it more and more with every language I learn
I mean, I can always learn another one (Spanish would be cool), but I'm fine with what I know now
No, not really
Imo it comes down to the use-case
Here in Czech Republic, everyone is expected to speak Czech
We don't speak our neighboring languages on daily basis
I speak English fluently, which opens many doors already
Probably most, proportionally
During high school and uni, I studies Russian and Spanish
Forgot most of them, because I don't need them
I have no interest in traveling to Spain or Russia and in their popculture and the languages are virtually useless in business here (definitely in IT)
Over time however, I picked up several hobbies where knowing Japanese would be very useful
I have already visited Japan once and would like to again
So I'm learning Japanese, since I now have a use-case for it
Same - model making, manga, Japanese music - Japanese everywhere
Started maybe 2 years ago and it's been a journey
It's definitely not easy, but I have to say, it's very rewarding, especially once you get few hundred kanji under your belt and can start parsing sentences without furigana (albeit slowly)
We used to build these as kids, but they definitely are not common in Czechia
"The Bolevec disaster" were tragic explosions in the ammunition factory of the Skoda Works in Pilsen in 1917
The "Střílna" ammunition factory was located on the northern edge of Bolevec in Pilsen
Since 1901, there has been a test range of cannons assembled in Skoda in the center of Pilsen, and even before the First World War, ammunition was also produced here
On May 25, 1917, one of the greatest war tragedies in the Pilsen Region took place in the factory
203 people died and there were over 1000 injured
The causes of the explosions are related to the increasing demands of ammunition supplies before and during World War
The factory was overstocked  with ammunition
The explosions caused damage up to 6 kilometers from the explosions

I used to drink a lot of milk until I was put on medication that makes me extra gassy
Milk didn't really helo with that so now I drink soy milk
not me, never liked
beer with milk
I thought I was the only one
I love it
I drink a cup each morning
In the morning I prefer warm milk
Sometimes I add a spoon of honey or cacao
Cereal with milk are also awesome
Or butter biscuits that I can dip in the milk
And sometimes I will have a cup or two in the evening
Then I prefer cold milk
Preferably not fridge cold, but more like cellar cold (which is where it's usually stored until opened)
I went trough a phase as a teenager where I drank like a 1+ litre of milk every day
Unfortunately only after I had broken a leg
However, I have to admit, I don't really like fresh milk (non pasteurized)
For some reason, the taste is just strange and I generally prefer regular pasteurized milk
And always whole milk (3,5%)
I really expected some Clockwork orange jokes in here
Milk is a blessed beverage
Unfortunately, I have broken a bone in my life already, but I try not to say that on /r/Neverbrokeabone so I don't get banned
So how is milk in Japan
I should have though of trying it when I went there
They can't stop us
Siberia
"Silent/calm like in Siberia" (Ticho/klid jak na Sibiři) is a very common saying
One term that I can think of is the somewhat vulgar "prdel světa"
We say often, vulgary, "v nějaký prdeli" which translates to "In some asshole"
Prievidza je slovenský Bruntál?
So far without any problems, no confirmed case in our hospital
We have 90 empty beds ready with lung ventilations
Only problem is that we need more respirators bud we should get a big delivery later today
Still we are little worried because our district in Prague have the biggest percentage of the old people
On monday we should get help from med students in last year of their studies
We are preparing for the worst but everyone is calm
Germany and socks in sandals stereotype
We do that too
We got one of the biggest beer cultures in the world
Germany or Ireland don't even come close
Important to note that National Socialism doesn't equate nazism
There were a lot of national socialist parties in interwar Europe and pretty much none of them bar for the German one had even a slight resemblance of the NSDAP agenda
You have great herring
Divine herring, a fish I'd kill for
Also cheeses
And stroopwaffel
But otherwise, yes
Epic rap battle of history: Portugal vs Germany
In that case, why do you eat it
Chicken is probably the most bland meat
> just confusing naming on the nazis part i guess
I guess that I may have been a bit mistaken on this and Czechoslovakia may have been the odd one out
Gotta check more sources
Bohemia/Czechoslovakia had a "National Socialist" party that was generally speaking a fairly progressive democratic centre-left party, in a cohort with the Social Democrats during the Interwar period after the communist wing split off in the 1920s.
They were a very popular party, the 2nd Czechoslovak President Beneš was a big supporter of theirs
The party got purged and reformed into a symbolic puppet of the communist party after 1948 unfortunately
If properly cooked, everything is delicious
Other meat however, can be delicious even when mediocry cooked
Because we have beautiful old buildings in almost every city, that would be overshadowed (literally) by them
If it is hide and seek quote than it is "Před pikolou za pikolou nesmí nikdo stát, nebo nebudu hrát. Už jdu
Před pikolou za pikolou nikdo nesmí stát nebo nebudu hrát.
Translation: beyond my english level forever
In front of the pikola, behind of the pikola none cannot stay or i wont play
Pikola - place where you count and say the name of the player you see
Říkáte taky někde na Slovensku: ,,Před pikolou za pikolou nikdo nesmí stát, jinak nebudu hrát. Už jdu
Also the act of being the seeker is called *pikat*. When the seeker finds the hider, they shout: *"Deset, dvacet"* (Ten, twenty) + the hider's name
At this point, the hider is *zapikaný*. I really wonder where the root *pik* comes from
We have a word - píka - pike (kind of a spear i guess) and i think a dick in danish is pik
So yeah a "pointy" object
Also theres pikola - piccola fluete and pikolík - busyboy/potboy
Slovak is not the same language but It's very close so I'm gonna treat it as such
I don't think anyone really cares if a Slovak speaks his language or tries to speak czech since everyone understands each other anyways
Many Slovaks learn czech after settling here but it isn't necessary
Being first car is more relaxing, since you don't have focus on the car ahead of you
I feel the same about Germans
Czechs reject the label of Eastern Europe because they also like to feel superior to everyone to the East of them, so it's like a slur to them
If we were both in the "Eastern Europe" category, how would we justify looking down on all the Ukrainians, Moldovans, Romanians and Bulgarians we use for underpaid labor
I mean
academics would give you many reasons why Czechia is supposedly culturally closer to Austria and Germany than to other post-Communist nations, but I don't think that's the reason why most people feel so strongly about these labels if we're being honest
You will unfortunately need to choose between summer or winter time soon, but I have read that Spanish people actually support summer time
Is this true
Because it would mean sunrise at 9:30 and sunset at 19:00 in winter
what piss me more on German highways are germans overtaking imaginary cars
Not people forget themselves in left lane or ignorant blocking left lane but Germans start overtaking car hundreds meters before it is necessary, not willing speed up so you have to simply slow down when actually both of us can overtake that truck without anyone need to brake down or speed up
literally only in Germany, doesn't matter if I cross to Bavaria or Saxony, this is something I will encounter on first 10-20 kilometers
In czech, we call vacuum cleaning "luxovat" after a vacuum cleaner brand from a hundred years ago
Yup, drak for both
And as you mentioned "zmij", we have zmije which is viper
In czech they can be both called 'drak', but a kite is often called 'papírový drak' (paper dragon)
Also koruna for both our currency and crown (either the jewel or the thing a dentist puts in your tooth when it is diseased)
I believe those are called homonyms (concretely homographs and homophones)
Zmije in our language is specifically a viper
Snake generally is had
No, rattlesnake is chřestýš, viper is zmije (or is it adder
I'm sure about Czech, not so much about English - for example puff adder is zmije útočná, sand viper is zmije růžkatá, both means zmije here), mamba is mamba, grass snake is užovka etc
and they all are hadi
Oh, well, that would be just venomous snake (jedovatý had), viper (zmije) is here only the specific snake with viper/adder in its name
There is the viperous (?)/zmijovití subcategory - only the snakes in this category aren't called viper if it's not their specific name, the "viper" isn't interchangable with viperous
Generally it's hadi - all snakes and then jedovatí hadi (venomous) - even cobras or any snake with venom (again, not speaking detailed zoology, but like laic public) and škrtiči (boa
or stranglers
or what is used in English)
It's basically the same meaning as in English - chřestýš, because his tail chřestí.
the most recent is from last Thursday, was a group of tourist (two girls one boy) having some mental breakdown after they were not allowed to sit at the bar (place was reserved and there were reservation signs) and obviously manager name they asking for was not given to them
They leave with "a threat" they are going to call a police, unfortunately it was at my favourite basement place with no cell signal so I missed these surprised Pikachu faces after response from police
A chinese female tourist taking a piss near the escalator leaving the Můstek metro station vestibul
I yelled at her that this is Prague, not Paris
There is lot of it
Changing many on streets, buying trdelník, and so on
Important to note that bike lanes in Amsterdam's historical centre (where I presume most of the tourists are going) aren't properly marked and the sidewalks are extremely narrow and often than not littered with other bikes or people just standing in the way
I had a massive headache about 3 hours into my time there because I just had to be on high alert 100% of the time in case an idiot on a bike came flying down my way at speed
I know that Amsterdam obviously isn't all of the Netherlands, and the lanes outside of the centre were properly marked and planned, but the planning in the centre is just piss-poor and inexcusable
I mean we already have Black Fridays and Santas and what not, so why not this one
Yeah, nice strawman you made out of me there, assholes
First of all, pedestrians need to cross the street sometimes
There are almost no pedestrian crossings in the centre, therefore you just need to pick a spot and expect the worst
I have almost gotten hit 3 times while crossing the street because cyclists didn't yield for me when crossing, and mind you this was after I checked both ways 5 times since I have seen people crossing before me also nearly get hit
Second of all, sometimes, as I have already stated, the sidewalks aren't usable at all due to the sheer amount of bikes and people just standing around on them, there is no real way how to avoid that
Thirdly, a lot, and I mean A LOT of bikelanes are level with the sidewalks and are only separated by a slightly different pavement tile, which makes them extremely easy to miss
In one specific instance a cyclist threw herself at full speed into me and a crowd of other people trying to cross the street, ringing her bell like a maniac and yelling at us to get out of the way
Where I come from, vehicles need to yield for pedestrians
Need I continue, or will you get off your high horse and realise that the infrastructure in Amsterdam's centre sucks for anyone who isn't on two wheels
Nearly every street is flanked or cleft with a bike lane with cyclists going at breakneck speeds relatively to the amount of people there, creating an extremely hostile feeling for anyone who just wants to walk from point A to point B. I have been to several other European capitals and in none of them I have felt as ostracised from using the street as a pedestrian simply as a result of urban planning
I live in Hradec, Czechia, the most bike friendly city in the entire country
There are bike lanes and shared bike-pedestrian paths virtually everywhere, from the centre to the very suburban outskirts
I am not bad at reading traffic, you're just fabricating an image of me to make it easier for you to shit on me
I am sharing my genuine experience I've had when visiting Amsterdam, and you saying "ur wrong lol ur just stupid" isn't going to change what I've seen there
Also, if you have read my original comment, you well know I was talking about the historical centre, the part of the city with narrow and busy streets with a very random urban layout, not about the entire city
I have also had COUNTLESS experiences where bike lanes went smack-down middle of a street, sometimes cutting across sidewalks without ANY warning
And so what that the capital of your country is popular
Prague is too, and has handled the situation much, MUCH better than Amsterdam, with a much friendlier layout that has entire streets being reserved 100% for foot traffic
Think about it, if literally everyone from everywhere around the world is saying how confusing and bad the situation in Amsterdam is in regards to the clashing of cyclists and pedestrians, it just MIGHT BE a fault of the cyclists and poor planning than just everyone's elses
Newsflash, the Netherlands aren't the only country where cyclists are commonplace on the streets, it's not like everyone who hasn't lived in your country is completely oblivious of how bike traffic should work
As I've said, get off your high horse and stop defending your half-assedly planned city centre by shouting "YOU'RE JUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND BIKELANES" at everyone
Good urban planning is intuitive and doesn't require being on high alert 100% of the time when moving around in a street
It's 'venkov' in Czech Republic, which means exactly the same thing as 'vidék'.
I don't think there is a general word meaning "everything but Prague". There is a derogatory term "vidlákov" - loosely translated as "shithole"  and it's derived from vidlák - which could be translated as redneck
It can be used for any rural area and the city of Brno :))
We use the word Venkov which means rural area for literally anything outside of Prague
I’d also say ‘vidlákov’ fits, but it is mostly referred to a specific place rather than to whole area
Never heard of this, lol
Also provincie, meaning the provinces
This made my day XDDD
Well I knew that it was used and had similar meaning in other Slavic languages but I didn't know it existed in other non-related languages like Hungarian too
I mean your expectation of Czechs not understanding it wasn't exactly unfounded - we have jokes about how is Hungarian language completely uncomprehensible compared to basically any other language :D
You guys in Greece wear socks in sandals
Because if not, you cannot call your clothing “similar to Czech”
You don't need anything to cross the border
Well you should have an ID on you, but it's not like you're going through some border checkpoints
You're just hiking through a forrest and suddenly you get a message from your operator welcoming you to another country
It's no different than going the same distance in your country really, traveling wise
The trains I usually take in my hometown near the border are often starting in one country and ending in the other, you just hop on the train like on any other
Unless you live near the border, we dont go often
Language barier and also we dont have euros, so its another small hinder that you cannot pay anything without card (parking, entrance fees, icecream
There was no real change, you just dont wait at borders 30min-1h.
People in border areas casually go shopping abroad, either because of better product quality or cheaper prices
Also there are people, who Are working abroad, but living in Czechia
Here in the Czech Republic some people are married or have families in Slovakia so people visit them regulary
You just need your ID to get into countries that are in the EU
fuck, there are so many people using czenglish, even mcdonalds used it once, it was like "Jsi hungry na new burgery
" and the combination of half czech half english whole words is really fucking cringe
People seem to be amused by our informal greetings, whether it's *čau* (from the Italian ciao) or *ahoj* (from
sailors
I guess it was first documented in English
It became widespread some time before WWII because of the enormous popularity of river tourism among Czechs
Also čus from tschüss
Ah right, that makes sense
I also never thought about that despite speaking German, I'd assume it was just a variation of čau
Well, you can always take the first step and try to start a new quirky trend
Definitely Slovak (partly from immigration, partly from similarity)
Definitely Slovak and if I don't count Slovak then it is Russian
Slovak - The language is mostly the same as ours except for the ř. Almost everyone here can speak Slovak, not because they learned to, they just can
probably polish or slovak since we have a lot of people here from there
Surprising amount of my classmates are quite clueless unless you really guide them step by step
Which imo is a bit troubling in an engineering uni
I'm kinda forcing my two younger brothers to be a bit more computer literate whenever I'm back home
Explaining sw, how internet works, what each part does when we're cleaning their PC etc
Basics, but they can build upon them
I don't agree with this
I think here it's a big hit or miss
Either the person only understands phone apps and that's about it, or sits at their pc all day and can troubleshoot most problems
Though that might be because I grew up only in a few Krajs and it may be different in Morava and Slezko
Totally agree
I'm a senior software engineer, but if you want a PowerPoint presentation from me, it's gonna suck
I can add slides, text and pictures, but that's the extent of my PowerPoint skills
Same with Word formatting etc
I can use Excel reasonably well but still am no expert
Sometimes it feels like way too much
You can smell it almost all the time in Prague
I am still for legalization though
Though illegal, very popular among youth and polarizing among everyone else
I know a lot of people that smoke it
But I know WAAYYY more people that don't smoke
I'd say 2-4/10 smoke it
It's mainly that one starts to smoke it and then his friends do too as that's the case with my friends
(tho I don't smoke it) Like there's village nearby and it's easier to count the people who don't smoke it
EDIT: Oh, and it's illegal
very popular, I can choose probably any direction from our place and within 10 minutes I will reach some place where smoking whatever you want is allowed (and smoking inside itself is officially banned for over 3 years)
Not really, because it's not allowed to give kids names with "incorrect" spelling
Some of them have a few variations (for example Nikola, Nikol, Nicola, or Nicole), but they're not usually considered that strange or "quirky".
I remeber my first time in Finland, a friend of mine introduced his sister to me and I had no idea about Finnish spelling at the time, so I just did my best to remember how it sounds
I was pretty shocked that what sounds like Yennü is actually Jenny
And since then I've been confused about people who have an English sounding name, but are not English speaking natives
Wait
It’s not allowed
Could you get away with Džon or Džesika, though
I mean, that is the correct transliteration
Somebody from Vietnam I'm guessing
Well, you have to jump through hoops to get any non-standard names approved at *matriční úřad*, and "incorrect spelling" is specifically listed as something they're not okay with
However, the list of "existing names" they use allegedly has around 17 000 of them, so it's quite rare to pick something outside of that
No idea, you'd have to ask the experts at *Ústav pro jazyk český*.
I am planning to move to probably Ukraine
It is mostly dut to the fact that the Czech Government is extremely incompetent and corrupt
You don't understand the Incompetence of the Government
Also, "kolej" means both a rail and student dormitory, I don't know why
Nah, you're never more than a few kilometers away from villages, hiking trails, tourists etc
I don't really care about that TBH
I sure wish we had more space for wildlife and natural ecosystems somewhere, but I'm not an outdoorsy kinda person myself
yes, if you mean something like three or five miles
Wouldn't really bet on 8, 10 is probably impossible
These are mainly former and existing military areas where  almost no one lives, some small parts of nature parks and some border areas where population was moved away after ww2
so like the current PM
Our current prime minister is Slovak, he can’t even speak our language properly, so here’s your answer to that
Kinda controversial generally speaking, but a Slovak could be accepted (our prime minister is already Slovak)
I think it would mostly depend on their language fluency and perceived level of "integration" with the culture
I can imagine for example someone who grew up here since childhood (and - let's be real - who isn't black or brown), but just happened to be born elsewhere, getting elected in a few years, why not
I don't think it would be at all, unless that country was China
It IS quite controversial
Yep, Pfeffel was rolling in Upper East Side
Remember Schwarzenberg vs Zeman elections
Imagine he were born not in Prague, but somewhere in Germany or Austria
**things you know only because of watching The Crown*
Seznamzpravy leads some pretty interesting investigative journalism
Hospodarske Noviny have a quality journalism, but controversial owner
Reflex is vulgar right wing journal opposed to government
But these are only inconvenience for government, because prime minister OWNS largest media house and these I mentioned are just smaller players
Seznam zpravy
They're a newspapers owned by a site called [seznam
cz] \- some sort of czech google
They do a lot of investigating stuff and exposed some political scandals
Such as our prime minister kidnapping his son who was involved with him stealing 2 million euro from the EU to Crimea so he couldn't testify against him
Oh and he's still our prime minister, noone in this God forsaken country seems to care
Sadly, none
Our prime minister actually straight up owns like half of all mainstream newpapers, so that's where we're at
None, because our president owns them all
I would add Czech TV
They do pretty good job even though they are public service (payed by television licence fees)
I'd add "Deník N" and "neovlivni
cz" both of which do investigative journalism
Even though I wouldn't say the government is afraid of them
I think historically Slovakia is the only country we've ever considered our friend, others were just "neigbours" or outright rivals (Poland, Hungary, Austria) and sometimes even bullies (Germany, Austria)
And before modern Slovakia popped out, we had the most friendly relations with Slovaks and Sorbs
But our ancient nemesis
Liechtenstein
We've only formally established relations 10 years ago and there are still disputes
Slovakia or Russia (before 1917)
Basically any slavic country except Poland
I mean we sure do like your beaches
If only more of your tourists would also get lost in the Czech mountains we could be tourist buddies
:-)
>before modern Slovakia popped out, we had the most friendly relations with Slovaks and Sorbs
I'm not entirely sure about Sorbs, but we didn't really have any relations with the Slovaks before the early 20th century
The only real interactions between Czechs and Slovak before were limited attempts to spread religion, so much so that there was a push to make Czechs to be the cultural model for Slavs living in Northern Hungary
The next large-ish interaction between our nations was during the 1840s as Pan-Slavism gained its brief popularity, though that was an interaction in a much broader scale and not limited to just Czechs and Slovaks alone
I'd argue our oldest friend would be Poland, or even more specifically Silesia( + Klodzko, I'm not sure if they count as Silesia or not)
Not only that they were a Bohemian Crown Land up until the war of War of the Austrian Succession, but Bohemian and Silesian nobles were historically on good terms and Silesians were present in the Bohemian kingdom relatively abundantly, in slightly lesser amounts than Germans according to estimates
Yeah ontacts were made in the 19th century and Czech national revival had had notable impact on the Slovak one, but even in the middle ages Slovaks came to study in Prague for example
The border between Slovácko and Upper Hungary was actually fairly blurry and wasn't closed in a sense that we know from the 20th century
Another thing is Great Moravia, if you consider somewhat silly answers, but the point of this whole thread is to be kinda simplistic and silly, so hence my answer
I also didn't state that it was some kind of super long friendship
Sorbs were the same case
I'd argue that Poland was never our friend
It was our largest regional rival in the middle ages and there were hardly any serious links in the early modern period
Again, the only temporary sense of brotherhood stemmeed from panslavism and shared opposition of Slavic peoples against German dominance in the Austrian monarchy
I've avoided Silesia on purpose, as Silesian identity is kinda complicated, considering population transfers and language evolution since the middle ages
Being Silesian meant something entirely different 1000 years ago than 250 years ago
Sheit
It's resisting the [fundamental country force]
Come and take it, mountain boy
I'm currently wearing T-shirt saying "New York"
never been to US
So dark it could pick cotton
Really
Nothing is sacred, nobody is spared
There's a reason Czechs were nicknamed "Laughing Beasts" by Nazi occupants
I'd say nothing is taboo, from innocent to DOOM level of brutal, puns and wordplays, but we mostly make fun of others (nations, groups, people), but in great fun offensive, not hateful offensive
Our humour is so dark, it would be instantly beaten by USA cops
Czech
Gallows humour, very self aware
Nazis were really shocked when they occupied us and opressed and slaughtered people and they made jokes about it all the time
Heydrich called us "laughing beasts".
Our humour is one of the few reasons I’m proud to be Czech
I mean look at us - we are keeping Babis at a power
Our humour can’t get much darker than that
Top 10 practical jokes that went too far
Czeskie memy is my favorite thing from now on
Even low hanging fruit count
Ah yes, the buses from Brno
Sounds like what's going in a lot of countries, ours included
The PM completely clueless and the occasional competent person managing to push through with some actually competent measure
Brno is a joke itself
Underground (and other things big cities have) in Brno (the 2nd biggest city in the Czech Republic)
I agree with the last one
I actually used to care about the US politics way more than my country's. Now I mostly care about domestic politics, but I'm also interested in Poland's and Slovak politics and vaguely of most other countries, even those outside Europe or North America
I briefly follow Slovak's politics (neighbourhoodly feel + my boyfriend is Slovak) and I try to keep some general overview of politics in Hungary, Poland and Germany
I also follow Britain and US, they have good drama over the Channel / ocean :D plus EU studf
But well, I studied political science, so my interest is probably off average
Probably not to the same extent as Czech and US politics (which is like the best TV show ever) but yeah, I'm intersted
I try to follow EU countries closely enough that I have an updated view of what's roughly going on there and what the issues seem to be
Ofc mostly it's about France, UK, Germany and then our neighbors
Don't really know what's going on in Scandinavia or the Balkans
I try to check out the parties before foreign elections
However, since there are almost 50 countries in Europe, I mostly have a shallow understanding of what's going on there
I see you love to torture yourself my friend
Nor a political party I can pronounce haha
Well after we crown Bosnia, I can quite confidently give you the award for the second most what in the actual fuck political scene
It is sad, but it's understandable
after all you have many youtubers and prominent media constantly talking about US politics, which are much more entertaining than those of European countries (maybe except UK and Brexit) and USA is just so influential it's good to be interested in their politics aswell
Wait
that was the most "interesting" part
To be fair it doesn't really matter who's in the white house
It's all just a bunch of corrupt crooks in a very corrupt swampy mid-atlantic area
To the average American, what happens in their state, city, neighborhood and family is 10x more important than which crazy partisan joker sits in the white house
Well we may have our own Japanese nationalists, but we don't have korwin-mikke so it's nowhere near as hilarious to watch
Well let me rephrase that
A Japanese sushi salesman, who got into Czech politics to make more money and after analysing his niche, adopted anti-immigrant (of all the people) rhetoric, winning 10% of the vote in the general elections
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
To play the devil's advocate, Tomio Okamura is 1/2 Czech, 1/4 Japanese and 1/4 Korean
He also has a brother who is in the Christian democratic party and who is quite the opposite of him
You definitely should
Babiš came from Slovakia to Czechia, after he finishes with us he's obviously coming to Germany, continuing west until he destroys whole world
Definitely
I used to think Czech politics are boring af, but after Babis took office, it got much more interesting
Painful to watch, but still interesting
He's very entertaining to watch
Regardless of what comes out of his mouth hahah
I'm aware and should indeed be called on this for accuracy's sake
I wasn't indenting to question his nationality or origin in detail since then I would have to list what you did
It's mostly just a light hearted funny comparison when contrasted with his stance and wouldn't be as funny if I went to specifics
The sad truth is that every politician in our scenes will want to (or end up having to) fuck with you
May as well enjoy the satire while it happens
In my hometown of Brno we have extensive underground areas
In the 1970s, an unmapped ancient water pipe collapsed under two people waiting at a tram stop during a thunderstorm and the water took one of them, a woman, with it
Her body was never found, because nobody really knows where the pipe leads
Mind you, this is only one of many such unmapped places in Brno
The underground here is exciting and scary at the same time
I have been to many of those places, but concerning that particular claustrophobic old water system where the woman disappeared, there is no way I'm going in
There are abandoned tunnels all under my city
There is an entrance in most of my towns basements including mine
Our entrance has been barricaded with bricks a long time ago
Sometimes, you can hear some noises coming from the tunnels
It's usually footsteps or things falling
That means there must be someone using those abandoned tunnels for God knows what
The weird thing is that the tunnels are barricaded from all sides, meaning they can't be using them for city travel
There is one castle, that is built to defend things from going out, not inside
According to legend, there is a hole to the hell in the middle of the castle
Where the hole is supposed to be, there is now small church
That would be Houska castle,
I don't know the exact details, but legend says, that since Stone Age, some strange creatures climbed from strange hole in the rock
In middle ages (13th century) Houska Castle was built, but it was strange one
It didn't have any strategic location and it also didn't have kitchen and any well, only rain water collector
What it did have were defensive walls, that were aimed inward
After some time, a chapel was built above the hole
The strange thing is, that its walls are always a bit moist
In late middle ages, the way to avoid death penalty was, to be lowered in the hole in the rock, to tell them what's in there and most prisioners chose death over freedom, but those who chose to be lowered there went crazy according to the legend
Also Nazis settled there and there are some unconfirmed legends about an occult experiments
But this is just a legend
Brno is a weird place
Not surprised
It’s Brno, after all
I've been to Brno many times as I live pretty close but I've never heard of this
Is it throughout the whole city or just certain parts
Reminds me of those four geocachers getting swept away in the Prague canals two years back
Not as scary because they did go down there, but still
And all those tunnels supposedly leading into houses, oof
Is it Znojmo
I heard that the underground there is pretty interesting, with multiple stories and all
And no one's doing anything about it
I thought that would be Zeman lol
Was not dissappointed
Without looking it up, I vaguely remember reading somewhere that they were probably laid down in the early 19th century
So about 200 years old
Depends
Most places are in the historical center, some are in the wider center, but there is also a couple of places on the outskirts
The ones around the historical center are mostly old cellars, some of them are as old as the gothic period
The ones in the wider center are mostly infrastructure or wartime objects
For example, the river Ponávka is going under the city and parts of it are accessible on a boat
But they say that while a lot of places are known to exist, only a minority of them has been properly mapped and explored
I personally don't know many people who know about it, but some places I discover through the word of mouth, some are hinted at on the internet
The exact location is never published, because I suppose the people who know about them want to keep it free of the homeless, taggers, drug addicts etc
I won't publish the exact places here, either, but if you're interested, I can give you some info on where to start looking
Feel free to send me a DM
Oh yeah, cellars connecting buildings are my favorite
From what I heard, those are more common in Prague than here, but I've been to a handful
It's like a secret passageway that almost nobody knows about and makes me feel like I know something special, even though their practical usability as a shortcut is probably close to zero
Quite indeed
I remember someone has said that "Czechs are the dwarfs of Europe". Gunsmiths, beer, mountains and now . . . underground tunnels
Ah yes, It's all coming together
The country has a very rich history
Also a lot of activity throughout thousands of years as it is a meeting point of 3 major ethnic groups
Medieval Warfare, crafts
combine that with mining history, military bases under totalitarian regime and you have a lot of creepy shit
Especially regarding mines and tunnels
I unfortunately have no clue what they were used for
Perhaps as a way to travel in the event of apocalypse
I only know there is an entrance in almost every basement and there is also a barricaded surface entrance around 240 meters away from my home
I should study my city's history a bit more
I don't know about his city but in Brno there is a large underground created by connecting cellars of the houses and it were used for storage in middle ages
No, it's around 149 kilometers away from Znojmo
I unfortunately can't tell you where it is, because I still live there
Yup, been to Znojmo underground and it's pretty cool
I was only there as a tourist with a group a few years ago, so I don't remember that much but it was interesting
I think he's talking about the Houska castle
Yeah, good luck with that
We wanted to go there, but we couldn't find the right turn even after hour of searching
Either some dark forces didn't want us there or I just suck at navigation
Probably the dark forces
Well yes
Our country is also very small
But our people are really bloody tall
175 cm is our average height and I am 183 cm
Judging by your flair, you most likely already know, though
Also been there
Never been in Brno's tunnels, but you are completely right
Tábor's tunnels really do feel like a D&D dungeon
Tunnels in my city are also connected, although I doubt they were used for storage, since everyone has a basement
Yep, Houska
All I know is that Brno is pretty cursed
I am commenting to correct a mistake I made
I have studied some books about my city and found out the tunnels were made in the middle ages as an escape passage
I have no clue what they were to escape from, but my city is full of walls and castles used in war
So potentially, it was to escape if there came to be an invasion by the enemy
I looked at the blueprints for my house and it was built in 1806
Although, there is a strong potential there stood another house on the grounds, where mine stands
I have 0 blood and i never had a problem with mosquitoes (I get like one bite per summer) or ticks
Now I wonder if there is something wrong with my blood, because this is like the 100th time I hear 0 blood gets the worst of it :D
You got that right
Very common and quite accepted
I first got drunk when I was 13 and my mum laughed at me the next day
Pretty much all of my peers started drinking around that age
I actually stopped drinking when I turned 18, lol
Now I drink only handful of times a year
Buying can be a bit hard because it's illegal to sell alcohol to minors but it can be done
Really depends on the cashier
I never really had to buy any alcohol when I was a minor because if I went to a party/celebration and there were drinks, there was always someone older who was legal age or they looked 18 so I don't really have an exprerience with that
And if I needed alcohol to bring with me to party I just grabbed a bottle of moonshine that I could get for free from one of my neighbours, haha
Extremely popular, which is probably because there is no drinking age here
lol czechia is the country where most beer per capita is consumed, and basically everyone has at least tried beer before 18
Very
*sips beer*
>moonshine
*Moravák detected*
Yeah, I started around 14 with vodka, joined with beer at 16
Večerka always sells anyone :D I stopped drinking hard alcohol at 19, now I only drink beer
Guilty, haha
In the last legislative elections 2017  there were 31 parties on the ballot and 9 of them got into the Chamber of Deputies (which is the largest number in the history)
There used to be a big left-wing party (Social Democrats) and a big right-wing party (Civic Democrats) with several minor parties but corruption scandals and the rise of populism fractured the scene
Now is the dominant party populist ANO (support ~30%) followed by Civic Democrats and Pirates (both ~15%)
Then there are falling Socialists and Communists (both ~5-10%) whose voters got cannibalised by ANO
Finally there are five other parties struggling to cross the 5% treshold (Christian democrats, anti-immgiration party, liberal-conservatives, mayors and independents, and a new conservative party)
I'd say right now, there is quite a big variation amont the parliamentary parties
But I think the biggest divide right now is the populism/anti-populism instead of the traditional left/right division
I am basing the percentages on the election results not polls although there's been very little change anyway
I suppose you can group the parties into certain categories
This is completely subjective, some of these are hard to pinpoint
**Left-wing** - **Social Democrats** and the **Communists** are the most traditionally left wing parties
Social Democrats these days are fairly socially progressive, while the Communists are socially conservative
Together they got around 15% of the vote
These parties used to be much stronger but the populist parties syphoned off their support base
They have the most support among the elderly
**Liberal parties** - **Pirate Party** and **STAN**. These are liberal parties, Pirates being by far the most socially progressive party
They are rather new and have the biggest support among younger and more educated voters, together they got 15% of the vote
**Populist parties** - **ANO** and **SPD**. I am hesitant to put these together but they are both heavily populist and have similar voters
ANO is the ruling and biggest party, they are a catch-all populist party, very hard to pinpoint any kind of ideology, they just do whatever brings the most votes
SPD is the "far-right" populist party, leaning heavily into anti-immigrant and anti-EU rhetoric
Their appeal is to less educated and older voters
Together they got around 40% of the vote
**Right-wing** - **ODS** and **TOP 09
** ODS used to be the biggest one of the two major parties but they have also fallen off in recent elections
They are economically right-wing, socially semi-conservative party
TOP 09 is more liberal and is the most pro-EU party
Their voters tend to be highly educated and urban
Together they got around 15% as well
**Christian Democrats** - this leaves me with this party, which I struggle to put into one of the above categories
Their main thing is being socially conservative and appealing to their dedicated old christian voter base, which has been shrinking so they get around 5% of the vote these days
That's about it other parties are pretty much irrelevant
You have the Greens, which is your traditional Green party, then there is a Libertarian party both of which sit around 1-2%. And then there are usually about 20 different far-right/anti-EU parties on the ballot which combined get like 1% of the vote
Again, pretty subjective, I am sure many will disagree with me
Great summary
Library card
I love to buy books and I always have more than I can read
Because of that, I don't really have a reason to borrow books in the library, but I'm still paying fees and going to read my books there
(but because of covid I haven't been there for some time)
My girlfriend loves birds, so she's paying for my (and her parents' and sister's) membership in the Czech Ornitological Society
Needless to say I have never participated in anything that had anything to do with it, except for when I was once tricked to go for trip which turned out to be a bird watching camp
I send monthly donations to a nonprofit organization which lobbies alternative transport around Prague
They work to make the city better and safer for pedestrians, bikers and public transport commuters (at the expense of personal car transportation)
I guess I might get some benefit off it in the long run, but I hope the answer counts
Local craft breweries all the way
When the coronapanic hit, I started actively looking for smaller independent places to shop around, not only supporting the store but also the local producers
In Czech Republic you can often find great local farmer products in wine stores
Since now, I evade supermarkets when on vacation in favour of local bakeries and farmers
An international supermarket chain will find a way to overcome a crisis but the smaller need our support to do so
A tip on how to describe Discord to non gamers - it's basically Slack but not for business
(At least that's what I think in my very limited discord experience)
It may be "To beru" (literally I take that) which may be I accept this or also I can agree to that
Or "Jak myslíš" (As you think), which has the feel of I don't agree, but won't argue anymore - but also doesn't indicate that I at least accept
But I don't think we have something with exactly the same meaning and I'd probably just use "rozumím" (I understand) or "aha, dobře, fajn" (like "ok") to accept but not make statement about my opinion
Also "Budiž", although it's pretty uncommon
Maybe "a dost"? I guess we could use that too
I don't think ano - yes is in any way a possible equivalent here
"Ano" literally just means "yes". It's commonly used, but definitely is more formal and in no way synonym for "fair enough".
Ano sounds way too formal for ordinary people to use in a casual conversation
Nope, that's _enough [of this]
_ and it's foreboding
Normally, one given name and one family name, say "Jana Nováková". Some folks get a second given name when they are christened (as children or adults), say "Jana Marie Nováková", and some folks have a double family name after they get married, appending their spouse's name to theirs (but usually the wife adopts the husband's surname, abandoning her own), say "Jana Marie Nováková-Horáčková".
In Czechia we have just given name + surname most of the time
Surname is mostly inherited from father (if married)
However the feminine form of the surname is different from the masculine form
Example:
Male form: *Novák*, *Malinský*
Female form: *Nováková*, *Malinská*
Adjective surnames have masculine/feminine adjective ending and suffix *-ová* is added to nominative female surnames
The purpose is to be able to conjugate the word in a sentence
This happens to foreign surnames as well, so you may spot names like *Clintonová*, *Streisandová*, *Williamsová* in Czech newspapers
Only first name and surname
Middle names are not common
For Czech, it's
Given name, at least one, but not more than two
Name should be selected from an approved list, i.e. random names can't be given
Nor one can use altered version of a name
If a foreign child being born here, the list restriction doesn't apply
If a foreigner gains Czech citizenship, s/he can keep the current name(s) but the limit of 2 still applies
Surname
One, unless you inherit double one, or you decided to switch to double when marrying (unless one of you already have double, in this case it can't be tripled), or you're adopted and want to keep the original one along the adopter's one
Female surnames are mutated according to Czech grammar (ones that look like an adjective are declined as feminine adjective, ones looking like soft adjective declined accordingly, ones ending in -ů not declined, the rest gets -ová), this can be waived if you're foreigner, married to a foreigner, or have permanent residence abroad
Also, all limitations can be waived if you're EU citizen and decide to use naming convention of your state
I've also seen a few women who ended up both keeping their maiden name and accepting their husband's surname after getting married, while not inflecting the husband's surname (not adding the "-ova")
Example: *Jana Nováková* married *Michal Matějka* --> *Jana Matějka Nováková* (not *Jana Matějková Nováková*)
Another thing when marrying is that it's not mandatory to change surnames
The couple can both keep their original surnames
They do have to agree which surname will be their kids surname when marrying though
It also is possible to join the surnames so both of the adults have both of the surnames
They have to decide, which goes first and then the kid has only the first surname
As for the suffix, females don't have to add the suffix when marrying in some cases:The woman is a foreigner, or plans to live long term in foreign country, or the man has foreign surname and is a foreigner
There are some people who did actually get the offices not to add the suffixes to their surname
Most of them had lied or did actually marry a foreigner or planned to stay abroad
Some, however, did have so unusual names that they were told that the original form would be better
An example that comes to my mind is Kateřina Jacques (she's a politician and a publicly known figure)
Edit: also, the foreigner thing leads to the second most common surname being Nguyen because it has only one form
*This info might be unreliable as all the websites talking about surnames can't actually access up-to-date info from our government and they state that there are only two thousands of people with this surname while 7 years ago there were above twenty thousands
There was no genocide so perhaps the archives must be incomplete
Sure, I have described what is most common
There are many special cases (e.g. Petrů) but they are relatively rare
Apparently there has been a lawsuit about that in 2017
The court has ruled that the name has to be written in latin alphabet and in its full authenticity including nonstandart characters if it would in extend requiredy by  the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and some other applied laws/texts
So yes, if it were important to the name, you wouldn't have it changed
&#x200B;
Fyi, our keyboards do support almost every special character that can be written in latin alphabet
We have right alt as a switch for special characters and Đ is written as rAlt+d and đ is written as rAlt+s. Instead of numbers, we have ěščřžýáíé and numbers are written with shift
The characters english keyboard has there are written with rAlt
Many programmers really love this about the Czech keyboard because it is really simple to write {}, <> etc
So Czech keyboard has two variants - the common one qwertz and programmer one qwerty
No surprise there either
You aren't writing koláčky every day so you don't need to have á and  č so easily accessible :D
Germany lost the war
Leopold's Congo was his personal property
That is why
From what I'm reading, many people mistake 19
century for middle Ages
Dead by something a bit of penicillin can sort today
Or watching grandsons digging in the mud
I guess I would be dead or wounded since my country fought against France 4 years ago
With my background of educated middle class, relatively good health and general inclinations preserved, I suppose I would turn into a naive romantic historian/archaeologist/folklore collector seeing remains of our glorious Slavic pagan ancestors everywhere
Future generations would make fun of my silly discoveries but also venerate me as an early founding father of this scientific field
I would also probably have already written several collections of poems forgotten by everyone else except for schoolkids who would hate me even in the 21st century for having this boring stuff in their curriculum
As for my job, I would probably become a private teacher for some noble family or a bit liberal (and thus not very successful) priest
Edit: Being born into a family of my ancestors, I would probably become a farmer, miner or mill owner, but the aforementioned career would still be possible as there was some vertical social mobility
Well, social mobility was, compared to middle Ages, higher
Kids were sent to schools and industrial revolution was kicking off
Not everyone was the typical dirty peasant without zero outlook
Yeah
Taiwan has 10x more investments in our country than China
So I'm in
I am from Czech republic
China uses our president like puppet
China made promises in investment but none came
One of our politicians went to Taiwan to discuss trade
China used their embassy and our president to not allow it but Vystrčil went anyway
Taiwan was pleased and already big investments were promised to become bigger
China was pissed and threatened entirity of my country, but when they tried to take away economical benefits from us, they discovered they could only cancel order on few hundred pianos
Taiwan was so pleased that they sent us few expensive life support units to save people in critical state due to covid-19
China sold us low quality masks and offered us vaccine with success percentage bellow 50%.
Funniest thing is that we export more into Taiwan or Russia than to China
I would like to trade with Taiwan just to hurt that fat bloated dictatorship calling itself peoples republic
I've heard that in Rovaniemi (Finland) or on the North Pole, but he was never bringing me presents
Baby Jesus always did
Saint Nicholas (svatý Mikuláš) visits kids on December 5th, accompanied by an angel and a devil
It's unclear where does he come from tho, the "living tradition" includes no mention of his origin
Historically he comes from Asia Minor of course
Exactly it's up to kid's imagination
> Sinterklaas lives in Spain
Only this week I've discovered this from a random video on internet
Also, naughty children supposed to be taken back to Spain
"Don't threaten me with good time"
To be fair, when I went to Finland years ago, I kinda thought that some of the areas in the north are permanently covered in snow
So, since I was planning to travel pretty much all around the country, when I was packing, I was considering taking my winter clothes
It was August, by the way
See
This is why it's irresponsible to tell drunk tourists funny things like that
But what about Voldemort
Would they find hiding Voldemort
That's the most American thing a tourist can ask
Its the famous german humour
No bullshit
Well if a single small car Škoda Fabia eliminate FOUR APC Pandur II 8x8 with single hit and repair of APCs took 3 years
I think it is kinda  embarrassing for us
Also the story how Czech goverment bought these APCs which was amphibious but after our armor upgrades they are too heavy to float so now it is ground only vehicle is also funny because goverment paid 3 times bigger money than for example Pandurs exported to Portugal, because the want amphibious version
Regional embarrassement, though I think this is more places in the Republic
Regions of Hradec and Pardubice created a unified transit pricing system which made fare prices consistent across the two regions, together with introducing an RFID card that you could store your tickets or money on so that the transportation could be cash-free
Here's the fucking catch
The RFID card cannot be charged with money on tickets online
You have to take physical cash to the bus driver for him to charge the card for you and then sell you a ticket by deducting the money from the card
If you want a ticket for a whole week or a month the card is now the only way how to get them
The system made ticket selling literally 3× more time consuming and complicated
I fucking hate OREDO and everything their shitty transport agency stands for
It's also easier to bulletproof old system, that isn't getting plagued by new and new irrelevant updates
>Well if a single small car Škoda Fabia eliminate FOUR APC Pandur II 8x8 with single hit
That is the funny way to put this story, but let's get real: The APCs actually hit each other when the first one braked hard in order not to flatten the Škoda
The actual fuck-up was them not keeping a safe distance when traveling on a public road and of course the way the repairs were handled
verb: "hodit se"
To se bude hodit
= It will be useful sometimes
Hodí se ti ten čas
= Is that time suitable for you
Ten náhrdelník se hodí k šatům. = That necklace will look good with those dress
[kurvítko] — a component which assures the planned obsolescence of a given good
[^(Czech Wikipedia)]
[^(Necyklopedie — Czech Uncyclopedia)] ^(Even though it's uncyclopedia, this article is fairly informative, yeah, that's how bad kurvítka actually are
lucid — however, this rather belongs to academic texts instead of meetings
It's called studeňák (~a cold one) in Czech
For us, you can't have a debate like this without at least mentioning [the Dancing House] near the Prague historic center
A lot of people either love it or hate it, everyone here has an opinion on it
I don't mind it too much, personally
However, by far the ugliest in my opinion is [the New Stage of the National Theater] I hate it so much and the fact that I drive by it nearly every week doesn't help
Eugh
The honorary mention could also be the [Ministry of Interior building] looming over Prague
But that can be said about any concrete-box building from the 20th century
[Ubytovna Kupa] maybe
oh come on, it's not so bad (both of this buildings)
Might be weird but I actually like it
Atleast it's not boring
we have more bubble wrappers :
Wow, I didn't even know this building existed
Yikes
fun fact : the director of CIIRC made a tv document during construction of this building
In one scene, he was standing in unfinished building, and he was saying that he will have a good view on Prague castle from his office
A few scenes later, he complains that he can’t see anything because of that plastic wrap
It's on Jižní město
I know, I'm looking it up right now
Although it looks like it was renovated around 2017 and it [looks a bit better] doesn't hurt the eyes as much
It just looks like a regular old panelák.
Unpopular opinion here, but I actually think that it looks kinda cool
I like the little bridge between the buildings and I can't explain why
In history they teach \_about\_ religions (which is understandable, we went through a fair share of religious wars in the past)
Othen than that: fortunately no and I don't think that will change any time soon, as we are one of the most atheist countries in the world (which is understandable, we went through a fair share of religious wars in the past)
No, we don't have anything like that
It is possible to have it as out of school activity and there are few religious private schools, but it's not part of our public system
No, public schools generally don't. They may have it as an optional class if a certain number of parents request it (or if the whole school is run by a church, then they obviously can make it mandatory), but it's very rare
Only 49 out of more than 4000 elementary schools in this country are religious
We don't have "ethics" as a school subject either, only "citizen's education" in middle school (which includes a bit of everything from actual civics and an intro to world religions to health and sex ed to "don't be racist or bully people") and either more "citizen's education" or "social sciences" in high school
Hell no
We are the most atheist country in Europe, so
Nope
One of the few things we can be proud of - we're one of the most atheistic countries in the world
Fun fact: In the census you can put anything as your religion, in the last census we had 15 thousand Jedi Knights
In my school we were taught religion, but only because it was a Catholic high school
In the first couple of years, it was mostly about Christianity and when we were older, we were taught religionistics about other religions as well
We also had a subject called History of the Christian Church and let me tell you, that was probably the most boring thing I've studied ever
Some of our teachers were fervently religious and assumed we were, too, so they had as memorize lines from the Bible and tried to force their opinions on us (stuff like "Slayer denies God's creation and should be banned" - made me wear a Slayer t-shirt, even though I'm not a huge fan of theirs), but the good ones had interesting discussions with us
But if I've learned one thing, as an atheist, it is the very important realization that almost no Christians today believe in God as a supernatural being or take the Bible literally
It's more of a philosophy or a way to live
It makes me often side with religious people in discussions against ignorant atheists, who believe Christians are all crazed worshippers of a fairytale (although some of them surely are)
I've learned about main religions and some most famous cults -> basic info about them
So we at least had basic information about religions
I think it's needed for atheist because it can be useful info in some cases and people are less likely to believe in disinformations about religions
Brno
Praha vs Brno already is a thing, so let's add to the fire
Čáslav
It's right in the middle so no one can complain it's too remote
Also there is a nice air base nearby
Brno, our highest court is there and also to piss off everyone in Prague
I vote for a more central location
Which would be either Kutná Hora or Pardubice
And because the second option would make Hradec secede from the republic
Kutná Hora doesn't sound so bad
Historically already was the catholic capital a few times during the Hussite wars, and was the second royal town in the kingdom anyway
It's tiny now, but there are precedents for an insignificant town being named the capital and swelling in size
Like Bulgarian Sofia
No, it should be Olomouc
It has much more interesting history than Brno, and it used to be capital of Moravia
But the most important reason why Olomouc is that it would insult Šalina riders
Ostrava, just fuck with as many people as possible
We could still opt for České Budějovice and enjoy the show
Or just Hradubice
Good idea
No, fuck no, I live there, no more people
Quite important, if you ask me
We provide other Europeans with a great, cheap destination for partying
What happens in Prague, stays in Prague
We make tons of cars and other vehicles
Thanks to our EU membership, we make EU borders look nicer than if we weren't part of it (not like Switzerland making a hole in the middle of the EU)
Oh and we make some awesome videogames
Same here, which is, with Koruna in mind, about to be our downfall
Mhmm
Germany is the engine of EU and France is the driver
Nothing is for free, we just pay it with our taxes
The downside might be the way how doctors treat you
They often won't be particularly nice to you and you often wait for a long time in a waiting room
However, this might be because of generally worse customer service here
Nothing is for free, we just pay it with our taxes

However, this might be because of generally worse customer service here
Cost
It takes a huge chunk of your income
Also you are denied some service that you finance cause reasons
Waiting times are crazy
And the quality and attitude of staff can be rather harsh
Hospitals keeping tons of supposed covid patients that are in fact fine
They get paid the same amount of money per patient so it's more profitable to have someone who's fine than someone who you actually have to spent the money on treating
Or so I heard
Yeah, we have a similar system
State co-owned and regulated insurance companies and insurance is mandatory, paid mostly by your employeer
I think it depends
My GP is a pretty decent guy and I only had good experience with the specialists
Though I realize I might be in a minority
Yeah, nursing staff can be rather harsh and inexperienced, though that seems to be more of the fault of the system around it
It doesn't make you a human with an injury but more of a broken box with something rattling inside
I consider it bet that I win in any case
that's pretty shit ngl
Domina est oofora :-)
Sure, I'm not saying they should treat you like a king and personally I wouldn't say it's too bad, but I've been to some doctors who definitely could treat their patients a bit better
Plenty of people rather drive to a different town/city to get a medical treatment just because the service is better there
Atleast that was the case in my town
Well, they are only people after all
It depends on the person
If you don't like your doctor, you can always go to another
having to bribe your doctor for service while paying for it with taxes
:( im sorry
romania sounds like hell
I'm fairly certian that in Czech you can also say behind the computer,  but I never found it weird
Jů ken definitly help wid dét.
School starts at 8, periods of 45 minutes and 10 minute breaks between them, after the second period ther is a 20 minute break
If you have any afternoon classes (after 3:30 pm), you get a whole period break after the 4th, 5th or 6th lesson
In high school you can have up to 9 periods a day but not every day, the mean would probably be about 7 hours
Typically school starts around 7
50 - 8, except my high school didn't - some days started at 7
25 and some at 9
10, because the morning usually had some of our electives so everyone's schedule could be different
Lessons are 45 minutes (sometimes 90 in HS if the teacher decides to not do a break in the middle), breaks are 10 min and one 20-35 min "big break" around 10am
Elementary school starts by only having morning classes (approximately 8 - 12), in later grades you start having afternoon classes first once a week and then 2-3 days a week
There's a minimum and maximum number of mandatory classes prescribed for each grade, the maximum for HS was 35 (x 45 min)
The latest my school ever ended was around 16
40, most students had many after-school activities and would rather cut the lunch break short than stay even 10 minutes later than necessary in the afternoon, so teachers would sometimes make informal adjustments of the schedule in this direction
Friday was never longer than 2pm
Pretty much the same, except school usually started at 8:00, except for some special classes, and some years we had “lesson 0” which started at 7:10
We agreed to those so that we didn’t have to finish after 4 or 5 pm on a long day
I’d get up at 6:20 at latest, get ready, have breakfast, and go walk the dog at 7 or 7:10
We wanted to walk him for as long as possible but our latest bus left at 7:32 and it was a close call
Wait
can you explain more about how these shifts work
That's the first time I hear about this concept
How often do you switch between them
Or who decides which one you go to
Is this done because of capacity issues
Got it, thank you :) I would have loved having afternoon shift as a teenager, haha
It makes sense, it's just very unusual for me to imagine any school not start in the morning all the time
We threw a bunch of guys out of a window, because we didn't like the church and started the Hussite wars, in which we were able to defeat 5 crusades the pope sent against us
Then we did it again, because we didn't like the church and started a major european conflict known as the thirty years war
Some activits changed the president's flag for giant  red shorts, and the President burned them few years later
But his actions weren't reported beforehand, so the president's office got charged with a fee
We, a landlocked country, have attacked Soviet fleet on the lake Baikal and won
That means we have won 100% of naval battles in Czechoslovak history
In the 90's some artist painted an old tank pink, then the city painted it back to normal, than some representatives from parliament painted the tank back to pink (but they had immunity so nothing could be done about it)
It's a famous story in the Czech Republic although it's presented as a heroic decision:
>Far be it that the King of Bohemia should run away
I wonder whether he actually said what I quoted and if yes, then what language he spoke it in
I mean third time's the charm, isn't it
Also 30 years war started and ended in Prague
Started as Czech Protestants were fighting against Catholics and ended as Czech Protestants were defending Prague against Sweedish Protestants
Also [this happened on presidential election day]
Ah, that reminds me the time when we pillaged the polish capital so hard they had to move it
John didn't speak Czech
His son Wenceslas aka Charles IV did tho
Yes, know, it is the same in czech and we learn it in school
It's "defenestrovat".
It's about time
Just the shorts, for now
We use it quite often in Czechia
No, no, the word is actually used quite often in the current Czech political climate
So, I guess we're even
\*all Czech political climates
It's funny, because (at least we were taught that in school) it's not considered a murder, you are just throwing people out of a window and it's on God if he's gonna let them live or die
Welp, dunno how they logically deducted that it's not a murder considering during at least one of these defenestrations there were people below with spears pointing to the sky
Also, there's that saying: "If you throw them out of door, they'll return through window
", but nothing about the other direction
For me, it’s November 17th which marks the beginning of the Velvet Revolution of 1989 when the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia was peacefully overthrown
Usually, there are lots of concerts in the centre of Prague, processions, exhibitions, all in streets where normally cars ride
It’s a beautiful day
Pączki are the best
It’s the first thing I buy when I travel to Poland
And also the last one when I leave
Prague is like a different world haha
I live in a village in south Moravia and oh god this day might spart debate amongst its residents, especially the old people who still think communism is better
I hate this place lol
It is a specific city I guess, even different to other Czech cities in many ways
But this would be the general difference between countryside and cities where people tend to have more liberal views on life
But I understand that you might feel pretty frustrated by that
And it will still take very long to change
In czechia, it’s on evening 24th december
There is early dinner (4-5 PM), then the gifts are unpackaged, and everyone watches fairy tale ať 8 PM
Then there is midnight mass in church, one of few religious rituals that somehow survived
Today
24th of December
Next two days are for visits
The 24th December is called Štědrý den/večer "generous day/evening", so what you would call Christmas Day/Eve
This is the main event, people spend the entire day cooking to have a big dinner of fried carp, other fish or schnitzels with potato salad
Then we open the presents brought by Ježíšek (Baby Jesus) and spend the next two days digesting all the food, laying about, eating Christmas cookies, watching TV and eating more food
Fun fact: people sometimes keep live carp in their bathtubs to be killed, fried and eaten on Christmas Day
I personally don't know anyone who even goes to the church mass at midnight
People sometimes go to choir events before Christmas Eve, but that's usually it

Deffinetely Prague
More specifically historic centre one bridge and castle
Than there's also Český Krumlov with beautiful castle, and gorgeous centre, gorgeous Karlstein and magical Lednicko-Valtický Areál.
Prague's centre along with Charles Bridge is probably the most crowded area with all the infamous tourist traps
Then there's [Český Krumlov] which is a small town in Southern Bohemia but the centre is almost as crowded as Prague
I would add [Karlštejn] [Hluboká] and [Lednicko - Valtický areál ] which are pretty popular aswell though to a lesser degree
Prague, Prague 1 is so filled with tourists you basically have half of the shit for them and the other for the people living there
Worst of all are the gift shops that sell Russian memorabilia IN CZECH REPUBLIC
Before pandemic the centre of Český Krumlov used to be ridiculously overcrowded with mostly Asian tourists
I think if anyone would like to visit this town, now is good time
Then there are tourists in the SPA areas (rich ones in Karlovy Vary, the poorer ones in Poděbrady)
I mean, Karlovy Vary are now Russian territory on Czech soil and I don't know much about Poděbrady Spa
In Poděbrady, plurality of the tourists are Czech, with a lot of other tourists coming from Russia and Germany
Most of them belonging to the elderly
Nobody can name them all or find them on the map, but when we hear it, we just kinda know it's from somewhere in the US
Well, in Europe I mostly know where the cities are located (no clue about Kent, or all those -shire counties - I only know some names)
But in US it is somewhat different; I mostly know the location of the states but not many cities
Yea it's pretty known in my circles
Most people would get lost around finding Maryland, differentiating Missouri and Kansas and stuff like that, but overall knowing of their existence and location of the bigger ones is pretty normal
I can name and place all 50 with capitals and stuff
but I'm into maps and geography so it's not a good example
Most people will probably recognize the name of most them maybe with the exception of like New Hampshire, Rhode Island and some of the other less relevant states
Most people I think will be able to point out Alaska, Hawaii, Florida, Texas and maybe California and that's it
Maybe they'll guess New York
But I could be overestimating here
Personally I can do all of them on a map but I am an exception in that regard
I know only California, NY and Alabama, Texas would be a wild guess
That's where The Mentalist operates

Day 2746 - I keep trying to find the diference
I think I’m going insane
Thinking of renting a car for a higher good
Ohh, like a word stress
Actually English is known for separating meaning only by word stress
Great examples (beside the ones mentioned here already) are words rebel or record
For me it's definitely French, that's probably because it has no roots with czech- russian was much easier for me because of this
Arabic
Absolutely alien phonetics, strange writing system (vowels are there
But we won't write them
Or we will write some of them
Or write another ones, you should know what vowel we meant)
Czech is much more difficult than German
I wouldn't say German is hard
But don't worry my dude
I learn 6 years already and am absolutely horrible
I hate it so much
I know English and Czech
I have to learn German in school as well as English but I'm okay with English
German is kinda weird with pronunciation and grammar I think
Also I want to learn Swedish and Japanese
Czech
I can’t speak it flawlessly even after 17 years
Russian, simply because of the alphabet, and if someone speaks in Russian then it sounds like they are either drunk or on some sort of drugs, I can speak it alright (sort of) but I can't write jack shit in Russian
French has no roots to Czech true but, Russian alphabet looks like it's been written by a slightly drunk crackhead, we could debate about it but I'm not in the mood to debate RN
At we can agree on that brother
For me it wasn't really as hard to learn cyrillic as it is hard to learn anything french
Yes
But I meant just some words
Mostly the a,o,u and just the letters with the double dots on top (I don't have an German keyboard on mobile sorry)
I'm mostly okay with it but some specific letters/words are weird
Also the sch at the front of the word is sometimes pronounced as sch and stuff
I just don't know
Can't blame you but at least I know what letter am I writing because the letters don't repeat 3 times, French looks like a gibberish but after some time and practice you can make sense of it but in Russian two words/letters can look similar or even the same but with some small thing like a line there, one more dot there, it doesn't end that way it ends this way
Aye, that's true, my dislike for learning french was probably caused by my teacher who didn't bother to explain the things we didn't understand, when you're falling behind for 2 years, it's hard to catch up
They do but you have the little dip line at the top saying you it's pronounced sch and there are words where you don't pronounce it as sch at the beginning of a syllable for example Štvát (means irritate someone or be make someone angry) is pronounced schtvat with the a being kinda long
But there is also a word like spát (means sleep) which is pronounced sspat with the a being long again
Fuck teachers like that, I have a teacher like that, *in chemistry* that's even worse
Ah that must suck even more in chemistry as I don't actually have to focus on french
She told me once that if i said "i don't know" once more, she would give me mark 5 for every "i don't know" after that and 'deal with me' this way, so glad she isn't on the school anymore
Hey fellow Czechs
Been looking for you guys like for 5 minutes of scrolling geez

I am sick for like 2 weeks now so it's going to be even worse :-(
Ah man, that sucks, hope you get well soon and catch up

Oh boy
* George Soros wants the population to be more docile and is importing vast ammount of muslim immigrants into europe to create more impresionable and docile population
Because they want our sovereignty
* Germany wants to control us so they dictate the EU what unfair laws they impose to us
Because they want our sovereignty
Also somehow they import immigrants to europe because they are on it with Soros, with more docile population and shit
* Austrians wants to controll us so yadda yadda
* US wants us to be their canon fodder in whatever cowboy powergrab they planning next month
Also importing muslim immigrants
NSA and CIA copying data from our datacentres, CCTV storages, listening to our phonecalls because of resons
* EU wants to turn us into a new soviet union, leftist paradise where we will have to eat white babies or some shit
Dunno, was too drunk to listen
* Russia good
But also
* Ezo and homeopathy and all that jazz is incredibly strong here
One of my familys friend is a very respected veterinarian and his wife, a medical nurse, does bioresonance for people and PETS and she firmly believes it
The general attitute of homeopathy users is something like "I know its sugar water, but what if ...?"
* Velvet revolution was not a peoples uprising but actually a planned power transfer
That one is actually interesting, since a lot of people that came to power after the revolution were on very prominent places of power or knowledge in the old regime while the "political" faces of the regime get deposited
But I just think that those are the type of morally flexible shitstains that would flourish in any regime
And yes
I mean our curent prime minister, our current president and our previous president
Many people believe that our prime minister is a good person and has only good intentions for everyone
But I don't blame people he has very good persuation, communication and manipulation skills
In this area he's an expert
Some supporters of our prime minister say that he isn't corrupt, rather that the whole political opposition, police, courts and also European parliament and commission are corrupted just to take him down
> Ezo and homeopathy and all that jazz is incredibly strong here
My son's pediatrician, she's a good doctor, she has almost 40 years of experience, but she is "pediatrician and homeopath". IDK
There goes my personal conspiracy - that communist regime did some really impressive stuff with education - while the system manage to raise well educated specialists it also manage to debilitate their ability to critically think and analyse written text
Both my parents have engineering degree, a lifetime of experiences and both struggled with high school level newspaper article analysis
In the way that they saw all the details but were unable to identify the general idea
Seeing that was ... disturbing yet impressive
Nope, not a conspiracy, dual product quality is definetely real thing
Usually big companies produce stuff in multiple factories so they create local variants with slightly different recipes (Coca-Cola US uses corn syrup, Coca-Cola Mex uses sugar) based on local prices of ingredients
But since "eastern" mindset calls for highest profit margins in shortest ammount of time locally produced big brands just cut corners where they can
In the end it looks like the Mars candybar bought in germany will be slightly larger, tastier and cheaper than one bought in Czechia
The ingredients on the wrap would be different too
The most infuriating thing about that is the fact that locally produced food for export is qualitatively better than the same brands sold locally, eg export sausages have more meat in them
And it says so on the ingredients section too
But the packing otherwise looks the same
Regarding detergents thats a whole new rabbithole but short story is that they really vary from area to area to comply with local laws, water quality and customs (so it is possible that detergents sold in the east are "weaker" than their western counterparts just because people there are accustomed to using smaller ammounts)
Not answering question
But I have one for others
Ive alway wondered
Even though Germans knew what crimes their SS and Nazi officials did after war ended
Do you think they were angry and sad for losing
Even after seeing the truth
After all, they lost friends and families
They were soldiers fighting war
You are not really interested in politics while bullets kill your friends
Not German and not my grandfather, but my grandmother was in the BDM but fell in love with a British soldier and came to the UK with him at the end of the war
I have english set as my system language so wikipedia defaults to english also
I only ever use the czech one if I can't find something on the english one or I'm looking for something czech, because it usually has more info on stuff that originated in the czech republic
I use almost every time the Czech wikipedia, but when I can't find the article I'm looking for in Czech version, I use the original
The Czech wikipedia is actually really good (not as big as the Swedish one, but still pretty big)
There are many good people working on the Czech wikipedia
However those good people cannot cover everything
I use English wikipedia the most
Czech wikipedia seems only good for stuff relating to Czech Republic and I do not look that up often
I think I even use French wikipedia more than Czech wikipedia
It's quite expansive but the quality varies **drastically** between topics
Some such as math and physics are actually quite good
But anything to do with history for example is just complete garbage
It's often *highly* biased and opinionated, very few or old sources and sometimes you see these sections which are obviously just copied from some dusty history book because they are written in an antiquated language
I usually go straight to English and maybe check the Czech version for terminology or something like that
And of course Czech related stuff
Worse than English in around ¾ of topics, but not bad
Completely normal, the quality of tap water here is more than OK
Yes it is normal, we unfortunately use drinking water for everything if I'm not mistaken
I certainly hope so, because I've been drinking it since ever
Although, some people joke about the taste of water in my hometown (which I don't mind): "You drink half the glass and the rest you eat
Yeah, our water is clean and good, but in restaurants, they'll usually give you bottled one
Our government is a bunch of incompetent meerkats
There are only 3 cities in the list I don't know
All of them in Romania (Iași, Craiova and Galați)
I should do something about that
Well, it's one of last 4 countries in Europe I've never visited
It's depressing to see how the "eastern half" of the EU is a huge white spot for the majority of westerners
Penultimate position, Craiova
I mean, I've heard the name but I have no idea what's this city is, apart from it being in Romania
The next (and last) is the same: heard the name, don't know anything
Iași. I really should visit Romania, because this "test" revelated that my knowledge of the country is shockingly lacking - I knew all the non-Romanian cities after Iași but not the Romanian ones
Zaragoza
North-east of Spain, mentioned in the first verse of "Chancon de Roland":
Charles the King, our Lord and Sovereign,
Full seven years hath sojourned in Spain,
Conquered the land, and won the western main,
Now no fortress against him doth remain,
No city walls are left for him to gain,
Save Sarraguce, that sits on high mountain
> Córdoba
was the capital of the Muslim Spain
Roman remains, magnificent mosque-cathedral

Thank you very much for the recommendations, I appreciate it
Serbia, Moldova and Iceland
You mean Vratislav
We call it "Kolín nad Rýnem" in Czech
I've been to Kosovo
I had just a few days
I visited Pristina and Prizren and enjoyed both
Next time it would be nice to see some monasteries and nature
Don’t... our tenses are easy, but you’ll die on the inflections and persons

We all tend to think our nation's beer is the best in the WORLD
German beer is highly regarded in the world as a whole, while the Dutch Heineken is one of the most common brands worldwide
Danish beer isn't bad at all
UK and Ireland have a drinking culture with their Stouts causing others' envy
Belgian beer is praised in Belgium but I've never heard of it in Czechia
We are the world's largest beer consumers per capita and we're extremely stubbornly persisting on that our brews are the most unique in the world
*Lithuanian breathing on my back*
We all love to drink heavily, complain and hate on imperial system
This is one of the things I like about the way Germans think about politics
I wish more countries adopted this mentality, because national pride hasn't done much good in the great scope of things
I thought you guys were really into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania part of your history
Which took place after Lithuanians had accepted christianity, no
We don't want it either
Crowns gang rise up
As it is in Canada (who switched in '65 I think
), they use the metric system for numbering the US quantities
Instead of the European 500 ml, you get 473 "mL" which is 16 american fl
They use kilometres for longer distances, but measure shorter ones with inches and feet
Since most household appliances are made for the North American market, where US customers prevail, you operate your oven and thermometers in °F, but use Celsius for weather
It's a weird mix, but using the metric system causes less confusion as it is universal and easily convertible
I consider myself a federalist for sure and I couldn't despise nationalism more
It does not
But nationalism means putting your country's interests above the interests of other countries
Which is a mentality I've never understood
Firstly, I am really not into the whole idea of nation states, because I think that the principles on which they are built hold much water and are overall more harmful than helpful
And secondly, putting your country's interests first, no matter what it means for others, is just overall harmful in the big picture
Besides, I don't believe a federation that consists of bickering nationalists is going to do very well
I mean, we already have enough problems with everyone putting their interests first in the EU now
And most countries are not even ruled by parties one would consider nationalist
The thing is, if you have a partner that is only on your side as long as it benefits them and not beyond that, then they're not going to be a very trustworthy one
If you're gonna have a federation that only holds together until the first major crisis, then it's pointless
The whole point of a federation is to be stronger together
Look at my country, for example
During the refugee crisis, it refused to help at all with taking some of the weight off the border countries like Greece and Italy
And yet, it still seeks money from the EU
It's horrible a shameful
There is always going to be some level of disagreement between countries
But in a federation, ideally, that disagreement should be about which solution benefits everyone the most, not about which solution benefits my country the most
That's exactly the short-sighted pre-WWI mentality that had been devastating the continent for centuries
In other words, you can't cherry pick the best of the federation without giving something in return
Because then everyone's gonna want to leave
If you tell your mom, I'm hungry:
"Are you hungry
Than rub it and call it small
It doesn't make sense, but that's because in Czech "hunger" and "rub" rhyme
Magical word
That sounds pretty universal
And if you don't close door, it's "Do you have a tree in your ass
" (Kind of outdated variant: Do you have a black servant behind you
- Which I'd be interested about the origin since servants here used to be white since there wasn't really so many black people around here and slavery was also (even loooonger ago) the question of different races and ethnicities than black here)
Czechs have the most offensive one
If you don't close door - Do we have a black guy here
It is ment to refer black people being slaves back in a day but 5 y.o. was nowhere neer knowing that
Our teacher used it constantly with the yawning (and it was often, first period and teenagers), so my classmate told her once: Acutally I was, but your shoes would hurt my stomach
She stopped to say that
Another I remember is when toddlers come to the age when they want to do everything on their own, they often shout: *"Já sám!"* which means "(I'll do it) On my own
" but it sounds the same as "*Jásám!"* ("I'm cheering") so the parents respond with: "So cheer then
Tree in your ass
Never heard that one
How do you translate that, "Máš za zadkem strom"?
The one with the black slave is true tho
It's hard for me to write this online, but I have ever only heard this expression when you don't close doors "Do you have blacks/negros at home
" Máš doma černý?
In Czechia, one of two variants (arguably not the one parents use with children) is "Do you have a pole(1) in your ass
(1) 'voj' is not any pole, but a pole that connects a cart with the yoke
Here, it's one of two variants
But we use the word "voj", it's a pole that connects a cart with the yoke of the animal towing the cart
Another one is "Do you have blacks (i.e. black servants) at home
Well there were slaves and "prosperous" slave trade, for example during the era of Přemyslovci
But black people weren't really the average people sold there obviously
"Máš v prdeli stromeček
Also "Máš v prdeli větvičky
"/"Have you got sticks up your arse
It’s regarding weed, the law says that a person can legally carry an amount that’s "smaller than small". No grams defined, nothing, just this
The promotion and incentivizing of class-based hatred is now illegal
You can guess why looking back at our history haha
We also have that no music past 22:00 law, and it's enforced, it's kinda annoying sometimes but understandable

It's not that weird, the EU also has weighted votes,

Perhaps i/y in some names because surnames don't have to nevessarily follow the grammar rules
Usually yes
There are few tricky cases like *z* and *s*; *ě* and *je*; *ú* and *ů*. The worst is *i* and *y*, they sound the same but there are very complex rules which you are allowed to use
Yeah definitely
Most of the times
Well, B-P H-Ch V-F K-G letters can soud the same, depending on letters next to them
Also i changes pronounciation n->ň, d-> ď etc
We are used to it, so we dont see it
The same as you I guess
Trůn and Kam i král/císař musí pěšky (Where even the king/emperor has to go on foot)
Back in the elementary school, we called it "Ministry of relieve"
Trůn (throne in translation)
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech sounds good because of ř, but I personally think there's better one:
Šel pštros s pštrosicí a pštrosáčaty pštrosí ulicí.
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných křepelek přeletělo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
It contains the dreaded "Ř", that most of foreigners have problem pronouncing
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
I would say “tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech” is pretty hard
The main obstacle is the letter ř [r̝̊]
If you’re really brave and would like to try to say it, this could help you: [ˈtr̝̊ɪsta ˈtr̝̊ɪt͡sɛt ˈtr̝̊ɪ ˈstr̝̊iːbr̩niːx ˈstr̝̊iːkat͡ʃɛk ˈstr̝̊iːkalo pr̝̊ɛs ˈtr̝̊ɪsta ˈtr̝̊ɪt͡sɛt ˈtr̝̊ɪ ˈstr̝̊iːbr̩niːx ˈstr̝̊ɛx]
The sentence says that “three hundred thirty three silver hoses squirted over three hundred thirty three silver roofs”
I see you took to the true masters of the craft for your own one hehehe
Yeah, those tongue twisters are cool, but řeřicha is nice example of our language
Maybe better in Slovak (one Slovak aunt taught my mum the soft l and she taught me, so perhaps I can say it :D), but it's not a thing in general Czech
"Vole" in Czech
It's a very, very mild form of cunt (literally "ox") and it's used by most, if not all generations
Some people use it as a filler  word when speaking, but it can be used as a genuine insult
The most iconic is certainly "vole" (=castrated bull)
You can either use it friendly or as an insult
If you use it friendly, I would translate it as "dude"
Then we have:
brácho - bro
bráško - bro (but a bit more emotionally colored or however you wanna say that - it's just more like "little bro" or something)
Kámo - mate
I personally also use
šéfe - boss
We can say that a looot
Most of guys also consider it weird when girls use it among themselves
Can confirm, girl from a class is using it as filler word and I always stop for a sec when I overhear her saying it
We have the same story
I've found out recently that we have the same legend of origins of our countries
Love it and it makes the story more believable
Czechoslovakia, a country in the middle of Europe, with no access to sea, has 100% naval battle winrate
When in 1618 a group of townspeople in Prague decided to show their displeasure with the newly appointed government by simply throwing the governors out of the windows of the city hall into a pile of dung below
This incident led to one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of Europe
After WWI, a bunch of central European countries got independence
Countries like czechoslovakia, poland and hungary
And what is the most sensible thing a newborn country can do
Wage a war against half of neighbors to get some disputed land, without functioning state or organized army
After a quick diplomatic intervention of france and britain we stopped our petty conflict
There should be a statue of that man
Or at least a memorial
Yes, they were really extraordinary men
Their exploits in Russia have single-handedly won us our independance (not kidding)
A* defenestration
There were 3 in total
Uhm, never heard of a pile of hay
The catholic side did actually claim that there was nothing below, just stone pavement, and that it was the intercession of the Mother of God that saved them from death
AFAIK the Czechoslovaks didn't use any military vessel, but they just put some howitzers on a regular ship
Even more badass in my opinion
Are you sure
Wasn't his name Szarik
Everyone knows white is used in flags because it looks good
He was a  Bohemian German
Even though he had a Czechoslovak citizenship until 1934 he was still a German
Just like The Hussites - Always outnumbered, never outgunned
Can you give an example of such a meme
...it is about our president, isn't it
And slavic comes from "slova
" Slavs know words, germans are mutes
Haha
I believe Dachstein should become the capital of all three countries
>You're making this a notorious "Nikola Tesla" hassle
No u. I am not claiming him for a nation of which he very obviously didn't want to be part of
He was born to a German speaking family in a predominantly German area
He voluntarily exchanged Czechoslovak citizenship for German one, voluntarily joined NSDAP and SS and actively aided German war effort
Don't be delusional, he was Sudetengerman as fuck
The fact that he had Czechoslovak citizenship for some time is just a peculiarity of Central European history between the wars
You can call him Bohemian but not Czech
This distinction does not exist in Czech but it does in other languages
Thanks, nice
We also have "How do you say X in Polish
" jokes, for example:
\-"How do you say mother-in-law in Polish
" -"Baba przebyteczna" (from přebytečná = unnecessary/redundant)
chamois = "koza turystyczna"
twins = "parchanti duplowańi"
hedgehog = "kaktus pochodówy"
bra = "śprajc podpierowy kozactva ochablego"
etc
, there are many of those
On one hand it is not in Europe, on the other one, it is in the EU :P
In 1934 Hitler couldn't really force a Czechoslovak citizen to do anything
It was a condition to continue working on KdF-Wagen/Beetle which he accepted
At the time when people like Einstein, Mann or Feuchtwanger were leaving Germany, he went in
He could have easily got a job elsewhere
Him speaking Czech wasn't anything special, many Sudetengermans did, just like many Czechs spoke German
IDK, we should all learn from us and just say fuck it and round up all cents
We still have haleře, they add up normally but when you pay it just gets rounded up or down
Czechia +-10 years ago scrapped destníky, dvacetníky (0,1 and 0,2 CZK coins) Few year ago we cancelled even padesátníky (0,5 CZK coins) All price are rounded up or down in shop when paying with cash
If you pay by card or by bank transfer you pay exact amount like 1234,56 CZK
All prices in shop are using only 1 decimal place
Their existence Is the main reason we don't want euro, we're just lazy
No it isn’t?
We use the same system in Czechia since we got rid of our small coins (under 1 CZK, so a 199
50 total gets rounded up to 200 for cash payments, but 199
40 or less becomes 199)
I would have preferred getting rid of that subdivision entirely, but this seems like the only other logical option, always rounding up would be a little too unpopular
If retailers really want to do that, they can always list their prices in whole crowns instead of that X.90 bullshit
Thanks for the post
Czech scouting is definitely more like the Swiss one, we also have more scout-like organizations, but most of them are somewhat similar in how their activities look thanks to common heritage
The biggest scout organization is Junák founded in 1912, it also attempts to introduce more civic educational activities into its curriculum that promote being a good citizen, but more based on the scout moral code, conscience and sometimes (depends on the troop) faith that opinions of current governments
Some of the other organizations focus more on the "technical" aspects of scouting like camping skills or playing games and helping the kids to socialize with other kids, but still are a viable alternative
I was a member of one such group, but not the "proper" scouting, so maybe someone who was can elaborate further
We have scouts for all boys and girls (Junák)
It has a long history
And it was banned during the socialist era
They are awesome
They plan summer camps for children, educate people about woodcraft and they lead people to live a good life
They also meet up with scouts from other countries
They have this whole hierarchy going from the young children to adults
The higher "ranks" take care of the lower ones
It’s beautiful
I have lots of friends who are scouts
It’s a shame that I never was a scout (even when I really wanted to)
I was a Czech scout 15 years ago and has been in one summer camp
At that camp we would wake up at 7 am and after a swim in a pond there was a morning report and raising of the flag
Occasional punishments were also dealt and then we've had gone after our duties
Theme of the camp was Robinson Crusoe, so many games were inspired by the plot
We were almost self-sustainable in our needs
We built our own shelters, cooked our food and collected firewood and so on
We consisted of two units, the larger one was water-based so we also spent a lot of time practicing rowing
Apart from that we also went for tours around the area where we slept under the open sky, played many games, worked
Also we did hold night watch where you could be tested in your vigilance
Rest of the year we spend our time in our clubhouse at the sort of scouting/free time complex on the edge of the city
Playing games usually, or learning how to tie various knots and other things
Large majority of members were teenagers, especially younger ones
Some of the leaders were in their 20's and I remember one scout who was like 60
In Czech Republic there also [tramps] \- loosely connected to scouting - they were called wild scouts and I've read that they are scout punks
Not organized and adults (kids are children of tramps)
I’m a leader in one of the scout-like organizations here
We’re tied to a small protestant church, so there are some differences from the “proper” scouts
First is we are much much smaller organization, so everything we do in our local club is kinda punk, we have to do everything on our own, there aren’t much programme structures established
Second is not only we try to scout moral code, we try to introduce the God and stories from the bible too
About 2/3 of the kids come from the church, the rest are usually their parent’s friend’s kids
Like 90% of the things we do are the same as normal scouts would do and that is pretty much the same the Swiss scouts do
We have some larger events going on too, there are multiple weekend events, summer camps and even international Camporee
Some things I noticed about regular scouts here is they have lots of (although sometimes dated) infrastructure - bases in almost every town, many capmsites and so on
They often use them when club from one town wants to visit another town
Water scouts are quite popular here too, they do a lot of canoying and river tourism, which is very popular vacation in Czechia
Czech scout here
Have you attended the 2019 Intercamp in De Steeg
Scouting organizations used to be divided by political and religious lines in 1920s and 1930s, but currently they differ more by kind of activities
For example woodcrafters are inspired by E. T. Seton and American Indians, Pioneers used to be the main communist organization until 1989, but are politically neutral and sort of generic scout-like camping organization now and there is also a small organization of scouts more in line with original British Baden-Powell's scouting
The club I was member of was founded by former scouts in 1970s when scouting was banned, but we did not rejoin it after 1989 because we developed our own traditions meanwhile
There is an archaeological site if Mušov, a Roman fort from Marcomanic wars, in Southern Moravia
It was already beyond the Limes
Several other Roman military camps were found (for example Olomouc-Neředín) or are suspected, but there was no permanent Roman presence
There are few of them, usually rotundas (e.g. Old Pilsen or St
George on Říp), which are well preserved, but castles and fortresses were mostly rebuilt, but you can still recognise some parts
No, there was almost nothing here during roman empire era, some Germanic tribes etc
nothing was left if something was build, there were some roman military camps and that's pretty much all
(plus some rumors says romans created wineyards at south Moravia but this was debunked both by historians and wine experts)
Song about tracksuits
It's funny and catchy

Basshunter what a legend, havent listened to him in ages let me go rectify that
Definitely ice hockey , its something what can put people together
Cold beer is better with group of people in pub, than alone from bottle or can, but even that is better than warm one from plastic bottle
I was at a café in Vienna and talked to the waitress in English
After a while of chatting we then found out she is Slovak, so we switched to our native languages, it was a funny little encounter
With my friends when we were drunk
Also, we had heated argument in Italian
None of us speak Italian
Almost always on the internet
once at Chicago airport
irl never, the accent is just a too obvious hint
in online games it usually depends on these factors:
*they have CZ or CZE in their username
*they cant speak english very well
*they speak czech with a heavy prague accent and slang
*they are 7-11 years old
No, they usually give it to someone who is home or take it back because nobody was there (only for example my parents living in small village and personally knowing the postwoman let her to leave smaller packages on our terrace - it was never stolen and you don't really see there from the road anyway)
The bigger problem here is the delivery itself, it's pretty common they don't even try to deliver it, leave notice you weren't home although you did wait specifically for the package and you have to go to the post office (meaning official post service, private comapnies usually call you before the delivery and you can arrange what to do)
No, this could not really happen where I live because they never ever left a package on the street
It was also reddit who taught me you could hate UPS/DHL/insert your least favourite courier not just because being late but also for damaging the package or leave it in a way someone could steal it
How can anyone support anything free
I would rather expect celebrations
It was proven times and again, that there is strong correlation between school successes and the food
Poor schoolchildren perform better when provided with free meals in school
Free food in schools is a relatively cheap investment with huge returns in form of better population
> I would rather expect celebrations
I am not surprised
Many Czech redditors are kinder-libertarians
Thank you
I don't even remember ever drinking milk so it was surprising for me to give everyone such unusual product
Hannover, there was just nothing to do
Afwully underwhelming when compared to other German cities
Also in the city centre there were more homeless beggars on 20 meters than I've ever seen in my life
Ever seen Pilsen on winter morning
Brno
It's just shit
If it wasn't specified with European, I would have quite a list, now I have to think, but I can't really think of any city without something to offer
Not even a letter
*páni - men* (alternatively can be used to express surprise, kinda like "wow")
*paní - woman/women*
First that came to my mind was smrt=death and zmrd=dickhead, it might not seem that close to you, unless you know that S and Z are pronounced almost the same in Czech
Politici BYLI demonstranty
- The politicians WERE protesters
Politici BILI demonstranty
- The politicians BEAT protesters
Byli and bili are pronounced the same way
Láska = love in Czech :) gotta love these false friends between our languages
This is funny to me that "Láska" means love in Czech
Just want to say that the line above vowel isn't accent like in others languages but it means that vowel should be pronounced longer
Maláka malákia malaká malakía.
But you changed two letters
>Politici BYLI demonstranty
demonstranti, not demostranty
Very easy actually, it's more like a different dialect rather than different language when it comes to difficulty
Czechs and Slovaks can usually hold a conversation while each speaking their own language
You can even use Slovak as official language in your government related communication
I also have Slovak teachers for some of my classes even though I technically study in Czech language only
> copíi = children, but cópii = copies
that's not a homonym, they're pronounced differently
These are just homographs (like read [ri:d] and read [re:d])
> masă = "mass" (in kilograms), but also "table"
> sare = "salt", but also "he/she jumps"
Neither are these
Since these word are spelled the same they are just words with different meanings (like English means both "referring to the English language" and "referring to England")
Homophones would be words that are spelled differently but pronounced the same, like kernel and colonel or martial and marshal

beer weed methamphetamine
I'd say beer lol
Train tickets, Brno-Prague (~200km) starts at 4€ for adults (low cost, most seats will be for 6-10€), plus there is 75% discount for students and pensioners
I don't know about food in general, but your beans (e.g. Heinz baked beans) are insanely cheap
It's like 3 times cheaper than here
Apparently because you eat twice as much of them as the rest of Europe combined or something like that
That's insane
I was thinking it was maybe 3-4 times more than the rest of Europe, but I didn't want to over-shoot it
But even in my wildest dreams, I wouldn't have thought it would be 10+ times as much
How often do you eat baked beans
A spoon full with every cup of tea
Since it hit our house directly and burned out our electricity and lot of appliances and about 2 or 3 years later another house and went into ours again so it damaged the electric net again (it was really "fun" to watch lightnings going from the outlet), not really
And my great grandma hated it and was terrified since it destroyed the fence and made crater as hell in the garden decades ago
They are scary but cool
I like them, because I live in a dry region of Czech Republic (South Moravia) and we don't get a lot of rain or water here, in summer most of our streams go dry and our crops die because of the dry summers
I am happy for every bit of rain
Computer- Počítač which means counter (as in one who counts)
Damn those Swedish words sounds similar to exact English translations
In Czech is Rhino- "Nosorožec" so same as in Dutch -> Nose horn
Medvídek mýval - -> little washer bear as well
moment - okamžik - blink of an eye
a lot of people mentioned sloth in their languages
In czech it’s lenochod, the lazywalker or slothwalker
ignite - podpálit - underburn
Junky - smažka - fried person
whale - velryba- bigfish
reptile - plaz- crawler
Many words sound strange, if you try to take them literally

Ve této situaci moc ne
Literally translated it does
Ahoj, jmenuju se John, rád tě poznávám. Odkud jsi ?
Hello, I named John, like to you knowing
From where you ?
Gosh it is hard, when we have ,,words reffering to people" build in pronouns
Ahoj, mé jméno je John
Je potěšení tě poznat
Odkud jsi
Hi, my name is John
Is pleasure you meet
From-where you
The second sentence is like "(it) is pleasure (to) meet you"
I'd say
Hello, naming myself John, gladly you familiarize/acquaint
Where-from are
Full grammatical analysis:
* Ahoj: hello
* jmenuju: 1st person singular "to name, to appoint"
* se: reflexive pronoun
The verb thus takes the meaning "I name myself". As Czech is pro-drop, there's no pronoun "I" in the sentence
* John
* rád: adverb "gladly"
* tě: 2nd person singular informal "you" in accusative case, you-single-informal being an object
* poznávám: 1st person singular imperfective "to familiarize, to get acquainted with". Once again pro-drop reports in
* odkud: "where from". Czech has separate adverbs for "where", "where to", "where from"
* jsi: 2nd person singular "to be". Pro-drop all the way down
This is one hell of a good analysis
Your supply of words is much more suited for this than mine
Local human population counts more than 10 million
I'll just mention wild animals, 'cause dogs and cows and people probably are the most dangerous of all
Individually, probably the odd bear that wanders in from Slovakia, but I don't think there have been any deaths or injuries from bear attacks for decades
I'd guess bees could be among the most dangerous at about 4 deaths annually (within a 10 mio population)
Tick-borne diseases kill about 6 a year
There are vipers but they have not killed anyone in decades, they have a comparatively mild venom
Curiously, one guy was killed by a crocodile in 2010, but that was probably a pet, since we don't have any wild ones
Or I hope that's still the case :) No detailed info about this is available AFAIK
Swans are pretty scary, TBH
Otherwise yeah, I think people saying that ticks, bees and dogs are all more dangerous than the very few wild carnivores we have are spot on
And humans are the most dangerous of all, killing millions of animals and causing all this pollution and stuff
If you mean which animal does the most damage statistically, then ticks (encephalitis, Lyme disease) and bees and wasps (allergies, anaphylactic shocks)
If you mean "theoretically, if you are going to meet this animal in a ring", then probably wolves are
Humans, especially neonazi brainlets protesting face masks and government restrictions
Hornets, vipers, there are few bears in the mountains, but that's about it
I wanted to write "homo sapiens"  ut you were faster xD
We have had both species spontaneously reappearing in recent decades
Lynxes are extremely cautious and do no damage (unless you count a chicken there or a small deer elsewhere)
Wolves also do not attack humans, but are a bit more problematic because shepherds have to change their ways to protect sheep
And they are not used to it as wolves were basically extinct here for a century or more
Lol, Czechs think alike
I have a story from my grandfather
It happened during his mandatory service in czechoslovak army in 1968
He was in infantry, and he got assigned in night shift to guard gate to military base
It was a boring thing to do, until the middle of the night, when out of nowhere, few soviet tanks with white stripe arrived
They demanded his assault rifle and entry to the base
He refused at first, he tried to contact his commander, but as one soldier with rifle against tanks he had no chance but to surrender to them
He was kept captive in his guard booth until morning, and the whole time he had no idea what is going on
In morning, he was reunited with his disarmed unit, and told Czechoslovakia is receiving a “Brotherly help from soviets and other allied socialist countries to prevent coup”.
It was the night when soviet union and his vassals in warsaw pact occupied czechoslovakia for its reforms
Would you guys stop, lol
We already have it bad enough with the Danes that come to raid our capital every year
Apparently they don't come to take any land, though, they only want the beer and to fuck some shit up
Yeah, I feel like it's a conspiracy
Our  cheap bars are constantly under attack from all sides
Even Americans seem to be in on it
It's not that complicated
In a parliamentary republic (which is what most European republics are, as opposed to your presidential republic), the president is pretty much a ceremonial role
They're formally in charge of the army, sign laws after the parliament approves them, and some other stuff, but they can rarely actually do anything against the will of the parliament or the government and their main role is shaking hands with other heads of state and holding speeches on national holidays
The Prime Minister is the one with executive power, who chooses the ministers for their cabinet and actually governs the country
A Chancellor is basically the German term for PM, AFAIK
As for why the roles are divided like that, I think the main idea is that the president should be someone less controversial, who isn't an active member of a particular political party and gives the people a sense of unity and wisdom (at least in theory)
Whereas the prime minister is just the victor of elections, so they'll be a decisive, polarising figure that can get replaced much more frequently
That's why there's a higher age requirement for presidency (40 here in CZ) and their terms may be longer
Yeah
It's not working great for us since the introduction of direct presidential elections
Exactly the reason why that idea was criticized, it doesn't make sense in a parliamentary system
The Parliament and the Senate together
There were always behind-the-scenes plots and arguments about whether their vote should be secret or not, but eh, in retrospect it doesn't seem so bad
No, that would be super weird here
I didn't even know there's a Europe day tbh
People do fly Czech and American ones a lot on the 8th though
Excluding government offices
Nowhere
There were a lot of US flags on 8th of May though
We celebrate only the 8th of May as a Day of victory
Well liberation day is celebrated on this particular day
Definitely Pelíšky
btw, since you're Polish, let me compliment your nation's cinematography on movie Sexmisja
It's a masterpiece
[Jara Cimrman, Ležící Spící]
It’s ony Netflix btw
I really enjoyed:
Taxidermia (2006)
Son of Saul (2015)
Dealer (2004)
What about RRRrrrr
I am curious about hungary-romanian film *Dolina* (2007)
Movie is based on Adam Bodór novel *Az érsek látogatása
* I really enjoyed the reading and story of the book, the movie is still a mystery for me because it's unavailable on the net
This is good movie aswell:  **Lust och fägring stor**
"I just wonder, where did the comrades from GDR make mistake
Kdy byste dostali 2 naprosto stejné krabičky, jednu z NDR a jednu z USA, kterou byste si vybraly
I dunno 'bout this raiding thing
That is so 9th century
Let's defenestrate someone instead, that never gets old
Underrated comment
Don't worry, the budget may be a little constricted, but our boys will be home by Christmas
Slovak president Zuzana Caputova to replace our president [Milos Zeman
] Please bratia, send her here and take this spiteful old man
>I'd choose Zuzana Čaputová
As head of state
Definitely
She is professional, dignified and charming etc
But as head of goverment
I am not sure
She is a bit too liberal for me
I would go for Micheál Martin instead
Even ceremonial president can be very dangerous
It used to be mostly ceremonial position here, but current president proved that constitution can be bent, and that he can cause a lot of damage
For example:
He is the one that officially names the generals or professors into office
But constitution just states president do it, and he argues that there is no time limit and that there isn’t written he has to do it
He is blocking naming of secret service general, who often warns of Russian activities (president is Sino-Russian asslicker)
He decides who can try to build government coalition after elections - he already chosen his own minions’ government without parliament support once, and he let them rule for too long
He did it again after elections, he appointed winner of it as sole ruler without consent of parliament
This decision was meant to be formality based on agreement in parliament
He covers up for his band of criminals in presidents office
His chancellor failed to get security check from secret service, that is needed for his office
But the president keeps him there
The chancellor is shady guy, who is well known from his EU funds fraud, bribery and other
So DONT ELECT DANGEROUS PEOPLE even into ceremonial functions
It doesn't have to necessarily be someone I agree with politically
I just want someone who can walk and isn't an old drunk
Please help :(
>Well, the tile says head of government or president
You are right, I misread the title
Sorry about that
This "naming" was always considered some kind of ceremony: professors and generals receive their title from the hands of the president
Previous presidents never said "no, I am not going to do so".
Mind you, it is not the only thing the current president did
For example, the law says the president names prime minister, and prime minister asks the parliament for the confidence vote
But it doesn't say *whom* the president names, nor how quickly does he, nor how quickly the prime minister has to call for the confidence vote
So after the parliament rejected his *protégé*, he simply nominated him once again and made it known he will nominate him again and again, not giving the chance to anyone else
After the fall of Nečas cabinet in 2014, he directly named his guy a prime minister, a guy not even a member of parliament
The law says that the president names his chancellery, and that the chancellor should have security clearance
Zeman has named a person without security clearance
Why
Because the law doesn't include any provisions how to unname a chancellor
What can you do
President also spread lies and refuses to apologize
The law says that the president can only be prosecuted for the great treason, so defamation is ok
Basically, our law is based on the idea that the president won't break the law, or how he personally calls it, "creatively interpret the law".
Definitely the variety of swear words
You can mix any two existing swear words together and it sounds awesome
Icelandic is not Old Norse, you can find youtube videos with parallel fragments from sagas, there are both phonetic and grammatical changes
Disclaimer: I don't speak either
I read an interesting article on this a couple of days ago
Perhaps someone here could elaborate, because I don't know enough to judge, if it's completely true, but in the article it said that in the Nordic countries it's kind of a faux pas to stand out
Specifically, it was talking about Sweden's covid strategy and how it still had a lot of support despite the fact that it wasn't working
Allegedly, a lot of scientists (Swedish ones, as well as ones only residing in Sweden) demanded a change to it, but instead of their ideas being considered and there being some kind of national debate on the topic, they were told to shut up and in some cases the backlash was so strong, that they decided to leave the country
It could be exaggerated or flat out untrue, so I've been meaning to ask, if anyone from a Nordic country has anything to say about it
> Even the poorest and the workers are heavily taxed, despite our  'progressive' tax system
In the last 20 or so odd years, liberal and  social democratic governments alike, the tax-burden has been lightened  for the richest, and spread to the broader population,  dis-proportionally affecting those already weakest in society
Definitely agree with the taxation
I was really demoralised during my gap-year about this
It seriously disincenivises low-skilled workers from taking part in the economy
Very common
It is used in the same way as in English
“Well the world after first world war kinda went downhill
“What do you mean ‘first world war’?”
He will probably wonder what happened to Czechoslovakia, the state he currently loves, and I will try to explain to him why it was doomed to fail from the beginning and that Czechoslovak nation was bullshit idea only Czechs believed in
Also he might wonder where are his German and Jewish neighbors, story how germans killed the jews and czechs expelled them, won't be pleasant to tell
Given the Czech-German relationship status and high levels of nationalism in 1919 I wouldn't be surprised if he was happy about it
Well, the whole Czechoslovakia didn't really work out in the end and about 50 or 60 of those 100 years were kinda shit
But it's not so bad now
We lost the republic to german nazis for 7 years of absolute terror because our allies france and britain betrayed us
After the war we were betrayed by the US and the communists took over for 41 years of terror
But same as with the monarchy, we prevailed and became free once again, this time we set a new record and are still a democratic republic after 30 years, that's 10 more years than between 18-38
Also the commie hungarians and nationalistic poles got their heads kicked in but we didn't manage to get all the territory we wanted to 'reclaim'.
What happened
A lot awful stuff
*explains WW2, the Soviet bloc and then rise to the independence from it which we're celebrating this year*
... And yeah, few years after that, Czechoslovakia was no more
"Yeah, we're independent now, 3rd time's the charm right
It’s wasn’t common name tho
Thats thin ice for Germans
Accomplishments of Wermacht idk about that
But German patriotism for times before wars should be supported
For avhievements in various fields
I'd say when we look at European history as a whole, it's generally the Balkans region that gets shafted the most
Yeah, people sometimes remember it exists past the 19th century
But there's one period that doesn't get much attention, unlike other long periods of warfare (Dutch war of independence, Thirty-years-war etc
The Austro-Turkish wars, or Ottoman wars in Europe
Over two hundred years of drawn out warfare with little conclusion - and it only draws attention once you scream "winged hussars in Vienna".
And there's so much historical significance there - subjucation of multiple nations by the Turks, the attempts to dislodge them (ranging from almost-successful to holy-hell-how-did-you-survive-this), the slow struggle of the Austrians trying to recapture Hungary fortress by fortress, the legend of Eugene of Savoy and the Great Turkish War - you know what I'm shutting up, go google
You know what's even sadder
I don't remember a single thing about PLC being taught at school except for the Jagellons, who ruled our lands for a short period of time
It was mostly about our history, HRE, Habsburgs and modern age
Possibly [Pankrác?] Sadly Prague is the only city where anything like what you mentioned could be built, but each time someone wants to build a skyscraper they have to fight dozens of "landmark protectors" because It WoUlD rUiN pAnOrAmA oF pRaGuE
For example we could've had [this] (which looks extremely dope in my opinion, also it's quite unique) but everyone went nuts so we don't have anything
Oh well
Step: 1 Take the biggest current Prague number
Step: 2 google it
Step: 3 do the images look like a bunch of field with fuck all
if yes go to step 1 and subtract a number if not you have your answer
Meanwhile Žižkov tower has been built and people just got used to it
In czechia it’s probably Aš. It’s also the westernmost settlement in country
We have a town called Aš. It is the shortest name in the Czech Republic, I think
We also have Eš (between Tábor and Pelhřimov)
And Aš is the westernmost town, there are villages further west
Not a native speaker, but still:
Opened all of them, all are fine but Italian and Galician one
Italian was about some astrophysics, so it might be the issue
Galician surprisingly was harder than Portuguese, maybe because the portuguese one was about one Abba song, while Galician one was about some of Berliose's work
Re-clicked, got Israel, first paragraph is clear
Here and there some words are guesswork, but overall the number of unknown words is small
The grammar is real pain in the ass, complex sentences are hard to understand
He's translated as Pytlík (little bag) here and I think nobody complains
Some of the names in Harry Potter are translated too, but mostly in a really clever way that is helpful for younger readers and keeps with the meaning
But for example the really incompetent translator of Song of Ice and Fire made terrible job, because she not only screwed the translation as a whole, but chose terrible name translations (some of them), in the middle of the whole saga suddenly translated almost all of them, even though she first used mostly not translated and then, after a book or two, said sorry, I take it back, here we continue with not translated
How stupid do you have to be to do something like this
Here, Harry Potter translations are mostly praised for being very throughout and creative and yet undisruptive, memorable, and overally good
One example, the name Dumbledore comes from an archaic word for a bumblebee
In the translation, it's *Brumbál* which comes from an archaic Czech word for a bumblebee as well, yet it sounds as a bit quirk but still naturally sounding surname
However, this prompted many translators of different books to attempt to do the same and failing miserably
The worst example is likely A Song of the Ice and Fire when the translator decided in the middle of the series (A Feast for the Crows) that since the Medek brothers, the HP translators, were so successful with translating surnames of characters, she could do the same and decided to change a name of any house that had a slightly meaningful name, House Redwyne became *Rudovíni*, House Merryweather became *Dobrovětrovští* etc
What's worse is that she often didn't do any research about the origins of the name and simply translated her first impression of what she thought it meant and wasn't even consistent with it
For example, House Harlaw sounded like "Hard Law" to her so she translated it as *Drsnozákonští* but occassionally as *Drsnořádi* as well
Because of a very negative feedback, she returned to original English names in A Dance with Dragons so AFFC remained only as a bad memento
Baggins is "Pytlík" in Czech
It means "small bag" but also can mean "ballsack".
How come I have untranslated names in my books
Those still being published by Talpress, not the new translations
Is this where the name from Legolas and Laura comes from
In ASOIAF she just
didn't understand at all how Czech works it seems
Literal translations, phrases that didn't make any sense (for example if someone was described as "bear of man", she made him "medvěd muže" WTF
), terribly put sentences and the worst sin, for example lady Stokeworth in first two books, lady Stokořínská in another
and then after expectable backlash, lady Stokeworth once again - and every other name that means something ended up this way (except the main houses and names like Tarly etc that doesn't directly mean anything)
Especialy Ironborn were an absolute mess because of this
But I don't think it was hard for Medek to come up with Bradavice
Like
Hogwarts is literally switched warthog, there are hogs on the gate, so
I have found the Czech translations in Harry Potter extremely charming
Things have a more magical feel and feel way-less nerdy when translators make the effort to work the weird English terms into the other language
I think that the series struck a perfect balance between translated and non-translated terms
Even names like Lenka Láskorádová work really well
Talpress apparently published [two editions] the first in 2006 and the second in 2012
Maybe you've got the one from 2012 and they already changed it there
U těch bastardích jmen mi to zrovna moc nevadí, tam je podle mě důležitý si při čtení připomínat, že jim prostě říkají jinak a podle něčeho, čeho je v tom kraji příliš, aby se líp vnímalo to stigma kolem
Když čteš Rivers nebo Hill, tak ti to prostě přijde jako obyčejný anglický příjmení a neřešíš.
I'm gonna
pretend it doesn't exist
I bought English version, so
oooh Hera
Most likely
It's absolutely terrible and yes I feel it like a huge loss for all of us
So, as of now, I'm becoming acquainted with it via reddit
I was little surprised that reddit won the race with other media in this case (that someone didn't told me earlier for example)
And what concerns the event itself, I'm ... unmoved
Eh, not trying to sound like a douche, but they'll repair it, even if it takes a couple of years
I don't see a reason to get upset about one cathedral getting partially destroyed, Germany got hundreds of similar buildings bombed into the shadow realm and they built them back
It's a shame, but nothing catastrophic
I mean it sucks, as would any large fire, but I don't really … care
I guess it's just me but if you asked me yesterday to name 5 points of interest in Paris Notre-Dame would not be one of them
When I saw the news last night, I couldn't believe it at first
I've been to the cathedral twice already and I definitely thought I would see it again one day
My second visit was two years ago, so I still remember the peaceful atmosphere inside
It was hard to imagine that should be lost forever
Luckily the cathedral did not burn to the ground so I believe it will be restored, even though it might take a decade or two to do so
For me and my wife it's like 9-11, it symbolizes an end of an era and I'm sure it will be used in history books as such
Such a terrible loss
That kind of sucks, but it's nothing I won't see in my lifetime
Up until then, photos and a thousand of different cathedrals in Europe will suffice I believe
As long as it gets restored eventually, I won't mind, even if the current events might incite some bad emotions in me
Nope
Most Germans just come off as condescending and slightly arrogant but it's not by a lot and it's well within norms
So you're quite normal
Dutch are the actual ones who are very aggressive and arrogant
There's a massive difference there
I appear to myself more confident when speaking English And I am Czech native speaker
The capital city itself or its people
I myself don't hate Prague the city, it is too big for my taste, but parts of it are quite lovely
I don't hate the people there either, we just like making fun of them for their accent and sometimes uppity attitude, but it's not hatred by any means
Not on my part anyway
the same in Prague, one of the reasons why it is disliked is that the average wage in Prague is 30% higher than in the country
I feel like Bratislava is mostly ok with the rest of slovakia
What do you mean by “accent”? :D We are those without any xd
I mean the wage might be a factor, but in my experience it's mostly the annoying accent and the general feeling of superiority
Hell no
You have one, instead of normal speech you are "singing".
I mean atrocities such as *vepřejď* instead of *vpředu
* Hearing it for the first time sent shivers down my spine
>vepřejď
Hele čoveče, nemáš žvejku
Do they really say that
To my Southwestern Bohemian ears, it sounds like a Northeastern Bohemian word
how can you spot diference between bohemian accent
I am originaly from Liberec and now i am living in prague and the accent is same
yeah it means exactly what you write :)
The tendency of using the final -j (or in this case the penultimate -j-) sounds like that to me, it looks and sounds similar to e.g. _k dědoj_. The closest we have is -ojc as in Novákojc, but this suffix with j is an exception
The 2013 [Nagyová case] A managing director in the prime minister Nečas' cabinet (later revealed to be his lover, and is his current wife) was found to have abused her position for unauthorized use of intelligence services to spy on the prime minister's wife (now ex-wife)
Prime minister later resigned, still defends his (current) wife
Edit: fixed position in the cabinet
ever collapsed
hehe
1997,2004,2005,2009,2013  just pick one
Well, in 1989 there was Velvet Revolution, but after that, one falls every now and then, like when mistress of our former prime minister (Petr Nečas) was using millitary intelligence to spy on his wife and few others
She was in the cabinet
I thought she was something like PM’s personal assistant/secretary
I actually meant that she was a highly positioned employee *of* the Cabinet ("Managing Director of the Section of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic's Cabinet" to be precise), not  a *member* of the cabinet (Minister)
My bad
They're Germans
They'll plan their infrastructure even as an asteroid is falling on the planet
English is kind of taken for granted these days, but not at a very good level (above B1 or so) until you prove it
I know a few people in their 30s who haven't retained much of any language from school, and they definitely see it as a loss they're trying to fix now
Mostly because of job requirements, but also because they know they're missing out on most of the internet, videogames, shows etc
Daily life in our country is mostly very monolingual, though
I feel like it is given that Czech is almost exclusively spoken in Czech
Yeah
A Scottish friend of mine said that Scandinavians can pretty much be considered native speakers, a lot of the time
The quality of English teachers is dogshit
I think at least you need to reach B1 to leave high school, but honestly I think lot of people barely reach that and even those who do usually never use it and quickly forget it
Half of my class in good grammar school was only B1
Smart people, but the teachers were just awful
English lessons are daily occurrence in many companies, but in my experience lot of people struggle, but make very slow progress
Lot of people still don't take it very seriously
That's my experience as well
Whenever I tried speaking French to French people in France, they would answer in English
My French is definitely not great, but I'd like to think it's not *that* bad
Yeah, it's pretty bad
High school should end at B2 in my opinion, but I don't know if we'll ever get there
My English teacher in high school was extremely old fashioned and boring, and the only thing that saved me was already being at B2 by then after I'd taken some adult courses outside of school (and you shouldn't HAVE TO pay to supplement basic education like that)
Otherwise I would've probably starting hating the entire language
My maturita was in the only year when you could choose "higher level" language exams (B2), and of course that didn't stick either because nobody else wanted them
Unless I'm told to bring something from the fridge or I'm expected to make my meals from what they have (I'm there for longer, I'm close family), I wouldn't do it, yes, I'd think it's very rude
I would say that even looking under the lid is rude
I do both as a joke when visiting good friends, but wouldn’t do that any other time
It would be ride to get some food or other stuff
But if you are drinking beer guests are free to get a new one how they wish
I really like what austrian Houses look like
You can always say excatly when you crossed the border because of them
Czech houses are usually Made out of concrete, but the ones in Austria are mostly wooden
They just look really nice :D
Uhh
I dunno, There's nothing special about them that I like or I know I guess
Halušky thanks, Slovakia
Hands down the best thing about Croatia is the people
And they have some of the best wine and sights
The biggest difference once you cross austrian borders are the roads
I’d say Andrej Babis, our prime minister
He’s originally Slovak so would be great if they just took him back haha
He wouldn’t have to go far
No one
I don't believe that a single person makes a difference, if you kick out some moron in politics, the morons voting him will find someone else in the same vein
Only total and systematic attention to politics and engagement will help
[Andrej Babiš]
He disgraces Czechia in the EU
He has a conflict of interest
He influences public opinion through his media
During communist Czechoslovakia, he belonged to the criminal police "ŠtB". His government relies on the support of the Communist Party
He is scrapping the state budget and state reserves, maybe for him I will never receive a pension from Czechia, because he needs money for his populist gestures for stupid uneducated people
When we received support from China during the coronavirus epidemic, he was waiting for it at the airport, and I'm surprised he didn't kiss those fucking boxes
When we received coronavirus support from Taiwan, he didn't even thank them
He steals opposition proposals, rejects them and then proposes them himself
([not just] On November 16, 2019, 300000 people [demonstrated] for his resignation, and he still did not resign
Make Andrej Babiš Slovak again
I came here just to write his name as well
I will trade you one Donald Trump for one Babiš.
Or Okamura
There is much more
For example, the abduction of his own son to the Crimea or making life uncomfortable for small business owners
But that would be material for a book
I was thinking most people would write Zeman, but he's going to dissolve by himself
He can be friend with Orban
I had flights to northern Italy, and I got my full refund PLUS 75€ from collibra
Thanks Babiš!
How very generous of you
But no, you keep them
We’re good with just ours
Can’t believe I’m actually saying this but
I’d take Babiš over Trump anyday
For sure
The list could go on
But if it comes to choosing just one person
Babis has the most power out of the bunch
Imo he’s just a successfull entrepreneur, making money of the political system here
Seems kinda harmless, people supporting his party tho
Oh no, what would Vladimir/ Donald/XiXi do without visiting our lovely dumpster-fire
Piers is OK guy
Sure, you don't have to agree with him but compare him with Hopkins or Farage
Andrej Babiš invites Slovaks to Czechia
Please invite Andrej Babiš to Slovakia (not just in court in Bratislava)
I look forward to it
Right
All of my Czech friends were talking about all the terrible things about Babiš, And in my head I was thinking, "I wish he was my president
" haha
But still, he sucks
He is a snake oils salesmen
He managed to carve himself a nice little corner in the Czech political spectrum where he woos gullible idiots into voting for him using fearmongering populist bullshit and he profits off of it
I genuinly believe he doesn't give a fuck about politics or EU or muslims or his voters, he is in it for himself only
So I guess good on him but yeah his voter base is insane
Mmmm, kobliha
Yeah Babis is bad for this country
No doubt
But you’re right that every time I start getting too
frustrated about our politics I just remember Trump and US and I suddenly feel much better about my tiny little country
I regret coming back to the states in May
But, I always come back to CZ
You can give your child any existing name, either Czech or foreign
If the name is very uncommon, you may need to prove that it's actually a real existing name and get an expert report that states that
You can't give your child a name that's a diminutive/nickname derived from a name, it has to be in the "default" version
A girl can't have a boys' name, a boy can't have a girls' name
There are some gender neutral names but there's not many of them
A child also can't have the same name as their living sibling (if the kids share both of the parents)
It's only allowed to give a child up to two first names
You can't use a last name as a first name
You also can't use names for objects or just random words in general, this includes words in foreign languages unless they're being used as names for people somewhere
> You can't use the name of a living parent or sibling
Gaius Julius Caesar after reading this: *Mē pudet, fīlī*
> You can give your child any existing name, either Czech or foreign
If the name is very uncommon, you may need to prove that it's actually a real existing name and get an expert report that states that
This is actually very tricky formulation

§62 says "Vital record accepts any existing name in its correct form". It is solely their decision whether the name is "existing" and "is in correct form", any digression from their opinion does cause long legal battle
In reality, it's virtually impossible to give Czech baby a non-Czech name; foreigners are less affected by this tho
Because most people believe that it should be up to them to decide what their name will be
Národní museum (national museum) in Prague is the best and the biggest, but I really love Prácheňské museum in city Písek (Sand)
I really like National technology museum in Prague
My parents are both monolingual so there was no way they could do this
And even if they did remember some Russian from school, I doubt that they would do that
Not me but I know a kid and one his parents is Spanish and the other one is Czech and his parents use German when they talk to each other
He himself doesn’t speak German but he spokes both Czech and Spanish and his parents only speak their language and German
No, parents in my country take it as a competition who will scar the child psychologically the most
It does greatly
People will generally treat you 1000x better if you try to speak the local language and they will try to be pretty helpful
Even if you can only speak few words, go for it
Even if it sounds bad, we'll like it
It's the effort that counts
I think it's awesome but probably slower than just speaking English
I don’t really feel that way, if you aren’t Slav, there is no way you will pronounce our words right (as a tourist) and I think it’s much faster to just speak English, just say:”I’m sorry I don’t speak your language, do you speak English
” And everyone from the younger generation have to speak English, it doesn’t have to be B2 English, but if you graduate from high school, you should on B1 level, which is alright
I once saw a sign in polish saying „Czechów nie obsɫugujemy, p.s Krecik to cwel
I'm not sure why I'm mentioning it, but I understood it and found it funny

Zajebiscie, kurwa
I have to say I've never ever experienced any bad reaction from Spaniards, even when my Spanish was very basic
Ironically, the only time I had bad reaction to my Spanish was in Barcelona, where an old fellow demanded me to speak Catalan
Prague is a different beast, everyone is used to foreigners
Better trying it in some random village
Not sure about your redbull vodka, there's really not much to translate
We pronounce it almost exactly the same way as in English
But you are right, sometimes we have a syllable with no vowel, but r or l instead
That's true for the younger generation, I don't mind either, but older people appreciate it a lot
Similar with people who don't understand English in general
Very Spanish and much Spanish
> Damn, just realised what a douche I am
You are not
French, for example, react badly if they don't hear "Bonjour". You don't have to adjust to every local idiosyncrasy in every country
I went to Italy quite a few times and it always surprised me, that many of the people I spoke to had better german than english
Maybe try german next time
That’s maybe the best thing to do, or just say “dobrý den” “good day” at the start of the conversation or maybe the best would be “dobrý den, promiňte” and add the “sorry” at the end, because it typical for Czechs to say sorry at the start of the conversation when talking to a stranger
I don't think we dislike you, we just sometimes like to make fun of your language (But that goes both ways I believe)
It seems to be true at least where I live though, that out of all our neighbours, we hang out with you the least
But I don't think we would dislike you
Slovakia are obviously our homies, Austria is the country to which I feel most culturally connected and Germany is the "big responsible brother".
Oh, I know
This was one single case, usually no one bats an eye
I like the attitude, no one was pissed off because of my mistakes, no one was pissed off because I speak Spanish while my English is better
It really encouraged me
> Los españoles son muy españoles y mucho españoles

Everyone here is really poetic and I just came to say beer
I was born in Ukraine
The smell of dill always brings back my childhood memories
You can smell it in every kitchen and on every outdoor market
My grandma was putting it in canned food and she used to grow it on her garden also
We had so much dill plants there
Probably the smell of knedlo-vepřo-zelo, a czech meal
Lots of high quality booze, goose and sweaty socks
And also a hint of smog (looking at you, industrial cities)
Well I'd say that contemporary Paris has a different, slightly less appealing smell
>Maybe no smell at all is it most significant trait, just fresh mountain air
Why, juniper of course
That's lovely :) Just don't tell any Czechs you like trdelnik, they will try to smite you :D
It's actually Hungarian or Romanian and kind of a tourist trap, because they're popping up everywhere tourists are, claiming to be genuine Czech baked goods
I personally don't care, I like the smell and anything baked with cinnamon is top shit in my opinion, but a lot of people in Prague fucking hate trdelnik
That was exactly what I was getting at hahah
Why not
We allow tabaco and alcohol which are way worse
I'm cautiously pro-legalization
I understand keeping it illegal doesn't really help anyone (except the black market)
However, if we move to legalize it, it should be done in a way that doesn't normalize it
At the end of the day it's a drug and should be treated as such
Obviously, I have no issue with its medical use
I understand I'm in a minority, but I find the quite literal obsession with cannabis that some people have unhealthy and quite honestly pathetic (for the record, same goes for all drugs)
Yeah, I would legalize it but penalize driving high as a kite
It definitely should
It's so hypocritical when alcohol and tobacco are legal and very much socially acceptable, and still so many people (including politicians) act like it's something horrible
Weed is not physically addictive and has less harmful effects than alcohol and cigarettes, plus it can be used to treat some mental illnesses for example
In my opinion, the war on drugs only causes harm to society and isn't productive at all
A much better approach would be legalizing drugs like weed or psychedelics and decriminalizing harder drugs
Harm reduction is much better than putting someone in jail for a bit of weed
I absolutely hate the high
But just make it legal for gods sake
It's a fucking plant
1) Isn't nearly as harmful as alcohol or tobbaco
2) Has a huge medical potential
3) People call it a gateway drug
It's not because the high makes you want more drugs
It's because of its popularity and when one finds a way to buy it, they simulatenously find a way to buy other illegal drugs
4) The state will get huge profits from taxes and destroy source of income for crime organizations in one hit
True, there will be smugling, but most people will want to buy it legally
5) It's about damn time we stop this stupid war on drugs shenanigans
It's not helping anyone and i feel like this is the first logical step
Definitely legilize, I've met some people that are into it and they're way more chill people than people that are into alcohol
Yes, there are no negatives
E= I meant legalising it has no negatives, not that weed itself has no negatives
I agree with you, and I think that this is a big problem with alcohol in the Czech Republic, it has become so normalized (the same goes for tobacco I would say) and yet the majority of people act like weed is so much worse and say that legalisation would ruin our society
I find it so hypocritical, especially since weed doesn't have as serious effects as alcohol and isn't physically addictive
When I was working in Netherlands I lived in Den Bosch which is compared to Amsterdam small city  without much turist and everytime I went to coffeshop there was full
So I think dutch people also enjoy cannabis just  they don't want to admit it:D.
Could you elaborate on why I am being delusional
I meant legalising it has no negatives
Hows that gonna change by legalising it
Plenty of people smoke today, youth has easier access to other drugs thru their dealers etc
As a kid I thought that 'the Baltics' (Pobaltí-Pribaltika) were one country, since they were always referred to as a grouped up thing
When somebody mentioned one of them, I just thought they were speaking about regions
Then I heard of some meeting of their presidents and was [pretty baffled
Just the common ones come to my mind, I thought Malta speaks Italian and that Bosnia and Herzegovina make the two federative units of which the country consists
Also I remember having a heated argument with my friend about whether the capital of Ireland is Dublin or Baile Átha Cliath
When I was really small I remember watching Married with Children, dubbed obviously, and I still remember it was Peggy saying something and finishing it with wether he doesn't understand English or something like that (probably another of their fights)
Since that day, even though only for a short time, I believed English is the same as Czech, since they talked Czech (dubbing) and said if he understands "anglicky", so she obviously said it in English and it sounded exactly as Czech and I didn't really met English yet
And this is about USA, not Europe, but also from TV
Watching Grease as a small child, watching all the old actors and the completely different school system with different steps I believed people study about 10 years of highschool in USA (since they talked about 10th grade and such) and that's why they are way older than people from our regular highschool I saw
OP, it's understandable that you believed [that]
> I thought the Iron Curtain was a real, physical object, some sort of border fortifications system,
It was
right bad, left good
It was out of iron and the fence quite resembles curtain
It was real physical object made out of iron
they indeed do
that's why I refrain from generalizations like that
1) Amsterdam, Netherlands
The most stunning place I've been to
2) Prague, Czechia
A lot of historical buildings and very unique culture
3) Budapest, Hungary
A party town, lots of great night clubs
4) Brugges, Belgium
5) Paris, France
Goriffee from Bratislava has been my favourite lately
None of that big brand dark roasts like Lavazza Illy Segafredo etc, there are plenty of small coffee roasting places in cz and svk with wide range of tastes and feels
My partner is French
I'd never had a 'thing' for French culture, never learned French in school or anything like that, it was completely random that we met while we were both staying temporarily in Germany
Neither of us fits many stereotypes about our nations, but obviously there are some things, like we always have debates about 'proper' meal times (Czech dinner at 6pm vs
French dinner at 9 or something), missing proper croissants or eclairs in Czechia, light-hearted stuff like that
Our political views and values are thankfully quite similar
I feel like it would have been more difficult to find a similarly progressive and egalitarian-minded man among Czechs, there's a bit of a macho culture here
His parents have also been very chill with me, I expected to be judged for some things about myself, but not at all
I'm kinda glad that my family doesn't speak much of any foreign language, because otherwise they'd probably be way nosier and more unpleasant (although I don't really have a comparison, this is my first relationship serious enough to visit each other's families)
One cultural difference I didn't expect was him being so staunchly anti-religion (I'm atheist too, but in a more neutral/passive way), despite still being Catholic on paper, and that definitely has to do with French discourse around the laicity principle
Another one is the expectation for public services and such stuff to just work, I know French people complain about their bureaucracy a lot too, but he definitely wasn't ready for some of the messes here
My boyfriend is from Slovakia so we just trash our countries for fun all the time lol
Central Europe
Tons of people here live on a super early timezone, starting work around 7am and trying to get home as early as possible
So lunch is at 11 and dinner at 6
People say it has something to do with the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph being an early bird, so people wanted to imitate him and they've kinda stuck with it since
It could be an urban legend, IDK
I think it's sort of changing with younger generations, but like my grandparents would still call anyone who gets up after 7am lazy, not noticing that they also fall asleep 6 hours earlier than us
I was always jealous as a kid, when I heard that school started at 9 in other countries
Everything is based on early birds being the norm here
We even adapted the "imbus" in Czech for the hex
Sounds strange to me with 'n'
> Doing small things 'here and there' and fucking, do not necessarily have to mutually exclusive for her
Czech verb "šukat" used to mean "do small things", but then evolved to "move back and fro" and later to "fuck". Now, imagine the class reading [this book] from mid-XIX century, where the grandmother was "fucking around the house".
It's our secret plan
Yes
Until "millenials" become thing on the internet, I had no idea generations are named or anything
It sure is
Here we think of generations only in a few dimensions
Like postcommunist and those "born in the previous regime". Of course the elderly, but that's pretty much the extent of it
Time will tell if there will be a bigger divide between my 'generation' (born in the late 90's) and these 'americanized youngsters'. Because I'm not sensing much of it
Yes, except we are not naming generations
Older people are still going to complain about younger generations, they just use "kids/young adults" instead of millenials
Im British originally, when I left ten years ago it just seemed to be young people, over forties and then pensioners
There is definitely some leakage of US politics into British though and there is talk, especially places like reddit or the media and FB groups of boomers and millenials but its too broad
With Czechs people above 50 are written off as the communist generation
For me there seems to be big differences between over 50s, then people 35-50 and then under 35s are different again
a (and), i (and, also), k (to, for), v (in), z (from), s (with), o (about), u (near, by)
Edit: I forgot Ó and Á as interjecton (surprise, aha moment, wonder or scream), it's counted among word class too
Czech has a couple:
a - and
i - and/too
k - to, towards, for
o - about (something)
s - with
u - next to, by
v - in, inside
z - from
a = and
i = "and also" or "and X as well"
o = about
u = next to
k = toward
s = with
v = in
z = from
For example parents don’t usually talk abt wages to kids, to raise them better and not make them spoiled, but adults do between each other pretty usually, same goes to working teens, to those it’s a normal thing
And if you mean about wages in general, people in Europe discuse it often
(Sorry for my spelling, and also this is just my view)
I mean, it might damage your relationship with that person, so for you personally it is generally wiser to not talk about it
But not talking about wages also heavily benefit employer and not employees, as he have to pay more only to people which ask for more
I'd say green ones
And I also prefer green olives over the black ones
Yeah green ones but I like black olives only
Satellites and probes
Lots of them

We're technically a parliamentary democracy, though power has seemingly been slipping more into the presidents hands
He can be overridden by the parliament, but since there are often weak coalitions or, right now, a minority cabinet, he plays one party against the other and comes out on top
For example, there was this minister that the socialists (cabinet minor party) wanted to resign, since he was nominated by them and didn't do a good job
Prime minister said ok, but the president said he won't sign his resignation, even though he's obligated to - prolonging the matter for months, eventually settling on a different successor than the socialists wanted - again, even though the president had no basis for such actions
Also, since the president has the presidential pardon in his hands, and our prime minister is being accused of economic crimes and is in a conflict of interest (he own a major business he's, allegedly, favoring in state subsidies and cracking down on his business rivals)
So the president has the prime minister in his pocket and PM won't go against him
TLDR: Right now, the system is unbalanced and the president is pushing its boundaries in the direction of presidential rule
Well, our president is an old drunk dude, with dementia, who hasn't been sober for 7 years of his presidency and our prime minister is megalomaniac/mafia boss, who owns most food, agriculture and media companies, over which he still has a control (unoficially), steals from EU and does shit for people, only if he wants to improve his public image, so things are great
To your question, prime minister has always more power than president (PM is head of government), but president can veto laws from parliment (who create laws), but parliment can overrule presidential veto by majority and get the law in lawbooks anyway
Also PM consults with president important decisions
Well, our president doesn’t really have a true power
He can veto laws
He’s supposed to be a representative figure
The PM has the true power
He (and the chamber of deputies) can make laws and stuff
So yeah, it’s kinda supposed to be a balance (and they teach us in schools about said balance), but the reality is different
And rn the president is kinda pushing our country towards more of a presidential country, rather than the parliamentary one
Which kinda makes sense to me, since we can vote our president directly (it wasn’t like that), but I’m more fond of the parliamentary democracy that we have rn
I think here our prime minister has a lot more power than our president
Like, I don't know much about politics (I'm a teenage boy), but because of TV and news on the internet I think he is well overpowered
I believe that only individual himself knows best how to operate on free market to benefit him the most
If you want to build the road, take a loan and pay it back using toll, if you want hospital get insurance, if you want police, just order this service the same way you hire your gas/water piping guy
I've read that most Finnish people nowadays are opposed to mandatory Swedish in schools, is that true
To me (from a monolingual country) it surely seems like a lot you're doing for a fairly small minority
Would it not be sufficient to protect Swedish as a regional language
Yes, there's school 1-9 grade on my way to work and pre-covid I was seeing tons of kids going in/out without adults every day
It's also common to send kids alone via train to school in another town since grade 1 here, because there is no school in our village anymore and when parents work in a place/time that it's not possible to take them to school, the kid simply has to go alone
It was no problem in tha past with us since we were also part of big group of kids going, there's fewer kids nowadays so it may not seem so "safe" but that's how it is
Yes, I walked to school without parents from 4th grade of elementary school, I would say it is normal here
Back in school, we were reading some samples from old texts
I understood what they were saying, but only from context and with the words being wtitten with today's letters (few of them changed sounds over the years), so I'd say it is intelligable, but more like slightly simmilar foreign language
[Podkoní a žák] has been written in 1300s. It is pretty much understandable, but the differences in pronunciation (ě sound, diphthongs not contracted into long vowels), vocabulary (what student wears means "skirt" in the modern Czech, but there it means "dress"; the word for the place they drink beer is present in modern Slovak, but not in modern Czech etc) and grammar (live dual number; more past tenses) are very noticeable
Modern Czech is usually harder than old Czech, except for some exceptions
Basically, the old language is mostly understandable by Czechs
Czech word "aktuálně" could be translated as currently in English
Many Czechs incorrectly say "actually" when they want to say aktuálně in English
Not according to [Cambridge dictionary]
>Actual is an adjective meaning ‘true’, ‘real’ and ‘the thing in itself’. It does not refer to time
>In some languages actual has the meaning of ‘current’ and ‘at the present time’. This is not correct in English
Found this on wiktionary
>In most Romance, Slavic and Germanic languages the cognate of actual means “current”. This meaning has also been used in English since the sixteenth century but is now rare due to a semantic shift
My best friend and I went to London couple of years back and and we wanted to take a picture in front of the TARDIS
While we were talking pictures, some guy about out age and his mum stopped to take a photo as well
They said couple of sentences in Czech about talking the photo before turning to us and asking us in English if we don't mind them joining us
So I replied in Czech that there is no need for English and the delight in their faces was the best
Nothing crazy but it made my day
Partly because I randomly met another Czech whovian in the middle of London
Not only Yugos
I remember ordering in Czech in Vienna, 'cause I've heard waiters to speak Slovak

meme town of "the highest quality of livivng" idk if living on the biggest crossroads in the country qualifies tho
someone from vnitro who is in charge of all these lives there, probably
Prague always
I don't think there was actually any bigger city anytime
Obviously Prague, but in other regions some cities were replaced as the regional capitals
Eg Olomouc used to be the "capital" of Moravia (got replaced by Brno) Litoměřice and Žatec were major cities in the north-west (now replaced by Ústí nad Labem and Liberec), Kutná Hora used to be the second most important city in the kingdom
And the "Czech Silesia" grew thanks to coal mining and heavy industry (the area around Ostrava)
Kutná Hora (Kuttenberg) used to be major Czech city until 19 century
It lost its importance because there were no industry, and it wasn’t connected well to railroad
Also Olomouc was the main center of Moravia for most of history, it is seat of second archbishop after all
It started to stagnate when it was heavily fortified, meanwhile the inhabited right turn before Vienna (Brno) was free to grow
Prague was always the biggest city in modern Czechia, ever since the beginning of the state
Any historical borders would include Wroclaw (much smaller, since in the 14th century Prague was the biggest in the Holy Roman Empire even, though with industrialisation in Silesia in the 18th centure it would probably come close, I don't have the exact numbers)
And yes, Vienna was inside the Bohemian Crown for a little while in the 13th century before the Habsburgs
I don't think Vienna was very big at the time though
Other Czech or Slovak cities don't come close
And Jáchymov used to be the second biggest city
Beautiful :D
I started english at 7 in 2nd grade
We had either 3 or 4 classes a week for the test of primary school
I started being able to understand movies in english round 12 pro 13 years old
I have still some trouble with the th, because I just don't even hear the difference between three and free
I also still strugle a little bitt with the r sound, because I just keep rolling my r's
I started in 2nd grade (age 7/8) and it took me until age 19 to be able to actually have conversations in real life and even longer to comfortably watch movies without subtitles
I saw "talking to real people" as the top skill level when I was in school, but it's actually much easier, because they can adapt to your level and re-phrase anything you didn't understand
I was pretty much fluent by age 15 or so, I just had a terrible amount of anxiety about mistakes
I think I learned most of my vocabulary simply by being immersed in the Internet since my early teens and looking up information about anything that interested me, trying to translate some song lyrics, playing games, stuff like that
For listening, Youtube has been more helpful to me than movies, because people speak more naturally
English subtitles are definitely a good choice for TV shows, you'll notice how you read them less and less over time :) It really mostly just takes time, don't get too stressed about it
I had some elementary English classes in kindergarden
Around 11, we got a PS3 and none of the games had subtitles in our language, se we used English subtitles
I don’t remember when have I stopped browsing the internet in my mother language
I’ve been reading books, watching the news, YouTube, films, series, and playing videogames since
At 14 we got a new English teacher who gave us a test to see our level
I scored best with like 98/100 points, which soon lead me to participate in language competitions
I’ve gotten into the national level twice
During this time, teachers would pull me out of classes to practise with me, which was frankly pointless even as a revision, and I missed on Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (those I did need, hahah)
At 16, group of best English students got an offer to take CAE with a discount paid for my the school
I took mine and got C2
I am now in my third year of uni and am still known as the good-at-English kid (very practical title as you’re always expected to take the lead whenever English is involved)
I’d say languages are generally easy for me - I was tHe GoOd StUdEnT in French class (starting at 14 I think) and got to B2 with hardly studying
I’ve also started German two months ago and I find it easier than French
But I’d say the most important factor is using the language to do whatever you are passionate about, rather than revising grammar or being good at languages
I took first classes in kindergarten when I was 5
We have mandatory english classes from 3rd grade(when kids are 9 years old)
I've learnt mostly from playing videogames and watching series, school wasn't that ifluential even though I learnt a lot there
I got C2(native speaker) certificate when I was 17 and most of my classmates got at least C1 as well
What is the strangest destination where people go to spend their Erasmus
What is the place, where you'd think: "People do their Erasmus *here*?!" Maybe a university in a tiny unknown town, maybe a far off place, maybe a place take captures your interest in some other way
Oh god
I guess that if you don't care about traveling or the funny looks that they'd probably give you at the student department, it could be a fun way to game the system
Nothing like a little bit of money for free, eh
Imagine if he came back with bad grades
Oh yeah
When I was choosing my Erasmus program, I saw that there was a Slovakian university in Nitra on our list
That would be probably about the same for us
I'm sorry to say so, but it looks like it
It's a study exchange program funded by the EU
It allows you to spend 1-2 semesters abroad and for a lot of people who've tried it, it's a really good experience
In general, you mean
Most Erasmus exchanges are in English
Actually, my university has a contract with one university in Reykjavik
It was my first choice, until I found out about how much it costs to live there, lol
Noped out it very quickly
I have to admit that I did my Erasmus in Lithuania
in winter
Actually, their semester starts a little earlier, so I spent a part of summer and the warm part of autumn there, so it was not all bad, but yeah, I probably could've made a better choice
And it wasn't even *that* cheap
You definitely can
You'll just be wrong very often
Yes and no
If you know what to look for, you can spot the dominant facial/body features
But it doesn't always translate to nationality because people mix and move around Europe a lot
That is also a common way to distinguish Czech men
>Walking sticks and hiking boots for a trail which locals do on flip flops and Moretti
Ah yes, the reverse Czechs
Well, Czechs do that locally, too
The mountain rescue had to save some lady wearing sandals and socks in the mountains
There is 80cm of snow
But to be fair, many of us are capable in the outdoors
Some just think they are amazing outdoorsmen while they are just stupid
You can't really tell Czechs and Slovaks apart in any other way than language
We are really mixed, since we lived in one country
Don't buy new plastic bags, use the ones you already have
And recycle all plastic instead of putting it in rubbish (trash) bins
If you can, use public transport instead of going by car
If you need to go by car, don't leave the motor running when you aren't moving (for example at crossovers)
You could try not reproducing, cause having a child leaves a big carbon footprint and as others said, change of diet, limiting the use of transportation by car and going on foot, bike or public transportation, second hand clothes ect
You'll need a lot of masks, prepare, when you can
“Padají trakaře” translates to “It’s falling barrows”. We say that when it’s snowing heavily
> "Das ist mir Wurst/wurscht
" (It's sausage to me
) - Whatever
It's in Czech too: je mi to buřt.
> Everything has an end, only the sausage has two
This reminds of this riddle: how many ends does [jitrnice] have
>!Seven: the front one, the rear one, 4 ends on the sticks, and the last one when you bring an end to it
We have the same but with camel
While I really like it, being a non-native speaker I was really excited when I first heard *éramos pocos y nació la abuela*. Really tore me into pieces
Also *de Guatemala a Guatepeor* is a nice wordplay
In Czech it's making a camel out of a mosquito, and it doesn't rhyme
Great question but I have no idea
Although I found that “camel” - “velbloud”, came from a word “ulbandus” that came from greek word for elephant
So maybe it has to do something with that
Yeah, it's called Ústav pro jazyk český (Czech Language Institute) and falls under the national Academy of Sciences
Many people think that this institute "makes the rules" of the Czech language, but that's not really true anymore, it works in a descriptive way
They have an online dictionary and a website where people can send their questions, and we use their resources in academia all the time
There's technically no law forcing anyone to follow a particular book or version of the rules outside of schools, but the Institute's publications carry a lot of weight
Czech people love being grammar snobs, I don't think descriptivism is very accepted among the general public at this point
Being borderline musically illiterate, I was stunned to only recently learn about a cult pre-revolution band whose [music] sounds like it could very well be tweaked to fit into a Stranger Things soundtrack
the music is very well known here as this song is a quite "popular" remake of the original hungarian one
We just have people from Brno, who set their city as a legitimate rival of Prague
Prague citizens barely recognize Brno's existence
Average Prague fan
Average Brno enjoyer
We even have Prague institute for insulting Brno on Facebook
There also is Brno institute for insulting Prague but there are mostly people from Prague who are insulting an occasional vesničan cuz there is no internet in the oppidum
Similiar with Nymburk and Poděbrady
Similar to Pardubice and Hradec Králové
Úhonice And Průhonice
I'm just mad because people always corrected me thinking i lived in Průhonice when I lived in Úhonice
Avera Holomóc enthusiast
Do Dubliners also refer to Cork as "the village"?
I know about this, it's hilarious
I am from podebrady and i can only say its true
Those are much more even I'd say
I have heard that when the regions of CZ were decided on,  Pardubice and Hradec were deliberately put into different ones
vesnice means village, so this term literally means villager
The ultimate disrespect
Not even having a derogatory nickname
Interesting question
I can't think of any cartoon that does it from the top of my head, but I remember that in The Witcher video games, dwarves speak in a Scottish accent
In the Czech voiceover, they speak with a South Moravian accent (where I'm from), which is a bit mix of Czech and Slovak
I know that in Alvin and the Chipmunks series, the girls there have British accents, as opposed to the rest of the cast, which is American
In Czech dubbing, the girls didn't even speak Czech, but Slovak
And honestly, that's one of the best things they could have done
There might be one I remember but, I'd like you to ask you something in order to confirm
Anybody who saw the Planes movie in English, there are two commentators, does one of them has an accent
Yes, e.g. Hermes in Futurama has a strong Moravian (Walachian
) accent and it sounds very funny
Hermes in Futurama speak with some moravian accent, original should be Jamaica or something like this
I see, because one of the two comentators spoke Slovak in Czech dubbing
That may be a little long stretch from times of Czechoslovakia where TV had almost half Czech half Slovak hosts
Travel programme "Objektiv" still has some Slovak hosts
Oh, you reminded we
Us too with just with Slovak instead of Norwegian
We have proverb :"To drink like danish"
>should we push them south this time
That was not a good idea but what about north next time
We have classical dance lessons
It’s nice remnant from imperial times, these courses consist of learning classical and latin dances and etiquette
There is usually dress code, recommending wearing suits and dresses
Usually whole classes of high schoolers go to these courses when they are 14-16
It’s great way to socialize and to meet new people
In cities majority of people go to these courses sometime in their life
>For example, France doesn't have "Religious education" classes
So do you really think that we have religious education
During upper elementary school we had had "Family Education" which was a subject covering everything from family relationships to etiquette to racism to drugs to sects to sex ed
I think some schools have it as a choose able subject in the 7th grade
Let's see if you manage to keep it in the future :/
Barely
We're supposed to have some (very brief) sections on sex ed split between biology and social studies/civics classes, but most of my teachers straight up skipped it
In high school, they just invited an external speaker to give one single talk on how birth control is a thing that exists (when most of us were already 16 years old
) and hand out a promo package of tampons
We had "Technical Drawing" which was actually engineering drawing for a year in the second to last year of elementary school
We actually had that too, in grade 4
They made it look all official, with a local cop supervising the exam and all
It's pretty funny to me, because most Czech people barely ever bike in traffic, it's considered more of an outdoor sport done outside of cities here
We did have cooking classes
Not sure if kids do these days
We learn that in history and social education
Yeah, we just mention the religion in history classes or in social science classes and quite briefly
Yeah, I had a brief unit on formal logic in Math at the beginning of Czech *gymnasium*. It's a part of the standard Math curriculum
exact same here, but that's not a surprise
The year 1968 is definitely described differently in Russia than in the rest of the eastern europe
Well for example Munich treat was for us the biggest treason in our history and we will never forget that, but for France and Britain it probably means very little
Yes
For example Japan ppl don't like nuke bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, but from our prespective US stopped Axis forces so it was right decision=difference of perspectives in the historic events
I don't have that opinion
It was such a tragedy
It was inhumane decision of reckless Americans that didn't value lives of innocent civilians
Similar case in Czech history is burnt down villages Lidice and Ležáky
That "the west" was organizing a revolution here to weaken the eastern bloc
And how they saved us from becoming vassals of US
The thing is, they really believe that and most of the soldiers who participated in that are firmly assured that they did a good thing
They killed over 150 people and occupied Czechoslovakia for 21 years
Stuff like that should never happen again
The worst thing about this is that there aren't exactly few people who agree with it here in Czechia
The communists - directly transformed from the Czechoslovak communist party - have 8 % in the parliament and many of them are mayors in small towns and villages due to old people being a large part of the electorate
Newer generations don't vote fot them, thank God
Yeah
Sweatpants, I never wear that outside (only when I'm in my parents village house), ugly, hole-y or just too worn t-shirts and old hoodies from the teenage era I wore hoodies (before I gathered enough confidence for more elegant, feminine clothes I actually liked more)
You mean sweatpants and worn-out t-shirt
Then yes
Yeah absolutely, It's such a good feeling to switch to new more comfortable clothes
Sweatpants are so much better than jeans
And I wear old t shirts and hoodies so they get some use and the newer ones don't wear out that quickly
Also, no shoes
>worn out
They are more comfy,  stretched  and softened
Only "Běž domů Ivane" (Go home Ivan) comes to my mind
We love it for obvious reasons
Thats great
Felt such patriotism for my own country
I need to look for some Czech ones
I'll be boring and say that I like to play CK2 as Great Moravia and go for the Slavic Church alternate history line
It's not that I'm such a patriot or whatever, it's just that I like the sense of familiarity in the alternate history scenario and have more of an idea what the places that I rule look like
Plus I have a lot of fun coming up with names for Slavic characters
In Crusader Kings I played often as Bohemia (and failed miserably), and then I tried to do the featured rulers that are in the menu (and failing as well, except for the time I played as Armenia)
In CK2 and EU4, Bohemia, for obvious reasons
But I also enjoy a good Mediterranean game - Byzantium for Rome, Italian minors for the challenge
Cyprus and the Knights of Rhodes for Jerusalem
I like the colonial game in EU4 very much, and I enjoyed the tactic of exodus into America for the Basque, or for Brittany and Granada
In Hoi4, Germany, since it's the full course
But also Austria-Hungary
And Britain bulldozing through Europe, since that's satisfying
Indeed
It connects to a lot of counties of different religion, so you can easily chip away at your neighbors, while they wage their wars - the Avars, Austria, parts of Germany
And with the other Slavs you can subjugate large swathes of land
It really leaves a lot of options for growth
Nová ves u Nového Města na Moravě [New village near the Moravian New Town]
Brandýs nad Labem/Stará Boleslav is a close second
V Novém Městě na Moravě se jezdí biatlon
It's not a joke, in Nové Město na Moravě is an international biatlon course
kuala lumpur is what I want but frankfurt will be what I will have to
Budapest
I visited north Hungary last summer and I loved it, so now I want to explore the capital
I also love train journeys, so I'm going to take direct train from Ústí nad Labem to Budapest
I kinda lost the drive to travel TBH, I'm not sure if I'll be in the mood to go abroad any time soon even with no restrictions
I wouldn't mind spending Christmas in France again and stopping in Paris along the way, but that would be just a side effect of visiting my "in-laws".
I studied in Oulu too, you'll not be disappointed
However, I'm a big fan of winters, hockey, metal and Finnish culture, so my opinion might be slightly biased
Last year I was surprised how beautiful, calm and welcoming Budapest is
It’s just like the cities I used to read about in Verne novels
Metro line 1 is a must
Compared to Prague, Wien and Munich, I liked it the best, so enjoy your stay
Been to Copenhagen and expected a bit more, there are more interesting places in Denmark
KL and Malaysia itself are awesome, definitely recommend it
1 is enough, it will be a business trip so I will see just airport and hotel anyway
I’d avoid Brno, it’s one of the better cities, but there are plenty of more exciting places in our country
Hanspaulka, Prague
That's historically where the wealthiest industrialists or movie stars of Czechia used to live (many still do)
When in Nice, you're happy to see Bentleys
Anything that's not a truc
ah shit too soon
I was there as a child, it was stop on the way to Barcelona  -  and yes, the public elevators were something else
That I don't understand
Ok, you're rich, you have Ferrari, but why blast music like some ghetto teenager
To be honest, Amsterdam city centre is not that far off
I mean
a pint of Heineken for €7
I'll keep that in mind
We've made a mistake by booking a hotel in the Amsterdam city centre
In Prague, you have a ridiculously expensive tourist trap place in the middle of a town square, but a perfectly affordable place just a street away
Not in Amsterdam
Arizona, Azerbaijan, Russian diplomatic plates (wouldn't be so foreign in center of Prague, but in my neighborhood it's pretty exotic sight)
Probably Russian on a personal vehicle, you can see trucks from the whole Europe here
But more interesting was one of my drive in October, when like every fifth car was from Switzerland - it was the last day when people could travel from Czechia to Switzerland without the quarantine, so I guess many people better went back to home
Once I saw a car with a Californian number plate
I live in a town with population about 50,000 people so I was very surprised
Chile
Some guys from Chile was doing their world wide trip and lived in hotel next doors during their Prague stay
Damn
Well, the car has been sitting in the parking lot for a week, then disappeared
If you wanna be aware, it's easy to recognize Russian diplomatic plates, it's white letters on red backround
Although I was more worried about matte black Mercedes G with tinted windows and AZE plates tailgating me once
"zavináč" - impossible to translate literally really, but the meaning is a "roll". There is also a dish named "zavináč", and it is a sour fish rolled with onions and sauerkraut
In Czech, it's called zavináč.
It's related to the word zavinutý, which means rolled up
"zavináč" is this:
Cute, I'm going to call it štrůdl from now
There's also the original meaning of "zavináč": [rollmops]
thanks
I knew it must exist outside as well, but had no idea how to find what it's call in english
Next time I would recommend to switch the Wikipedia page of the given term into English
Yes, mainly Slovakia
In hockey when we're knocked out, I usually cheer for US since I got friends there
And if Russia plays, I cheer for literally anynone playing against them
Well probably slovakia, but we never get knocked out before slovakia in hockey ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I don't really follow a whole lot of sporting events, but when I catch a glimpse of one on the telly, I usually cheer for the exotic underdog
So for example Japan in football, whoever is the underdog in the ice hockey matches and so on
I actually cheer for them even if they play against us
not at all, I have some favourite foreign sportsman and that's all
I was surprised how tiny and old Dutch houses are
Everything is very small, tightly packed together and lacks open spaces
UK:
Sandwich and crisps is not an unusual lunch
People working in offices are wearing suit and tie just because they are working in an office
Fire drills everywhere, in hotels, in offices
Mainland Europe just parties harder
> supermarkets are more likely to accept debit cards than visa/mastercard
this sentence doesn't make sense at all
> I get up at 6
Why
Why
But how often do you discuss distances in thousands of kilometers so megameters will have some logical sense in such a case
I guess never
For earth it is way too big scale and for astronomical distances way to small
On the other side shopping is something people do daily and do you really ask your butcher for 783 grams of meat
Is there any drama if there isn't exact gram precision because it is hard or impossible to make
No one is ordering in grams here because such an accuracy is is impossible and demanding it would be a Karen thing
So no one really uses grams even it technically makes sense
> Putting aside how rarely people actually go to butchers here, no
wait what
where do you get your meat from
OK never mind, imagine buying salami or cheese, you do this thing up there
Same thing, often you can't cut slice up to gram
>It isn't about what's precise it's about what's usual
yes, this is what I found strange, because it is usual to use that scale which avoids unnecessary leading or trailing zeroes, exactly I would not order meat by hectograms, I bet you would not declare your weight in grams either  (last but not least, saying twenty five is shorter than two hundreds fifty, shop clerk is not a person for a quick chat, stop blocking queue :)
hm sliced cheese and salamis are not sold in Danish supermarkets, that's crazy
yes, I am surprise you don't have any deli counters in supermarkets at all
Lichtenstein - I find funny that their southern Moravian estates were bigger than Lichtenstein itself
Recently they were in news in here because they are trying to get some of their confiscated things back
Andorra: cool skiing
Monaco:  casino
Lichtenstein: no you can't have things back
Vatican: pope
Malta: some island, the word mean Mortar in Czech (as in masonry)
San Marino: always forgot you exists
sorry about that but without seeing your flag  I would not list you at all
More microstates= more Eurovision entries, (except for Luxembourg, saying they can't win anymore, so why should they try) /s
Monaco - basically just a casino
Andorra - tax heaven
For the record, there are cities that have 3 or 4 times the population of Finland :P
It will bring more chaos to Iraq
Also:
Let's kill Iran general in Iraq
What, outrage
Surprised Pikachu face
JUST IN: The State Department issued a security alert early Friday urging Americans in Iraq to leave the country immediately
STABLE GENIUS at work again
All these "WW3" memes are utter shit, of course, but the middle east will be de-stabilized even more
Anyone who tries this is called a terrorist and we invade that country and burn it to the groud
Oh its USA, its ok, nevermind
USA is terrorist country
Iraq and Iran are actually now pretty close
Both countries have a majority of Shia muslims
Under Saddam Hussain Sunnite minority oppressed Shias, after that it turned around and Shias started to oppress Sunnites
ISIS then started to recruit soldiers from now oppressed Sunni minority
This US action is likely to worsen the Iraqi government's relationship with the USA
If Iraq government asks USA to withdraw their soldiers from Iraq will USA obey
I would say it's more like Russian soldiers being in Syria
Iran is now Iraq's largest trading partner
Iran and Iraq are very close allies supporting each other against ISIS
Iran forces helped Iraq in fight with ISIS a lot
The relationship between the two countries is strong in part due to the fact that both governments operate on a Shi'ite system of governance
We have a bit of oil here so I guess your country
Russia
Russia
Could you not invade slavs
FOR FIVE MINUTES
Germany, once again
Oh, not again
Danish students
Chinese tourists
They will buy what they can to get know-how and then leave us here to rot
yearly production is around 2 millions barrels
Probably not enough for your government to run some black op here and then "liberate" us :)
Problem solved
Russia sold them the resources needed for war industry and allowed training of german officers on russian territory
> What language do you speak
Czech
>What are the most popular foods in Czechia
beer
>What generation are your jets
I think these grippens are 4
5 generation (we have 14 of them so don't worry)
>how how robust is your air defense
I am not sure about this but due to pretty good relations with Russia I don't think it will be hard to obtain S-400 from them
If I am correct our passive radars were used to shot down your stealth F177 during Serbia war
"Mléčný bar" was pretty popular during communist era here
Now all of them are gone, but my city has still one
I don't know any other existing "Mléčný bar" in Czechia
But we still have one
We have a long-standing (pun intended) tradition of Jídelna where you can buy traditional czech foods for low price but you have to eat it standing on a high table or on a window table
You are right "jídelna" is more similar to polish "bar mlieczny" at least from my experience
However, we have also "mléčný bar" which offer a little different meals
It's kinda hard to describe it
I can just invite you to my home town Pardubice and you can experience Czech Mléčný bar
Jožin z bažin
Perhaps:
* [Vítkovo kvarteto - Pražskej démon]
* [Jiří Schelinger - Holubí dům]
* [Zimní královna]
or probably something from Lucie
Like ungrammatical, "folk" speech we use in informal situations with some words or prhases  the previous generations used more than us now
I may be wrong, but I think he spoke some Moravian too (but only a few words)
Tahák, from word Tahat (pull) as it is going to pull you out of problems
as far as I know it is not used for anything else, but can't speak for all dialects
"tahák"
It probably derived from the word "tahat" which means "to pull" in English
Maybe a piece of paper with information for the test that you pull out of your pocket or sleeve or something like that maybe
It's really from going to pull you out of problems
I always thought it's from I'm going to secretly pull it out from under the desk/papers/pencilcase
but I guess the other meaning makes better sense
never thought about it this way but it also makes a perfect sense
Nah i think your meaning makes more sense
Yeah, depended on the creativity
I had this big calculator with cover you could turn over and slip the calculator into while you're using it so I always had tahák in it for math, physics and chemistry inside
It was this [scientific calculator Casio] with the cover you could slip the calculator into from both sides
Yes I do
In all the schools i ever went to had them
But my classmate says his previous school didn't have them
You always have to change your shoes when you Come to school so you have a place where to store your shoes, maybe clothing for PE
I stored even a long board in my previous school cuz I didn't have a mopedcar (I won't explain what it is, I am tired of it)
Nowadays I store my shoes, clothing for practical lessons, PE clothing and my heavist book (1000 pages) with a jacket or whatever I don’t want on me
Yes, in some schools
My elementary school had them (since the last year I went there lol), my high school didn’t even have a big enough cloak room (1,5 x 2,5 meters max for 30+ people), and my uni doesn’t even have anything (no cloak room or lockers)
We had tiny lockers in middle school - there were like 4 or 5 of them stacked vertically, so they could only fit books and art supplies and stuff
Coats and shoes (changing from your outdoor shoes into slippers is a huge deal in this country, including in school buildings) were kept in "changing rooms" [like this] in the basement, shared by each class
My high school had regular size lockers for everything
It was kind of a fancy thing, not that many Czech schools had lockers at the time, but I think they're quite common nowadays
On elementary school we had fenced [cages] on every hallway
One cage for whole class
You switch shoes there every morning and leave coat
The craziest part is that as time went on the amount of shit (such as books) in my backpack decreased instead of increasing as the difficulty grew
In primary school, every lesson needed a book, an exercise book a notebook and other shit like that
So I ended up with a bag packed full of garbage that weighed half my weight
Then in high school, only like half the lessons needed books that were actually useful and I started combining notebooks to fit more than one lesson
And now in uni, I carry one notebook where I occasionally write something but other than that, nothing since everything is online these days
10\^6 = milion
10\^9 = miliarda
10\^12 = bilion
10\^15 = biliarda
10\^18 = trilion
And this seems to be the same as in other European languages except English
So I looked into this and there seems to be a "long and short scale" for English
The long scale having the same prefixes as anywhere else and the short scale introducing chaos and existing for no reason
I don't know
There are both the systems side by side:  [ But I can't find why there are two systems in the first place
million = milion
billion = miliarda
trillion = bilion
quadrilion = biliarda
Pretty much the same as OP's.
Million- milion or milión (both are grammatically correct)
Billion- miliarda
Prague, Jihlava, Znojmo and several other cities have pretty big underground (tens of square kilometers)
These are usually some old sewers, silver mines, storage spaces and corridors connecting them, etc
Fun thing is, that you can access these areas from most cellars of older buildings
Also under National Museum, due to leaking water, there is small cave with stalactites and stalagmites
Time to take pickaxe, few friends and find out
Number one in beer consumption
Good question
Maybe consumption of beer and geography ? Dont really have anything too special
Cheers to that
Looks like Germany is [fourth]
Noobs
Luckily no, nothing against politeness but I think hearing people yelling through the bus Thank you every minute would be quite annoying
Noone Does that here
Absolutely not, at least in my city
Not really, you usually exit through one of the doors at the back tho, the front is for entrance only
It is impossible in Prague
Public transport here is quite efficient, it means
* Buses are big (12 or 18 meters)
* Entrance and exit are allowed through any doors
* Tickets are *very* rarely purchased from the driver (this is discouraged, you pay 25% more if you do), usually one has yearly ticket, or ticket from a wending machine, or from an app
Yup
But I say hello and thank you when buying a ticket, so that compensates for it
(Czechia) On my route of bus when I was in secondary school (I'm 20 now) we were saying 'Thank you' to the driver
It was so annoying like twenty people saying thank you again and again lol
this would be considered here probably as speaking to myself and people will look weird :) the default bus for Prague is over 18 meters long and there is no way driver could hear it, especially when exiting through last door
Driver itself sits behind glass door and there used to be sticker saying "do not talk to driver" or something like that anyway
Not so long ago Prague public transport rules said front doors are just for exiting the bus and boarding just in case you are elderly, disabled etc
Driver didn't even opened these doors if there wasn't anyone fitting this rule
Also if you wanted to exit through first door and not being from these groups you would got first some death stare from driver saying "you want to use THESE doors
ok but this is the last time"
I honestly have to wonder whether I could even do that in Prague
Elsewhere yes, it's normal to just buy it from the driver, but in Prague everyone either has a public transport card, ticket  from a ticket machine placed outside of the bus (these are usually in metro stations, but the ticket applies to all public transport) or with SMS ticket
I find it hugely hypocritical how so many defend the right of private companies to censor free speech on their websites (be it hate speech or not), but the second China is involved everyone is again such practice (and yes, they are the same people, lot of them straight up admitted it in various threads)
Anyway, it's absolutely despicable
However, China is such a huge market and has investments in just about everything that it doesn't surprise me in the slightest
Nevertheless, I hope something is done about this
Western countries shouldn't allow other countries to dictate what their citizens can say
Not entirely sure how much can governments do to help to be honest
I suppose it's down to consumer how they will react
It's just a tip of the iceberg
China evidently decided to use their economic power to force their politics to foreign countries
This is only start and we will see how specific countries will be able to defend themselves
In Prague they now threaten to Prague's magistrate with "[harm]
I think we should be far more aggressive against China
It's so obviously clear that their influence has gone waaaay too far and having western companies self-censor themselves on behalf of an oppressive authoritarian government is frankly disgusting
I wonder if maybe banning Chinese from investing in and buying up western companies could work because this can't and shouldn't continue
Get out of here with communist apologetism
It HaS nEveR BeEn AppLiED
Shit, I maybe should read whole comments, my bad
Lichtenstein, because noone else is gonna mention them
Russia, because
# B I G
Not again
Kick Turkey out of NATO, put EU talks on permanent hold, denounce through UN
Massive fiasco on the side of the US
Betraying an ally in this manner is really really shitty and terrible PR
And fuck Turkey, they are just a bunch of hypocrites
For all their speech about fighting terrorism they sure as hell didn't mind having ISIS on their border for a few years and having radical islamists fighting on their side
(And yes I recognize there are links between SDF/YPG and PKK and the history behind it)
It's probably too late to really do anything
From a realpolitik point of view, having Turkey in NATO is waaaay more important than supporting a minor player in the grand scheme of things
That's the sad truth
And I genuinly don't know what the "right" response should be at this point, kicking Turkey out of NATO
Perhaps if that's even possible
As for the Kurds, I fear that it's too late for them too
I don't know if allying themselves with Assad is possible or if it would even help at this point but they are running out of options
In an ideal world the war should not have escalated or even started to begin with
Of course the blame doesn't really fall on one party but in general I think US and the coallition should have stayed out of it
The way this has played out is pretty humiliating for the americans and devastating for the people living in the midst of the war
Complex topic which I would like my country to stay the f away from
Unless Turkey decides to do another ethnic cleansing, then both EU and NATO should step in
And their planned buffer zone contains almost all oil rich and fertile land from that part of Syria
What a coincidence
No at all, only when I can recognize mistakes
I can't identify native speaker of any language including Czech
Mostly
I could probably tell if someone is british but I might mistake for example germans for americans if they're really good
It probably depends on how similar their native tongue is to yours
I am always able to tell if someone's czech within 10 seconds of hearing them speak english, no matter how good they are
Yes, but only because I've been C2 since 16 and spent a lot of time polishing my accent, so my ears are tuned to it well
My French is much weaker than my English, and while I can tell when someone speaks with a weird accent, I can't say where are they from
Started German a little over a year ago and I can't tell at all
Afaik, we don't bite into anything, instead we've got *"prdět do hlíny"* "to fart into the dirt".
don't..?
At least I've never heard of a similar phrase in Czech
Who the fuck says that
“Natáhnout bačkory” I’d say is a lot more frequently used, meaning to “stretch slippers”
This or I heard "Žere hlínu".
I doubt you'll find many
Most European countries have a lot of similarities to their neighbours, or at least neighbouring areas of those neighbours
Each country or culture is then unique not through single traits but through combinations of overlapping traits
With exceptions, of course
(staring at Hungary)
Our contradictory nature, probably: we do a lot of sports, yet surfer from high obesity and have high alkohol consumption, our country is steeped in history yet few people care about it, we love to laugh at other people misery yet we made masks for our neighbores and hospitals while goverment was as ineffectual as ever
I would say the [Czech tramping culture] which also is kinda connected to the [Czech kutilství (DIY culture)] (which is not as unique as the tramping but the whole DIY mindset is more common here than in other countries I've been to)
Month's names, maybe
leden, únor, březen, duben, květen, červen, červenec, srpen, září, říjen, listopad, prosinec
because you have Central Europe time instead of +1:00 (or +2:00 not sure), which is because of tourists and trade etc
I thought you get used to weird time
I wouldn't survive long in those temperatures, it's crazy
Your bodies are just trying to keep at least their heads over sea level, just in case
Yeah, poor phrasing on my part
I really meant the Hungarian language as being one of the few truly unique traits
Most Slavic and Germanic and Romance languages have a continuum of dialects that makes them intertwined, but Hungarian stands out
That's how it startér, but then there were more than enough opportunities to make it 'normal' again
But there were/are many reasons to let it be
According to the latest official charts:
Radio Airplay chart: [Chinaski - Kapradí] (typically generic and boring Czech pop-rock that radios play over and over for 30 years)
Singles chart: [Yzomandias ft
Nik Tendo - Rolls] (the most successful and controversial rapper and perhaps artist overall in the country right now, the video is made for all songs on his latest EP, the #1 song starts at 3:25)
If we look at the official monthly charts for August, there is no change - both songs were #1 in their respective charts
Maybe it might be good to mention #2 on singles chart - [Viktor Sheen ft
Calin, Nik Tendo, Hasan - Až na měsíc] That song was already released in May 2019 and since then topped the chart 32 times,  and even now, 1 year and half since release is still in top 10, so we could say this is the ultimate Czech hit of the past 2 years
That's horrible
I've read the lyrics
That's so fucking cringe I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry lol
Moravskoslezký kraj — that one which is close to you
At first, I read: "What **religion** in your country is the odd one out
But I stopped myself
honestly misha man like, is that even considered music
Type to yt: pejskové se koušou
Oh gosh we have czech version of this
I never knew that other countries suffered with us
Well, yes, but actually
yes
I refuse to recognize this as music
I ALMOST forgot about it
He was kinda matipulated by his older brother to make shitty and provokative videos to get views
The parodies too:
OP said he wants the worst music, not the best
>and occasionally ALSO live at home while going to university
that's nothing ocassionally where I am from, no shame for living with parents during studies
Thick walls, sturdy doors, a different floor, possibly loud music -> even soft BDSM isn't a problem
Czech goverment
I like our anthem
It celebrates beauty of our nature
I don't expect anthem should have faster tempo or something it's not a pop rock neither metal song
I actually like ours
Unlike most national anthems It's not about wars and fights, but It's a song about loving our country
It's boring
At first I thought that the melody was beyond saving, but it's actually more like that the commonly used rendition is written in a way that it feels like the entire orchestra has woken up 5 minutes ago
Kde domov můj should be either modified to have a better tempo/stronger dynamics or replaced, because currently it is just the definition of sub-average mediocrity
Terrible, best Anthem have Russia
I don't really have a problem with the text but musically it's very boring and too slow
The melody is weirdly melancholic for a song that supposedly celebrates Czech lands
I suppose it sort of fits the peaceful nature of the text but still, it just makes me want to fall asleep
Just looking at our neighbors Slovak and Polish anthems have imo much nicer and more fitting melodies for an anthem
I think it's pretty slow and king of boring, like I get that it's sentimental and talks about how beautiful our land is but it's too slow
I feel like we could have a better anthem
Like, it is literally all about the nature
Nothing about us as a nation
I still kinda liked it when the slower and a bit sentimental Czech anthem was followed by the faster and triumphant Slovak one when Czechoslovakia was still a thing
I really like that we don't have a pompous military "march" like most other countries
We weren't historically a militaristic state, our current anthem represents our national character much better
I like the Finnish one for the same reason
Exactly it celebrates beauty of our nature
That's what I like too
More than fighting
Has to be brutal technical death metal at least though
Czech here, honestly, I'd rather a pompous militry march sometimes
Beuatiful nature is nice and all, but for someone who doesn´t know the lyrics, it's just yet another song some people in some country sing on occasions, and nothing's particularly interesting about it
Not really happy with it, but look at the anthem of the Soviet Union
That's a very proud song, even upon hearing for the first time and knowing no Russian
Ours
Not that much methinks
The only one that comes to my mind is Slovakia's "Nad Tatrou sa blýská"
It depends, usually there are 3 or 4 red and 1 or 2 green
3-6 usually green apples, golden delicious, Spartan, gala, jonagold
Edit: respective strain names may vary
Hmm, I've never really looked at that in detail bc I'm allergic to apples, but I'd guess around 5-10 at most supermarkets
I often shop at an online supermarket, and that one currently has 11 kinds
Or 8, if I don't count that some varieties are listed in 2 different sizes/packagings
The varieties are Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Idared, Red Chief, Pinova, Red Prince, and then some just labeled as "red" and "organic apples, mix".
3 usually, Red, green and knock off red Chinese apples that I am allergic to that cost twice the price both of the previous ones combined
[Půlitr] stolen from the pub
Multiple of them, not a single one is the same in one household
Pretty sure I can find this at my parents household or any aunt/grand but if you ask me when I was last time served hardboiled eggs cut by this we have to go to some new year celebration in mid nineties :)
That's so handy, I want one of those
I really want this
It's such a good idea, right next to a dryer
What's a flat toaster
[Like this
That’s so true
It sounds good, but I'm already fat, owning a deep fryer would probably kill me in a few weeks
Having to go outside to get fries is a self-preservation method, really
Be careful about that
You can buy one, but using it is strictly forbidden in most places if you're on the public sewerage system
"Ptakopysk" is literally "Birdsnout" in Czech and it means platypus
Aaaw thats sounds so cute
I remember that when I was learning German in school I refused to call phone "Handy" because it sounds ridiculous
Thanks my fellow neighbor
Here people call the mobile number "GSM" as well:
TEL 296 xxx xxx
GSM 733 xxx xxx
This is one of the things that bother me about English the most . In my language, there's a very elaborate set of rules of how and when to use commas between words or sentences and it takes a lot of efforts to master all of them
However, not only these rules are non-applicable in English but it sometimes seems like they're exact opposites
Poppy - how is it seen in your country
As source of opiates, or as a food
In Czech cuisine, black seeds of poppy are quite common - they are added to pies or sweet rolls for example
Used seeds contain minimal amount of active drug, they are safe to consume, and there is no way to get high with them
I’ve seen surprised people, who seen this for the first time, and they thought it’s like eating opium
How is it seen in your country
I once saw a very amusing Vice documentary, where they visited a bunch of junkies living in some bushes on the edge of Prague and watched them make "heroin" out of poppy seed, which they stole from a nearby field
At the end they took a sample of their product to a lab to find out how pure the heroin was and it turned out it was 0%.
I came here to say Czechia’s the world’s largest producer of poppy seed (despite its small size) and that I personally absolutely love it
You mean pure opium
Yummy

Well, they will understand "cucumber time" but probably slightly different
We have song ,,Holka modrooká" (Blue-eyed girl) which is first sang in original, then sang again but every vowel is A, then again but with E, then with I, O and U
It looks like this:
Holka modrooká nesedávej u potoka,
(Blue-eyed girl don't sit near brook(?),)
holka modrooká nesedávej tam
(blue-eyed girl don't sit there
V potoce se voda točí, podemele tvoje oči,
(The water spins in the brook, it'll grind your eyes,)
holka modrooká nesedávej tam
(blue-eyed girl don't sit there
Halka madraaká nasadávaj a pataka, ...
Helke medreeké nesedévej e peteke, ...
Hilki midriikí nisidívij i pitiki, ....
Holko modrookó nosodóvoj o potoko, ...
Hulku mudruuků nusudůvuj u putuku, ....
I fadely remember this
First elections in Czech republic after world war two
People felt betrayed be democracy and countries from west, so they voted communists
Well another Austrian or German guy would probably come and try to conquer half of Europe anyway, because of the situation Germamy found itself in
Gottwald got orders from Stalin to start civil war if necessary
I can’t decide between the liberation of Prague, February 1948, and 1968
Civil war would start anyway
And it would be more like Czechia vs Slovakia because KSČ had big support in Czechia but not in Slovakia
> Japan also has this archetypical character in the samurai
I think closer to the cowboy archetype for the Japanese would be rōnin
Anyway, we've got *zbojník* ("outlaw", "highwayman") who were often romanticised as someones who refused to live according the rules of the nobility, stole from the rich and gave to the poor, lived with the nature secluded from the society etc
[Here is one] on a period engraving from the 18th century
The best cultural example of this archetype would be Vilém the terrible lord of the woods from our most renown poem *Máj.* From historical persons, there are Slovak Jánošík or Ruthenian Nikola Šuhaj which are the most ingrained in our cultural awareness
Yesss Don Quixote
I remember that book from my literature class here in the Czech Republic
It was surprisingly pretty fun to read (:
Generally I am not aware of anything like that here in Czechia
There are some minor cases - I believe beer is not allowed to be the cheapest drink in restaurants, but maybe it"s not true
I believe increasing prices is extremely important especially in case of emergencies in order to prevent scarcity
For example our government capped the price of PCR tests
Inmediatelly many labs stopped testing
That's might be one of the reasons we have currently one of the lowest number of tests in Europe
The maximum price of COVID test is currently set by the government so no company can charge more
We have "Pricing Law". It has been applied recently due to human idiots that were selling respirator masks for huge amount of money in the beginning of pandemics
So they've applied this law and now these masks should cost maximum of 175 Kč (6,50 euro, made in EU) and 350 Kč (13 euro, made outside of EU)
Oh, they've introduced this law here as well, recently
Before that, beer was usually literally cheaper than a glass of (sparkling) water
You could have always asked for a glass of tap water, but the usual reaction of the waiter would be something like: "Sure, but why would you want water, if we have beer
Sounds like a bit of an overreaction
Those words actually come from a website, where they tried to map, where you can get tap water from the waiter without issues or something like that
I found that question funny more than anything else
Do you know the website
Would like to see that
I don't think it exists anymore (or at least not under the original name)
It was called Vodovoda, but I haven't able to google it anymore
Because of that conference, Prague had to wait for Russians to free us, even though Americans could arrive there several days earlier and spare countless civillian lives, that died, while fighting Germans
Also we were Soviet puppet for another 40 years or so, because of that conference, si there's also that
Luckily we were used to western allies selling our country to dictators, so it hurt only little
West sold us to USSR and thrown us into 40 years under Soviet communist dictatorship
Yeah, I know, most of the Germans were defeated by uprisings
In Prague, you can even find some plaques with names of fallen civilians, where they died
But there was also general Vlasov and Russian Liberation Army, who were fighting on German side (mostly they were captives or people, who disagreed with Stalin's regime), but after fall of Berlin, they also helped in fights against German soldiers
Of course they won ellections fair and square
I don't have problem with that, but after that, KSČ did what Mother Russia said
Things like political processes, refusal of Marshall plan and others
Thats all nice, except the fact that Gottwald pushed Beneš to the corner with threats of civil war and massive Soviet military intervention which would back the stalinized Communist party
Only Western help could have prevented the Soviet takeover
Beneš was too old and just gave up, but the Soviets would have taken control of Czechoslovakia anyway, just with force
By 1946 we were by all intents and purposes a vassal of the USSR, and unfortunately people knew nothing about it
They were mislead by the omnipresent communist propaganda and misinformation campaigns
*Almost* nobody voted for brutal Stalinism, purges and fake trials, class warfare, abolition of private property, censorship, violent collectivization etc
Well yes, but if they planned to liberate Prague, they would deffinetely take more troops
They initiated a coup backed by the red army to systematically dismantle democracy in the country
They won an election and then made all future elections invalid
They also murdered the prime minister so there's that
It was a militant power-grab backed by stalinist Soviet Union
If you replace KSČ with NSDAP, Czechia with Germany and 1946 with 133, you've described the Nazi takeover of Germany
Please do not attempt to spread this thinly veiled Communist propaganda
The KSČ, who had won only a plurality (around 1/3) in 1946, largely thanks to the optics of them having secured the official Liberation of Prague and therefore the country (and their propaganda machine which heavily tried to cover up and unload blame for all the very unpopular city aerial bombings they committed in the last days of the war to keep german soldiers for surrendering to the US instead of the USSR), occupied key ministerial and admin positions (ministry of justice, chief of police etc) and immediately (literally, work started in the summer of 1946, when the parliamentary elections were on May 26th) set out creating a new constitution, largely based on the Soviet one of 1936 that would dismantle democracy, enact widespread censorship, and remove judicial independence
The other parties in government, seeing what was going on, and informed of the Soviet support of popular militias int he Country, resigned en masse, hoping that this would force new elections as the government lost legitimacy
Instead, Gottwald occupied these now free positions, deployed the police to suppress revolts and arrest enemies based on Soviet orders and intelligence and pushed through the 1948 constitution, threatening Beneš with civil war if he refused
You are being wholly disingenuous by attempting to portray the KSČ as a sympathetic force, with the backing of a great many enthusiastic Czechs, only responding to attacks by hostile political opponents
Take this tankie bullshit and shove it where the sun doesn't shine
>grassroots worker militias
So grassroots now means with direct foreign government support, funding and intelligence
Don't make me laugh
KGB units were present during 1946-48 and they murdered or abducted multiple people opposing the communist party
>Where is the big difference
How about the fact that those were territories of an occupied enemy state that were under the administration of the US, whose laws applied there compared to an **ALLY** destabilizing, assassinating, and confiscating your country and resources explicitly for their gain
Though if you want to talk about more "big big crimes" lets exactly talk about why the 1949 West German constitution looks as it does and especially why the German coursts abolished the German Communist party: Lets talk about the other coups the Soviet Backed Communist party tried to enact in 1948 in Germany, or 1953 that let to its ban whose reasoning was exactly upheld by the Court of Human Rights on the basis of the Communist party's extreme hostility to freedom of speech, democracy through its support and propagation of totalitarianism
>Beneš tried to coup the government in 1948, the takeover by the KSČ was in some form a "counter-coup"
Excuse you
What coup attempt can you possibly be refering to, especially in 1948
Is it the parliamentary resolution concerning Security from Feb 13, that started the constitutional crisis
The one where the Communist party was purging the the StB to secure total control over it and the police forces
Or are you referring to the events in 1947, where the communists secured stripping Slovakia of its parliamentary representation, since they voted overwhelmingly democratic
Or was it the Krčmaň affair, where the Communist party in 1947 attempted to assassinate the non communist Minister of Justice, Deputy Prime Minister and, Foreign Minister
You know, where the Communist Minister of the Interior refused to investigate
Did this coup attempt happen before or after Moscow airlifted its NKVD agents in preparation for their coup into Prague on February 15th
>could turn into another Austria (which also had the Red Army on its soil and was not part of NATO but officially neutral
The exact reason why Austria had Soviet troop stationed there was because it was an occupied country, responsible for the 2nd World War
The whole reason why it is today neutral and not part of NATO was because they took advantage of the Soviet Union's instability after Stalin's death and negotiated the Soviet withdrawal for perpetual neutrality in 1955
Until then it had the same control structure as West and East Germany
Why would Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union's **ALLY** need to negotiate that
Do you not know anything about 20th century history
>just like trying to erase widespread support for the communists amongst specifically Czech workers (less Slovak workers)
Here are the lies again
The whole reason why the KSČ chose February 1948 to enact their coup was because they were desperately afraid of losing their coalition majority in the May elections of 1948
Already in Slovakia in 1946 a near supermajority (over 60%) of voters voted for the Democratic party
Thats why they did their best to keep the Democrats from taking their posts in Slovakia, through any emans necessary (harassment, illegal arrests through the StB, trying to associate them with the L'udova strana that was active during WW2)
The Communists, through their incredibly unpopular campaign in 1947 to enact collectivization, completely alienated the farmers in the country
Along witht he above mentioned scandals, they knew they would lose their plurality, so they expedited their plans for a coup-d'etat
>Seriously trying to compare the ČSSR to the Nazi occupation
Check your reading comprehension
I wasn't comparing the 3rd republic tot he Protectorate, I was comparing your propagandist language used to describe the NSDAP's rise in Germany in 1933
Do you think you know more about our history than we do
Do you want historical book recommendations
Do you want me to call some people who had their relatives deported to concentration camps by the NKVD
We could maybe arrenge a meeting
>\citation needed
[Here
] [You
] [go
There was literally a [scandal in 1947] which uncovered a [Moscow driven spy ring] trying to assasinate 3 non-communist Czechoslovak ministers and further sow discontent
Literally one google search away
You either have to be very ignorant of history to believe the NKVD and KGB did not take part in Czechoslovak affairs or willfully deceptive to assert otherwise
I believe that your brain is capable of searching the relevant sources by yourself
>nothing to do with the coup
Don't try to be moving goal-posts now, OP clearly stated the period "*KGB units were present during 1946-48*"
As for the February coup, [Moscow directly airlifted NKVD agents to help with the coup on February 15th, 1948
23 stayed at the Hotel Flora while another 16 at the Hotel Steiner]
>work of the Czech communist party
Who the hell do you think gave them the support and tools to enact these intrigues
Your ignorance and stupidity makes my blood boil
Why are you even trying to discuss about something you know nothing about
First you said there were no soviet agents, once presented with abundance of contrary evidence, you start arguing random semantics
I was literally replying to your full comment of:
>"KGB units were present during 1946-48"\citation needed])
which you then tried to discredit why effacing even KGB/NKVD presence as just unrelated StB actions
Regardless, when it came down to the coup itself Soviet deputy foreign minister Valerian Zorin *did* offer the support of the Red army, which was stationed on the Borders of the country
Gottwald only declined because, aside from not wanting the risk of being made redundant by an army commanded directly from Moscow, he was certain the political pressure, combined with the threat of civil war would be sufficient to force Beneš to concede
He was of course right
In fact the primary reason Beneš took a neutral position was exactly because he was afraid the red army would use any hostile action against the communist organized demonstrations as a pretense to invade to "restore order".
>Obviously the Russian secret services were in Czechoslovakia
No shit man, they were also
The important difference here is that the spies in France, the UK or US did not actively partake in a coup d'etat that establish a 40 year long totalitarian regime
In fact, wouldn't the fact that these 400 or so agents were explicitly sent to secure the coup, rather than intelligence gathering like the other countries, characterize their presence at least a bit differently than your blasé *"so what"*?
>It's not like they were in control of
And how do you think they were able to set up this control from before the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia
Its not like the agents of the USSR actively gathered information or arrested for the direct benefit of the nascent reestablished KSČ, its not like they literally made it impossible for Czechoslovak administrators to reestablish themselves in the liberated Czechoslovak territories
oh wait
That's exactly what they did
>instigate a coup
You're moving goal posts again
I didn't say instigate, I said help
And that is certainly what they did
We're all fully aware the KSČ caused the coup
Noone is arguing otherwise
What also cannot be argued that the USSR helped secure the coup with their agents
> blame outsiders for something that was actually done by Czechs
Czech(oslovak)s with the backing and orders from Moscow
And after the fact, these same people immediately immediately showed where they lay in the hierarchy and who was in charge
Castro also succeeded in his coup, but no-one is under illusions of how he got there and what his relationship to the USSR was afterwards
Actually making progress towards switching fully to renewable energy (like Austria, Sweden, etc
) would be nice
Instead of continuing to poison our air with obsolete coal powerplants and even giving them fucking _exceptions_ from emission limits just to sell a surplus of electricity for profit

Interesting
We've also this aspect
Sometimes we're too rebels, but usually it's very useful
We've one of the geratest eductions systems too
But the schools hard
Well I'm fine with using nuclear power too, that's already much better
Just no sacrificing our environment for the coal lobby
No, sorry but we don't... French protesting is on a whole different level
I meant the aspect that I would copy
I ment it for Czechs
But thanks
Maybe
We were always rebel nation
I know, French protest and revolution are the best, but I think, that our were great too
Question: How does it work
Here in Czech republic some people are planting trees "how they see it fit", but because they don't really understand this topic, they sometimes plant trees to  problematic areas
Because of  population density there is a lot's of gas and water pipes and power lines under ground and new planted trees roots can disrupt public utility networks if they aren't sanctioned by local authority
Im a part of a group partnered with the Charles University (biology) and we help saving and preserving our nature
I don't know if we have a single liquor that's the most typical, would that be Becherovka (a herbal bitter)
Fake "rum" made from potatoes
Slivovice (distilled plum spirit)
They all kinda taste just like ethanol to me
Here in Moravia, definitely slivovice (plum spirit)
If it's well made, it's not as hard as vodka, but fruity and smells wonderful, and you can drink it at room temperature without any strong "kick". Really hard to come by, though
You practically cannot buy the good ones in any store but have to "know a guy". Even then it's hit or miss, because everyone says theirs is great
Other notable variants include meruňkovice (from apricots) and the rare oskerušovice (from  [Sorbus\_domestica]
Slivovice is ours
It's basically a liquor made from plums (though it can be made from basically any other fruit) and tastes adequately
Is it like neighbouring countries do consider ouzo as their drink as well
I had ouzo in Bulgaria and thought its more like east Balkan drink
Zelená is a classic broke student choice
Licor 43 has very fond university memories attached to it
Great stuff
Is that similar to slivovice that we have
our is usually home made clear plum liquor around 50%.
Eeey hehe that sounds very familiar  what do they make it out of
For us traditionally it’s plum but pear, apple, and cherries are also popular
Ah, a man of culture
Yeah but that's probably not a Czech invention
Germans have Pfeffi, etc
good ol' fefrmincka
Cool, I didn't know it was that popular :D Maybe we should promote it more, tourists in Prague nowadays seem to be more into absinthe
I mostly associate Becherovka with being the drink of choice of our current president, TBH
Yeah, I know that one isn't *exclusive* to one country :)
Oh okay
Then I was cheated haha
You mean grass that European Bison use to eat I hope
That’s why there’s also hruškovice, etc
the slivo- part just denotes the fruit
I’m from the Walachia region and there plums are often referred to as slivky
I speak Czech (so basically all slavic languages), English (Pretty well I would say) And a bit of German And I have to say english is the easiest of them
Not really, but the prenounciation Is quite difficult to learn
It isn’t for people from Czech republic
But getting rid of the horrible Czech accent
That’s the hardest part
Easy to learn hard to master
Well i can speak it fluently, so i can't be that hard
But seriously
It's very easy, compared to the alternatives
The hardest part is spelling and even then
I can spell better in English than in Czech
And if you consider all the social media, films etc
, it's also very easy to practice
r/antiMLM would be pretty empty
Also stuff about army and being armywife would be probably nonexistent
"Can I get Czech citizenship if my great grandmother was born in Czechoslovakia
We won’t have questions like “what do you think of America/Americans” anymore
The ever-present Trump jokes
Nope, I'd use American spelling since I once came across `color` in CSS and I want to be consistent
Besides, from my point of view American spelling is less fucked up
And for example the change from _s_ to _z_ happened in Czech too
_Kolonizace_ is a modern word, while _kolonisace_ is archaic
In Austria
I wouldn't expect that
There isn't consensus that guns are bad
Where did you get that
Edit: Answer would be preferable
>they should just ban them
As far as I know there isn't single country where guns are banned
Japan and Romania come close, but it still isn't ban
In most of the European countries, the word used for "both continents" is just America (Amerika in German, Czech, etc
) and it is considered as one continent only
Which is quite different from "guns are bad".
I want to know where [kalliope\_k] got that there is consensus about guns being bad, which is nonsense
Edit: Apparently seeking information is offense
I am not obtuse, I am curious
I assume he meant exactly what he wrote and I ask where he got it
If it isn't what he meant, he can just tell me
Not anyone else
> I apologise
You have nothing to apologize for
Some other people do
> there are guns used and are (semi)legal in countries like Croatia (where I am from), Switzerland etc
Guns are legal in every country in Europe
As far as I know they are legal in every country in world
There are countries which have very strict regulation like Romania and Japan, but it still isn't ban
> I am pretty sure most of our countries would agree to ban/heavily restrict their usage
I know for certain that they wouldn't agree to ban their usage, because they didn't and aren't going to
These are the some names of GERMAN cities: Cáchy, Mohuč, Saská Kamenice, Chotěbuz, Drážďany, Cvikov, Budyšín, Brod nad Lesy, Svízel, Kouba, Ředvice, Řezno, Mnichov, Kostnice, Norimberk, Pasov
These are [Czech exonyms]
* Londýn
* Edinburk
Some Austrian cities too:
Štýrský Hradec, Vídeň, Solnohrad
This also extends generally to the HRE, even the old HRE cities outside of Germany are renamed
For example the Swiss city of St
Gallen become Svatý Havel, Zürich is Curych (though that is just a rewrite so i don't know if it counts), Genoa becomes Janov, or Saltzburg becomes Solnohrad (though I actually never heard anyone say it like that, but it still just means Salt castle)
Also (as was mentioned by the Slovaks in the thread already) Venice is Benátky and Copenhagen is also Kodaň in Czech
Also to disentangle some of the above names which I know:
Cáchy = Aachen
Mohuč = Mainz
Řezno = Regensburg
Kostnice = Constance/Konstanz
and Cáchy in Czech ['tsa:xi]
Yeah, these are easier ones
Kouba is Cham, not exactly the big city, and nowadays Czech people would name it Cham anyway, but the names look quite different
Yes
Not that different after all
Does your country have some kind of maps, that people use outside of Google maps/Bing maps
For instance, here in the Czech Republic people use [mapy
cz] which provides more detailed road infrastructure, outdoor map with hiking trails and winter map with ski routes; all of that available for other countries (mainly European)
Edit: Also, you might be familiar with mapy
cz layout if you use [windy
com] (both webs use the same map [made by the same guy/company])
Yes mapy
cz ;) Google maps look terrible, they are only good for driving or finding reviews on restaurants
Bonus fact: there are maps from 19
century if you want to see how Czech Republic looked like in the time of Franz Joseph
I love the fact topography is available for the whole world in [mapy
cz] one can use them for hiking in the middle of Africa or in Pamirs
Just anywhere
mapy
cz are the best online outdoor maps and that's a fact
I think they saved my life once, when I was lost in a fog on a mountan ridge in Iceland
Mapy
cz is great in CZ, for hiking and anything outdoor they can't be matched
mapy
cz provides all this data because it is based on the OpenStreetMap
Yeah, I also use them, but sometimes they have problems, mostly during car navigation
I like the fact that you have 60's aerial map
We have 19th century map made out of cartographic maps from that era, that's only historic map we have (if you'll not count all previous aerial maps form 2003 - 2018)
> this mapy
cz thing looks like it's based on OpenStreetMap
Because it is
As it takes the data from openstreetmap, it does work for the entire world
Alternatively, you can use any other OSM renderer, like osm
org
Because they are based on OSM, which is great outdoors
Google maps are so terrible for walking through Prague, I don't know how anybody can use it
You can check historical maps of Czech lands [here] or [here]
edit: [Here] as well
Oh, so you're from Gigabite
I thought England was a city
1 CZK  - a one or two screws or nuts or a shitty breadroll during sales
10 CZK - cheapest beer including bottle deposit
100 CZK - ten cheapest beers including bottle deposit, from this deposit you can buy additional three beers including deposit, and from deposit of these three you can buy one more beer but it is not enough for deposit so you have to drink it at the shop
so with good planning it could be 14 beers and some screws or nuts
1 crown
nothing
Not even a roll
5 rolls, some rip off candy bar or tatranka/horalka
100
few beers, 5 breads
I don't think you can buy anything with 1czk lol, 10 czk: maybe some small sweets, 100czk: probably like 2 bottles of beer, not sure tho
1 CZK could get you something cheap, like a lollipop, or something like that, but you would need to be lucky to find something which costs only 1
10 CZK can get you a croissant or 0,5 liters of juice
100 CZK would be for a wine or pizza
(I don't know the specific prices but it would be something along these lines)
5 breads
You can buy 2 and a half with a100 in this region

Cursive, that is mandatory
Then if you want you can write printed-like but nobody will teach you that
You can choose now
well, sort of
Most Czech schools still teach the same cursive we were taught
For some years now, some of the schools teach [Comenia Script] \- printed like letters, basically the kind of handwritting most people came to on their own anyway
They still teach how to read cursive too
Source: have a daughter on one of those schools
1st Printed-like, then cursive . Many of my friends write only Printed-like, but I kept cursive, but I write letters Q and G Printed-like cuz I forgot how are They written
Cursive first
We learn cursive only, though many people learn printed-like by themselves
EDIT: I'm not sure, if you can see it, but I'm from Czech republic
> Then if you want you can write printed-like but nobody will teach you that
But in high school, every math and physics teacher will expect you to be able to write it
Man, that was a royal PITA
> basically the kind of handwritting most people came to on their own anyway
I never quite understood how that happened
I noticed majority of my classmates writing in this style in high school, but ... like how do you just come up with your own writing style
I still write in cursive
I was never taught anything else (I wasn't formally taught to write print in the first place)
It never crossed my mind to change my style of writing like this
Teachers learn them but not *how to write them
* It's quite easy for kids after they read good amount of books
For me it was simple - in cursive, I wasn't able to write fast enough
So I simplifed the letters to the point, that most of my handwriting is basically a print with some cursive influence
I can write much faster that way AND can understand my own notes later

Yeah my schoolmate lost £40 there and was so pissed, but we all knew it was a scam
Avoid Euronet, Moneta and Česká spořitelna ATMs
The rest are fine and should let you withdraw without a fee
Just make sure you don't choose the DCC option, always get charged in Czech Crowns
The same applies to paying at POS terminals, also preferably pay contactlessly so that the terminal doesn't get chance to ask for DCC
I love octopuses and seafood in general
Too bad it's expensive and not common here
I think It's a shame we eat these super inteligent creatures
Most of them are smarter then the average user of Reddit :D
Since I have octopus phobia, not exactly appealing
Nah, I like Octopus
Anytime I go to some countries having fresh seafood, I get it, cause I live in landlocked country and good seafood here is expensive and rare :)
Sea food isn't my go-to but there are worse things to eat
I've had a fried tentacle once, wasn't bad
It's seafood so I'm fine with it
I don't know if I've ever had octopus that I loved but I have no problem eating it
Sounds gross to me
Maybe it's the landlockness of my country but the thought of eating most sea creatures sounds appalling to me
I can so-so tolerate shrimp but the idea of crabs, lobster, mussels etc and food makes my stomach turn
I hate that because I love food and this limits the things I can experience but I just can't get past it
yummy
Cephalopods are tasty, octopodes, calamares, cuttlefish
I had it in Spain multiple times
It's not something I would add to my menu for a regular meal but I liked it quite a bit and if I'm in the Mediterranean I always have it
I am the exact opposite
I hate almost everything seafood
I'm so glad it's not common here, at least one advantage of our landlocked country
I'm also affraid of heights but I don't chew on skyscrapers, do I.
I don't particularly seek out fish but I will eat it (especially on Christmas) no problems there
I can't tell you what the reasoning is, i guess fish are "normal" but the other animals just look creepy with their legs and tentacles and not having a skeleton
Skyscraper
Yes
Not a fan
People from Prague make fun of people from Brno because Prague is only city in Czechia with a subway
Moravstán, because no metro
Brno - a glorified village
Ostrava - jokes about pollution and how they speak polish-like gibberish
Vysočina - Alabama of Czech republic
Ostrava
They are swearing and don't speak proper czech
Basicaly Everything at anytime
But mostly Brno, Morava, Prague
Prague doesn't exist
Well I'm going to Creta in a few days
Wish me luck
Beer&porn, Czech biggest contributes to world
As a kid I idealized the US, but the more I learned about actual life of average Americans (not the filthy rich individuals shown in Hollywood movies/TV soaps), the less appealing it sounded
Right now I'd say there would have to be some kind of very serious pan-European crisis for me to consider moving over there
No, that would be quite downgrade
Most of my reasons are already written in this thread
Fried Cheese
Its pretty much on every menu of every pub,restaurant, even some shops sell it pre-fried
Depending on the region, in Bohemia mostly Beer and guláš, in Moravia mostly wine and anything that won't ruin the taste, and in Silesia mostly coal
I love Spanish cuisine more than most others
But for some reason churros with chocolate is something I find awful
It is so sweet it is like eating diabetes
Fried cheese is my choice when I dont know what to order in restaurant
Ah yes, fried cheese
I miss your cheeses and wines, counting the days with you
I think I only tried versions with sugar and Chocolate
But tbh other than that all Spanish food is comfort food
I especially liked the cuisine in the northwest of Spain
Germany: Německo ([land of] mutes)
Austria: Rakousko (after castle Ratgoz/Raabs that lied in that direction)
Hungary: Maďarsko (because of Magyars, but older name Uhry related to Hungary was also used
Btw, "uhry" also means "pimples" in Czech, but the etymology is unrelated)
Also, these two are often subject of mistakes when translating from English:
Latvia: Lotyšsko
Lithuania: Litva
Germany - Německo
Austria - Rakousko
Netherlands - Nizozemsko
Georgia - Gruzie
Denmark - Dánsko
Hungary - Maďarsko
Greece - Řecko
In the Czech language we use, for instance:
Austria - Rakousko,
Germany - Německo,
Greece - Řecko,
Lithuania - Litva,
Latvia - Lotyšsko
That's all, pretty much
Other countries' short names are more or less similar to their English/native language equivalent, despite of countries such as:
Suomi - Finsko,
Nippon - Japonsko,
Shqipëri - Albánie,
Hellas - Řecko
I would also add, even if it's not so different, but as interesting thing:
Iceland - Island in Czech
Which like that looks (with different pronunciation) like Czechs using English word (ostrov in Czech)  for Czech name of non-Czech and non-English country
Włochy -> Italy is a pretty big one too
Czechia
**Olaszország -** when you play Scrabble and you got a worst letters
Probably through Russian латышский (latyshskiy), except the "a" got switched for "o".
What is wrong with í,ý? Or ě,š,č,ř,ž,á,é,ó,ú,ů,ň,ť ? :D
“Máj” (May) by Karel Hynek Mácha
It’s a romantic poem, but it’s also tragic
It is highly regarded and most students will learn at least the first stanza
I would say ,,Máj" (May) and ,,Kytice" (Bouquet)
Kytice is collection of poems collected by Karel Jaromír Erben
I think the most famous of these is ,,Polednice" (The Noon Lady)
Máj is lyric-epic composition written by Karel Hynek Mácha
Máj is a peak of czech romantism and Mácha uses the whole beauty of the Czech language
This is first part of the first song:
Byl pozdní večer – první máj – (It was late evening – first may)
večerní máj – byl lásky čas
(evening may – it was time of love)
Hrdliččin zval ku lásce hlas, (Doves voice invited to love)
kde borový zaváněl háj. (where pine grove smelled(?))
O lásce šeptal tichý mech; (Quite moss whispered about love)
kvetoucí strom lhal lásky žel, (tree in blossom lied sorrow of love)
svou lásku slavík růži pěl, (nightingale sang his love to rose)
růžinu jevil vonný vzdech
(rose's (love) was appeared by fragrant sigh)
Everyone here knows the poem Máj (May) by Karel Hynek Mácha, but it isn't as widely known outside the czech republic as the examples OP listed
I'm not sure but I don't think there's any in Czechia
Rabits, rabits everywhere
Also you can find a lot of smaller deers outside in the middle of the field, but they are shy
Closest you can get is to hit it with a car on a road
Now we have roddent apocalypse on the fields, so many small mices are running around
They are in hundreds of thousands
If you go along road, you can see in field, every 40cm there is a hole to nest
They are everywhere
They are not plowing deep enough because it cost diesel - better to get subisidies and throw poison around
I live in Karlovy Vary which is 60000 people large spa city and we have wild boars everywhere
They come in large packs, mainly at night and early morning to city and eat whatever they can find
You can see mouflons waiting for a green light or wander in parks nearby place I was grown, coypu colonies in close to downtown part of Prague, boars near fields and pretty much every small animal, beech martens, badgers, foxes, squirrels, ground squirrels
The thing is Prague natural environment is very diverse, it has bit of this and bit of that, actually it would be a perfect place for natural park if there would not be a city already
>a dutch friend told me the national dish was fucking smashed potatoes with vegetables in it and a bit of salt
Isn't that similar to a Spanish tortilla
And onion
Yeah, maybe
But honestly, tortilla is usually quite bland too
Yeah, I know it can be really tasteful, it was usually when it looked like this:
But many times I have had it really bland, it was dry and full of eggs, like this one
Svatá říše římská (Holy Roman Empire)
The emperors are sometimes called "římskoněmecký císař" (Roman-German Emperor) to distinguish them from the Roman and German (1871-1918) emperors
Sure
We were part of it for eight centuries
Our favorite King Charles IV was also a Roman Emperor and he was not the only one
There was movement like this in 19th century
In that time, Czechs were living together with Germans for 7-8 centuries in one country, and languages were getting mixed
but then nationalism appeared
Language purists were partially successful: official language was reverted to early 1600s form (this is why official form may sound unnatural today), and radical proposals were abandoned
It was in 19th century and some of the words replacing loanwords stuck, some of them definitely not
We, Czechs, love making fun of what you did to your word for car
Something like:
"Hey, do you know how do you say 'hedgehog' in Polish
"No
How
"Kaktus pochodówy"
"Hey, do you know how do you say 'mother-in-law' in Polish
"No
How
"Baba Przębytećna"
Those are just classics
I suppose "kurva" is the oldest of them, also most useful
[gumáky] in Czech
Huh, didn't know you were making these jokes too lol
We use the squirrel one as a joke about Slovakia
Except a bit differently - drevokocúr.
It was from a comedy show back in last century, I think
rasa psa
I... I can say I expected the Spanish inquisition more than this
I don't get them mixed up, but its strange
The word "host".
In English, it means something like "the one who's serving".
In Czech, it means "the one who's *being* served"
That's the exact opposite
If you wanna say it in the "the one who's serving" way, you've gotta say "hostitel" or something completely different
Host in Czech means guest, so i get that mixed up quite often
Not anymore but for a long time I used the word "eventually" wrong, in Czech we have a word derived from that, "eventuálně", which means "possibly" so I used eventually to mean possibly
And even nowadays I have to stop and think when encountering large numbers in English, like billion or trillion etc
, we use them slightly differently:
- million = milión (the same)
- billion = miliarda
- trillion = bilión
- quadrillion = biliarda
- quintillion = trilión
- etc
As we say: "je (to) výjimka tvořící pravidlo"
It's used when there's an exception for a rule
It means: "(it) is a rule-making exception
Yeah, it means the same here
You can translate it to different things, tho
Makes, confirms, you could probably think of another word with really similar meaning :D
What you wrote isn't the same, and the set phrase actually is "výjimka potvrzuje/potvrzující pravidlo" (an exception confirms/confirming the rule) which is the same
Fun fact: výjimka (exception) itself is an exception, if it would be regular i'd be written as vyjímka
Bro, there really is not only one way to say it
That's why I said what the set phrase is
Of course, you can alter it
Fair enough :D
Saint Wenceslaus in Czechia
He was murdered by his brother Boleslaus assassins
He is seen as patron of Czech people
In reality because of his murder, Boleslaus said no to Germans and defeated them and released Bohemia of paying tributes
Not really
I think not much
I know just one
Only in my house, unfortunately
Not really, we just laugh at dumb americans doing that
Yes really
Climate change denialism is widespread
Oh sorry, you’re right but it’s only the climate change
I’ve never met an antivaxer or a flat earther here XD
Indicrectly, yes, in terms of the legacy of WWII
The war taught us two things:
* Expect your allies to throw you under the bus
This is less visible because after all, we do have alliances with other countries, but the sentiment is the driving force behind us putting our eggs in as many baskets as possible in terms of security and the main reason why the calls for us to cut our alliance with USA most likely won't be heard
* Being occupied by a hostile power and made subservient in your own country honestly sucks
That was further re-inforced in 1968 when Russians arrived
As a result, it's kinda ingrained in the Czech national consciousness to be extremely wary about foreign powers meddling here
This kind of pre-emptively defensive nationalism unfortunately gets misapplied to things like the EU as the knee-jerk emotional response to EU politics isn't "hey, a group we voluntarily joined as an active member is doing something", rather "great, how are the foreigners trying to fuck us now
Czechs and Slovaks finally started working together after WWII, apart from that probably nothing
I think that the first lesson should be rewritten as "Don't make impossible to enforce alliances and then expect them to work when times get rough". There was absolutely no way the alliance with France (and the Soviets too) was gonna work out and I doubt the interwar government and general staff weren't aware of this, at least with a scenario of Germany being the aggressor
Czechoslovakia made its stance to the very last second until the real bloodshed would come, which in a way is very noble, considering all neighbouring countries slowly eroded away into authoritatian or totalitarian regimes; and it's also true that the Munich conference was a stab in the back, but being realistic, the writing on the wall that Czechoslovakia was utterly fucked was there since at least 1934 when the two leading proponent diplomats for the Little Entente (and therefore the entirety of French security in Central Europe) were assasinated
I cringe extremely hard when I see "white people" generalisations and US racial politics in general, the ever so prevalent American view on ancestry and nationality which is driven by their mindset to be unique - e.g. claiming German, Czech, Polish, Italian etc
nationality based on one of their relatives 3 generations back being  an immigrant and so on
Despite me being acclimatised to American culture (so references and vagueness doesn't throw me off), I still find many American philosophies, such as aggressive judging of others' views or being blinded by their status quo (measurement systems, political systems etc
), really baffling
Also 16 year olds owning cars and driving around weirds me out
For subs I visit abundance of Americans doesn't matter
Yeah, especially when I come across discussion between military wives
sort of, there isn't a week I can't see something like 'it's called aluminum you silly', 'its truck not a car you idiot' and shits like that
+ when I subscribed to /r/atheism I was expecting reading shit from complete different countries than US
+ and one more point, a picture or video clearly not from US but there is always some comment like 'there is a lawsuit waiting' or OSHA
Yes but mostly on subreddits which deal about university or employment advice
Those things are very different in the USA, so most of the post there aren't really relevant for me
> While here sometimes I can go weeks without seeing anyone that isn't a South Slav
Did you explain that to her
> The Hawaii comparison is poor
He is true
You have better ask him, when US will return Florida to  Seminole nation
The whole United States territory was inhabited by now fully or almost exterminated nations
Hawaii was and independent state up to 1898, it was annexed
Réunion was  uninhabited  when Europeans discovered it
French colonised it and  imported Africans, Chinese and Indians, That US traveller had look at least in Wikipedia
&#x200B;
His sentence
> Your last sentence is an attack
is really perfect in the context of his texts
>is their relation with religion
I subscribed to /r/atheism expecting to read some weird shit from Saudi Arabia and other fundamentalist countries where non believing can bring you serious issues but instead I have really weird shit from the US like 'family is no longer talk to me, I was kicked out of job etc'
What did you say that it was perceived as speaking on behalf of all other cultures
I am trying to understand what their fucking problem is
/r/carseu exists for that reason but it is pretty dead
And honestly, the "American-style" atheism seems to me a lot like just another church, when I look at the subreddit for example, I paradoxically get a very religious or cultist vibe from it
I'm atheist myself (which isn't much surprising here) but I just can't relate to all those posts about finding plotholes in the Bible, sharing quotes of famous atheists, advice about how to avoid religious rituals or which phrases of religious origins not to use, or the general need to bash and debunk religion and "evanglise" other people to be atheist
You could just leave the overall sentiment of the posts and only change a few words and it will be like an ordinary religious subreddit
Upvoted for bravery, of admiting doing such crimes
> I am trying to understand what their fucking problem is
To discuss with a non-white US feminist ( especially graduated or studying at a University ) is a special type of entertainment for people who incline to mental masochism and like to study mentality of people who devoured Salomon's shit and their mental capacity is reduced to an absurd ideology
A special sort of them are lesbian radical feminists
Find their subreddits, but they split in various sects who mutually fight  and it is really not easy not write something what would cause immediate ban
Yeah, I'll add that sub on list of those which I shouldn't visit
It does a lot
I am way more extroverted and confident in English and I also feel like my social skills are better
Plumbers, electricians, gasmen, bricklayers and other tradesmen who do house repairs and installations are usually very well off
Sweep
It is one of the best payed jobs you don’t need special school for
**Prague:** history and architecture, tons of tourists, arrogant, expensive
**Brno:** rivalry with Prague, funny dialect, student city, dragon, being joked about a lot
**Ostrava:** industrial, short-voweled dialect, swearing a lot, unemployment, pollution, lots of Poles
**Pilsen:** beer capital of the country, being freed by Americans during WW2 instead of the Soviets
**Karlovy Vary:** spa town, lots of Russian and Arab tourists
**Ústí nad Labem:** poor, polluted, lots of gypsies, port
**Pardubice:** horse racing, decorated gingerbread
**Olomouc:** stinky cheese
**Liberec:** Ještěd tower
**Zlín:** shoe making, being called Gottwaldov during communist times (after the first communist president)
**Tábor:** Hussites
**Třeboň:** fish farming
Pilsen: pils Pilsner Urquell
Praha: Expensive, Capital, Full of tourists
Ústí nad Labem: Poor, Dirty, Industrial, Weird People
Ostrava: Ustí nad Labem but worse
Mladá Boleslav: A lot of Škodas, Pretty rich, Pretty much just a big Škoda factory
Stará Boleslav: Stará-what
Lovosice: Very long town (there's even a saying "Long as a Lovosice")
>Olomouc:
> stinky cheese
I'd say it's also known for being a student city, even more than Brno
Also really pretty
E-gaming
What's that all about
Lmao
Oh that's cool I never knew that, I've moved from Prague to Ostrava where I'll be staying for the next 15 months or so and then I'll be moving back so I'll definitely use this time to go explore Poland for a bit
So far it's been a really good time there
Definitely not
Thanks, that's great I'll definitely go see it
I think it will end in 10 years
Hopefully it will be stripped down back to only economic union
Nothing more nothing less
Fuck federalisation, fuck onespeed europe, fuck multispeed europe even more
And fuck eu shit legislative interfiering national interests
Vast majority of Gaul spoke vulgar Latin
In this case invaders got assimilated
I don't understand
Romans were very good at assimilating
My name Viktora is common mostly in south Czechia/Bohemia and mostly around cities Czech Budweiser and city Písek, but most people in cz probably never heard this name, also polish names are really common in Silesia and city Ostrava
[here] also this website shows every last name in cz a shows you how many of those people are there and where they live
No, not at all
You can't tell anything apart
We have a lot of generic Czech, German and other names and they don't put you in any area
I have a Germanic surname and English first name yet I am generic Czech
It's a mess
I was born in Czechoslovakia, I don't think there's a way back :)
I have lived in Czechoslovakia for few months
Would be cool to get back there i guess :)
Hey, out of curiosity, would you say that Norwegian people are similar to Czechs (in terms of how they behave)
Das ganze tschechische Volk ist eine Simulantenbande
Not a sentence, but a word "krankenwagen"
*Non te la dó*
An italian friend of mine said this to me but refused to tell me what it means
Googling didn’t really help, so I had to ask another (female) italian friend of mine
She was not expecting a question like this
Orewa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo - I like penis in Japanese
I wonder where does the second one is from, because it is known here in czechia as well
Maybe some movie or some long forgotten meme
On our high school, our class adored this sentence:
Ich koche meinen hund

Hundgoulash
Jaja sehr gut
> "Das mädchen essen die eier
Either isst or die Mädchen
The sound of wood cracking in fire
It reminds me of all those long summer evenings around bonfire, roasting sausages and singing
Damn, we still have one of those, in Prague in capital city, my classroom is among the last few in the school to have those
oh yes cabajka, that interesting hypnotising move of windscreen wipers, insane cold during winter, 30kmh uphill, holes in the rubber joint so you get water splash during rains, parties in night lines, I miss this piece of shit
I have the same memories about 700s series Karosa buses except the four part door
We have Kaufland aswell, but not Aldi for some reason
We have [HONEST GUIDE] It is mostly focused on Prague, but it is great
Honest Guide is the best channel for tourists about Czech Republic
Honest Guide
Very much recommend
It's more about the capital city, Prague but it's great
I love every part of these replies, thanks for asking u/Brainwheeze ! haha
[their channel]
> They really do a great job of promoting local commerce
Do you mean really great job promoting local commerce willing to pay and shitting on these don’t want to pay
All of them (with the exception of 2015-2019 they weren't that terrible), since nobody really cares about Eurovision (except me, but I'm weird AF)
First we need to find someone who knows what our country sent to Eurovision
This will not be easy
Post 2010 are from okay to suppa (except Kemama, papa bless cancelation of 2019
But pre 2010
Oof
No, we don't.
Maybe because majority of Czechs in WWI died fighting for "wrong" side
It's not common in the Czech Republic, but it started to be a thing few years back and now you can see sometimes someone with it
Really
Last time I saw a lot of people wearing it, at least in Prague
Edit: Or maybe because we celebrate the Veteran Day, not specifically related to WW1, but to all war victims
Well youre right but when you learn about this part of Czech history the schools will probably just tell you that Czechoslovakian legions were good and that they were "our" freedom fighters and that the Austrian Germans were terrible oppressors
Tbh the main difference I see that Austrians want to differentiate from Germans
Not that there is anything wrong with it, I just don’t see a huge difference
I’d compare it to US and Canada, Britain and Ireland or Czechia and Slovakia :)
Came here to share this, nice to see a fellow man of culture (or at least fan of Waltze's talks)
I also liked [this  video of him] where he talks also about Austrians (and death)
And less weird shit added to food in Austria
Schnitzel eaten with sauce like in Germany is scandalous
I like it, it just seems logical to me
Consistent with other country names (and our name in most other langauges - Tchéquie, Tschechien etc
), easier to remember
I didn't like when English speakers would shorten the name to just "Czech". And I kinda like annoying other Czechs by saying Czechia/Česko all the time, TBH
I prefer the name Czechia
It doesn't really make sense to always use the full name
Bohemia sounds nicer but then the Moravians and Silesians would be angry :/
I don't really mind
I also don't call Slovakia the Slovak Republic, so why not shorten it
We also call our country "Česko" in Czech most of the times
I know a lot of Czech people that absolutely hate it, but I like it personally
It goes well with Slovakia and it isn't so unnecessarily long
I think it makes no sense for English to not have a shortened version when it has one for almost any other country
Generally I don't really care what you call it
It was super fucking weird seeing all those Czechs being asspained about the "change", the most bizzare pearl-clutching I have seen, especially since in Czech we use the shortened Česko as much as Česká republika
Thankfully it seems like most have gotten over it
I like it, because it just makes writing quicker
However while speaking I use the long version more frequently
As a Czech I support "Czechia" 100%!
I have been using it for decades so yea, I am glad the government finally made it official
Too bad it took them 23 years to send a letter to the UN to do so
I don’t care
I use it all the time in English
Nobody cares irl outside of a few people on reddit
(“Political connotations”? Seriously
I personally don't mind it, but I found out that even people who know little to no English don't like it
A while ago, I was translating something for my parents' company as I'm the only person in the family who knows English
I remember that translating our country name was needed at some point
I wrote Czechia cause it's simpler
The moments my parents saw it, they got 'angry' (as in a joking, but actually offended deep down way) and told me to rewrite it
My dad knows no English and my mother only understands the basics, yet neother of them wanted to hear that word
Not a fan, got a little used to it so my eyes don't bleed as much but I still think that Czech republic sounds better
In czech we also to our country as 'the republic' most of the time
At least in my social circle
I don’t like using it because I’m worried someone (coughamericans) might confuse it with, say, Chechnya
Alas, there’s no better word encompassing all three regions of the country and Czech republic is a tad long
The best way to refer to the country is just "ČR" but that doesn't really work in English
Czechia is fine
Absolutely
There is no other alternative for a short name
Czech Republic is too long, too official, sounds sketchy, and is too tied to the current establishment (i.e. you cannot use it to refer to before 1918)
Czechia is short, has actually been used for centuries, and is politically neutral
I'm from Czech Republic an I prefer Czech because in Czech language we say Česko [tšesko]
or Česká republika [tšeska republika]
And I don't like how "Czechia" sounds It is like Slovakia
It's funny that we have the word "Česko", which we use in everyday conversations pretty much every time, but when we speak English, most of us prefers the "Czech Republic". Since pretty much no other country calls itself a republic explicitly (nobody says the Italian Republic, the French Republic, ...), it doesn't make any sense that we do, but I guess we are just used to the sound
In English I prefer saying Czech Republic, but I say Česko (Czechia) when speaking Czech
I personally dislike it
It is terrible, thanks for asking
For real, It was because the Czech Republic Sounded the same as Chechen Republic, or Chechnya
No, I don't like it
It just sounds weird
But maybe it's because of the language
In other languages, it may sound better
I just don’t like how English term sounds
“Czechia” sounds weird to me
It reminds me some banana republic (even though we are definitely one haha)
“Czechia” makes sense anyway, but just personally I like Czech term “Česko”.
When speaking English I usually just call it’s Czech, because in Czech (language) it is pronounced as Česko which and Česko sounds more like Czech then Czechia
I learned to accept the short version even though I don't particulary love it but what pisses me off is when people mispronounce it
It still sounds the same as Czech, you just ad - ia at the end
Some people decided the word changed though and pronounce it similar to Chechnya and that's just stupid
LOL
this made me laugh so hard my helmet almost fell off
I don't exactly like it as I find the sound of it somewhat *artificial* for lack of better words
Nevertheless, I've long moved past caring about it and use it regularly as it is more practical and at this point it's really pointless to oppose it
Thanks
Please don't forget to use the correct pronunciation "["Check-i-ea"] Some people read the "CH" part of the word as "ch", which is wrong
it should be pronounced as "k".
It totally is a matter of getting used to something "new" (this name is pretty old, actually)
You're comment is right on point
The short name is just logical, really
But we have to make sure to use the correct pronunciation: ["Check-i-ea"] Some English mates pronounce the "CH" part as "ch" although it should be "k"... such as in the word "architect".
Hopefully, it'll catch on
It's extremely tiring out having say "the Czech Republic" all the time, isn't it
By the way, the correct pronunciation is ["Check-i-ea"]
No offense to your parents, but they seem to be pretty Čecháček/SPD kind of people in this story
XD If I were you, I'd just stand my ground or tell them to learn English and do the whole translation themselves
Czechovia souds like Chechenia
In general, it's not an offense to use/don't use "Czechia" for us
But some people like myself actually don't fancy "the Czech Republic" a lot, so it puts a smile on my face whenever someone uses the short name, as long as they use the correct [pronunciation]
That's only a region of the country
Czechia is pronounced as ["Che-ki-ea"] roughly
Chechnya is pronounced as "Chech-ny-a".
I believe there's a noticeable difference
I think that would be unfair to Moravians and Silesians, since "Čechy" is our term for Bohemia
Well, "Čechy" means Bohemia
Bohemia "Čechy" is land in Czechia "Česko"
In Czech leanguage it sounds very simliar
In our leanguage it's "Česká repulika" (- means Czech republic) and "Česko" - (means Czechia)
Czechia is pronounced "Check-i-ea".
Chechnya is pronounced "Chech-ny-a".
I think there's a noticeable difference
I don't really know
Some people are very critical of the Czech term "Česko" because they feel like it erases the other historical regions of the country besides Bohemia (there are 3 - Čechy/Bohemia, Morava/Moravia, Slezsko/Czech-Silesia, and Česko sounds like it's derived only from Čechy), but some just really dislike the sound of the word
I think it's because we as a nation don't really like changes that much
We tend to be more conservative I guess
Also why most people want to keep CZK instead of EUR, even if they have no economical reasons
We're just used to it
Interesting
I study German and I was taught (by Czech and German professors alike) that Tschechien is a totally normal correct term, while Tschechei is the offensive one
Most Czechs with any knowledge of German make a really big difference between those words
Basically
A lot of people here just think it sounds bad in English as opposed to Czech
Nah, thank god, the universe or whatever they aren't that at all lol
My dad complains about the coalition daily,  they're on European market and some of their employees are from Ukraine and so on, they don't really care where are you from as long as you work
Most of the time they need German language tho, as they mainly export to three of our neighbors (the exception is Poland for some reason, dunno why) but sometimes Swedes order stuff, so that's where I come into play
Plus I get paid for doing occasional stuff for their company, so it's not like I do it for free
As for that, my mother attempted to learn, but there's only so much a course once a week can do
Dad is dyslexic and one language is apparently enough for him
> Čínská republika
That's ČLDR, my dude
That's not true
Czechia encompasses all the lands of the Czech nation
54% is Bohemia
Only in case you meet someone with the same opinion as mine, which may be not that common tbh
;-) In fact, most people here simply don't care about it
Ah, yes
Bohemia is very famous in games
But it still exist
But you do it when you say "Czech", why would that suddenly change
Isn't that Böhemen in German
Young people prefere "Česko", older say "Česká republika" and the oldest say Czechoslovakia
Both
But I prefere "Česko"
Well, say that K and after that I in english must be difficult for you
But we are used to it
Czech leanguage is hard to pronounciation, so when we say Czechia it's not too hard for us
I understand
Well, it's basically just putting -ia to Czech, so if everyone knows how to pronounce the adjective, the noun that is derived from it shouldn't be a problem, hopefully
:-) There're like 150 other English words where "ch" is pronounced as a "k" already
Yeah
As I said, I don't think it's super logical
The adjective Czech was just accepted as neutral long ago (the Czech republic, Czech langauge,...), but it is technically also identical with the adjective for "Bohemian".
Language can be wild
It kind of reminds me of the "Hyphen War" (a very serious debate over the spelling of Czechoslovakia vs
Czecho-Slovakia just before the separation)
But anyway, the anti-Czechia crowd was on the wrong side of history this time :D
Well, "Čechy" means Bohemia
Bohemia "Čechy" is land in Czechia "Česko"
In Czech leanguage it sounds very simliar
Ah, ok, that clears it up
And yeah, Czechs associate the word Tschechei strongly with Nazi occupation, but older people from West/South German-speaking areas sometimes just don't get what the problem is
I had a professor go on and on and on about how she much she argued about it with Austrians when she lived there in the 1990s, that was awkward
Sometimes I feel like Czechs are almost trying to foreigner-splain the German language to these people
I see
Well, there's like 150 other words in English where "ch" is pronounced as "K", so I guess people just have to add one more to their vocabulary
By the way, do you also read "Czech" with a "ch" sound
"Czechia" is basically nothing more than putting -ia to it
It's ok
There is a big confusion in that in our language
People sometimes say Bohemia, but they mean Czechia (sad Moravia and Silesia)
But the UK has the same problem
When someone says England, they mean all of the UK
Good points
I definitely think it's just a misunderstanding
This kind of constructed image of our past can be hard to get over
Czechs kind of love holding historical grudges and feeling victimized by others (Germans, Russians, Austrians, even the EU) even when a random person from that country has nothing to do with that
No, we say Česko (some people also say Čechy as for the whole republic, but it's just one of the historical countries (Bohemia) and it pisses Moravians and Silesians - pretty rightfully)
Only in written text and sometimes spoken we just use ČR.
Yeah, I know
Czechoslovakia is still way better known in the UK or US than the Czech Republic even though it doesn't exist for 27 years
Maybe if we just stuck with Czechia since 1993 already, more people would notice the change
I love the design of [Silesian] flag
Since we had only like 3 in our history if I know right
There's not much to choose from but I'd say I like the current one the most
[The one we copied from poland]
[The current one (we also had it before WW2)]
[The one we had when we were german protectorate during WW2 (now we have it as our tricolor)]
I just love the 1956 uprising flag
The hole in the middle is just such a strong symbol
The fleur de lys is such a nice symbol, why'd the state stop using it
> The one we copied from poland
I don't wanna go full patriot here, don't get me wrong, but the Bohemian flag wasn't copied from Poland
The Polish and the Bohemian flags are both derived from their Coats of Arms, a tradition that predates both countries
Poland: Yeah, you can copy my homework, just make it slightly different
Czechoslovakia: k, got u fam
\*slaps a blue triangle in the middle\*
Cool, thx for letting us know
I thought it's the flag of Teutonic Knights
In Czech, we use "žárlivost" for "jealousy" and "závist" for "envy". You could use the former when talking about something non-romantic, but not the other way around
Still, using "žárlivost" in a non-romantic context kind of gives the statement a bit of a subtle romantic undertone, in my opinion, so it can come out wrong in certain situations
But maybe that's just me
Crazy how we use almost the same words
How surprising
There’s us, who speak proper Czech, then there’re the other people in the other part of country, who don’t know how to speak Czech and then there’s Prague
I speak Russian for decades
I have Russian wife
I thought I have perfect command of the language
And then this guy comes
What the hell does he say
As a side note, in his speech vowel quantity and stress are *distinct properties*. But the only long vowel is /o/.
Hmm, I mean yes, but that union was called Austria-Hungary :P
I've launched the first video
Pure nonsense
In XXI century, Russians are still firmly in the prescriptivistic realm
IT seems to atract a lot of foreigners to work in Prague

We have kings on our money too
Our currency is literally named crown
Our currency literally means "crown".
Our head of state lives in a castle
Thousands of people stand in queue for hours to see our coronation jewels for few seconds
It was decided by few people in exile that Czechoslovakia would be a republic
Even after independent Czechoslovakia was declared, it was generally accepted that the new state would be a monarchy
We call them "Párky" (pairs), because, well, they come in pairs
Yeah, but unlike crown, the one the royals have, our crown has little to no value
Well we have more than kinds on our notes
Not all of them but we have Saint Wenceslas (who technically wasn’t a king) on the 20 Czech crown coin and on the 100 banknote is Charles’s the IV (or I) and in the past there were more of them
We had Přemysl Otakar I on 20 Czech crowns note but its no longer used
And also our money is called crowns so that's cool

We also have a party that ran for the elections to European Parlament named EuTroll, and its only purpose according to its founders was to make money and Troll the Eu
They were present in political debates with piecharts made out of pies and other crazy stuff
they received 37 046 votes, that is 1,56 %.
In CZ there is a party called pirates
Argentina, it is big but eehh
Never heard of it, lol
It’s possible but honestly most of the times I ride a train it’s quiet
Pilsen is pretty great
A lot of things to see there as a tourist, and it feels great to live there
The worst thing about Pilsen is their famous beer, it is mediocre, dull and incredibly overpriced brand
Český Krumlov
Definitely
Even more now without the international tourists
I like English memes more, but sometimes we produce something worth nose exhaling
On Reddit
Kinda decent
Everywhere else
Last time I checked Instagram they were still using rage comics

Private Facebook groups are the shit you want to look into
I unsubscribed from virtually all default subreddits
Back when I browsed /r/all from time to time, I had filters setup
Good half of them are just sport team subreddits
I'm pretty sure almost all are American football too
And another third is Trump/Sanders subs
I know I had RES literally blocking every mention of Trump during the height of the elections, but I guess I got rid of it eventually
The rest are random games, porn and hobby subreddits I had no interest in
Some bigger American events creep in from my subscribed subs from time to time, but only to tolerable degree
Yeah once certain subs get too big, the mods lose control of it and that's good bye to relevant content
Prague field trip
1 hour + to my school, then 3 hours to Prague, then almost all the mayor sights and attractions, 2 dispersals and back home, all in 1 day
Needless to say that I had trouble getting up the second day
We had a subject called 'rodinná výchova' which in english would be something like family education, where we were sopussed to also have sexual education, but the teachers usually don't do it anyway because they feel too akward
Same  for biology
We didn't have sex ed, my parents told me nothing and tbh i did learn these things mostly from my gf
I think we did some basics in biology class (my guess would be it was between 6th and 8th year of elementary school)
But really, just the absolute basics
Otherwise same, we didn't really have any
I feel like most people figured it out themselves
I know that my sister had a talk with my mother about using tampons and basic protection and such, but I (a guy) never had either of the parents talk to me about it (and it wasn't really necessary)
Norodom Sihamoni, the current King of Cambodia, spent most of his childhood and youth in Prague, where he studied music and classical dance
He is the only Czech-speaking monarch today
We have a notable Vietnamese minority thanks to cooperation during communism
Many groceries are run by Vietnamese (a sort of "typical" Czech-Vietnamese job, but certainly not the only one) and foods like pho are beginning to be widely known
Having such an Asian minority might not appear unusual for European countries with former colonial empires, but Czech republic is a landlocked, non-colonial and ethnically mostly homogenous country
Thank you for this, I and my friends have wanted to go to Kotipizza for quite some time and one of them is Italian
They will love it
And soon, Austria will be no more
Only Bratislava
Before the WW1, Bratislava had tram line to Vienna:
In German it's called "Lokalbahn", but in Slovak it's "električka", ie "tram".
I wouldn't say Pho is beginning to be known, I think it's already an established staple in the food industry here, same like pizza
In Teplice, where I live, there are about 25 vietnamese restaurants, that's probably even more than Czech-cuisine restaurants we have here
We also have a great relations with Israel since their creation after ww2
We voted for their creation, gave them weapons, were amongst the first countries to recognise Israel
We have been called as their "closest ally in Europe" by their prime minister
Czech republic has repeatedly voted in favor of Israel in the UN on several topics (for example we voted against upgrading the status of Palestine to a non-member observer state)
We also have one of the lowest levels of anti semitism in Europe
Here are also some examples from wikipedia:
"In December 2015 the Czech Parliament refused to implement European Union guidelines to label Israeli products originating from the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights
Czech lawmakers described the rules as anti-Semitic, and discrimination against "the only democracy in the Middle East". Israel's ambassador Gary Koren thanked the parliament for its decision
In October 2016 Czech Parliament passed a motion condemning a UNESCO resolution on Palestine which omitted reference to the Jewish heritage of the Western Wall and other historical sites in Jerusalem, with deputies accusing UNESCO of antisemitism and describing the resolution as "hateful" during the parliamentary discussion
Ofir Akunis, Israeli Minister of Science, Technology and Space, thanked the Czech Parliament and the country, describing it as a "heroic act" and reaffirming the close relationship between the countries
"On 22 October 2019, the Chamber of Deputies passed a non-binding resolution condemn[ing] all activities and statements by groups calling for a boycott of the State of Israel, its goods, services or citizens
I feel like not many people know/talk about this amazing friendship
And their food is delicious
Not sure about that, but it certainly rings a bell
Slovaks buying property on the Austrian side: totally legal
Bratislava public transport going to the other side: totally legal, might need some cooperation with the Austrian authorities
Yes, we've got this thing called the Council for National Minorities that represents interests of currently fourteen national minorities, that were recognised to be culturally, demographically or historically significant for Czechia
The Vietnamese joined the council in 2013
This gives them among other things a right to communicate with the authorities in their native language (with translators and interpreters being provided)
Of course, Slovakia is not annexing Austrian territory; legally it remains Austria and Austrian laws and taxes apply
For all practical purposes, aglomeration might outgrow the national border
... badly, as it's "einen Apfel" (accusative here)
I'm half Czech, quarter Slovak and Romanian
I've been born and raised in Czechia so I identify as Czech but I acknowledge the Slovak and Romanian sides too as we have quite a big family in Slovakia and we used to visit them for many years
I don't really know about family from Romania except for my grandfathers brother who we found on Facebook
As for languages, I can understand Slovak and speak a bit and I tried to learn at least some basic phrases in Romanian when I was younger
My father is Russian but I don't feel any attachment to the country, especially given the current political situation
I understand Russian a bit but don't speak it
I am half Czech and half Greek
I consider myself a Czech citizen but ethnically Greek
I do speak both languages (although my Greek is getting a bit rusty)
Half of my family lives in Greece including my half-sister so yeah, I do feel a certain connection to it
Starting 30 years war would probably count
1/3rd of central european population dead
Bohemian domestic dispute over catholics closing a few protestant churches boiled over to the Third defenestration of Prague, war against the king, and eventually, the Thirty Years War

Do you like names of cities or town in your country
(in your country's language and English)
I really like names of cities in Czechia
For example:
Prague ("Praha" in Czech)
Brno
Ostrava
Pilsen ("Plzeň" in Czech)
Budweis ("České Budějovice" in Czech)
Carlsbad ("Karlovy Vary" in Czech)
Liberec
(Especially the name "Liberec" sounds like liberty)
Do you like names of cities or towns in your country (in your country's language) and do you like it in English
I really like the german cities' names
Berlin, Leipzig, Hanover sounds cool
How could you forget the real prides of Czechia
Pičín, Řitka, Kozodírky, so beautiful names
They're interesting names
Irish names of places always sound for me like some names in the Lord of the Rings
And one interesting fact:
We have also some Celtic names of places
For example:
Elbe - (the biggest river in Czechia) was named by Celts (it sounds like "Alba")
Yeah, but I meant if you like the names or not, or if you would change their name (in your native language and English too)
LOL
If you like it
But I must say, they have its beauty
Jizera for example have Celtic origin too
I hope I won’t offend anyone but it has to be either Silesia or Vysočina
Probably somewhere along the german borded
I wonder whyyy
looking at you Germany
The entire country except Praha
Vysočina used to be our largest inner periphery before D1 was built and Jeseníky mountains in Silesia were one of the toughest regions to live in, but nowadays it's actually Manětínsko that has the lowest population density, little tourism and it also lacks any noteworthy economic/industrial centre around
That one is a proper hinterland nowadays
Edit: I think most of the Czech wouldn't even be able to point it on the map
And no, it's not even close to borders
Nah, Brno
You are right, I have no idea where some Manětínsko is
it's a shame Manětínsko gets so little tourist attention, it's a beautiful area
Oh, thanks for the info
Looked up Manětín and it's actually a nice looking little town
By all means, suit yourself
Younger people go to bigger cities to study or work, while older people either stay or get tired of the city hustle and move to a nicer house in the countryside
Young people move to the cities while families move out of the cities to the Czech version of “suburbs“ aka villages v close to the big cities
Most cities don’t grow at all nowadays
I noticed the same trend in the Czech Republic
People do move to cities
Real population of Prague is about 1
55 million and it's fast growing, although surpassing 1
4 was originally expected in 2030
I think you'll get there
More and more Lithuanians are now coming back from their work abroad and as Lithuania gets richer and people have more money to buy houses, this trend will appear in Lithuania, too, I think
Tbh, I'm not really sure what rugby is, so probably not a lot
It's only marginally popular, but in my district specifically it is a fairly common sport for children
I'm living in one of the smallest distrcits in Prague and we don't even have a football pitch, but for some reason we have one for rugby, so local kids tend to join the club
Some people are playing it, but it isn't popular or really known
Didn't even know it was a sport until I saw it on the internet
Apparently we have some 40 clubs, compared to like thousands of soccer clubs
Surprising to me it's more popular than lacrosse; we did lacrosse in school (heck, we did tchoukball) but we never did rugby
Hockey and football trade blows depending on national teams' performance, tennis is probably third
I don't remember any sudden surge of rugby popularity, but if we achieve some success, the media can easily elevate any sport from obscurity, so perhaps one day
Rugby is not some alien sport here though
Major events get some media coverage and we even played it in school, even if not often
It is possible
I've seen some rugby matches on sport channels, but only sometimes
We don't have to if the milk is tetra pack (of course we do once the milk is opened) and many people, if they have some, put it in the pantry with no special cooling
I don't have any place in my tiny apartment, so it's the fridge
But it's not necessary
Eggs yes, some can be sold unrefrigerated, but I don't know anyone who'd put them on the counter at home
My parents sometimes keep theirs in the basement, they buy them directly at a farm and sometimes they get too many at once to fit in the fridge
Otherwise the fridge just seems more convenient and keeps them fresh for longer
Fresh vs
UHT milk is up to personal preference, but I'd say that most people probably have it in the fridge too, unless they buy milk cartons in bulk or something
You're gonna put it in the fridge once it's open anyway, so why keep 2 different spots dedicated to it
ETA: safe storage temperatures should be listed on the packaging
"Unrefrigerated" eggs here say between 5 and 18 degrees, but recommend a steady cold temperature after purchasing
18 is on the low end of "room temperature", so probably not a good idea to leave them out if you don't have a chilly pantry or basement
Only during hot summer for eggs
(Or we got more eggs than we need but try to say no to relatives)
Rest of unused milk can go to fridge but that’s quite rare in our household
Both are better to use at room temperature anyway
Probably people who don't actually use it as a drink
I only ever bought milk for baking or porridge, before switching to "oat beverage". Plain "real" milk always tasted gross to me, especially full fat
It's not common practice
But it's almost never an issue if you ask
It's perfectly normal
Frankly I think anyone that "frowns upon this" is a wasteful fu***ss
I paid for the whole meal so I'm gonna take the whole meal
I hope they are not cooked bone, those could kill your dog like nothing
We use QWERTZ (I swear I read some piece about the elf Qwert Zuiop living around the keyboard but I can't find it anywhere, perhaps it was something for typing lessons in highschool) with +ěščřžýáíé on the 1-0 buttons, some other symbols including German umlaut are in the right part
QWERTZ with ě š č ř ž ý á í é instead of numbers (you need to presss Shift key for numbers)
I changed it to QWERTY on my computer, as it feels more natural
I don't know why somebody decided to switch Y and Z - Y is much more common in Czech, so it is better to have in the middle of keyboard
QWERTY + composite input, so I can write all the characters I need
Standard czech layout is seriously fucked, and even if it weren't I still need letters not present there from time to time
It's worth noting that a lot of people use QWERTY too, but QWERTZ is the "default" option
Oh, that's it
I had to confuse him with fornit
Yes, I use Czech QWERTY so I get to keep the special characters and don't have to switch my brain to QWERTZ and back all the time
There are AZERTY keyboards at my workplace in Brussels (stands to reason as it's Belgium) and I don't actually need to use them very often and typically use a different one every time
As it's pretty international, there are always at least five different layouts to switch to, presumably installed by angry Greeks/Romanians/Austrians/whoever who just couldn't deal with that stuff
Always gives me a little chuckle imagining that frustrated person saying fuck it, where's my normal keyboard
> Even night clubs had these insane queues where you sometimes had to wait between 15-90 (!) minutes to get in, even when it was -15° outside
but what is the purpose of this queue
I understand supermarket one or bus one as you have to wait till clerk or bus driver serve the customers in front of you but in a pub
I asked my Irish friend about this recently and he said they vacuumed the house every day back in Ireland
Here it's once a week and even then then floor is still much cleaner than what he had in Ireland
Apparently it's just something you don't notice unless you live in it for a while
>we can't really use ceramic or other hard material, as they would get frozen and crack in the winter
together with this
> is very rare to have a house stay uninhabited through winter
made me think you don't have any kind of heating in kitchens in Finland :)
The pub my grandpa frequents does this with smoking
When you enter, they give you a membership card and you can smoke
Same in Czechia -- they not only put the ribbons, but also blocked goods in the cash desk systems, so one can't buy them even at the automatic checkout machine
Someone on r/czech told he had to stole a pen, because stationeries are closed and supermarkets are not allowed to sell them either
It has been for us for decades haha
Tell me about it
I got existential despair from just reading that sentence

Our boomers loved tanning
Now people finally got the memo that both the Sun and tanning beds give you cancer, or worse, make your skin age, so the only young people with a tan are gonna be Instagram models with a regular self-tanner regime
Making fun of pasty people's paperwhite legs is so early 2000s...
Even though we are a small country, there’s quite a lot of dialects
But the most distinctive ones are Moravian and Silesian
These are divided into other dialects (depending on area)
I personally love hearing different dialects and learning the different words they use
But yeah, people (especially the ones living in Bohemia) make fun of them
(I couldn’t find a map of dialects in English for the whole country, so here’s Moravia at least -
This
Omg :D
Nobody cares
Unless you seat yourself to a 6 chair table, while smaller tables are available, then you might get some looks
But it obviously depends on time and restaurant
I can't imagine a situation when the number of people would make difference
They offer food, you came to eat that food, what's wrong with it
I can imagine situations when your outfit may cause problems, or your behaviour, or level of your alcohol intoxication, but the number of people you're with
Then feed THEM two main meals and dessert
Now there are two of you
*Edit:* u/KahootGer3, you have commited crimes against r/AskEurope *and her people by completely rewriting your comment in this thread
What say you in your defence
Then I put on my sunglasses and slowly walk away as the basement explodes behind me
Something to the effect of adding them into one's collection in their basement
Nope
Very, very illegal
in Czechia we don't have
where are you from if you don't mind asking
Yo what the fuck
There's 14 in Czechia
Finish sites are kind of: Hey, we need something in Finland, do you have anything
I love Finland but in country where everything used to be made of wood, not much can withstand
For example Suomenlinna castle is beautiful but you can find dozens of similar castles in Czechia
But Finish nature is awsome and you can have some untouched places, unlike middle europe where you will find village every 5km
Yeah, I meant Savonlinna, sorry :) We dont have any naval fortress in Czechia
The only thing I can sort of think is how to serve [dill sauce]
There appears to be lot of differences how people make it
Or rather what they server it with
What I'm used to is [dumpling and hard boiled egg] But then there are weird people who server it [with meat] Not my cup of tea, but I can understand wanting meat
But even worse, there are monsters who server it [with potatoes] Absolute blasphemy
Good portion of the population doesn't partake in the discussion, because they think dill sauce is inedible
Christmas potato salad with or without mayo is probably the biggest one
Also ["knedlíky vs
noky"] but the movie's the first I've heard of it
There was also a controversy over calling potato/sugarbeet alcohol with rum aroma "rum", and a lower-fat spread "pomazánkové máslo", but both of these have been resolved, though some folks are still a bit butthurt over it
> Cheesecake with raisins
I'm sorry, what the fuck
o.O
My Russian wife is in team kvas, so there am I.
I’d say that a more popular discussion is whether it’s better to eat a schnitzel for Christmas or if it’s better to eat a carp
>  What I'm used to is dumpling and hard boiled egg
But then there are weird people who server it with meat
Let me be an arbiter
Both are shit
>  But even worse, there are monsters who server it with potatoes
Oh jeez
Potato salad without mayo is heresy
Who the fuck wouldn’t put mayo in their potato salad
Hmm, I guess
Never really had that argument as we always make both and I hate eating ~~mud~~ *carp*.
Salmon
It's a fish, so tradition stands, but unlike carp it's tasty
Traditionally, fish aren't very prevalent in our quisine, like in most landlocked nations
Except for (awful) carp we make for Christmas
Also the way we do dill sauce may be a bit different to how you make it
It's a bit hard to imagine with a fish, but it's interesting idea
At the very least it's not straight up off-putting to me like eating it with potatoes, haha
What sort of fish would you recommend
It's not really dilly
It's quite thick sauce because of the flour
I remember being served this abomination in Austria
No mayo, nothing but cold potatoes, vinegar and oil
WTF is this
[This] is the kind I'm talking about
No clue if it has any specific name
I feel like i’m the only person who actually likes carp
Come on I think that carp tastes really good
But hey everyone has a different taste
Vice versa
Taliban means "students", talib is a student in Farsi (EDIT: arabic loanword)
But Spaniards do use this word versatile
Grammar nazi in Spanish is "talibán ortográfico".
I think Bohemia is much cooler than Czechia
It is a denomination for one of the 3 traditional parts of today's Czechia (but actually accounting for ~ 60% of the total area) but historically we were known as the Kingdom of Bohemia anyway
The English word Czechia just looks wrong and weird - especially the "cz" part is unnatural, these two letters never occur next to each other in our language
I think the English spelling is borrowed from the Polish language, but still
If I had to, I'd change it back to Bohemia
It seems easier to spell than Czechia
Czechia to Checkia/Chekhia and the Czech Republic to the Check Republic/the Chekh Republic
Now it looks like Polish, not Czech or English
"Check" would look like English and "Chekh" would sound like Czech
To be honest, "Croatia" have always sound more like "Korea" to me for some reason
Definitely wouldn't connect it with our "Chorvatsko".
I love how the Slavic, English and German names sound nothing alike
I swear every other country is at least a bit similar, but not Germany for some reason
It's the old Czech spelling, not Polish
We couldn't quite decide whether to use "cz" or "č" until the 19th century when "č" finally prevailed
>traditional parts
You mean LANDS
And what about Moravia and Silesia
I know right
Hahaha, check this out, i see, very funny, never heard of it before
And what about Moravia and Silesia
We should rename to ,,Lands of the Czech Crown"
Hold up Czechia is the Beerland
Well, yes
Bohemia sounds more cool
But it's only one land in Czechia
It sounds cute
Wiki disagrees though: "The current English name comes from the Polish ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech
[22][23][24]"
What about United Republic of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia
We could be the republic alternative to the UK - the UR
Although it doesn't have the same ring to it
If you're asking about why they shortened the name, probably because it's shorter
I tried to google the origin of the name, but didnt really find anything, but I assume it's after 'praotec (grandfader basically) čech'. He's the legendary founder of our lands basically
He probably never existed, but there's a period of around 150 years in Czech history of which we have no records, so there are famous legends (Staré pověsti české) set in that period, which includes this legend amongst others
In Czechia we call it Německo
Ahem
I'm here
While we're at it, let's get rid of the president and get a cool king
They've got it wrong but the sources claiming so are credible enough that they are unwilling to change it
Or so I've heard
We would be the URBuMS
Not sure I would want to be called that
Dunno about silesia but I'm Moravian and pretty sure people here would be lol
According to wiki, the word root of -Čech is the same as the root -čel meaning people (člověk in modern Czech)
So we're basically "the people"
*TV documentary*
The Bohemia is the only country in the world, where they vote freely for their own king
Great idea, but not the Habsburgs, I suggest someone from Poděbrady
There is much more then Pilsner fee example Radegast or Budvar are completely different
Well, yes
But don't forget to other lands in Czechia
It's like, we were Spain call Castile
Okay why didn't I find that lol
Kinda boring but makes sense
Well we don't want them to flee when things don't go as imagined really
They aren't only historical
They still exist
I know
But it makes that feeling
I mean Japanese names sound nice,but it would be very weird if a kid was called Takumi Novotný.
I really like the name Artyom, which is from Russia, so the kid would get weird looks here in Czech republic
Jason and Timothy
I like Robins but their names don't really fit :/ Richard is the only one that works (friend got dibs on that), Damian is OK but bit strange
Only got girl so far tho :D
Johannes, Wilhelm and Friedrich
Thats
stupid lol
I like those names tho
Agreed, also Johannes is really nice
And Hermann
For Misha: you dont have a "Michaela" in Russian
Female form of Michael, that can be called Misha
Laszlo is a very gypsy name
Funilly enough, i know a Baasha and she is Polish
Really
I know a lot of russians who live in Czech Republic, that have no problems
Also, when we were in poland with my school, one of my classmates - a russian, had no problems and even spoke russian to older people who didnt know english
To be honest, I have no problem pronoucning Zbigniew or Zdislaw, but Arkadisz is harder
And he would need to live in Prague, since metro is only there
Don't
I have a classmate who moved from Russia to Czech Republic, his name is Vitaliy, why the hell would you put "iy" at the end of the name
Cool
Thought most Polish names have Czech equivalents, this one doesnt
I see a lot of Levi's t-shirts And sweatshirts here
I have some too
*former eastern bloc here
Actually, after the revolution and throughout the 90s it was super popular to wear huge logos of western brands cause it had been forbidden fruit until then
>I try to avoid them since I'm not a billboard and don't see why I should even pay more to be one
I like this
I think I'm in danger of over-idealising Austria
To me it seems like Czechia but better in every way
I really hope to go to Vienna on Erasmus
Same here
Couldnt believe what I saw on TV
>tons of Swedes believe Sweden is the best country in the world and the Swedish way is the best, and they're not hesitant about pointing it out
Danes have the exact same
I love living here, but a hint of the slightest criticism instantly makes them super defensive
It's not uncommon to have people suddenly question you over whether it's better where you're from or why you live here in the first place
I think it's a Scandinavian thing
That sounds so awful
First of, you can look up [patronymics] \- these occur in many European languages
All of **O**'Neill, **Mac**Donald, Fergus**son**, Pér**ez**, Ivan**ov**, Ivan**ovic**, Kardash**ian**, Juga**shvili,** Papa**dópoulos,** Petr**escu,** Nikola**yevich**, and many others, refer to "sons (or children) of". This should cover a large part of European surnames
Not the nation you mentioned, maybe still worth a bit: thing to bear in mind in Czech surnames: they differ for men and for women
As a rule of thumb, women's surname will end with -ová; ie
Novák and Mrs
Nováková. If the man's surname ends with a vowel, it is usually omitted: Mr
Svoboda and Mrs
Svobodová.
It occurs both at birth (Mr
Novák's daughter will be Nováková) and at marriage (Mr
Novák's spouse will also become Nováková)
There are couple of exeptions like Janů or Petrů when the surname is the same for both genders, and if women marries a foreigner, she can keep his surname without -ová. Ie
Mrs
Smith will remain Smith and not Smithová.
For naming characters - it's as easy as pulling up a [list of Polish surnames] and picking one
It'd be a much safer method than trying to devise your own surname based on some rules you can only guess at
Not sure if Kowalski is proper Polish surname, but it definitely looks Polish to me
Same name could be possible in Czech, but it would be spelled differently, as "Kovalský". Czech uses "v" but Polish uses "w", and the rules for using i/y are different
We have male and female surnames here
We have for example: Novák (male) and Nováková (female)
The female surname is usually done by adding "ová", but it can have some exceptions like for example:
Novotný (male) and Novotná (female)
They all have some weird grammar rules here, but you begin to understand those rules some time around adulthood
We are tackling the language barrier a little bit here
Meaning of "Kowalski" could be translated as "the smith". Keeping in mind that smith is a profession it could be expanded as "of profession of smith". OPs idea behind "of" may be right
Yes and this good to bear in mind for most Slavic surnames
In the Balkans, they often end with -ić for both men and women, but for the rest of the Slavic (and Baltic, excluding Estonia) countries this applies
Thanks, I'll fix it
So Wodehouses's "Psmith" was not as random as it seems
That would be same in Czech: _Novákova_ and _Novákův_.
I only find it a bit sad that we often shift to English for convenience with related nations too quickly rather than putting in a bit more effort to understand each other
Especially when it comes to Polish which is not fully mutually intelligible with Czech as Slovak is but still relatively well understandable when both sides speak slowly in simpler sentences
For example my grandpa back in the days was a penpal with a Polish guy (they were both collectors)
They wrote to each other about their shared hobby, then they invited their families over to visit their respective countries, spent holidays together etc
, all while speaking or writing in their native tongues
Sometimes there were misunderstandings, sometimes they needed to repeat themselves slower or explain certain expressions but it was possible and it offered them a unique insight to each others' culture and their relatedness
*Nauč se česky, paznehte

Je to tak
Občas vidím na Internetu polštinu a je mi trochu divné odpovídat anglicky, když tomu rozumím.
**edit:** btw [dobrý kanál na Youtube] Polák mluví s jinými Slovany, aby se dověděli, jak si rozumí. (For others, a great Youtube channel where a Polish guy speaks with other Slavs to see how much they understand each other)
Večerníček
Hah, typical :D :D
You've served in Iraq
Respect to you
Hlavní problém s polštinou vidim její psanou formu
Nevím jak to číst  :D
ę,  *ą*,  ć  a tyhle podobný
Some of those we use in our Czechisied German words too
szczególnie to se čte jako - ščególnie
Basically we had similar writing as you until Jan Hus made a reform and introduced - ě,š,č,ř,ž. Little arrows above some letters
Czech reads as it writes
Thats nice and where are you from
I guess by nickname from Italy or Estonia(Talin)
Ah, nice, thanks for great explanation
Once in Germany on field hockey tournament there was one Polish guy in German team we were drinking with
After some beers we were speaking Czech-Polish with him :D
Trust me, me neither
I have no understanding of Polish language
(not kidding)
Oh, thats great
Some people learning Czech shares their experiences on the YouTube channels
For example TadyGavin and DreamPrague- both Americans
Im learning Deutsch on school, but Im not that good in it
No, not our neighbors, but Russia isn't far enough TBH
nah, we only hate our neighbours when they win in hockey
Probably Slovakia
I know nothing about this topic tbh, but this article came out on 1st april soo
yep same situation in Czech republic
Orban or even your Kotleba have many alt-right supporters here
"ej more gadžo co ten mocac kolik dás?"
Nah just kidding
Czech will understand what I am trying to prove here
I studied in Santiago and as a non-native speaker who only knew castellano I didn't have much trouble understanding spoken galego, but written galego was prety tough, because things that sound almost the same in both languages are written rather differently, since the grammar rules and pronunciation are much closer to Portuguese
It is still readable though
Some time ago I read someone concerned with the Irish survival, who claimed that the new generation of schoolchildren (gen
Y back then) has better command of the language that his generation
Has the trend been reversed or was it mere wishful thinking all over
The gypsy problem isn't just magically going to disappear
40% want communism back
Seriously what the fuck
Please don't gang up
That usually doesn't end well
For us, anyway
why are you booing me I'm right
I think they just miss their youth tbh
Not that much really, i definitely view it closer than any other region, but not particularly close
Without looking stuff up, I'd recall
Morocco - touristy, lots of exotic spices, bazaars
Algeria - colonised by France, lots of Algerians in France, biggest country in Africa, Atlas mountains
Tunis - Berbers, Carthage, Started the Arab spring and came out of really well off
Lybia - Gadaffi, civil war, ISIS strongholds, sub-Saharan migrant smugglers
Egypt - ancient times, Nile, Crocodiles, extremely densely populated, Suez canal and crisis
I've been to Tunisia once on an exchange program and have some Tunisian, Algerian, Morrocan and Egyptian friends
I dare say I know more about the region than your average European, but I would still love to explore the area a lot more
I love the beautiful historical centers, the sound of the Arabic language, the cuisine, the pottery, the lovely Mediterranean countryside, the atmosphere in the evenings, the blend of European and Berber culture etc
Certainly wish I would get to read some good literature from the region
I'm looking forward to visiting, once the corona situation blows over
EDIT: The only thing that I *don't* love about the region is that I am an obvious target for all the street peddlers, so in some places I can't walk five steps without someone trying to sell me something while trying to make smalltalk
It makes navigating some places really tiring :D.
How you can be closest non european neighbors when you are over sea
Almost nothing
Basic geography, dominant language and religion, and that's all for an average Joe
Plus some obligatory stuff like pyramids
We definitely know way less than it would be good to know
Okay, 30-Years War and the Hussites have both been mentioned, so I'll go for the less obvious choice - **the Protectorate**.
The country's occupied by Nazis, but there is resistance, not least of which are para-dropped **literal assassins** aiming to take down the Butcher of Prague, the Blond Beast, the Hangman, one of the darkest characters among Nazis, an architect of the Holocaust, Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich
Now, I don't believe Ubi could do the story justice
Maybe back when they were sticking closer to history, but probably not even then
Most certainly not now
But in an ideal world, it would be a wonderful setting for an Assassin's Creed game
Easy, hold my beer (literally)
Background of the reign of the most successful ruler of the Bohemia - Charles the IV
The whole area of Prague's old town as the playground, wouldn't even need to "shrink it" like they do with the rest of the cities
1939-1945
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
Resistance, sabotage, maybe something to do with the Czechoslovak foreign legions in Russia or UK
And the assassination of Heydrich of course
There's also the Urban legend of "Pérák the Springman" which the game could present as either an assassin or an acrobatic villain
It could end with the Prague uprising
or go a little further and show how we only went from one totaliarian regime to another
For Czechia Hussite Wars or assassination of Heydrich
And they could also stick the urban legend about Pérák into it as well
I personally would like to see Assassin's Creed in Prague during the reign of Rudolf II
Prague was the capital of HRE at the time with a plenty of artists, scientists, and occultists at the court
You would have Edward Kelley, John Dee, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, the Devil's Bible and even the mysterious Voynich manuscript, not to mention Rabbi Löw and his Golem, at the same place at the same time which would certainly make a lot of content fitting to the AC universe
Ah, kurva, I wrote a comment about Protectorate and Pérák as well, without knowing it's already here
Oh, well, I'm too lazy to delete it now
Anyways, Pérák would fit really well into AC
What's interesting is that we don't really know if he was a hero or a criminal
since there are accounts of him attacking nazis as well as raping girls (i think
So you could either present him as an Assassin, a Templar, or just some acrobatic neutral villain
Could make an interesting sidequest line
We do not limit those to a single era :)
Pérák's modus operandi was also rather similar to those the Assassins: jumping from the height, killing a nazi officer with a razor, and vanishing
I can imagine a story arc where a main character wonders whether there's another assassin in the city only to discover it was Pérák all along
(Also there's [a cool animated short film] with Pérák for those who are not familiar with the urban legend)
One of advantage of hussites as AC’s protagonists is large amount of weird weapons they used
Did we
Didn't the chinese have something similiar before us
No that much, we mostly watch czech old fairytales and russian Mrazík.
Private televisions are trying to push it as Christmas movie, but it's not exactly popular and definitely isn't a symbol of Christmas, it's just a movie nobody asked for, which gets aired during Christmas
We have our own traditional movies, like russian [Mrazík] but more importantly two czech christmas classics, [Tři oříšky pro Popelku] and [Pelíšky]
Definitely
I would love it they would air Die Hard, at Christmas, actually, I'll look if they are
Love actually is a classic here too
EDIT: They're not airing it
Pelíšky, vole
Wel there’s just too many traditional movies
I can name these just from the top of my head - Pelíšky, Tři oříšky pro Popelku, Mrazík, Home alone 1 & 2, Die hard, Anděl páně 1 & 2, Tři veteráni, Sůl nad zlato
+ Basically all old fairy tales
For my family, Christmas movie is also S čerty nejsou žerty, I wonder if it's usual or only my family thing
Russians
burany
Not really sure if anything really fits the definition in here
The closest thing to chavs here are probably gypsies or the people in cities that stick around them
We don't really have a word for them
lidezbrna - totally uncivilized rednecks from a village
slušní Češi - "polite" czechs
General term „socky“ from something like socially disadvantaged - coincidentally also a slang term for public transportation
Also „agrometal“ gets thrown from time to time, villagers listening to local pub rock/metal scene, would coincide with „burani”
slušnočeši
Loud, obnoxious, rude, aggressive, very prone to crime (especially stealing and drugs), very prone to never work a day in their lives and instead have 10+ kids with their cousins and milk benefits
There are exceptions of course, every city usually has on average 2 gypsies who have a job and are reasonable
Propably stole some shit
Can't speak for other people or even other countries, but my family's experience with gypsies involves multiple burglaries
Europop/dancepop, similar to Abba style but from czech artists
That's actually interesting
I didn't live through those times, so correct me if i'm wrong, fellow czechs
Because of communist censorship, quite a lot of music from west was unavailable and got into czechoslovakia through smuggling and with long delay
To hear what's actually trending in the world, you could listen to radio stations from abroad (but that was illegal i believe)
Because the regime had to approve every piece of art (music, movies, books), the dominant genre was pop - not many heavy themes, sometimes just songs from west translated to czech
Karel Gott, Hana Zagorová, Michal David etc
There probably were some mainstream rock bands, but idk about any rn, because the whole rock scene was very much against the soviet ideas
All czech rock bands from that era (Blue Effect, Plastic People of the Universe) i can think about had problems with the regime at some point, so a lot of them vere pretty underground
**Slovak:** Basically everything
Grammar concepts are pretty much the same as in Czech
Much of the differences between Czech and Slovak come from historically different vowel shifts, so for example where Czech uses "ů", Slovak often uses "o" as in sůl (Czech) vs
sol (Slovak) - meaning salt
So often, the words have same consonants but sometimes different vowels
When the vocabulary is completely different (doesn't happen often), I usually know the meaning through exposure to the language or by context
With Slovak,  I am able to remember the meaning of unknown word after first hearing it, it doesn't feel like learning completely foreign language at all and don't need to put in much effort
Anyway, most of the unknown words are not words people use in daily casual conversations - often times it's more technical stuff, names of plants etc
**Polish:** I would say that I can understand about 80% when written and about 65% when spoken, speaking slowly definitely helps
I've checked some news websites in the past and I could understand most of the articles
Watching polish people speaking on TV I can also get the general meaning of what is said
When interacting with real people in Warsaw or Krakow I could also understand most of the times, although I had a feeling I can understand Poles better than they can understand me
That could be because I can understand Slovak and sometimes the words in Polish are more similar to Slovak
Poles don't have this advantage
Polish also uses lots of words which are already archaic in Czech and there are lots of false friends, which can be tricky sometimes
**Sorbian:** Very similar to Polish when written, especially Upper Sorbian
When spoken, it gets really harder - the influence of German is very noticeable - it's basically Slavic language spoken with very thick German accent and that makes it very hard to understand if you are not used to the way how some words sound with this accent
**Slovene/Serbo-Croatian-Montenegrin-whatever:** When written I can understand about half or little below that of what is written, so usually I can get the general meaning but the details might get lost on me or might be inaccurate
When spoken, the understanding gets lower
When hearing these languages it feels oddly familiar - as if they spoke Czech but in the end they use completely different words
Anyway, I've never had problem to have a basic conversation when on vacations in Croatia
**Other Slavic languages:** I can occasionally understand a word here and there or maybe even some short phrases, but that's about it
East Slavic languages are hard to understand when spoken due to their heavy use of palatalization
When written, the limiting factor is the Cyrillic
Anway, for Slavic languages mutual intelligibility I recommend youtube channel Ecolinguist
The creator holds conversations between different Slavic people, transcribing everything what is said including translation to English
[Here's one video comparing Czech, Polish and Silesian+Kashubian dialects of Polish
] This way I found out I can understand Silesian/Kashubian on similar level to Polish, with Silesian probably even more
Slovak - absolutely no problems, though the eastern dialects can get harder with muttering
Polish - 75 %, if they speak slowly enough; the meanings somewhat differ and archaic words switch places with the normal ones between the languages quite often, but I presume I could hold a conversation, if both me and a Pole speak slower and pronounce carefully (I heard a full lecture in a museum in Polish, with my teacher translating somewhat, and halfway in I needed the translation only with certain words)
Sorbian - 70 %, again, I need to hear it slow and carefully pronounced so I can pick the words apart, but usually I get the meaning of the sentence somewhat
southern Slavic - I have experience only with Croatian, and it gets somewhat tricky (maybe 45 % of the words I somewhat recognize, but the meanings can be jumbled), but the pronunciantion is pretty good and close to Slovak in a way, so one can get by
Ukrainian and Russian are different worlds to me - sometimes I catch a word (like 25 %?), but getting the meaning of a sentence is real hard for me, the pronunciation is really, really foreign and it gets difficult to recognize words
Czech and Slovak are like brothers
I can understand Slovak perfectly but sometimes the words are completely different and it feels uncomfortable to read the text
Other Slavic languages aren't so similar, but since I know my cyrillic and my diacritics I can usually understand the general meaning of the sentence
That is, if the language hasn't got a word that's identical to a word in Czech but means something completely different
(for example: Droga in Czech means "drug", while in polish it means "path")
It can sometimes creaty funny misunderstandings if you don’t know what certain words mean
For example the famous polish word "szukat" :)
In Czech otrok means slave
I Czech it’s kočka :)
Bulgarian for me is on the same level as east slavic languages - I can understand only isolated words, it's quite different from other south slavic languages - or from all slavic languages for that matter, Bulgarian is pretty unique - when it comes to grammar at least :)
Portuguese and German are also somewhat connected
They are both Indo-European languages
What the actual fuck guys
Ah, nothing brings about a constitution faster and safer than hanging ministers from a lamp post
Sometimes it is
If there aren't piles of manure under the windows
Personaly should be
It's fun
Yeah, just like nothing starts war faster than throwing political figure out of window
I don't think they threw people out of the windows so that they could get some fresh air
When you throw somebody out if window that is 20 meters above the ground I don't think that you expect the person to survive
Universities usually have Czech and English study, but other schools don't. Maybe some private
Here, rarely maybe some private schools
It's not common but it does exist
In the long run, weaker Georgia means higher chance to absorb Georgia back to some kind of Soviet Union (without Soviets this time)
> The only part I'm sure about is that it's purely Putin coz Yeltsin's administration supported Georgian territorial integrity
Ehm, no
The first round of wars happened in early 1990s, and Russia was heavily involved on the separatist side
I'm old enough to remember news
Not officially, but Russia was involved, including anti-air, air and naval support
Who knows which were the orders Yeltsin actually gave
EDIT: checked wikipedia
It documents direct battles between Georgian and Russian forces
Do you believe it is possible to "disobey order" and organize full-blown military operation with air support and naval landing of a regiment
Ridiculous
měsíc - both moon and month
Candle and spark plug = svíčka
Wheel and bicycle = kolo
Scratch ticket and elk = los
Feature and lynx = rys
Trail and college = kolej
Passport and waist = pas
Shine and Septemeber = září
Hooker And fuck (as a bad word) are translated as Kurva
In czech we have lidé for people in general and for humans as a species
Houba = mushroom,fungus/sponge
Safety and security are both bezpečnost
Yes, but in reverse
"Tvaroh" and "sýr" are both cheese in english but it's a completely different thing
> On the other hand, we have "buho" and "lechuza" where they only have "owl"
Interestingly, despite Czechia being landlocked, Czech language has different words for the true seals, *Phocoidea* (tuleň), and the eared seals, *Otariidae* (lachtan)
Same here
Czech kinda circumvented the problem using *velkoměsto* (bigcity) for, you know, big cities
same here, we call it jed
You don't do reflexive pronouns
But U-Boat is just the German word for submarine
In English, it's messed up as well
Biscuits are different across Atlantics, and I'm pretty sure cakes are too
Because pescado is a substantivated past particle, like "fished (stuff)"
Same here
Yeah, we have "učit/učit se" and "půjčit/půjčit si" (i.e. pożyczać sobie)
Czech langauge also has "luna" for moon, though its too poetic to be used in normal conversation
Surprised Slovak doesn't.
Damn that classico one sounds cool af not gonna lie
When talking to other Czechs I say I’m from region of city Písek and when talking to other people I say Czech/European
same plus playing on playground with other kids
Me too and I was really proud of myself because I don't know how but I won the campaign missions unlike my cousin
Jewelry - I just cant say it
Or any word with th sound - I just say d instead
The car - D car
It used to be “schedule” and “uncomfortable”, but recently I found out that I cannot say “Brazil” and pronounce it as “Brazzle”
Comfortable
No matter how hard I try my lips are not cooperating with me on this word
some words are hard to pronounce, because, there isn't one way to pronounce them
Like for example **Read** does and doesn't ryme with **Lead** and can read like **Red**, but also doesn't have to and only way to know how to read it is from context
Also some geographical locations (like **Worcestershire**) are pretty hard to pronounce too, but they don't come up in conversations that often
Generally it's words with the "th" sound, words with "rl" in them and words with more than one r in somewhat close proximity
So it's words like thorough, girlfriend, rural etc
-ough words are a mess
Every single one of them is pronounced differently
You can start with learning how to spell the word correctly ;)
Here in czechia, we pronounce things the way they are spelled (so basically any spelling competion would be useless with few exceptions)
In Czechia (and I would expect that in other slavic languages as well) we have the same problem
People try to pronounce it as if it was some sound they know, because "th" is just too hard
Instead of "The", many of us  say "D", instead of "with", many of us say "wif" and I have even heard "wis".
Can't speak for Germans, but given we drink the most beer per capita, we can trow Czechs into the mix
The beer culture is strange in a way that, up to certain amount, drinking beer is not considered "boozing", and I heard, and have the experience that Czechs generally tried to avoid conflicts, even under the influence (unless they had way, way too much) even more physicall ones
Ireland
There is the obvious: beer and pub culture
And then there is a surprisingly similar history and a mindset, to an extent
Both countries have experienced the underdog, almost "colony" status under a reign of another, stronger neighbor
Both suffered from being forced into adapting a different culture, almost letting their identity to be wiped out
Both have a certain "underdog" mindset, although we express it in a much different way due to the whole 20th century mess
I feel like whenever I talked to an Irish, they understand us much more than any other Western Europeans
From some perspective, Switzerland is kinda similar, Czechia and Austria are really close together, because of our history and when I was in Switzerland, I felt like being in Austria, so from one perspective, Switzerland and Czechia are kinda similar
We use discord for almost all subjects
I'm very surprised by it actually
I only had a few classes this semester and like half of them were complete bullcrap that I only took to get enough credits, most of those simply didn't happen anymore
There was only one class that used Teams for lectures and the internal school system for exercises on a regular basis, even the final exam was online
The other classes were kinda meh - a few online lectures, some excercises we had to do but that's about it
Overall, easiest semester ever
Right now I am just finishing up my bachelor's thesis, which I don't need the school for
So the quarantine didn't affect my studies that much
Yeah
5-7 30 minute long classes each Monday, Wednesday and Friday
Most of the teachers use Microsoft Teams and some Zoom, it depends on the teacher
In general, language teachers prefer Zoom because of the fact you can make groups there
"alright guys, we've finished the chapter
Can I get a pog in the chat
I don't think using a Microsoft product for "privacy" is a great idea
Security of the software you're using != privacy
Still kinda sad that the government doesn't do anything and it's really showing in statistics
You have the similar number of inhabitants and about 3300 people died in Sweden
Here, in Czechia only 300 people died
I was quite sad when I looked at the statistics 3000 people could live now if government took this crisis seriously
But I understand due to social and historical context why Sweden takes it easy
Still it's kinda sad for me even though I have no relation to Sweden
I guess at least you will less economical consequences
However, I prefer more health than money
Pičín is probably the most famous one amongst the czechs
I'd translate it as "pussy land" tho it could be probably translated better
We have Pičín, based from the word piča which is pretty much a cunt
Kuřim --> I smoke
Řiďka= Asstown
Pičín=Bitchtown
And many more
Pičín - Pussy town
Polipsy - Kiss my ass
Somebody already mentioned Pičín (cunt town), but I think that these also deserve a mention:
Řitka (small ass),
Šukačka (fucking),
Hroby (graves),
Onen Svět (basically a euphemism for death),
Vepřová (pork),
Hovězí (beef),
Telecí (veal),
Hlína (dirt),
Kámen (stone),
Hrochův Týnec (hippo's town - not sure how to translate Týnec),
Louka (meadow),
Sloup (pillar)
Pičín (Cuntsville)
Kozodirky (Goat-holes)
Peklo (Hell)
Mokrovousy (Wet-beards)
Hulín (Blaze-town
as in pot-smoking)
... and that's just a few of them
Sometimes I wonder what the fuck the founders were thinking (or smoking)
village called "Onen svět"
"The other side"
Cunttown, it sounds bettter
And our Little Anus where the old anus Helenka lives
Similarly, there's Horní Police in Czechia
Yeah Cunttown sounds better
Never ending cycle of train crashes
Most known are [Studénka\[2008\]] and [Studénka\[2015\]] \- yep, almost same place
First was a [bridge falling down] on the rail during it's reconstruction, second was [polish truck driver] not wanting to scratch  his truck
You have the winner, no doubt
If I recall correctly he also caused his employer to go bankrupt because the damage(cca 8 mil €) was way higher than the insurance limit
Every insurance has a limit
The absolute minimum in Czechia, required by law, is 1,4M€.
Usually it's more than enough
But when you wreck a hightech train and kill few people
People are usually asking for our BEER, CARS and MONUMENTS (mainly in Prague) or why are we so atheists
(And when you say, that you are from Bohemia, they usually ask what part of Germany is it)
"Oh I visited Prague once in 1995, it's so nice", or their cousin's been to Prague, etc
I personally find Prague overrated, but it's alright, people are just trying to relate to something
More people than I would expect know a bit about Czechia/Prague, at least those from other European countries
I don't remember any surprising questions
I know a guy from the Czech Republic
When i tell people that I’m from Czechia they usually say Where
Or are you communist
I have problem with distinguish Ukrainan and Russian
South Bohemia region
In the regional city I live - few days snowing, but it all melted the second it touched the ground
My home village in foothills little bit further - the same, only the thin layer of snow stayed for few hours, probably thrice this winter
Small town little bit further, deeper in the national park and mountains near the border where my grandma lives - little snow for several days twice
It's pretty cold this week, but otherwise around 5C and higher and I don't expect any snow
Now or the next winter
It's the same situation for several years now even though we used to have a looot of snow for majorty of winter some 15 years ago
We do have snow, but it's laughably small amount
Still enough to cause the ski-hungry Pragueners wreck their cars though
Yes
About two times for half an hour
In the city where I live (north-west Bohemia) it haven't snowed yet
Sometimes in the morning there Is ice on the ground from frozen water, but that's it
Nope
We got like 5 hours of snow in Prague on one afternoon, but it melted overnight
Nothing in sight as well
In the past, Vltava (the river flowing through the city) used to freeze and people played hockey on it
That sounds less real than seeing a live unicorn these days
It was snowing but didnt lasted more that Hour
So not funny, didn't laugh
Prague and North Bohemia, in Prague, it "snowed" for two days but it didn't even get to touch the ground
In Karlovy Vary (North), it didn't snow at all, only frozen dew in the morning
Climate change is real (imho btw acording to the Milankovitch cycles, which are usually the main excuse of denyers, we should be getting colder nowadays, really doesn't seem like it, maybe global warming is a thing after all
(LOL btw our former and present presidents still deny CC and GW))
EDIT: spelled the cycles name wrong
Where at
I don't trust it (there are still some channels doing it but not much and it looks even less trustworthy than before), but we loved to watch it as a funny show with my brother as kids
In times when Horst Fuchs was the star
I don't think it's much of a thing anymore
My grandparents were definitely into it 10 or 15 years ago, but it's been replaced by shady online stores that resell cheap Chinese stuff to people who haven't heard of Wish/AliExpress, MLMs, and stores selling products under the "As seen on TV" label that have kinda become their own thing now
We've had scandals involving "sales events" and lonely elderly people, in which scam companies take a bunch of old people on a "free" bus trip or lunch and then pressure them into buying overpriced appliances or mattresses while they're locked in a room with aggressive manipulative salespeople
It's quite bizarre and a little sad
IDK if this was a thing anywhere else
This shit kinda replaced the door-to-door salesmen my grandparents were buying vacuum cleaners from in the 90s. I feel like some people just never learn
Probably [this one] It's from the 1989 protests that were part of the Velvet revolution and fall of communism
For the recent years
[President of the Czech republic on holiday]
[New prime minister kissing his PR head-of-staff after election results were announced]
I'd nominate two 1968 photos, [this one] and [this one]
Or maybe some other with people arguing with Soviet soldiers, like [this one]
Gaelic
It sounds like something out of fantasy
Finnish
That sounds very melodic and there are a lot of vowel sounds and not many consonants
I really like Swedish, Croatian and maybe even Slovenian
To me they just sound really pleasant
As for someone from the Czech Republic the most pleasant sounding language is Slovak
For our similarities its sounds like Czech but mor cuter witch poetic charm to it
I've just compared them by listening to them on youtube, and I must say that Scottish gaelic sounds more pleasant to me, in fact
I don't know how to properly describe this in english, but I like that the R in scottish is harder than in irish
It's basically the same as we pronounce R in Czech
Aw, that's a shame
But I fear that is just the nature of school in the end
I'm sure there are plenty subjects in school I would normally really enjoy, but the environment and the fact that it's forced takes away the joy in it and makes it kind of annoying
Sadly, I think this is the only way to keep the language from dying out, which should not happen to such beautiful cultural heritage
Czech R is very similiar to the scottish "tapped R", if not entirely identical
EDIT: The irish "slender R" is in fact quite similiar to our infamous Ř :)
Yes, that might be it, Czech has probably the weakest palatalisation out of Slavic languages, so it sounds more natural to me
Maybe Russians or Poles would like the Irish gaelic more in comparison
And don't take this as me saying irish gaelic sounds bad or something, both dialects are very magical
Well our current PM is Slovak and is effectively the main person while our Czech president is just trying to drink in peace
It the complex politics and diplomacy of the medieval Europe it was quite common
For example John of Bohemia, father of our most respected ruler, was from Luxembourg
Our current PM is Slovak
Every country from Austro-Hungarian empire be like
Zeman and drinking in peace
It’s more like he drinks while thinking of how to provoke as many people as possible and how to make more room for his buddies
He may look and act like a senile zombie, but he can still do harm
Currently he is lobbing for Russian vaccine and bringing Prymula back again
And he already claimed he is going to be creative with interpreting the law after next parliament elections
Babiš, the CEO of Czech Republic
I still wanna know who killed Václav III
Trust me, every normal Czech thinks it's bizarre as well
He was born in Japan, too
But technically he's not a foreigner as he holds citizenship by birth
In reality he is just a political entrepreneur
He does not actually believe what he claims
(E.g. He used to be very much pro-migration some 10
years ago
Well, he claims to be a huge patriot, protector of traditional values and he's very anti-imigration, but at the same time he wasn't even born here
I mentioned it as an example of how politically active he still is
I personally believe that the vaccine is likely ok from medicinal point of view
Yes, Russians sometime cut corners, but they have been using this vaccine for their own people a lot, so I tend to trust it
Talks about it being unsafe sometime sounds like propaganda from our side
The issue is political aspect - what they might want in return
It would be fine if it was only  about money, but with countries like these it is often about influence
And after being part of eastern block for 40 years, I believe it’s reasonable to be cautious when dealing with them
If doctor asked me to choose between Russian vaccine and no vaccine, I would gladly accept available one
I wouldn’t trust the Chinese one tho
I think that they've started dating when he was 39 and she was 20
"It's about -1600 °C  high in the atmosphere as the molecules are too far away from each other" - my high-school geography teacher
He refused to believe that there was something like absolute zero (-273
16°C)
Once our history teacher let some student from university to teach us WW2
She said that Operation Barbarossa started 22nd May
When I corrected her she asked if I mean by Gregorian or Julian calendar
At the time I didn't know that difference is only about 2 weeks (if I remember right) so I've shut up
Well
My high school physics teacher thought the moon landing was fake and told us the Earth was 15 billion years old
Hey, I have a question about your religion classes
Are you taught oy about one religion like Christianity or about more big religions like Taoism, Budhism, Islam and other
> The American Civil War was not about slavery
It is not my field of interest, but I've heard people whos field of interest it is, and they insist that saying "US civil war was about slavery" is oversimplification
It is a popular misconception
I believe I was taught the same in my school days (1980s)
Oh, that's cool, on my school we have this class only bcs we are Christian high school, other high schools don't really have it and in my opinion it's really good to know about different religions even though 90% of us are non-believers or atheists
On our school its a little more about philosophy
Yeah, and we also talked about Taoism, Confucianism and natural religions
Look at the USA, they are bad in languages and geography
Look at the UK, they are too
I believe the English language is the problem
It definitely is celebrated the same as the German guy said but I'm not sure to what extent, because it's not celebrated in cities and big towns
I live in Prague and in my apartment building we used to celebrate it when here lived kids
I remember when they apparently told themselves "Gotta hit the winter where she doesn't expect it
" so they went on to salt the streets in September
Byl pozdní večer – první máj –
Večerní máj – byl lásky čas
Hrdliččin zval ku lásce hlas,
Kde borový zaváněl háj.
It's from the very famous poem Máj (May) from the 1800's. I'll try my best at a translation
It was late in the evening - the first of may
Evening may - the time of love
The turtledove's voice called to love
Where the pine forest's wind was blowing
It might seem from this snippet that the poem is about love
But it actually follows the story of Vilém, who has been sentenced to death for murdering his father for sleeping with his girlfriend
He is hanged and the girlfriend commits suicide by drowning herself
"Byl pozdní večer, první máj, večerní máj byl lásky čas"
The first two verses of Karel Hynek Mácha's poem Máj, translated as "May". It's an introduction of the first may being the time of love, though the rest of the poem is sad
This whole poem is linguistically interesting, because Czech language by default stresses the first sillable in every word, but reading this poem makes you always stress every other sillable (it's called jamb), very unnatural way of speaking in Czech, but at the same time it sounds good
That shows that Karel Hynek Mácha was indeed a genious linguist
Definitely the first or second line of "Máj" by Karel H. Mácha
"Byl pozdní večer – první máj –
Večerní máj – byl lásky čas
"It was late at night - the first of may
nightly may - the time of love
I'd say "Hynku
Viléme
Jarmilo
" is the more commonly known part, and sounds just ridiculous out of context
Wasn’t Vilém executed on the breaking wheel
I think they hanged him first
They used to do that if they wanted to show some mercy to the criminal
That, and also I had no idea what "lámání kolem" was in english
Don't make graffiti tags on cultural monuments
Stupid British and German tourists in Prague
Not to redder to us as Northern Europe
Another weekend plan ruined
But why
Well there go my plans for the weekend
I think I know my next vacation destination
*cough* One Plzeň please, this other stuff is disgusting
Sad we don't have that law
Is there someone for whome a clown isn't part of a nightmare
Lennon Wall is not cultural monument
it's not okay anywhere where it is not allowed
Hmm
Kölsch, sounds like Braník.
Also, it's hilarious how people from Brno and Ostrava defend their local beer just because it's theirs despite the fact it's absolutely disgusting
mostly cheap furniture which doesn't stay long with couple of good things
Why is the food there so popular I can't understand, probably because only competitor nearby is mcdonalds or so due to ikea stores locations
Its most basic and cheapest furniture you can buy NEW for that price
Its so generic and widespread today, people think you are "poor" if you dont have anything better
Its starting furniture for starting families you will replace in few years after moving in
Also there is another view, that for material used (sawdust, shives, glue
) its overpriced
Some people say it will not last long because of cheap materials, it will desintegrate in 5 years, but these are just abusing that furniture and handle with it like 20cm thick undestructible oak table
Yeah, people here really take it personally when you call Czechia  “Eastern Europe”, and the argument is: “Prague is more to the west than Vienna, so we are Central Europe
On one hand I understand that, since being considered Eastern European automatically means that you have to be poor and corrupt based on stupid stereotypes
On the other hand, though, aggressive arguing and trying real hard to convince others you are not Eastern European
feeds more into the stereotype that you are just an angry little Eastern European trying to shove ‘truth’ in other people’s faces
>  I don't get what's is bad about being in ''eastern Europe''
>People really like to get upset for anything
What people like you repeatedly fail to understand is that the "Eastern Europe" definiton most (ignorant) people use was defined by the Iron Curtain and extremely oppressive treatment from the Soviet Union
This is all without mentioning that this Eastern Bloc definition is extremely, extremely broad and lumps together countries which haven't had much in common before the Soviet occupation and have distance themselves from the Soviets/Russians from Day 1 they were allowed to
And let's not even pretend that "Eastern Europe" isn't a negative attribute in the English language
How would you feel if Italy was a part of "Axis Europe"? I bet that wouldn't be okay with you now, would it
Not with Czechia included in it
I never claimed we were a part of Western Europe, we've always been Central
we don't have any and I am fine with it
Far enough we're in NATO
I wish they were European military bases but I don't really mind them, certainly better than Soviet military bases
I don't think we have one anyway
I don't mind
It feels comforting to know that the world's most powerful military has a large operations base in a neighbouring country, makes it more convenient if we are attacked from the East
The more the merrier
Liquid bread
Beer I know its not food but best beers came from Europe and you can drink it with a lot of classic European food
You're limiting yourself too much
There are many excellent Spanish cheeses, some Greek and Cypriot ones (Kefalotyri for one, plus niche things like Feta and Halloumi), and I had good cheeses from Norway (this sweet brown cheese), Sweden, Lithuania (they follow the Swedish tradition, Džiugas is similar to Swedish ones), Austria (Bergkäse), UK (cheddar, stilton)
There are many more countries which I would put in the second tier, but still with some nice stuff
Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova all have some cheeses worth tasting
I was looking for a guy like you haha
Same, I couldn't even find any bakery with an actual bread :(
I didn't know what to eat lol
I mean it is brined cheese, not your usual hard cheese, and it should not be compared with say Gouda
I can easily believe it, but I have never been to Portugal, so I've omitted it entirely
Sorry for that
No, Polish gastronomy is not exotic here
Never saw any
Maybe in regions near the border
Sadly
You won’t find many Polish products with good reputation here
In Czech Republic people from  Ostrava are going shopping to Poland
Not really, if you want Polish groceries you usually just go to Poland to buy some
Slovakia - Slovaks live in their lands probably since 7-8th century, but history of their independent state starts in 1939 with collaboration with Nazis
Hussite wars have great stories in general
For example, they used wagon fortresses in battle to counter heavy cavalry and infantry with great success
Late in Hussite wars they split up into several groups, and there was a battle where both sides built fortresses and waited for the other side to attack
Unsurprisingly the side that lost patience and attacked lost
Hussites are super badass from military perspective, but from religious side they have been extremely radical in 15th century
not that far from ISIS today in their actions
Not being Austrian, I'm still fine with calling it Austria
I have 2 answers so here they go
For vacation or just plain visit I would probably love to visit the Interwar period Czechoslovakia
Probably an obvious anwser
Then I would also love to visit either the reign of George of Poděbrady and even as far back as the time of Great Moravia under Svatopluk
I know the tune and some of the lyrics of the Slovak and our old Austro-Hungarian anthem
I recognise the tune of the Russian, Polish, Italian, French, British and German (also the old East German) anthem
What do you mean know
Like when I hear it, I can recognize it
Or you mean I know the lyrics
I know german one with lyrics (even few older ones), polish with lyrics, slovakian with lyrics, soviet with lyrics (russian without lyrics), british with lyrics and french with lyrics
Also the american one with lyrics
And also canadian with first 6 words
Just to mention, I don't know the whole lyrics in many cases, but I know most of it
I can recognise the old austro-hungarian too
I know British, German anthems well because we sang them at school due to learning English and German
Then I know Russian because meme culture of the internet and ofc Slovak
I know that French one is war march song and that's all
If they are "almost" rich (just wannabes) it's your tipical shit, expensive shoes, 2nd hand Audi And all that
But if they r truly rich, u won't even pretty much notice them y'know
But I guess it is the same everywhere
Depends on personality
They become prime minister
Ulice (Street), it's been airing since 2005 and there are currently 4025 episodes
It would take ~120 days to watch the whole thing
Ulice (translated The Street) has about 3150 episodes and new episodes are still coming
The Czech Republic is culturally divided into 3 main areas - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia and there are so many different slangs
For example, I am from Moravia and usually, people from Bohemia would not understand what I am saying if I didn't want them to and definitely not if my grandma was speaking
It's not only the pronunciation but also the use of different words for different things, the endings of words, the verbs would be spelt differently if written down and so on
Not that many young people use the slangs today, but it can be still challenging even with basic words that we use
Czech Republic is divided into 3 areas, Czechia, Moravia and Silesia
The biggest difference is between Czech language and Moravian language, but you can still understand what that talk about
But my mom is from Ostrava, which is divided into Moravia and Silesia and my dad is from south Czechia, so my language is somewhat mixed, for example I speak normally Czech but in sentence “we are” “my jsme” I could pronounce jsme as jzme, but that’s just a small difference
I don't think there are is one unintelligable accent (I guess it depends from where the listener is) but every accent has several words than no one else understands
The further right you go the more polish it sounds so yeah, anything past essentially Brno is just unintelligible
Slovenian in general is somewhat harder to make out for us compared to Croatian for example
I don't think I could communicate with a special case of Slovenian effectively without English
And in the Czech language, there is nearly never a word that two people would read out loud differently if they saw it written down, but we use different forms of the words when we speak, which would then be spelt in a different way
You mean "jejichejma žufánek
I've only been to Devon when it comes to the British Isles and I have no problem understanding Scouse
Geordie is a bit trickier but I can still manage
Welsh accent in English is the most complicated one for me
I might just as well struggle anywhere because I'm not at all familiar with respective regional vocabulary
I went west and saw „ein zwei“ written on a billboard
I think „raz dva“ is more intelligible
This is actually not entirely correct
There's a phenomenon called 'Moravian assimilation' — all obstruents (p, b, t, d, ť, ď, k, g, f, v, ch, h, s, z, š, ž, c, dz, č, dž, ř) are voiced before sonorants (m, n, ň, l, r, j, vowels) across word boundaries
For example, „Jak je
“ is pronounced „Jagje
“ instead of the Bohemian „Jakje
“, or „nicméně“ and „buďme“ are pronounced „nidzméně“ and „buďme“ instead of „nicméně“ and „buťme“.
Some Moravian and Silesian dialects keep i/í and y/ý distinct from each other
For example, „holubi“, „holuby“ and „holube“ are all pronounced differently
Similarly the l-ł contrast (two l sounds) might be still retained
Minimal pairs such as „lež“ – „łež“ and „spal“ – „spał“ are found there (which are obviously both homographs and homophones in the standard language)
panický (paňický from panic vs panycký from panika) nebo proudit (pro-udit (about meat) vs prou-dit (about a river)) are one of the homographs in Czech
There are no many of them though
Does this mean "best time in history to invade Russia in winter"?
Small facial piercings are considered normal for women regardless of age, in their case they are seen simply as contemporary fashion elements
But in the case of men I'd say it's viewed more as a statement, not just fashion
People will think you belong to some kind of subculture and might treat you as such
Not in Czechia, I’ve seen very few and none on people in higher positions and respected professions
Germany, in the other hand, seems very different in accepting piercings, tattoos, amd smoking
it shouts "bad life choices" anybody doing serious business will shut doors in front of you (90% of the cases)
Its thrashy, if you want to do shitty job (hair dressing, waitress, helping hand in industry) Its how you choose it for life without possibility to go back
So I hope your piercings and tattoos were great choice
Exactly - if you are doing shitty job or servicing people, you can have it (few), If you want 1,5x or higher wage than is average, you just cant have it
There are unwritten standards
Everybody in higher tiers will look down on you
They dont want to be seen with these people
As a male with shaved head and pierced ears, I have never been rejected by a Czech employer
3 times average salary
This is very true, poeple in cz love to talk about the "live and let live" yet they obviously treat you differently when you dont conform to what they perceive as "normal". I guess it just makes them feel better about themselves when they say it, they dont live by the statement
It is 100% correct description of Czechs in general
Seems like a bullshit to me
Your posts in this thread indicate to me that you personally have some issue with this and you are projecting it onto the whole country
I am living proof that piercings are not a problem and I've never had any issues during job interviews (male engineer with a septum piercing and 10mm tunnels in both ears), neither did my university educated friends
And I work for a big international corporation outside of Prague
I've had no problems even when I travelled for business to our offices in the Germany, USA or anywhere else
There are managers in my company who also have piercings and tattoos
I can imagine piercings would be a problem only in banking/law sectors where the demands for business looks are high
Don't see why some programmers or even doctors should have problem - I personally know one doctor with piercings on face and sleeve tattoos (tatoos covering whole hand)
Generally, piercings and tattoos are so common nowadays, walking on the streets it's pretty common to see someone with piercing/tattoos/tunnels in the ears etc
I cannot imagine manager or engineer with these in the face
Never seen one
Only low income group have these
Because Czechs might have a negative opinion about some of your traits or looks, but it generally doesn't change the way they treat you
Not "live and let live", but "pretending to follow the 'live and let live'".
Body modification is generally more mainstream in Western Europe
I’ve met more tattooed, piercing-scarred or wearing people in Germany in three weeks than I have in my home country in my lifetime
Similar with the UK
And my cousin owns a tattoo salon
Because as other stereotypes it depends on individual people
From my experience it's rather true
We use 1 234,56 in Czechia
We don't put anything between thousands
We split decimal places with comas and we don't always split thousands but when we do, we do it with a simple space
So for example: 1 201,55€ or 1201,55€, we usually split thousands if the number is long
We use commas for decimal and space/dot for thousands
234,5 CZK
We use billion this way:
million = milion
billion = miliarda
trillion = bilion
quadrilion = biliarda
etc
My old calc did this
It's the default position
Really strongly identifying as "an Atheist", you know, like the kind of people who have to rant about how stupid religion is at every opportunity, that's cringy, but also not uncommon
Otherwise it depends on your area/social group to some extent, the South East part of the country and some rural areas are more religious (Catholic), in other regions (like in the North where I grew up), being a practicing believer of any kind makes you a very small minority
I would say people just dont care about that here
Comparing to US or Western Europe it simply do not even cross our minds that someone could be religious
And if someone is, then it is likely very personal and you will not even find out (people usually don't want to stand out)
Growing up i didn't know anyone who would practice some religion,it was just a thing from historical or foreign movies, literally nobody talked about that
Remember how weird it was to see those US movies where they they always prayed before food and visited church every Sunday
I think one of the reasons why so many people in this country do not want immigrants from distant religious cultures is exactly this, they dont want to disrupt the homogeneous culture of irreligiousness
People don't even want to bring discussions about religion back to everyday life
I know 2 religious people under the age of 60
Our country has around 90% of population non-believers, so that explains a lot
Totally normal
I mean I'm from Czech Republic the most atheist country in the world
>How are Atheists viewed as in your country
We are them
In my country there is almost everyone Atheist
I don't know anyone who has any religion
Being Atheist is like a normal thing and almost anyone gives a shit about some religion
Almost everyone is Atheist from late 1960s. And religion is now like a historical thing, i remember from my childhood, when i was watching some film or serial from US it was super weird when characters was praing before food and going to church on sundays
(Thanos voice) I am atheism
Around 70% of the population is atheist, so
Czech republic is full of atheists so it's kinda normal for us
Love this
From another historically Catholic country, well, opinions on church buildings vary
Some hardline atheists don't care for these monuments (or even see them as symbols of oppression) and think the church should only maintain them through member donations and never receive any public funding
However, most of us still recognize their cultural and artistic value and are fine with taking care of them on the same level as castles, museums etc
Not every church necessarily has historical value, it would be unrealistic to maintain churches in every single village if so few people ever go to them, but the major or unique ones are definitely treasured
It's kinda like how we don't have a monarchy anymore, but we still kept its crown jewels as one of our national symbols and didn't bulldoze former royal palaces
Famous cathedrals are definitely visited by many more tourists than actual churchgoers, that's true, but lots of the tourists also come there _because_ they're Catholics/Christians themselves
Some large churches here actually have services aimed at tourists, in various langauges
Any chinese people feel free to answer this one
That mf is drunk 24/7
He nearly threw up on our Crown Jewels, on the TV
He also said pussy in an interview
You don't even have to make up jokes
The man is a living meme
Here are some links, you should check out: [Crown Jewels] [i don't even know] [a videogame based on his interview]
He is THE JOKE, we don't need to tell jokes about him
Did you copy our prime minister
In Czech you pronounce things as they are written
Budapešť, with SH
> because the hungarian keyboard is already full of letters
the feeling when your keyboard doesn't physically have the key between Z and left Shift :(
yeah, and in most parts of the world the keyboards don't have the key for í xD, it goes like Shift, z, x, c, v, ...
French, Spanish, Russian - other languages don't seem very important or I already can speak them
Tough question
On one hand, it's tempting to ask for an upgrade of the languages I already speak to some extent, on the other hand getting 3 languages fully for free
OK, I'd say
* French, which I don't speak and not learning, but it is useful
* German, which I'm very shitty at and going nowhere
* Something non-IE, either Arabic or Turkish, just for fun
German, since it's a pretty useful language, same with Spanish and as a third choice I'd choose Japanese because why not
German, because I'm currently trying to learn it
Russian, because it's kind of an international language in its own sense
French, because omelette du fromage
German, French because those are the most useful
For third either Arabic or Chinese
Something a bit more exotic, that's hard to learn and is widely used
I think they should generally be removed, although there's some difference between statues of Lenin and such and more generic monuments to Red Army soldiers and WW2 liberation (even though those were also extensively used for propaganda purposes, for sure)
If any of them are of unique artistic value or really iconic/popular with the locals, they can stay
We can't erase that history either, that would be like getting rid of all the memorials to absolutist monarchs or the Catholic church because they were also oppressing our people
(We've also had debates about [some of those] I think municipalities should decide what to do based on consulting the citizens, but also independent historians and art scholars
Of course none of that is really as relevant as the fact that we have an un-reformed Communist party sitting in the parliament and many city councils, as well as Russia who still sees itself as a continuation of that "empire", so it's not easy to get rid of any of them
Too bad we didn't have more of that revolutionary energy to get it done in the 90s.
Most of them have been removed, and the rest should be torn down with haste
Exception should only be monuments dedicated to actual soldiers who died to defeat the German army
Yeah
Do we even have any statues of Stalin left
I thought those were removed already in the 60s or so
I was amused when Russian protesters swamped the Czech embassy and threw a few molotows (if I remember correctly), and when some Friends of Russia type group protested here
But the fact politicians had to go into hiding under police protection is absolutely outrageous if the intel is correct
If there's a table dedicated to the pub regulars and you're not one, you don't sit there even if it's empty
In some pubs, they bring you beers automatically when you're finishing your currend beer
Putting beer mat on top of your glass tells the waiter you don't want another
If you insult local favorite football team, you are a ded man
You don't switch the TV from ČT sport
You just don't
Ahh yes the "costumers", a dress up party is always nice
Sometimes there's a sign "Permanently reserved for regulars" or generally you just know
It's usually a table close to the bar, in older pubs, it's together with the bar in an entrance room called mázhaus, separated from the main room further inside called lokál. In smaller or newer pubs it's at least visually seperated from other tables
First you have to be acknowledged as a regular by both service and other regulars
And then you get gradually accepted by the regulars until one day you might get invited to the table
No, it's more of a gradual and subtle process
As I wrote in the other comment, first you have to be acknowledged as a regular by the staff as well as by other regulars, then the regulars slowly accept you more and more until one day you may get invited to the table
It starts with the bartender recognising you were there before, he may ask "As usual
" when taking your order or don't ask at all and simply bring you what you usually order or he may joke about being puzzled when you order something different or that you were missing when you don't visit the pub on your regular time
It goes both ways, you start using less formal language when talking to the staff, talk about various things and maybe joke around as well a bit too and being generally more comfortable around them
For the other regulars, when you start recognising their faces and they seemingly recognise yours, you may do a nod of acknowledgement when entering the pub, later even directly greet them
At this point, you could be already considered a regular and most likely you won't get past this stage
The guys with their own table are the top tier, a sort of local nobility, they have likely been frequenting the pub for twenty years or more and developed strong bonds between each other and between them and the staff so they don't let anyone easily among them just as you wouldn't really let anyone into your close group of friends
Anyway, even at this point, the status of a regular brings you certain priviledges
For example if the pub is full and you come, the bartender may sit different people together so there would be a room for you, or you may get things that are not on the menu
Plus you may socialise with other regulars who frequents the place and make use of this diverse social network
However, if you still desire to get to the štamtyš, you have to simply wait at this stage
Maybe one day, they tell you they need a third one for a game of mariáš (a card game for three players) if you wanna join or if you've got a skill to offer or an interesting story to share etc
If you prove yourself a jolly companion, you may get directly asked to join them at the table the next time
And after a few times, you start sitting at the table without asking
Waiter either keeps tabs at the bar, or each table/person has their own - it looks like this:
beer for 13
8, sweet nineties
I applaud your knowledge of the term "hladinka". You made this Czech happy
Every police officer is armed with service pistol, in our case CZ 75 D compact, some police patrols have long firearms in the trunk of the car
Even municipal police are armed
Police is always armed with a handgun
And many civilians too
In the Czech republic, every police officer and every municipal police officer (and many private security guards) carry a handgun
In every major municipality (sometimes they cover 2 municipalities) at all times, there is at least 1 police car patroling around with heavy firepower and Kevlar equipment ready to respond to threats even before the swat team could
And in times of high emergency, tension or just important diplomatic event, police in vital checkpoints carry heavy firepower
Overall very well armed
In addition we have a lot of civilian conceal carry firearms all over the place
The same thing here, though I'm not sure about the assault rifle in the car
But yeah, every officer is armed with a handgun, but it's pretty rare to see them carry anything more than that
The only time I saw that, I think, was after the terrorist attacks in France and now that I think about it more, it may have actually been the army
Been to Vienna during Christmas holidays 4 years ago and seen plenty of police walking around with assault rifles
That was military, not police
Oh my bad, completely forgot about it
Same in Czechia
EDIT: sometimes it is called "Australia and Oceania"
Neat, we have the same thing
We call it „světadíl“ also means „world part“.
We're glad our roads are not destroyed enough for us to drive cars on them let alone a ride bike lol
They don’t. My first family gathering was my boyfriend’s family’s. My family is full of drama (caused mostly by my mother)
Not stupid but a lot of people have problems with this and it's purely grammar:
Řekli jsme
(We said
- Like we all without specification or we if there's at least one man or only we men and it's clear from the text
Řekly jsme
(We said
- Like only we women or only we children or we women and children
If there's one man in the group you are speaking of or if it's not specified at all, it's Řekli
And again if it's clear from the text)
But if it's not about people only, there are cases where -ly is even for masculinum
For example: Muži stáli
(Men stood
) But Stoly stály
(Tables stood
) Both masculinum, but it depends on whether animatum or inanimatum
Stvůra a nestvůra jsou v podstatě totéž.
A  creature  and non-creature (monster) are basicaly the same
Negative concord
It usually becomes a mess when there are 3 or more negatives and the context is logic itself on top of that
Don't forget that the neuter only group would be řekla jsme
I've seen native people totally confused by "dojela jsme" in a car advertising
Never in my life have I ever noticed that lol
Dead and undead are both dead, tho
More like "is forming dialectal continuum with the western Ukrainian dialects".
Even two can be confusing
Like "Nikdo nezraněn", literally "Nobody not injured" actually means "Nobody injured" in Czech, even though it said the opposite even in Czech
The same for example "Nobody didn't came" meaning "Nobody came".
Yes
But I'm ok with people in everyday informal speech use -ly
Written
there should be -la
Well one of them is moving
Not in all dialects
There are some extreme examples, like popular song from the 30s:
Nikdy nic  nikdo nemá  míti za definitivní
neb nikdy  nikdo ne-ví  co se může státi
Nobody never should not consider nothing to be definitive
cos nobody never doesn't know what could happen
That's exactly what negative concord is and once you know it's idempotent, it's not confusing, provided the context is casual
That's what I meant by my previous comment
However, yes, the confusion actually starts from two negatives onwards when the context is logic, although when there are only two negatives it's usually made clear by emphasis that the concord isn't used, that's why I initially wrote 3 or more
I usually find three negatives difficult as people can fuck with you, as you can't tell if they're all in concord, all negates each other or only two of them are in concord and the remaining one is negating that partial concord
(When the discussion is getting close to logic
Yes, then it breaks the concord, same in Czech
EDIT: To be more precise over here if the emphasis sounds like:
* I didn't do **NOTHING** — The concord remains; you're just angry
* I didn't do _n o t h i n g_ — The concord breaks; you're a cheeky bastard
"not against" or rather "not to be against" directly translates to "nebýt proti". Note that "against" isn't a negative
Charles IV, the holy roman emperor
T. G. Masaryk, our first president, played an instrumental role in the creation of independent czechoslovakia
And, of course, most important is Jára Cimrman, inventor and writer, who I highly recommend people that don't know him to research
* Svatý Václav (Saint Wencelsas)
* Jiří z Poděbrad
* Karel IV (Charles the 4th)
* Jan Hus
* Rudolf II (We were under Austria)
* Marie Terezie (Maria Theresa, under Austria)
* Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk
* Edvard Beneš
* Klement Gottwald
* Alexandr Dubček (He was Slovak)
* Václav Havel (I am not sure if he counts as historical because he was president until 2003)
Important authors:
* Karel Čapek
* Božena Němcová
* František Palacký
* Karel Hynek Mácha
* Karel Jaromír Erben
* Jan Ámos Komenský
Don't forget about Jan Žižka and, most importantly, Jára Cimrman
And Master Splinter
Ok, I wanted to add a category for musicians but decided not to
With him I would probably place there Dvořák a Tyl
Try asking young people outside Prague
OP didn't forget, the nation did
No, they wear "it's ok to charge me at least double" costumes
There are no pools in Prague which would be accessible from balconies
So instead, British people climb up on the top of water fountains and traffic or street lights
I like it because it's the only foreign language I can speak
It doesn't sound too bad but there are way more beautiful languages
Czech is definitely not one of those tho, I think vowel-heavy languages sound way cooler
The pronunciation is just a complete mess, so can be the tenses and sentence structures
Czech is more consistent and easier in that aspect, which I like
But there's no declension, whereas in Czech you decline, conjugate and inflex everything, which isn't very cool (although it has its advantages)
Overall I like that the beginner grammar is incredibly easy, which means the language is very easy to pick up and converse in
I think the best aspect of English is its absurdly large vocabulary
Just makes it more interesting to read and listen to
On the other hand Czech has more consistency with its prefixes and suffixes
I prefer to use English online in typing and writing a lot more than Czech
English has a very good autocorrect, so I don't have to watch each letter I type
No annoying declension and diacritics, forcing you to type everything manually and slower than in English
The written English grammar is also much simpler than the Czech one
I prefer spoken Czech more though
It feels more practical than English, often has shorter sentences, less (though longer) words and it's my native language afterall
Better than Czech for most stuff, at least for me
Even for emotional matters, my native language feels kinda “cringe-y”.
I enjoy it
I particularly like the nuance of some of the adjectives and descriptives
Sometimes I feel like the Czech word I want to describe something with is lacking in context whereas there is an English word that fits perfectly
I would have to use a phrase to describe something that has just one word in English
So it feels very versatile
Like irked and miffed both convey annoyance but in ever so slightly different ways
It's okay, I feel like it's not as rich as Czech language but that's probably why it's easier to learn for a non-native speaker
And in English it's nice that you can talk about someone without assuming their gender, that's not really possible in Czech
For example in English female and male students are all student but in Czech we use often masculine terms as neutral to refer to people even if it might be a woman, like when you say "go to the doctor" you don't know if the doctor is male or female but in Czech you say "jdi k doktorovi" for male doctor and "jdi k doktorce" for female doctor, so the problem is that if you just don't know the gender of the refered person or just don't wana assume people say just the masculine term, so people often imagine the male right
Or when you ask "do you have a partner" you don't assume what gender is their partner but in Czech you kinda have to assume to create the sentence cause we don't have a neutral term so that causes that everyone just assumes you're straight
And saying the options like "do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend" every time to be inclusive, that's something not many people do or maybe are not willing to do
Just because of the way our language works I think it's gonna be harder to change things like these
Most people don't see it as a problem I guess but I had a classmate who studied gender studies and I learned things like this from her a lot and now it's just stuck in my head haha
I hope my comment made sense lol
No, I don't, but I don't enjoy speaking languages
I love them, but not in the practical sense
In Czech you can do a similar thing
You can also make a swearword out of pretty much everything
Some Czech here said expressing empathy and emotions in Czech is cringy
Have you ever met someone with an opinion like that
It seems to me the other way around personally
The real plague is here in Czechia
With our shit education system teens can’t speak English very well, but they do adopt English phrases
It doesn’t seem that bad, but it’s really weird
The importance of English will again decrease in the future as the US loses its sole economical and military superpower status
English is currently just convenient for trade and science
In 200 years, it will be something different again
Latin, Greek, French, German, Russian, Spanish (Mandarin
Lingua Franca changes all the time
It's not gonna replace Finnish or any other language
It's just convenient for now
This is the first time I hear something like this
wtf
English is such a boring and barebones language
It is excessive
You can verb without any suffixes, google it
The first and last one are the same, it seems to me
Yes, like this
You just go without them, and it is perfectly fine
In case you really need to convey the idea of *this* object, you use a demonstrative pronoun
"I saw yellow bus
That bus had antenna".
Of course I have met one, he's me
Expressing myself in czech can feel too intimate to me for some reason
It’s probably because of all the TV shows, which are in comparison to real (slavic) life very emotional
V tom případě je to psychický problém, nikoliv lingvistický. Jakýkoliv jiný jazyk by pro tebe byl "příjemnější".
Asi jo
I am not afraid of the current situation, but I doubt my abilities will be the same as 6 months ago
"Forefather Czech, God grant him eternal glory, was an ass
There are so many pretty places in the world and he had to settle where he did, in the one place between the Germans and the Russians

Looks like your team advanced to [Division 1] this year, so congratulations
I'm from Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) so we got most of our landmarks from the last 2-3 centuries (thus not very historical), we got lotta spas, some thermal springs, a watchtower, an old house (the eldest building in our city, from 16th century I think) and the Three Crosses, a beautiful lookout
Well, I am gonna anwser anyway
Prague Castle, Charles bridge and Vysehrad(older castle in prague)
Prague Castle
I've been to Bílá Cerkva
Not too far from Kyiv, so I've actually came two or three times
But I've only been to the park, not any cathedral
Lonja de la seda hands down
There are many other interesting places, but the lonja is magnificient
Kladivo
I don't know how badass it is but i think that kladivo and kovadlina (anvil) souds good for the clanking of forge
Also "palice" for those big ones
Kladivo is pretty badass tho
Very hard, no soft sounds
kovadlina, kovadlo here in cz
How is then normal hammer in your language
>Nakovalo is an Anvil
I don't know where you got his one, the Czech word for an anvil is kovadlina
That's more of a mallet than a hammer
Anvil, or "kovadlina" in Czech
depends on what region
some people would pronounce the D hard
It's okay mate, we all make mistakes
Isn't that just germanized Czech
Matka
Peníze
Pít
Pinkat
Všecko jedno
Those are Czech words
If they're renting alone, probably nothing
Many single 25 year olds still live with the families, or on a property they inhereted or got from their family, and with how much rents are increasing in cities, we're only gonna go back towards less independence
If this hypothetical person shares an apartment with a whole bunch of people, then maybe they can save 200€ a month or so at most
Unless they work in an IT engineer/developer position, in that case they're getting paid twice as much as any other 25 year old, but in general the average "fresh out of college" salary isn't much more than 20k CZK after taxes and rents in Prague and Brno are climbing towards 20k a month for a one bedroom flat in decent areas, soo
You finish school when 20-25, you work 35 years, you retire and live next 35 years
It looks like you need to save 50% of your income or you just live above your means
Dont inflate your lifestyle
You spend 60e on lounas
I mean, realistically it would be absolutely total chaos in every country
But there is not realy south/north divide in our country
Prague would be at roughly the same place, people from sudeten border mountain areas would go into sudeten border mountain areas on the other side of the country
People in Central Bohemian region would still live in Central Bohemian region, Ostrava would be at roughly the same place too
The most impacted would be Brno which would move maybe like 100km more north
In this sense i thing we would be one of the least impacted countries in Europe
Well, the wine rednecks would live in the town of coal rednecks and vice versa
Nothing much
> a socialist system would Be perfect for Russia and other ex soviet countries
The central planing is in principle a bad system
The market and people participating in it are too complex system to be planned for years forward
You need to go deep into the forest, when you are in nature
Here, you just go few steps outside of path and nobody cares if they see your back
Toilets are of course preferred, but it's not a big deal when there isn't any around
It's considered rude not to turn your back to other people while doing it, but it's normal and noone cares
It really depends on where you are
If you find yourself in a built-up are you really shouldn't urinate anywhere outside toilets
In nature I agree with you
It's also not quite legal, aka you can get fined if you do it in front of a policeman, but generally, people don't care, thus they don't bother the police
It could be either public indecency, or polluting of a public place, depending on the specific
Of course, I forgot to mention that, but people do make that difference
Al dente is the only way to pasta
This makes me so irrationally angry
This shouldn't be the trick of the Italian, but the trick of FOLLOWING THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGING
You mean it is not on the package
You mean people put pasta in the cold water
Holy shit, the last time I was here it was Czechoslovakia
Czechoslovakia doesn't exist
Parents take their small children to pee in a bush / occasionally also naked small kids around public pools
Why you have toilet if you can shit in bin directly
What about stop with drinking of beer
Then I will also add shocking fact about Czechia
Not everyone are alcoholics
The first time I encounter a spelling bee was during watching Southpark and was just thinking they are mocking some knowledge competition or whatever
So I was really surprised later when I found you really have national broadcasted competition how to spell words correctly
When I first learned of spelling contests as a little kid (from that Simpsons episode), I thought they are either made up, or that they are for mentally disabled contestants
Since, you know, why would you ever need to spell something, unless it is maybe a foreign name/place
Czech language has highly phonemic orthography, meaning almost everything is written as it sounds
So, spelling bees are irrelevant - most of the time if you can say it, you can spell it (sometimes with the exception of i/y)
I initially found concept of spelling bee utterly baffling because our language is very phonetic and you read the exact sounds you write
Only much later I realized it's because English is basically an abomination
No and I thought that americans must be really stupid, because they have spelling bees when I saw them in cartoon
There are some spelling things like I/Y D/T P/B but they could be told by overpronounicing or saying I in high tone and Y in low tone
Or you can use [rock and putty] in demonstration
is it really putty
What else it could be
He wouldn't dare
I found out such contests exist from your post
In Czech language they would be pointless as the words are mostly written as they are pronounced
I can imagine such contests for foreign languages like English, French, or Spanish - older kids usually have some knowledge of at least one foreign language, so they could compete in that
ETA: Well, I just remembered that Czech language competitions do exist and I even took part in one at about 14 (which was along time ago  )
But it was not about spelling at all, but mostly about correct use of language to express exactly what one wanted to express, recognizing nuances, finding different ways to say things, etc
I think one of the tasks was also a piece of writing
I’ve only heard of (and participated in) the national conversational competition
Every level had a list of topics and a listening exam
It doesn't make sense here, as basically everything is pronounced the way it is written
Only time I saw it was on Simpsons
I know what it is, but it doesn't make sense in Czech
We have the same in czech, except with i/y, s/z, mě/mně,  je/ě.
by quick google it is episode 12 from season 3  but I don't remember anything from that so I am going to watch it again now
Yeah, diktát. Many fond memories
Especially placement of interpunction and weird rules for capital letters were my favorite
Not
- Head of state is elected just like in Russia, if in the first round no one gets 50+% two candidates with the most votes ascend to the second round
- head of Government is chosen by the president, it's most likely the leader of the winning party
Very stupidly
Ok now to be serious, we vote for parties, and the party that won (biggest percent of votes) or the one that forms a coalition, almost always, the leader of winning party becomes the PM
In case of coalitions, it's usually leader of the party that got most votes out of the ones in the coalition (usually the biggest one
President is voted, from 2013, by "popular vote". President than elects prime minister
Yea, but we dont have one president for one lifetime like Russians have
I would like to add, that President is elected for 5 years and can only be elected twice in a row
It's more complicated
In the case of our president, we have ordinary "people vote and the most votes win"
In the case of PM, our president basically names PM and this named PM must form big enough coalition to survive the vote of confidence
I believe the president has 2 attempts and then someone like the Speaker of Chambers of Deputies or the Speaker of Senate has an attempt after the president
Only by the lower house
But could be elected for another 2 terms after 1 term  pause
I mean, kinda
I got married recently and we got many, many questions when are we gonna have kids
From people at work, randoms who found out, family, friends that aren't that close to us and don't know that we both hate children, etc
We aren't ever planning to have kids, though, and our families don't take this seriously/don't believe us
They have stopped pushing the issue mostly, so that's good
Except for my husband's sister, who had a kid few months before our wedding
I know it doesn't exactly answer your question, but we got married pretty young, so we didn't have any of that "settle down" pressure on us, but now that we are married people are expecting we will reproduce and that kinda pisses me off because it's not their business
So I would say that I feel that pressure sometimes
I guess the joke is on them, though
Czech republic (summarizing various stereotypical viewpoints):
* **Prague:** Arrogant, self-important pricks, who think that they are something special because of money they have, they also do not understand real life
* **Brno:** Somewhat silly city with mentality of a big village, has huge inferiority complex in relation to Prague
Also, everybody in Brno speaks "hantec" (a local slang with German roots, popularized by some actors and local partiots)
* **Ostrava:** A grimdark (post)industrial city full of unemployed miners, everybody speaks in a funny, short-voweled dialect and is half Polish
* **Sudety:** A general term used for regions inhabited by Germans until the end of WW2
Sort of a backwater wilderness with harsh weather conditions, lots of unemployed people and ruins, local pub brawls can be pretty brutal, everybody has a dead German buried under his cottage
The town of Bruntál is sometimes considered to be a prime example of this stereotype
Also, everybody votes for communists and neonazis
* **Southern Bohemia:** Somewhat poetic land of level-headed and hard-headed farmers
* **Southern Moravia:** Land of jolly wine drinkers
Nobody does anything else than growing and drinking wine or walking around in traditional folk garbs
* **Haná (central Moravia):** Sort of a nice-to-live-in breadbasket countryside inhabited by slow thinking farmers
Slow does not have to mean stupid, more like reconsidering everything in almost entish manner
* **Valašsko (westernmost Carpathians):** Wild mountains with wolves and bears and long tradition of shepherdry
Everyone lives in the country, has a "valaška" (a long axe often associated with brigandry) and waves it wildly when dancing
Even more hard-headed people with lots of common sense, but unable to change their opinions
Vaslui what the fuck
Wow, we jihočeši got out the best of this
No wonder, with all the Praha-Brno, Morava-Praha, Ústí, Hradubice and Asia starts in Vysočina, pyčo, etc "conflicts" I have the feeling like nobody cares for Southern Bohemia (which isn't so bad)
Prague is pretty diverse itself
Life of someone living in Holešovice or Vinohrady will different from someone living in Velká Ohrada and the rest of Prague 13
Idk about the Sudety mate
Mostly industrial area here on Ústecko with low unemployment
But I agree with those dead Germans
We even buried some Germans in river hehe
V Českých Budějovicích by chtěl žít každý!
Yes, here are some of the stereotypes I have heard combined:
* **Historic Centre:** An ancient, picturesque and mysterious empty shell of a city, full of tourists and tourist scammers
* **Žižkov:**  The Republic of Žižkov", a bit rough, formerly proletarian (and proud of it) quarter, best pubs, but you have to dance between piles of dog shit to reach them
* **Vinohrady:** A hipster nest where upper class people like to buy flats if the center proves to be too crowded
Press "G" to gentrify
* **Dejvice:** 1/3 old underground/dissident musicians and writers who spend their days in stylish pubs, 1/3 higher ranks of former communist army, 1/3 Russian spies
* **Letná:** You probably live here if you work in PR or marketing and want to live in a peaceful neighborhood, where not everybody works in PR or marketing
* **Jižní město (The Southern City):** A grey, graffitti and crime infested hellhole where pensioners slowly crawl around old communist high-rise high-capacity buildings and further into oblivion
* **Outskirts in general:** Urban sprawl of former villages consumed by series of ugly family houses built en masse in the 1990s. People just sleep here in their mortgaged homes, then drive to the centre where they work
* **Karlín:** Something like Žižkov, but without the charm and pubs
Well Ostrava or Most would be more like Forge world
so praise the Omnissiah
Well, I was talking about stereotypes in general, including the mountainous areas and towns that were reliant on industry that did not survive global competition or got tuneled by old owners
I'm moving there in two weeks
Any places to avoid at night
Byl jste někdy v Budějovicích
This is cool, thank you for this
Also, I think The Southern City stereotype is valid for most panel housing estates in Prague
Pilsen not mentioned
Yay
It is mostly alright, the reputation is partly historical, partly exagreggated
Very nice praise the machine spirit bro
Cheers
For example, there is a book "Z tajností žižkovského podsvětí" from the 1930s that extensively parodies gangster pulp stories and uses this reputation for various comedic effects
The book was/is quite popular and sometimes is still quoted/referenced in local context
Not bad, I live pretty close to Polish and Slovakian borders, so we can go shopping there and we can watch Polish and Slovak TVs
Outside of that, pretty normal
It's not very uncommon but depends on your financial status too
Generally, people go to neighbouring countries for weekends quite a lot
But I'm from Czechia and it's very easy for us to go to another country since you can reach the borders in three hours from nearly anywhere
It's also very good for hitchhiking as you can experience lot of different countries in short amount of time
Pretty cool i'd say (if there's open borders and no corona of course)
And even if you have no car, train system got you covered, especially if you're student with ISIC card - student prices can be ridiculously cheap
As an artsy person, i sometimes just go and have a nice weekend in museums in Vienna, Berlin or Munich
Sometimes me and my friends go by car to further locations like Hungary, France, Italy or Croatia, but then again, the "long" distance trips are still pretty short sompared to US
Very nice
Pre-COVID restrictions, I travelled to another country at least once a year
Usually for vacation, but sometimes for different reasons - shopping, concerts, music festivals
For example four years ago I took a trip to Katowice (Poland) to see a movie in IMAX theater, because I really wanted to see it in that format and Prague's IMAX theater (the only one in Czech Republic) wasn't playing it anymore
It used to be common here too, but it somehow died out with the generation of my grandparents
That's žínka, pretty normal to see it in households
In the Czech Republic, it's called *Tuplák*. Which means literally "double". Although it is not really common
Most used is 0,5l beer
These are extremely common all around SE Asia
I believe most of the world uses only water
Pretty much all Africa and most of the Asia
Arabs use usually only water now, in the past it was often just sand
Holy shit, you think other countries don't have tea bags
Tea bags, of all things
Mate, you're hilarious
We do have them too
It's terrible, it gets stuck all the time
I think moka pots are relatively common all over the place because they're quite cheap and basically indestructible
You buy one for a camping trip or just out of curiosity about new ways to make coffe and then it kinda stays in your home forever
I bough one in college and when I later went home and mentioned it my mom fished out one we had at home even though no one there is a coffe drinker
It was probably older than me and just kinda existed there
That's [umami synergy]
They are absolutely common
I use cans handful of times a year, and at least half of them have pull tabs anyway
So yeah I also have only this kind of opener, although with a larger handle to be more comfortable to hold
If I used cans more regularly I would probably get a more modern one, but this takes minimal space and is good enough for the few times a year it's used
Germans have really good Minecraft servers
GommeHD
Rewinside
In Czechia se have QPlay and Survival Games but these are all country blocked for cz and sk only
**Cycling infrastructure
** It is almost non-existent
There is a lot of paths for recreational purposes but very little "useful" ones
When I look at bigger cities around the border of Czechia many of them have at least some sort of infrastructure
Public transport is alright but it doesn't go everywhere
edit: grammar
25€ deposits on cans and plastic bottles like they have in germany
I was about to write exactly this
I live in a relatively flat city yet there is absolutely no cycling infrastructure here and it drives me crazy
I would love to cycle to work but it's just not possible - I work at the other end of the city and cycling would mean I would have to cycle on very busy roads, alongside big trucks etc
To avoid busy roads I would have to use a different path that goes up a very steep hill (like one of the few in the city) and showering at work is not possible
Lot of the cities/areas with a good cycling infrastructure are flat, though
Czech cities can be relatively hilly, so unless you have the opportunity to shower at work/school, it's not that practical
I think that's the main reason why there's not much push for cycling paths
Cyclopaths in Brno and Jihlava are good
I can't imagine living without it
I mean if you just wipe, it's never a 100 % job
>the option to buy one pizza slice instead of an entire pizza, as in Denmark and - I imagine - many, many other places
What
You cannot buy just a single slice
I'm so jealous
If you don't try to beat the record, you can drive relatively effortlessly
If you would cycle for only 10-15 minutes, it would not be that exhausting
I would really like to see at least some change because the current network is just disappointing
Maybe I'm naive but I hope the party that wins the next parliamentary election could bring some change to this
Can't imagine using it either, i'd say this is not exactly a country specific thing
Once you go clean butt you never go back
You would have to revamp social dynamics to be like this
Most jobs in the Nordics are union protected, while in here unions are almost a swear word
Some retail workers would gladly get more money from weekend shifts however a lot of retail employers would often bully employees into taking weekends and late nights while forcing contractor agreements on them so they wouldn’t have to pay weekend and night shift bonuses
Work ethics, employee expectations and overall work-life balance of certain unsilled labour positions here is from the western point of view quite nightmarish
Makes sense now, you usually cannot buy just one slice of pizza from proper pizzerias here too
But you can get single slices in pizza stands (like [this] or [this] they look similar to kebab shops or there are combination of these that sell both pizza and kebab
I would prefer shops/stands that would sell more nutritious food though
Then this seems to be more of a problem of Romanian public healthcare rather than "free" healthcare in general being bad
Which is actually super against MasterCard’s and visa’s TOS
Yes
It makes construction and renovation very difficult cause you have to consult with a "bureau of conservating 12th century cobblestone imprints under 12 degree sunlight" kind of regulations when you want to paint your bathroom
The term old building has quite a different meaning in Europe
Old buildings were built centuries before the asbestos invention
It's a problem of rather newish buildings
I think it's still pretty common here
We have some asbestos at home and at our garden too, I think people don't really care much
That can afflict new construction in Europe as well
You are digging basement for you new family house and boom, bronze-age graveyard
True, but I guess u/mathess1 meant its application in construction
That's correct
I don't have any asbestos mine in my garden though
This argument is always going to be there when you only have a binary choice
Lot of Easter and Christmas traditions are disappearing
For example during the week before Easter Monday, children in villages used to go around village 3 times a day with noise making wooden things (řehtačky), and they used to sing religious song at several locations in the village (usually where cross or chapel is located)
During that week church bells are silent, there is saying ‘bells flew to Vatican’.
In Easter Sunday, children went to all houses in village, and they received treats and little cash for their ‘service’ in previous days
This is still alive in some villages, I’ve encountered it once in middle of nowhere village, and it felt alien
Religion
I don't know if it's a tradition to be religious, but Czech Republic is a country which has the greatest percentage of atheistic people in a country in the world
Honestly, fuck the Easter traditions
I used to dread Easter so much
Like, I'm supposed to get beaten with a switch AND drenched with water just because I'm a girl
Hell no
You Finns are hardcore
So are traditions relating to Masopust and Máje
This still happens every year in my Moravian village, I had no idea it was disappearing
I think it's lot more common in villages and small communities (not satelitní městečka) than we think, just because most people live in bigger towns and cities
But I will not miss pomlázka at all
I used to dread Easter because of it
So you have chosen death
Mysterious "diarrhea" every easter monday locking me on the toilet until noon for several years until my parents gave up forcing me to open the door just because boys and men from our village were dickheads
Oh childhood
I tend to be careful and slow on those roads, but I usually am more careful than the average joe here
There usually aren't that many people taking these kinds of roads, they tend to be more like shortcuts or paths to someone's garden you cannot access with a car from the front
Since mostly locals use them, the drivers are way nicer than on normal roads
When two cars meet and can't fit on the roads, you'll have to drive back or find a place to pull over
Then you usually get thanked by the driver
How is 80kmh even physically possible on that without rattling your brains out
As for a song everyone knows I would say something from Karel Gott
as for the second anthem I am not sure
I would choose symphonic poem Vltava (Moldau) by Bedřich Smetana
"In this piece, Smetana uses tone painting to evoke the sounds of the longest river in Czechia
My guess would be that he exists within some very leftist/activist circles
Normal people don't care about that kind of thing that much
Dejvice from dej více - give more
You will never find bigger cheapskates elsewhere
We would lose ourselves to the big countries again
That fear of being ordered around once again will always be there and it will always be the biggest argument against it
We would have sandpeople like germany, britain, france and sweden
Also we would not have ability to change monetary policy and end like greece and italy with unpayable debts
We would be minority under votes of france and germany
And that's why it's crazy and I treat federalists like extremists
I do honestly believe that, my fellow european
While the citizens of the big countries are afraid that they'd have to help the smaller countries, they so happen to be, mostly, the citizens of countries that received outside help in the form of the Marshall plan during their post-war reconstruction, something that most of the "smaller countries", which also so happen to mostly be from the ex-socialist bloc, had no actual possibility of using those funds for their own reconstruction at the time due to political reasons
I simply have a problem with the fact that our existence would be watered down from an independent country where it's citizens can rule themselves into some backwater province that would get ordered around ybt eh big countries whose citizens believe us to be nothing more than just second grade citizens
Jeez, would this meme about us being some gun-loving nation just go away
Just because we have relatively lenient gun laws does not mean that it's completely normal to carry weapons, the vast majority of people don't carry any guns, people who do carry guns are like 3% of the overall population
Quick googling tells you that it's some 1
8 % in Germany, it's not really such a huge difference
My issue is that here on reddit, there are several Czech redditors who are gun enthusiasts, which is fine, but please don't pretend like it's totally the norm here
The vast majority of people don't give a crap about guns, this is a safe country afterall, so you don't really need to have a gun
It's not about whether the state protects you or who protects you, it's that most people don't exactly feel the need for protection
Germany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5
5 million firearms in use, which are legally owned by 1
4 million people in the country
And German population is some 82 milion people
It's only matter of time management and self organization imo (and maybe bit of just how much your work sucks)
Although, I think I'm not exactly *average case*, I manage to work regular full time (8h/day), commute (40min/day), enjoy my many hobbies (if anything, my number one first world problem is managing all of my hobbies), eat 3 meals a day (although breakfast is usually something quick lice cereal), cook regularly (prepare a proper meal for at lest 3-4 days of the work week on Sunday; if I don't it's mostly just matter of laziness) and sleep somewhat ok (usually around 6-7 hours)
But as I said, probably not a norm, since I don't have a family, nor a girlfriend to pay attention to
I mean there diffinetelly is
I'm just not respecting it
I guess breakfast is between 6:30 and 8:00, lunch is between 12:00 and 13:00 and dinner is between 17:00 and 18:00
I'd say it depends on the job/school we're talking about
Employees in warehouses and industry will have different day schedule than office workers or students
For lunch 30 minute break is mandatory, but many people will take more time, often over an hour, if their employer allows it
People will either bring their own food from home or will go to a canteen or restaurant
Most restaurants offer "menu" a choice of three or four meals available at lunch time
This is prepared in advance so you get it very quickly and it is cheaper than regular meals
With sleeping it is very individual and depends on how much of your free time are you willing to spend sleeping and when do you need to get up
I usually sleep like 8-9 hours even when I have to wake up at 6AM
I’m not sure if it’s just local or if other countries have it as well, but we have this “last ringing” tradition
When kids are in the year before high school graduation - so the last year at the school for them
They announce one day where the last ringing takes place
That day from early morning they go berserk on the rest of the school and wreak havoc
They usually paint all over other students and the school building (which they must clean up afterwards tho), wet them and interrupt classes to draw more
Anything that doesn’t harm anyone or is permanent is allowed
This is connected with another tradition which is more of a ceremony where the last year students initiate the penultimate year students
They usually make them promise something and put up a great act (I’ve seen one year where they acted as if they are a judge and jury) and when they promise, they have to eat something gross
Sometimes it’s stuff like olives, but sometimes it can be a health hazard - like cube of yeast
So it's free-for-all
Yeah it's basically a costume party where the graduating students make the entire school smell like vinegar and then walk around their town, making a lot of noise and asking people for money
I've seen something similar in Poland
However, I didn't ask them so I am not sure if it's the same thing
Oh yea
I completely forgot the asking for money thing
Most foreign is Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), it looks like most of Eastern Europe countries and there are even orthodox churches
And most typical
maybe Olomouc/Brno or some other big city
I dunno if i'm the only one, but the most foreign one to me is probably Český Krumlov, one of the most touristy places in ČR aside Prague
About 2 million (at least according to some website i've found) tourists visit it every year, especially Koreans and Chinese for some reason and the town centre is basically made for tourists [and out of tourists
Honorable mention: Karlovy vary - so many Russians live here, [half of any text you can read in the city is in алфавит.] It's weird, but in a differrent way than Český Krumlov
For typical one
Prague and Brno, and even tho especially Prague has some problems with tourism, it still has it's own character only known for locals
Is it a North Limburg thing or also a North Brabant thing
Would somewhere like Breda also be quite Belgian-feeling
Just realised corona exists, so the over-tourism is not really an issue right now, haha
I meant the architecture, most of it was built by Russians for Russians in 19
century
Yeah, it doesn't look Eastern European in my experience, either
There is a bunch of orthodox churches, but that's it
Otherwise it has a very Central European look
But since there is a pretty strong Russian community there, you'll see a lot of writing in Cyrillic in many places and in the touristy part you'll hear Russian more often than Czech
Even German seemed more common than Czech, actually
Because sometimes you just want to inflict pain on your European neighbours and luckily for you, Czech allows you to do just that:
Blb vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
A perfectly valid sentence
Well the answer is obviously Czech
Why
Because it's a language for every budget
If you'd like to save money, you can buy only consonants for your typing machine and get by with sentences such as "[Strč prst skrz krk
] On the other hand if you'd like to have a lavish lifestyle you can have all 42 letters of [Czech Alphabet] including the luxurious *ě š ř ž ý á í ů*!
On the more serious note - Czech is quite complicated (7 cases, you have to memorise rules for correctly writing i/y, other rules for writing capital letters,...) - I think that if people would know more how complicated Czech language is, they would be even happier with the fact that we are using way more easier English to get by
:-)
Honestly I would objectively vote for Bulgarian
If it wasn't for the Cyrillic, it's the easiest language to follow as both grammar and writing is quite easy
Make it happen
I can't wait to finally insult someone's mother's uncle's birth village bakery after they cut me on a corner road
Seriously, you put so much beauty and thought to insults
I dig it
I too, curse your bloodline
And everybody say with me: "ZMRZLINA"!
Hahaha mate
Check my flag and then do know
Delicious example of  a wovel-impaired word
:) I commend you for your choices, but the best ice cream I have ever had was a strawbery one in Hungary
That sounds like a very suspicious context hahaha
Communism
I wouldn't say entering the war a mistake
It's the launching of 11 identical offensives and fail every time that sounds like a mistake
cold 0 and less
chilly 0-15
nice 15-20
warm 20-30
hot 30+
cold - up to 13
chilly - 14-20
perfect - 21-24
hot - 25+
I would just change
<-8/-5c freezing
-4/5c cold
5/15 chilly
and my hot extends to 35, after that it's too hot
I lived in northern Finland for some time and it didn't feel as dark as you might expect, because the snow reflects a lot of light, so even during full polar night you could see during the day
People just carry on like normal, towns are safe, outdoor sport facilities have sufficient light sources or you use headlights
Many people add extra light sources on their cars too
Overall lights are everywhere and the nighttime feels kinda romantic
But I'd probably view it differently if I lived there all my life, to be fair
50,39°. Existence is a fucking pain, the Sun sets at 15:52
I guess that time, when group of peasants led by a one eyed and later blind guy defeated several crussades and attacking knights and soldiers were even afraid of their singing
Also, probably not a plot hole, but 30 year war started in Prague, with Battle of White Mountain, where protestant armies (and bunch of mercenaries) were fighting against Austrian emperor and ended again in Prague, where those same protestants were fighting for Austrian emperor against Protestant Swedes
8th century
Close to zero written evidence, only some archaeological records
Battle of the White Mountain definitely did not start the Thirty Years War since it happened 2 years into the conflict (1620, war started in 1618)
I remember reading somewhere that the name is considered to be very ancient and probably of non-Slavic origin
Yeah, you're right, defenestration was in 1618
The average life expectancy is that low because children's death were very common
Once you make it into adulthood you could live a long life
No history we are aware of
There's a written evidence of the [battle of Wogastisburg] in 631 and then about the Charlemagne's campaign against Bohemia in 805 ([siege of Canburg]
I got the experience from the other side - once I was in U-Bahn in Germany talking to friends in Czech and a German came by and said "Strč prst skrz krk" - which is the most famous and super hard Czech tongue twister
:-D
Warms ma heart
Lovely, do you find the ř sound difficult
:-)
Cool, I appreciate that you are trying
I am sure it is going you well :) Do you have a Czech heritage or are you just interested in Czech culture
Personally I really like Valencia’s and the Barca logo too
For our country, that would be [Gutalax] [for] [sure]
I'm giving non religiousness
Let's not actually, that is that counterbalance, right there
It is, but never saw someone enforcing it
But one of my friends was fined for jaywalking in Austria
It's if there's no crossing within 50m
We actually got stopped once for crossing a on a red
Police stopped us, but it was like 2am so we talked them out of the fine and a friend who crossed first had to buy us mcdonalds
I don't know if there's a direct translation, to be honest I don't even know how I would  say "entitled" in the sense of a personal charasteristics in Czech
The closest words we've got which we would probably use in this situation is *fakan* or *spratek* which mean a bratty child in general
Though in my family, much to my friends' amusement, we use the word "fakan" neutrally to mean just "child".
Mamánek maybe
Museums related to things I completely don't care about and almost any "modern" private museum of any nonsense like museum of Lego which makes no sense in Prague downtown and not in Denmark
There's the Black tower, dominant of the city with nice view
I lived two streets from it, now 10 minutes by foot but I've never been there, simply never cared to go there
Or I go around the regional history and culture museum every day (before covid) and still don't know what is inside
To be honest, I visited a lot of tourist sites but only as a prt of trip with the goal to go to touritst sites, and none was in this city
I like to go around the buildings, look at them but don't really wish to go inside outside of vacations
I live in the western Czech Republic
There are like 5 castles less than an hour away (be it car or train)
Only been to one of them
We also have catacombs, one of what, 4
in the entire country
Black Tower
Is it České Budějovice
There is also one in Klatovy
Now that I think about it, the centers of those two towns are very similar, just Budějovice is much, much larger
Yes
The only tourist site here I visited is probably Budvar many years ago (and I don't even like beer)
Lol, most countries around Germany seem to have an identical system, just translated
We do, but we were germanised for a long time, so normally we say Dvacet jedna (twenty one) but you can say jedna dvacet as well
We did count as Germans, but in 19
century when we had our Czech revival, we changed it back to the classic counting, but people (mostly old people) still use it while talking
It is similiar to German though, “jednadvacet” is pretty much directly translated from German: “einundzwanzig,” where, if you are describing a double digit number, you first write the number, that you would write second if you wrote numerally
It is also written as one word, same as German and with bigger numbers like: “dvaadvacet,” you also write the word for “and” -> “a” in Czech
This is not the common way to write numbers in Czech, though, some people still say that way and on some occasions you may use it
So yeah, it is pretty germanised
Excuse me for any inconsistencies or missclick, I am writing this on the phone
Yeah
It is the same thing, just translated word for word
We are closer to Germans than Russia lol
I meant more by culture, but yeah
Though we do have a *lot* of words we took from German
Damn you Swiss people, you always need to have everything
Mountains, money, cheese, sense of humor
Meanwhile we cling on to our beer for dear life, because that's all we have going on :(.
Isn't that the case everywhere
AFAIK, employers simply want capable people, who can learn and solve problems
Whether or not you have a degree doesn't matter a lot, that's something important only for you
Hey, out of curiosity, do you think that a high number of graduates from the arts and such is a factor in the relatively high unemployment of young people in Spain
I have no statistics at hand, but I feel like I know quite a lot of Spaniards, but none of them are in the STEM fields
I wouldn't worry about it
I did my studies in Biochemistry and Computer Science
The first one on a good university, the second one on an okay university
And yet, I am a much better software developer than I ever was a biochemist, because I had a lot more passion and interest for CS, did an internship during my studies and spent time learning things on my own
It's all about how much you take from it
I find that the university is only there to give you a basic idea about a lot of things, but to be good at them, you have to use your own initiative
[Mushroom picking
] Though I'm sure it's not unheard of in Western Europe, going out into the forests and picking up shrooms for hours with the whole family is something that's often seen as a curiosity by outsiders
Little children drill the kinds you can pick and the kinds you can't even touch
Even those people who don't eat mushrooms will go out and scavenge
You have regular news reports in summer and autumn about the state of forests and humidity, record finds, favourite spots
To be honest the smell of the mushrooms drying is something that disgusts me for a whole month after one stops collecting, because in a normal apartment, there's nowhere you can leave them
People even start gifting them out when there's far too much to eat or bear the smell, and then it becomes another persons problem
But you don't just throw them out, [never
] (pic's not mine, I was just lazy to go into the cupboard)
Burning the witches on April 30th
Also visiting girls with a willow stick (pomlázka) on Easter Monday
Beating girls with sticks and getting sweets seems unique
We mostly don't do that either
At least I learned about all them with -us and -os as such
On the other hand, it's worth it when a few months later you open the jar and throw a handful into bramboračka
TF less than 10 cents
Lucky
If I want decent rohlík and not the rubbery trash from the supermarket, it's at least 10 cents in conversion
No rohlík for 50 halířů anymore
Are saunas popular in Russia
In a aquapark here, there is a Russian Sauna World, is it just a tourist ploy
Or you really have saunas in wooden cabins outside
I think it is popular in the former Soviet world, because of the lack of food
The west could just buy mushrooms
I do have the need and I am sad it is so expensive to have a sauna
We have it too at home
I never new why, it was just one of the things that just are
somehow knowing what is the day doesn't make my shit anyhow better
Not because Hitler said so
There were % of nazis in Austria than Germany
In fact the anschluss was peaceful because 99
8% of austrians voted for joining the Reich
Well yeah, it wasn’t 100% fair, but sadly vast majority of czechoslovaks still wanted communists in charge
Actually no, in 1946 KSČ only got around 40%, so it was only a plurality and not a majority
Still, it was enough for a coup
>including female animals
How do they enforce that
Does it include wild animals
Northern Hungary joke didn't disappoint
Depends, if only the empire was reunited, it would not directly affect us, since we weren't a part of it
Apart from the fact that it would mean that there is a big and probably very unstable country in the Western Europe that we would have to somehow deal with
If the rest of Europe was restored to the 1812 conditions as well, then we would be back under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy, so I guess we would have our own issues to worry about
The Habsburg monarchy would probably be allied with the French empire for the time being while waiting to stab in the back at a convenient moment
I'd be on the frontlines with a bohemian regiment of the imperial army
Are you afraid to find out, at this point
Oooh yeah, with plums (the most classic here), strawberries, blueberries
but our cuisines are very similar and we took a lot of the dishes
But while we also make this topping, more used is butter, curd, sometimes poppy and sugar
I love fruit dumplings and other sweet main dishes, such a comfort food
I mean, Czech and Austrian cuisine are probably very similar
my French partner is always kinda horrified when I go on about my love of fruit dumplings :D
We don't usually serve them with breadcrumbs, although some people do
My toppings of choice are always some combination of melted butter, sugar, cacao, and/or grated high-fat quark
Our fruit dumplings come in 2 types of dough, either quark or yeasted dough
Potato-based ones go only with poppyseed filling or topping (*šišky s mákem*)
Now I need blueberry ones :(
Come on blueberries,grow
You small
Sure they are, though we mostly use quark or yeast dough
Our fruit dumplings could be also filled with blueberries, strawberries, or plums (my grandma made plum dumplings using potato dough)
My other grandma sometimes made apple dumplings (using quark dough)
Also had a huge dumpling filled with poppy and vanilla sauce, it was called an Alpine Dumpling
I don't know why but I hate sweet pierogi
I've seen varenyky with fruit fillings (cherries I think
) advertised as Ukrainian food here, are those not traditional
I've never heard of them
Found a few recipes online, but they all mention that it's a Slovak dish
The ingredients look basically the same as our yeast dumplings (*ovocné kynuté knedlíky*), except that they're steamed instead of boiled in water
yep, we call them "pěry" in south moravia
My grandma did it commonly both ways, boiled and steamed, I think steamed are also pretty common
Those are quite confusing terms to me, I thought that varenyky was the Ukrainian term and pelmeni Russian for a very similar dish
I hope I didn't just offend anyone :D (Also my grandma comes from Ukraine and calls them pelmeni, so IDK
You're giving me dangerous ideas
Combining fruit dumplings with the vanilla sauce from *buchtičky s krémem*? Sounds like a winner to me
Here's a recipe that sounds pretty classic to me -  (replacing the pits with sugar cubes is one part of the recipe I've never seen in Czechia, my grandma just leaves the pits in, but this sounds like a better idea)
This is a potato version -  but potato dough goes better with savory stuff, IMO, which can also mean stuffed dumplings -
But that's like potato mash from a box
Making either kind of dough from scratch is worth it, I promise
Make a big batch and freeze them
Although I do pity people who can't get any fruit dumplings in restaurants
Ah, OK, that wasn't so complicated after all
Thanks
Yeah we do, but not with sour cream, that's an interesting combo
Döner is the safe late night choice here as well and I'm not complaining
Or, if there is the option, a rotisserie chicken or a klobása  though most of these places close rather early so you gotta know where to go
Always bramborák/kartoffelpuffer
[Prague Castle] comes to mind first
I don't know if it counts because it is a complex of multiple buildings
It is a defining part of Prague's panorama and instantly recognizable all around the world
The Prague Castle
The Charles Bridge
Prague Astronomical Clock
These are the most well known and instantly recognizable monuments of Prague
There are many more outside of Prague but these ones I named are just unmistakable
I'd say the Prague Castle, but that's not a single building
Then probably the St
Vitus Cathedral in Prague - a part of the Prague Castle
not technically a building but the "brněnský čurák"
If that photo included Charles Bridge, I would agree 100%
brněnský čurák?
Yes, I was also considering the clock, but the castle's history is over half of millennia longer
most people I can see are using some kind of trek/mountain bike
Makes a perfect sense to me
Prague is not just nice asphalt paths, especially if you need to cross downtown areas, these "dutch" style heavy city bicycles, with couple of gears if ever are not really handy too considering the difference between highest and lowest point in Prague is more than in whole Denmark and about whole Netherlands
In general commuting in Prague is not really a thing  unless you have it close and flat, you don't mind taking 3x longer route due to terrain, you are fit enough to handle terrain,  you don't mind weather will be often against you and you don't shit yourself cycling in traffic
One of our most famous hockey players (Jaromír Jágr) got booee by the public for staring in an electric bike ad
I am more a cat person, but certainly can enjoy raw steak tartare or something similar
But eating raw meat is certainly not just an European trait, what differs is the kind of meat that is culturally considered edible uncooked, for example consider the popularity of raw fish in Japan or beef in some countries of Southeastern Asia
Who the fuck eats raw meat
Except sushi/salmon I strongly agree
Example of this ignorance
Hej hej tatarák je chutná božsky
I think I could make that from head
But normal everyday people dont know this
Why should they
Well you dont use it in everyday life
You tend to forget
I read about a lot of stuff but memorizing African countries, which some hardly contribute to world economics or events, isnt that high on my importance list
I think history and how things work (physics, biology and chemistry) to be more valuable
Sure geography too but you dont really have to know much about Kazakhstan or west/central Africa
I guess you have different view on it
After all Senegal and other countries were your colonies, etc
nope but been in abandoned and unfinished nuclear power plant at Kazantyp
Well, let’s see:
5th Century - 1526
1918 - 1939
1945 - present
( I count Czechoslovakia as our country being free)
1918 - 1939 ( thanks Allies )
1945 - 1949 ( communists took over )
1989 ( Democrats take over ) - 1993 ( the divide of Czechoslovakia )
1993 - onwards as the Czech republic
London
It's an amazing city in terms of things to see and do, but I found the spatial planning horrendous
It feels extremely cramped and there's nowhere to move
More of it should be pedestrianised
In Czechia the barkeep wouldnt care, and he would likely ask if you want Griotka (Cherry  flavour liquor),  Egg nog or Zelená ('The Green', liquor with appearance and taste of mint mouthwash)
These are the cheapest options, all very sweet and not much strong
When starting grammar school the teacher mentioned
- Sumer
- Assyria, Babylon
- Persia (not much)
- Celtic and Germanic people (living in the areas of our country)
- various ancient civilisations in Anatolia (Phrygia, the Hittites, Lydia)
- Egypt
- Greece
- Rome
- ancient India and China (in about 2 lessons so)
We were teaching a bit about Mesopotamia, Hittites, more about Egypt, even more about Greece and Rome and also something about Germans and Celts, because they lived here
Like in the English word huh
And it's easy to differentiate because "a" is a vowel and "h" is not
(And they sound different)
it's like if you said huh but without the uh, or like a minecraft villager noise but shorter
It's exactly the same in Czech
Vatican, because I am too fat to fit in there
Never consider
None
However, UK is the least appealing to me
Monaco, though the F1 GP is extremely tempting
More like, why yes
What's there to see
Also world's top source of disappointed tourists
Be specific
Just because it's popular does not mean it's worth it
Tourists are just a herd
"*Tramtárie*". It's either a corruption of the word "*Tatárie"*/ "*Tartárie*" ("the land of Tatars") or just a meanigless onomatopoetic word, possibly connected with a sound of a fanfare ("*tramtarará*")
Imaginary-Tramtárie-Tramtaria
Also "prdel světa" meaning "ass of the world"
can't remember exact words as it is years ago but it was something like Imagine how this place would look if we didn't jumped into war
(probably WW2), from American, in Prague
we have same thing, usually these two weeks when there is a final exam for oldest ones
Some schools like restaurant&hotel industry related have this as a part of regular schedule for whole year
As far as guns go, Czech republic is the second most liberalised gun country in the world after (certain States of) the US
Here you can own semi automatic (and under very strict conditions even automatic) firearms for self defence purposes and you can conceal carry up to 2 semi automatic handguns provided you stay away from places that don't allow them (malls, schools etc)
There are about 300 000 such permits and under some estimates, even up to 7% of households have a self defence gun permit
Lately, the right to defend one's life and health with a firearm has been added to charter of fundamental human rights
And we're I believe the only country in Europe with a shall-issue gun permit
Meaning if you don't get it, the burden of proof why not is on the administration and they are not free to deny you without grounds
As far as laws for actual self defence (and use of aforementioned firearms in our case), it is similar to other countries in Europe
You have instances of necessity and immediate self-defence
It's definetely not a castle doctrine and in all instances must be strictly proportionate to the danger and it must be a last resort
I wouldn’t say Czech law is similar as American one
The proportionality of attack is crucial
I would mention the case when a man caught robbers in his barn
They started to run, and he fired with crossbow, killed one of them, and got to jail
Also numbers of guns aren’t comparable
Isn’t it like 5% of people owning the gun
The right to own you talk about, it is a new thing, that populists added few years back to make very small and very loud minority happy
It was response to paneuropean law banning extended ammunition clips and other stuff, that has no reason to be owned by civilians
Well, it has a lot to do with how many people actually own a gun
In US (where a gun violence has always been crazy high), it's probably pretty common for most households to have at least one
On the other hand, most Czech people don't want to own a gun, even though we can
(And personally I'm really grateful it's that way
We have *Městská policie* (City/town police) and *Státní policie* (Country police)
Town police operates in their own town, or sometimes, when asked, can help a neighbouring town
The country police can and does operate everywhere
Country police has much more rights and is the "important" one, they handle more important/bigger crimes, while the town police does a small things for the town (patrols, helping children to cross the street infront of the school etc)
We also have military police, but it has entirely different meaning
It is a police force inside the army (although still part of the police force)
It protects property operated by the Ministry of Defence
No, military police is rarely involved in civil issues
Such a thing would raise a lot of eyebrows why is military budget used to supply police work
State police might be a better translation
Czechoslovakia used to have *četnictvo* rural military police similar to the gendarmerie but it got integrated after WW2
> "important" one
I think měšťáci would disagree with this classification :D
I originally wanted to write state police, but then I changed it, because it might get someone confused, states sometimes mean a region of a country, not a country itself (in USA or Germany for example)
I knew *četnictvo* existed, but I wasn't sure what was its job, because I wasn't born yet, when it existed
Yeah, that's why I put it in inverted commas, just in case :D
The word “robot” was first used in the 1920 play “R.U.R.” by Karel Čapek (though the word was invented by his brother Josef Čapek)
It was basically a play about automatons talking over society
He needed a name for them and his brother delivered
At first it didn’t really seen like it, but when I think about, the word “robot” is totally a czech word
It comes from the term “robota” which means forced labour (or just labour), but it’s hardly ever used today
Nowadays, the word is used worldwide, but I think that not enough people know of it’s origins
> which means forced labour
I believe the English (or rather French, but used in English) term is corvée.
In czech ,,kolo" means wheel and circle is ,,kruh" but dimunitive for ,,kolo" (kolečko) can also mean circle
okruzhnist (geometry) is kružnice in Czech
also, neděle means both Sunday and week in Czech (but the „week“ meaning is much less used, it's more like oldfashioned but the meaning is preserved)
You do not learn any world history before USA came to be
:-)
We did, although not very in-depth, but there was some prehistory, Greece, Rome, then focus shifted to early local history (Great Moravia), then to medieval Czech rulers and their shenanigans, a quick look at world events when America was discovered, Renaissance, 30 yrs war, Habsburgs, French revolution, Napoleon, WW1 and then there was usually not enough time to finish the plan, so we got some lessons on WW2 and that was it, more or less
However, there were also separate lessons on history of literature that complemented the history lessons, especially in culturally important periods
I was in an elementary school at the turn of 1980s/1990s, high school until 1999, so there was some shift from pro-communist version of history towards a more balanced approach during my curriculum, but the old communist (or even Austro-Hungarian) approach to history as a sequence of important rulers and events that leads to social progress was still lingering around in the 1990
In a retrospect, when I remember school history lessons, medieval ages mostly come to mind, with all the easily examinable but memory-heavy stuff like who was whose son, when did a war take a place and so on
It's 9+4 years of having history lessons, both world history and national
Somehow the last 70 years get as much attention as fucking 30 Years War
We oversimplify the most important bits
yes, if two monarchs marry each other, and the produce an heir
The heir will inherit both countries
So the our system is:
Compulsory education is now 9 years (was 10 when I was in school) and is usually completely covered by primary education with elementary schools for 9 years
Complete secondary education which is necessary for universities takes at least 4 years so people starting with universities at age 19-20
I started at 18, but that's only because I started elementary school at 5, born in November
19 is usual
But if I studied "učiliště" (for practical teaching of trades, only 3 years, you don't do maturita and don't get highschool diploma, only "výuční list" and you can't go to uni with that), I'd end it at 17
Or even sooner, there are some programs for only 2 years but that's mostly for people who really can't manage more education
Some generation ago it was even common because they had only 8 years of "základní škola" (elementary + middle school), but we have 9 for some time now
And the ending of uni is different, depends on the program
Bc is 3 years, magister is either bc + 2 years or 5 years in a row, medics have 6 years instead and you can also study bit longer, I had 6 years instead of 5 because of half a year pause
You probably know but anyway
I would add that the the standard age for entering school is 6, but 7 is common too
5 is allowed in special cases, but rare
The children must pass a specialist examination if the parents want them to enter school earlier or later
My town, called Trutnov, has been named after a knight, called Trut, who has defeated a dragon, living in a nearby cave
The story goes something like this:
Two lumberjacks have heard a raven going crazy, when they decided to investigate they found a dragon sleeping in a cave
The lumberjacks ran in to the town to alert a knight Trut (full name: Albrecht from Trautenberg)
He, with help of the towns folk, set up a trap and killed the dragon
The dragon was skinned and its skin filled with wooden chips
Later gifted to the city of Brno (second largest city in Czechia)
Where he is still to this day
Every year there's a small festival celebrating this story
Towns coat of arms:
The "dragon" (in Brno)
Most common theory is that it comes from word describing forest removal with fire, that happened here during early middle age
Modern word for roasting have the same origin
Its called Protivín, adjective “protivný” means something like hateful, but the name originated from a Duke Protiva, who was the first mayor of the city
My birth town is named after smoke, because when my country was founded
A friend of the founder lit up a fire to form a smoke signal, that alerted the founder of him finding a better place in my country than the founder found
You mean Czechia
I feel like correcting it because it looks like Chechnya
And I've never heard of the legend that they met again
That's interesting
I never heard this version of the legend
In Brno the legend says it lived by Svratka river and was killed by butcher aprentice
Man learns something new every day
Yes
When I visited Brno, I remmeber being like: „What the hell
“ there was no mention of our towns generous gift
Guess stories change through time
Maybe you could remember that Czechia is called Czechy in Polish (according to Wikipedia at least) so you only change the "y" into "ia".
But to be honest, it seems to me that Czechs still prefer Czech Republic to Czechia
My grandma always said it like *vrrrrba, vrrrrba* (which means "willow") so I do it this way too but she was a Slovak so I don't know if it's the Czech way or the Slovak way or whether she made it up
Otherwise I have never heard anyone making the sound, maybe it's the same way as we express growling: *vrrrrr*?
I think we just imitate the sound and don't use a word for it
The act itself is called předení (spinning a string)
Mňau same pronunciation as English
Yeah
I think that we use it with "v" like in growling, but truth is that I have never heard it to
we usualy say that the cat "přede".
I don't think we have a word for it the sound itself, though if I had to make it, I would also say "vrrrrr". The act of purring is called "vrnět" after all
Charles University
Charles University in Prague and Masaryk University in Brno as a whole, but there are also very high quality specialist schools like engineering ČVUT and VUT or chemical VŠCHT
Charles University
Founded in 1348
Čvut & MatFyz
Can confirm, I had classes when I was the only Czech in the room
Ehm, I mean yeah you’re not wrong
\+ Czech technical university (ČVUT)  in Prague
In Slavic mythology, vodyanoy, vodyanoi, vodník, wodnik, hastrman or Wassermann is a male water spirit often depicted as a frog man or a little green man in green suit
He was lurking in sweet water waiting to drown people and steal their soul
He would keep them in small porcelain cup
Do you have something similar in southern Europe
Maybe living in salt water on the coast
Beside mermaids
Vodníks in Čtvrtek's tales didn't drown anyone and help heroes and punish villains
And Čochtan in Werich's Fimfarum was against drowning at general, because it is pollution
There are some stories like this too, the most known is Vodník in the Kytice compilation from K. J. Erben
It's horror poem about a girl not being careful enough, being kidnapped by vodník into the lake, him marrying her and having child with her
Then she pleaded to visit her mother, so he let her, but the mother didn't want to let her go back - and when the vodník came for her, saying she needs to go back "home", the baby needs to eat and what not and the mother kept sending him away, he left and let the decapitated baby by their door
But the man luring people into the water, drowning them and storing their souls is more known
So no tales or fables or anything like that is common anymore
Because in Czech Republic we have lots of books and movies about that kind of creatures
Mostly for children and is a really big part of our culture
Fresh or spring water
Water which is not salty
Its direct translation from my language and I didnt even realize it
this guy plays EU4
Yes, that checks out
Both are thumbs but the toe is called feet thumb
Or better, thumb beside feet
Anything involving high speed chases
There is no way the cars would survive Czech highways at such speeds
Cops in car cautiously stopping another car
In US police procedurals tracking down a suspect often hinges on having their social security number
We have a citizen registry - the government knows where you live (or where you say you do)
Shockingly its still the case in many rural areas of Sjælland not far from Copenhagen
Act causually and switch to garlic diet
On YouTube, there are a plenty of real-life chases posted by Czech police forces
In lots of them the car crashes in the end though
Because you're not as different as you think you are
If one person said the food is bad, it might be anything; if one hundred people said the food is bad, you'd better believe it's bad
We've got Literary Czech (*spisovná čeština*) which is meant to be used *when writing* and ideally when speaking in a formal setting but I wouldn't call it a typical dialect because it doesn't really naturally occur anywhere, it's a variant of Czech based on the 16th century Western Moravian dialects and then polished by national revivalists in the 19th century into the current form
There are regions in Western Moravia which speak closely to it but they still sometimes differ in regional expressions and pronunciation
Typically reporters in public television or radio speak Standard Czech (those in private ones not so much), teachers are sorta supposed to speak it and correct children to use it, and if you want to be polite, you'll use it when contacting authorities, being at a job interview or other formal situations, for example when I consult something with a teacher at university I speak normally in my rather thick Prague accent but when I am examined by the very same teacher I try to speak in Standard Czech though I'm not always successful
It's also the variant of language foreigners will likely learn so if you want to make yourself more comprehensible, you'll speak slowly and switch to Standard Czech
Then there's Colloquial Czech (*hovorová čeština*) which is a spoken variant of Literary Czech meant to be used in conversations, and is a bit less formal, with words altered for easier pronunciation and more open to influence of vernacular dialects
These two are however still standardised
The most widespread dialect on the other hand is Common Czech (*obecná čeština*), an interdialect based on Central Bohemian dialects which evolved more or less separatedly and which gradually replaces regional dialects
You may most commonly encounter it when speaking with others in a normal setting or in media (films, series, etc
People living in Prague and other big cities, even when coming from areas where other dialects are spoken, often eventually adopt this one, same us foreigners who live among Czechs
Totally, even the people from the capital have their dialect and others cannot stand it
Honestly as I am person from east-mid Moravia the thing u call Common Czech (obecná čeština) is something that tears my ears every time I hear it even on TV, radios etc
It is something really disgusting
>hen speaking with others in a normal setting or in media (films, series, etc
People living in Prag
Sure thing
What i dislike about Common Czech is it simplification of inflection, lets take an adjective "malý (small/little)" with a various substantives for example
It is also important to say that Czech Language distinguishes 3 genders (masculine, feminine and neutral)
Let's start with expresion "little dog". Word dog has a masculine gender in czech and in correct form we can traslate it as "mal(ý) pes", in common czech people would say something like "mal(ej) pes" the ending "ej" just doesn't sound right
Another problem is with endings in the plural form of adjectives
Usually correct endings for plural adjectives are "í/é" for masculine, "é" for feminine and "á" for neutral, but in common czech people would use ending "ý" for every plural adjective
Masculine: mal(í) hadi (little snakes) - > mal(ý) hadi
Feminine: mal(é) kočky (little cats) -> mal(ý) kočky
Neutral: mal(á) auta (little cars) -> mal(ý) auta
I can go on with another examples but i can't procrastinate any longer :D if you wish to know more than you can go to wiki: [ where is way more info and better described than what i can give you here
What should be the same in the whole EU but is not yet
For example, I think there shoul be one policy for daytime running lights
I think every country has it's own rules now
Gay marriage should be **legal** across the EU
Disability card
Currently, the pan-EU disability card has been only implemented in 8 countries
Even sadder is that it's countries' decision
Czech Republic decided not to join, so Czech citizens don't get benefits abroad -- but foreign citizens don't get benefits in Czech Republic
Maybe a little bit of money has been saved, in expense of disabled people
When you are driving in CZ your lights have to be on all the time (during the day, during the summer, etc)
In Germany you only have lights on during night /dark
Yes, but only on dividends
I love the way Estonia handles corporate taxes and such a system should be completely valid
No, I don't think we will
In EU for 15 years and EU don't really care, because there were written like "eventually" so we didn't do anything wrong yet
Minimum wage is just ban of work and you have to be on welfare if you want to live
Disgusting leeches
Why Switzerland doesnt have minimum wage
Modern cars with small LED lights are not consuming so much electricity
But I hate when I look at my rear mirror and can't tell if that car is parked or driving
When you are driving in CZ your lights have to be on all the time (during the day, during the summer, etc)
In Germany you only have lights on during night /dark
I feel like it's better this way
Cars are more visible in traffic mirrors and there's a clear distinction between which car is moving/operating and which isn't. I live in an area with a lot of unclear intersections, some of which use multiple mirrors, and cars with unlit headlights are basically invisible in them up until the last moment due to the terrain etc
, that law is a blessing
Except it will not
Lev is pegged to euro (strictly pegged to the currency board)
We are obligated to eventually adopt euro once we meet those conditions, but are we gonna
Nope
That's the point of eventually, we have all the time in the world to do it and by the time, EU just won't exist anymore
You can tell which car is driving and which is parked
We've got "plněné knedlíky", different doughs with different savory and sweet fillings
Potato-based, [quark] and leavened dough, can be filled with smoked meat, sauerkraut, plums, strawberries, pears, or apricots
But those aren't filled
OP was specifically asking about dumplings with fillings
If you don't need fillings to qualify, oh boy
Bramborové knedlíky (potato d.)
Kynuté knedlíky (leavened d.)
Houskové knedlíky (bread-enhanced leavened d.)
Karlovarské knedlíky (bread-and-herbs-enhanced d.)
Chlupaté knedlíky (lit
hairy dumplings, made with grated potatoes)
Noky (gnocchi) Halušky (smaller gnocchi)
Kapání (drops - miniature gnocchi)
Šulánky (different kind of gnocchi), typically served with poppy and plum jam
Játrové knedlíčky (liver dumplings, excellent in soups)
I'm sure I'm missing some :)
Four letters for one sound
Horrible
More like roasted boar
- Opening beer bottles just with the things you have
- random card games
- trying to save as much money in different ways
- figuring out, how to get through a city, while there's a roadwork
- [Pebble hunt] basically, everytime you go on a trip you can find little pebbles, the pebbles are decorated like a painting
On the vack side, there is a post code by the painter
You can either keep them, or you can leave them on a different place, or post on facebook
Thank you
Also don’t worry about language
We don’t expect visitors to speak Czech
For me Its the Netherlands I went there when I was 19 when I finished high school even tho the job Ive done was quite shitty I really enjoyed my time there, I was blown Away by the public transport and the way how the country was organised, I lived in the small town called Vught and people were very nice to me, this experience was definitelly valuable for me
Dankjewel Nederland
Romania, absolutely
Poland is really nice too
Visited both already and hope I'll come again soon
Also I wish I'll visit Ukraine one day, met many nice people from there here in Czechia
Estonia and Slovenia
Cute little underrated countries
Also Slovenia is like our small forgotten twin
Italy
One of the most beautiful countrysides in the world, plus the culture and people just feel very refreshing
I would recommend Prague if you ever go there
It’s a really beautiful city
Very historic
Edit: also Karlovy Vary is very beautiful too
I was planning to visit Prague but corona virus and we had to close of individual states
For me, it is France
I love the language and I would like to visit the Eiffel Tower
Aw, glad to hear
I’ve been learning German for over a year and traveled through a small part with my German boyfriend
I’m planning to travel all over Germany during my Erasmus next spring
It feels like Czech republic spanning over a greater area and with generational wealth, meaning a larger number of gorgeous castles and fancy governmental buildings
Just before covid, I made a three-day trip to Krakow and Birkenau with a friend, and I want to go back so bad, then continue to more cities
And finally, Austria
Shared history still makes me feel like we are estranged cousins
I grew up not far from Vienna, went to Laa an der Thaya as a kid, and I was skiing in the Apls every winter pre-covid
I like the language, and the cars they used to make
Here are some of my favorite Czech songs
Also could you please send me a link for the list, once you’re done
:-D
I miss you to Guys, nearest Austrian city(Retz) is like 15min by car from my home and It really frustrate me that I cant visit
Wow
It’s close to perfect
Two small typos not changing any meaning
I know plenty foreigners living here for years not even close to this level
You just abused periods quite a lot
Yeah, I thought the same thing and it was great that Den Bosch was very close I enjoyed this city aswell, great architecture and amazing Nightlife
But FIAT made a killing on the first Panda
Well, yes
But I meant cars where there is at least 0
00000001% chance I could ever get to have
Ight, I’ll send you a dm
Only if it's from the Carroze region
I'm going to show you the very few very small mistakes you have made since you asked for them, but please, don't take it badly, you have done amazing job and I'm amazed, how well you know czech
Instead of těžčí, the correct form would be těžší, but the pronounciation would be basically the same
I have seen even some czech people make similar mistakes
Čeština is feminine, so you should say "čeština je jiná" (not jiný)
You could say "čeština je jiný jazyk", then it would be correct
And at last the commas
"Také je pro mě zajímavé", here there is no need for a comma
"...je jiná, a každá věc..." - generally speaking, you shouldn't use comma before "a". There are some situation, when you should, but those are in minority so it is safer to not put a comma there
Again, you have done amazing job, keep it up and good luck
our language love these complex sentences, basically mastering a writing skill is just mastering these complex sentences
But there is nothing wrong with using just some narrow simple sentences, it's an easy way out how to avoid dealing with this
The rule where to apply period and where not is insanely complex, expecting you fully understand the grammatical role of every word in the sentence
In a short almost every conjunction like "a" "ale"  etc have version both with and without period depending the whole context
But there are many exceptions and also whole context came to play and might change the rule
Don't worry about it, it is a clusterfuck for us too
For example, when "a" conjunction is used for merging information period is not used
for example
"Šli jsme k horským jezerům a potom lovili ryby
we went to mountain lakes and then fishing
so the period before a is wrong in this case "že čeština je úplně jiný, a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost"     (and for the same reason there should not have to be peridod before mi)
but when "a" conjunction is used to graduating the information or negating or some other meaning then there is usually period
Here is an example:
Slíbil mi návštěvu, a vůbec se tu neukázal
(he promised a visit but he doesn't show up at all)
Svalil se na zem, a protihráč se ho přitom ani nedotkl
(he fall down but the player didn't even touch him)
Sounds like when you can also use anything else than "and" in english version, or or just single "and" would sound very odd is the case where you probably should use period, where the simple "and" do the job you don't.
Not OP, but: Čeština je těžší než další jazyky, které jsem se naučil, ale mám cizí jazyky velmi rád. Také je pro mě zajímavé, že čeština je úplně jiná a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost
I would have still probably written some things differently, but this definitely sounds more natural
That thing was a shoebox with a mouse on meth under the hood
I found myself looking at a few older Fiats I could possibly buy in the future, like Regatta or Uno
And yeah, Alfas and especially Lancias are legendary, I think Delta Integrale is one of the best looking cars ever made
Grandpa had 1st gen Panda, drove it on a field few times, funny thing
I couldn't really care less
If I had to choose, I would probably go for Czech one, seems like the less boring option
looks like Czech version is the literal translation of English one, same body parts in exact same order
Same words (just translated), but different melody
Hlava, ramena, kolena, palce, kolena, palce
Hlava, ramena, kolena, palce
oči, uši pusa nos
Can't decide between President and Prime Minister
Both equally shit
Currently Miroslav Kalousek
He was the secretary of finances during the 2009+ economic depression
He’s hated because everyone thinks he causes the crisis by stealing the tax money
Of course, all of it is just a slander and he’s actually one of the best politicians we’ve ever had
Is Cromwell really hated
He always seemed like a Great leader that was just trying his best to make a more democratic system work while failing miserably
Too many idiots think that the economy is somehow supposed to grow (and pensions along with it) during a global recession
And here I was in another thread, complaining that Tesco stores are inconveniently large, because it takes like 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other
I can't imagine how large your stores have to be to contain all this *variety*.
We use rock paper scissors as well but in different order, rock scissors paper (kámen nůžky papír)
Yeah same here
I've never heard about it
I live with my girlfriend and our 4 month old son, we almost exclusively cook at home, so we only spend about 120€/month
However, I know people who spend about the same amount a week, so I guess it's pretty subjective
No idea about the whole country, but my household of 3 spends ~550 € per month on groceries (i.e. not counting eating out, that's another ~250 €)
Wait, that would be 100 Kč/day for 3 people
How on the earth 3 people can eat for that amount
Turkish president’s advisor claimed on public tv interview that there is no such country as Czechia, all the real men left the country and set up Slovakia
"How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing"

Neville Chamberlain, 28 September 1938
This isn’t exactly a long term problem, rather a short episode - diplomatic incident
Our police arrested Kurdish politician on Interpol warrant issued by Turkey, but he was released and Turkey doesn’t like that at all and accused us from supporting terrorism
Ahh yes, Netherlands the place of death, grim and fire
No, if they aren't citisens, they shouldn't vote, but if they will become citisens (dual citisenship or just regullar citisens) then I don't see problem
For the majority including me, it doesn't "feel" right
But so far I haven't found any *logical* argument why should it be like this
EU nationals with permanent residence can vote in the local elections and EP elections, why shouldn't they be allowed to vote in the national elections
The usual argument "because they can move away and thus don't have the interests of the country at heart" doesn't stand the criticism: any citizen can easily move to other region at any moment, yet local elections being held
Any citizen can move to another EU country (or even non-EU country) at any moment
The "commitment proven by time" could be established, and it's called permanent residence permit
Isn't your father eligible for Spanish citizenship after 30 years
Or in general, what would be the difference between permanent residence and citizenship if you allow permanent residents to vote
Born 1971, Czechoslovakia
This question is often asked in this subredit, so I compiled some of my answers together:
There were no real election between 1948 and 1990
There was always only one candidate you can vote for
In theory, you could choose to vote or not, but if you chose to not vote, you could be punished
Before 1990 there were no private companies or schools or hospitals under communist regime
Everything was under party's control
Justice was controlled by state too, so there was no real possibility to defend yourself in court against the state
Media too - under communist rule, a lot of things was censored
My favorite example is year 1973 in Czechoslovakia, when a lot of catastrophic things happened, but a lot of them was censored or just partially reported
The state decided what movies will be allowed in cinemas or tv, what music will be released etc
The same with books - even content of some books was modified - for example in The Day of the Triffids it was China, where Triffids were created, not USSR
Lot's of propaganda in elementary school - we read stories about heroic Soviet soldiers protecting us against imperialists
Russian language was mandatory
Limited range of products in shops - there was always at least basic food to buy, but if you wanted some better - let's say better meat cut, you had to have "friend" in the shop and he hid it for you "under the counter" - at various times there were various scarce products - sometimes nails, or car parts or plumbing seals or hammers etc
There were a few weeks where there was a shortage of toilet paper and menstrual pads - that was tough :) Basic food was relatively cheap, because it was subsidized
My friend camped whole night before shop to get socialist clone of ZX spectrum 8bit computer - they had only 3
Everyone had job, because working was mandatory
Who didn't work was "parasite" and was sent to prison
We had saying: "We pretend we work, they pretend they pay us
" In lot's of factories there was a lot of obsolete machines - like lathes from 50s.
Criticism wasn't welcome - Yes-men were promoted and critics punished
This principle was however also system's undoing
Problems were ignored, warning voices were silenced, but in the end, reality always win
We had saying: "If everything belongs to everyone, then nobody has anything
People could not travel freely outside the country - it was easier if you wanted travel do "friendly socialist country", it was much harder for the West
&#x200B;
In the eighties:
If you wanted to have "amateur garage" music band, you had to get permission from ideological commission
One time somebody at night placed an empty bottle into hand of Lenin's statue
There was an extensive police investigation, the offender was never found
One time they found something like small neo-nazi group at one of the local school
As a result, in our high school, everything with English phrases was banned (like t-shirts, pen cases, bags etc)
A daily schedule of planed economics was clearly defined, so if you was outside during working/school hours - let's say between 9AM and 2PM, cop could ask you what are you doing there and he could ask you to show him your ID - it happened to me a twice - when I was out to my doctor appointment
Before the communist regime fell, street names were like: Missile street, Artillery street, Gunner street , Army street
After that they were renamed to American street, French street, Danish street etc
Ruling communist party scratched their heads because Soviet Union now wanted them to implement the same reforms they sent tanks to stop 17 year ago
Big communist propaganda billboards everywhere
You could get jeans, digital watch or pirated videotapes on black market
Jammers were disabled so you could tune in to Polish TV and see some boobs or Hi-men cartoon
If you slightly rebelled against the regime it was kind of lottery (in the 80s) - you could end in jail or you could be left alone with warning
Comrade (soudruh in Czech) was common official address in formal situations, for example, in elementary school, students addressed teachers as comrade teacher, even if he or she wasn't member of the party
You could be called comrade by someone in the position of authority, like policeman, boss etc
In movies and TV shows everyone addressed each other comrade, but in normal life and in normal situations it wasn't common, at least in 80s.
Dont ask, you will see it under the command of Angela Merkel and other western leftist
Czechia was 8th economy in the world before socialism and communism influence
At 1989 we had 1/3 of wage of germany
Enjoy 60+% economic decline
Or you can buy bitcoin
My dad told me in the 80s there were actually some American films playing in cinemas
Notably, he saw E.T and Rambo
Apparently if a film was deemed to be critical of the US, it would get a pass
There's was also a reasonable amount of French and Italian media content because those countries were considered friendly (big commie presence)
Listening to Austrian radio was illegal, but lots of people still did it because it had music in English
I think Ö3 was the main one
E.T. was in cinemas, but [Rambo wasn't] \- I'm sure of it, because half of my family worked in the cinema and i had free access to all screenings
Rambo (and many other movies and porn) was available on black market VHS tapes, dubbed (horribly) by a one guy
About E.T. - Eliot in the movie had [this speaking toy] \- until the fall of communism I was sure it's just sci-fi prop, because digital children toy which is able to speak what is typed on keyboard was something so advanced to me that it never occurred to me that it was something that could be bought in a normal shop
Alien was in cinemas in mid 80ies
Can't recall if it was from 15 or 18 years because parents didn't let me in
>Listening to Austrian radio was illegal,
was not
Even in the the 80s it was clear that the future is in CNC machines, at least on industrial level
Yeah
people in the Ukraine were starving for change during the communist era
I remember seeing a documentary about Romanian orphanages when I was a kid
I didn't sleep for a week
Hmm, maybe it wasn't Rambo
I'll ask again but I'm sure it was some relatively well known American action movie
Any ideas what was screened back then
I remember Raiders of the Lost Ark (I've seen it at least ten times), Alien, Beverly Hills Cop, Jaws,  Grease, Papillon, Fort Apache the Bronx
I've seen starwars (IV) in 84 here, it was on betamax with shitty voiceover dubbing all done by one person
There are a lot, here are some from the top of my head
Nejsem ve sví kůži (i'm not in my own skin) - you are sucking at something you are usually very good at
Pověsim tě za uši do průvanu (i'm gonna hang you by the ears in the draft) - said as a warning to kids when they don't want to behave
Nosit dříví do lesa (take wood into the forest) - do something that is completely unnecessary
Máš za zadkem černocha
(Do you have a black man behind your butt
) - said when you don't close the door
Natáhnout bačkory (to stretch the slippers) - to die
Hrát na nervy (play on someones nerves) - be very annoying
Hodit šavli (to throw a saber) - to vomit
Vyspat se do růžova (sleep to the pink) - have a good sleep
And some more
Prodal by plešatýmu hřeben (he can sell comb to a bald guy) He is so convincing that he can make everyone like thing he talks about
"Spadl z višně" - fell from a cherry tree, aka has stupid ideas
"Malovat čerta na zeď" - to paint a demon on the wall, meaning being too pessimistic
"Dělá vlny" - he's making waves, as in doesn't want to cooperate, agree, or reach a concensus
"Dělat mrtvého brouka" - to play a dead beetle; pretending you're not there
"Hodit ručník do ringu" - to throw a towel in the (boxing) ring, meaning to give up
"Chytit vlka/housera" - to catch a wolf/male goose
Wolf = getting a skin rash from wearing wet trousers/pants
Goose = lumbago
"Mít ostré lokty" - having sharp elbows
To play hard
Not just in sports
Edit: forgot my favourites,
"Mít v malíku" - to have in one's littlefinger, same as in Polish
To be skilled or knowledgeable about something
"Vycucat si z prstu" - to suck (something) out of one's littlefinger - as in where am I supposed to get that
"Zpít se pod obraz" - to get drunk under the painting, derived from "obraz boží" = god's image
Geting so drunk you resemble an animal more than a man
We have "We (speak) about shit and shit is on our shoes"
Good ones, just to add:
>Nejsem ve sví kůži (i'm not in my own skin) - you are sucking at something you are usually very good at
I percieve it more as "I don't feel comfortable/I feel weird" in a sense that it's just not my day, I didn't slept well etc
Maybe regional difference, I guess
&#x200B;
>Máš za zadkem černocha
(Do you have a black man behind your butt
) - said when you don't close the door
I know "Tady má někdo v zadku oje
" - Somebody has a pole in their ass
More specifically, "oj" is the pole that connects cart with a cargo
The image is that you cannot really turn yourself and close the door if you are the "cart" in this situation
&#x200B;
And some others:
"To je mi platné jak mrtvému zimník" = "That is useful (lit
valid) to me as a winter coat to a corpse" = It's useless to me
"Sbalit si svých pět švestek" = "Pack up your five plums" = Prepare to leave
"Mít v hlavě piliny" = "To have a sawdust in the head" = To be dumb as a rock
"Být o hlavu kratší" = "To be shorter by a head" = To be decapitated
"Přijít <něčemu> na kloub" = "To come up to <something's> joint (like in a knee, not the one with weed)" = Figure something out
From my experience, I am completely able to talk to someone who speaks slovak, unless they start to talk fast, because then I have a little issue to understand everything , but It's still okay
In Poland, Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria I got okay with Not knowing their language, but it really needed both sides to be interested in having a conversation together
Polish is the most understandable out of those, then slovenian then croatia and then bulgarian
I haven't been to any other countries where they speak a slavic language, but I imagine in other south slavic countries it would Beiing pretty similliar, but east slavic would be probably a problem
In Czech Republic everybody will understand you in Slovakia, almost everybody will understand you in Croatia and some people will slightly understand you at the borders with Poland, Germany and Austria
German is common second foreign language option (after mandatory English), but reality is that most people just never learn it to a sufficient level and then also never use it
Maybe in border areas, but otherwise your chances would be fairly slim
It's like this:
The only way I can tell I'm in Germany is disappearing of speed limit on my navigation
traffic signs starts to be a bit different and that's it
and there is usually German police car parket at the place where D8 highway turns into A17 but never seen them doing anything else than stopping trucks from time to time
Only way I can notice i am crossing a border are signs warning you that you are and maybe a difference in road quality
You get on a road that leads to your desired destination, and you drive
That's it

How many screws
I have about five in my fibula head + some other piece of metal
(stupid while drunk, obviously)
Russian furries
Well that's new
But I have to agree, he is cute
Boyfriend lol, it would have to be a big bed for the 109
Oh thats what I have in smaller version just on the other side
Next to ankle
Beer, chocolate, Hercule Poirot
[Rudest word in the universe
EU,  Spa Francorchamps, De Bruyne, Lukaku
Charlotte De Witte
And chocolate
Bricks
Chocolate and the fact that they think that they have better beer than us
Chocolate, your flag, EU headquarters
Slovakia
I mean they are basically just northern Hungary
Well
almost everybody
All
But hot spot is Slovakia, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic and Probably UK and USA
Slovakia
Anything under 25° is heresy
It's currently 23° and I am pissed
23C which is fine
I can deal with 18C, but everything lower is not acceptable, not even for sleeping, since my nose and/or feet get cold and I cannot fall asleep
Fuck that, anything over 24,5 Inside and I sweat like a mf
22,5°C is where home is
My grandmas place is always 26,5, it’s hell
In Prague you can walk everywhere at night (but not now due to the covid lockdown)
If you get really drunk and pass out on the street or in the bus, your wallet or phone can get "lost".
I walk almost everyday through my town (from work, walking my dog etc
) a lot at night and never felt actually unsafe
The worst thing that can happen is coming across drunken groups screaming in the streets, especially during hockey championship
I tend to avoid these just because it's uncomfortable to me and you never know what they're gonna do
Zero risk
You can go anywhere anytime
I guess the same applies to almost any place in this country
I've never felt any kind of threat
You can get hurt by underestimating our (rather tiny) mountains though
No offense, but people often get terrified once they see a car on a road that has "PL" on its license plate, especially when it comes to truck drivers
I hate when this happens, but I know they do even more
I once had to run back home across the street because I forgot my keys and some unfortunate woman happened to be in front of me
What happened next was both of us running
Poor woman
Oh so it goes both ways
It's just an observation from other people that Polish truck drivers are the most dangerous ones
It's a pretty set stereotype at this point
Czech drivers are similar though
They just see themselves as being in the right all the time
Especially when they have "A" as a second letter on their license plate :)
There was a lot incidents with trains
Polish drivers (usualy near Ostrava) are crossing rail even on red lights and causing quite a few problems
Even with multiple people dead (for example well known Studenka 2015 - Pendolino & polish truck - 3 dead and 17 injured)
Also unexplainable will to overtake anywhere
But this stereotype (dangerous drivers) is mostly directed to polish trucks, not cars
Yeah  we've got a type of [Bagpipes ]
A [vozembouch] (literally ground smasher, it's a rod with a bunch of jingle bells, tambourines and such),
and we use [washboards] as a musical instrument too (you take a stick and run it against the corrigations)
I'd say probably that one time the future king of Bohemia (Joan of Luxembourg) and his wife (Elise Přemyslid) hid inside the city in the 14th century
And the neighbouring city is in the dynasty name of our only elected, non dynastic, hussite king (often visible in the dynasty map mode of EU4)
Wonder if anyone would want to guess those cities
A Czech writer, philologist, historian and Bohemian revivalist, Vaclav Hanka, falsified medieval manuscripts to support the idea of independent Bohemia (by enriching our literary history)
We have a theatre named after the guy in town, lol
Hard to pick one with capitals, depends on perspective
but I guess that one event which sparkled 30y War was fairly significant
It was the capital of HRE for 9 months, whenthe emperor Rudolph II moved there because of plague
[Battle of Czajánek's barracks]
Esztergom (spelling
) we know it as Ostřihom, the one on the Danube across the bridge to Štúrovo, Slovakia
Szczecin right
To clarify for others, the names are Jan Lucemburský and Eliška Přemyslovna in Czech
I'm not sure where you got those name translations, but they seem pretty incorrect
In English they would be John of Bohemia (or the Blind) and Elizabeth of Bohemia (Přemyslid)
Joan is a female name
Linda&Hanka
The OGs of „It’s not true but it could be”
Also Dvůr Králové?
Poděbrady is right, good job, the other one is very close to Pdy but more to the north
Sorry about that, probably messed it up with the french translation
Yep :D
Hope I didn't sound too harsh :)
Vůbec ne
we have word host, that means guest
It causes a lot confusion in english lessons
also there is plot, it means fence
"Panic" means virgin (male) :)
Should we mention the whole dick situation
mince (coin)
We have a sentence enhancer "fakt" meaning "really" that is overused a lot
The "t" is often silent in a fast speach
Now imagine how it sounds to an English ear when every other word in a sentence they don't understand sounds exactly like "fuck" :)
Both are available here
Difference being that sweet popcorn always comes pre-made, while salty you generally make yourself in a microwave
Sweet is however definitely less popular, mostly available at fairs and cinemas
I don't mind sweet, but I vastly prefer salty, or even better cheese flavoured
Progressive Shangri-La of cultured betters who've long known that racism, sexism, and homophobia are bad, m'okay, and are living in the atmosphere of enthusiastic acceptance
Fucking lol
Just ask a Roma person from pretty much anywhere
"Do you have a Tv there
And what about Wi-Fi or computers
Do you have computers
Seriously one American asked me this
That EU = Europe
It's just so weird when peole say it
EU is an institution and has almost nothing to do with our culture and heritage
You can dislike EU and like Europe, it's not such an outlandish idea
Some stereotypes are stupid alone
But stereotypes based on
uhm
let's call it "One Europe" are total bullshit
That Europe=EU
EU is marxist construct organized by Germany and France to control other nations
"Private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe"
*\*laughs in Czech\**
The UK is so true
Is it not
Does other people's self-identification often enrage you
Nothing odd about it
If the general stereotype of Central/Eastern Europe is a bunch of patriarchal homogenous nationalist manly he-menz who are staunchly anti-women's rights, anti-minority rights, pro-traditional family in the most oppressive sense of the word and wouldn't know a modern value if it slapped them in the face, there's bound to be a group of idiots who'll start claiming that the fantastical concoction is actually desirable
I suspect that this stereotype, as the majority of the other ones, used to be correct at some point of time
Maybe sexual revolution of the 60's?
As a Czech I have to remind you that there's a Central Europe
> I find it a bit annoying when I see women with shaved armpits in films about any time before the 70s though
Recently I saw one supposed to play in 1920s Berlin and the woman was smooth as a baby seal
That's just done so modern audiences don't feel uncomfortable but it gives off a wrong image of 'normal'.
Nope, this is historically accurate
The period after the WW1 seen the return of the "antiquity ideal" of the body
Google videos and photos from 1920, dance parties, sport performances, and you'll see that the armpits are shaved
*To be fair though, China's constitution claims to protect human rights so
Bet it doesn't say which humans
Nice
I guess
Is it actually legal in Norway to own guns like hangun
Or did I mistaken it for Sweden, where it's illegal
Well, firstly and most importantly, your culture's opinion on what my culture self-identifies as, i.e. Central, is of no relevance whatsoever and I don't understand why it should be taken into account in any way
It's also rather interesting that you claim this is a matter of geography while dragging political history and culture into it and preventing "technicalities" (?) from having a role, despite Central Europe being an officially recognized concept, historically, politically, and culturally
And finally, the distinction of good West vs
bad East is anything but an "Eastern" invention, and the Western European insistence that it be used, a generation after the end of the Cold War, does indeed raise some eyebrows over here
It's almost like there's a need among certain WE circles to have a handy term to designate a place "the Other Europe".
My guess is the period of the sexual revolution in late 60s-early 70s.
I hate to tell you, but Czech Republic is closer to German way of life than the Russian or eastern European
Yeah, 40 years under communist regime erase those 600 years being literally Germany or Austria
I like this comment and yes people are more affected by recent events and turns, also Cold War and communism destroyed a little part of hope, but the way people act is much more similar to Germans than actually to other Slavs
We have so much different way of solving and going through things
Yes, we are close to other "German Slavs" like Poland or Slovakia but I think that is point of need to stay together after what happened after WW2 (including)
After being betrayed like 4 times
It kinda suck to not have friends
Also it is not like whole Czechia is more german, Bohemia (with Prague) is more Germanic, but still Moravia is closer to other Slavic countries
Largest I found is 148 m² with garage on the outskirts of Brno
In Prague (capital city) in the historical most expensive district about 50 sqm; close to 90 sqm in other good districts
About 20km from the city centre a family house on the smaller side
In my area decent size apartment in the centrum or big apartment/house on the outskirst
And since there is a lot of villages around, pretty big house in one of them, there are offers for half the price for multi floor house with land
Although my house is closer to half a million, as are most places in the area, 400k can still get you a very nice suburban house with a garden
At least in most areas, maybe with the exception of very lucrative Prague suburbs where the price may climb to 700k+ or so
In less attractive cities, you could push it down a lot more
Otherwise you can get 2-3 smaller appartments in big cities for that
Depending on location
Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, total of 120 square meters apartment in dead center of Pilsen, fourth biggest city in Czech republic (where I live)
And I would still have about 15k eur left
Or with no money left:
Similar apartment in outskirts of Prague
100 square meters houses just outside the city (both Pilsen and Prague, with Prague ones being a bit smaller and having significantly smaller ground around
Or (relatively) small 2 room (around 40 meters) apartment in historical center of Prague
EDIT: above is the 'best' you could get in cities
Personally if I had that kind of money available I would get house in some small village near a big city
There is a bunch of those small villages in 5 minut ride by car/ 15 minutes by train kind of distance around Pilsen, where this kind of money would easily get you 350-400 square meters of house, plus another 1500 meters of land around it
Geez with that much money you can get a big modern family house if you don't require it to be near or in Prague (there the prices are almost double)
Looks like some very nice houses in Malmö.
Is the city really that bad
These places seem like an absolute steal
Prague is one giant tourist trap but I think it is pretty easy to avoid them with a little research
There is so much information online so if you are willing to spend a few minutes to look stuff up you should be fine
You can buy a great, tasty beer in a Prague pub for 1-1
50 USD, but also for 6 USD
The "problem" is that 6 USD for one beer is somewhat normal for tourists from Scandinavia, USA etc
, so they don't care
Same goes for food
same as everywhere, do not eat at restaurants with photo menus, someone trying to show you the menu or "please wait to be seated" or similar signs
don't exchange money from random people unless you want to buy overpriced money from some former soviet state
Exchange offices rates can be unclear or shitty
In Czech republic, we have a dedicated youtube channel just for that, its called Honest Guide, if you ever find yourself in Prague, i advise you to watch some of their videos, really helpful
See honest guide for more info if visiting Czech
This
And  stay clear of the ATM machines with massive ATM letters on them
The exchange rate and fees are terrible
You can use basically any other ATM machine, there are tons of them around with logos of different banks and "Bankomat" written on them, and those are OK, just stay clear of the ATM ones
(blue and yellow IIRC)
Don’t use cab from airport these guys prices are well above legal range
Use bus instead
Don’t exchange money here, most places have ridiculous fees while acting free - use card or honest guide map to find good exchanges
Don’t buy trdelnik
It is shit and not even czech
Watch Prague honest guide, they’ll inform you the best
It’s tourist trap if it is local or European cuisine
Asian restaurants have photos almost always here too, and they are usually are rather cheap or normal priced
I’d say menus only in English, Chinese or Russian, with no Czech version is even bigger indicator of tourist trap
This can be simply narrowed down to "do not recklessly press YES on everything that appears on ATM screen"
Euronet, to be precise
taxi is ok but you HAVE to use the app unless you are not local
this is simple not a part of our restaurant culture and only traps targeting to foreigners have this
the exception can be if the michelin guide brings you to the place but then it is not a trap (and even then it is not the norm)
If a nice place here have a feeling you need to be guided around they will have some staff around to catch you and not some post office like sign "make a queue here"
I mean if you see this in Prague downtown at burger place (and you can) it will just tell you go for burger somewhere else unless you need to pay a double
most of our dishes doesn't have any exotic names so from the English menu you could figure out what are you getting, listing main ingredients so there isn't really any trap here (unless you are vegan or   muslim or similar dietary needs, and picture is not going to help you either)
Other networks and companies are no better when it goes to DCC rates
Technically, OP didn't say it is
exactly, and this is not just ATM issue but shop terminals as well
Cats's heads in Czech

English is a lingua franca of this era
If we want to communicate on European level here we have no other choice
This is an American website with majority of users being English native speakers
What would be the point of posting in our native language in English speaking forum
We "choose" to speak English
Considering the level of English we see here, I think it's second nature to a lot of us anyway
However, you see lot of our native languages in our national subs

Yep
That sweet vocative case though
We haven't decided yet
Some buildings have numeration starting from 0 (sometimes called 0, sometimes P as *přízemí* or literally "earthfloor"), some from 1
I've already told this, but in my previous job we have office building split between two companies, and tenants were responsible for everything including the floor number markers
So we have numbers 0-5 in the elevator, but on the stairs we had 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5
We have it that the one at street level is called "přízemí", which would be translated to something like "near ground". The next floors are called 1st, 2nd, etc
We "haven't decided" because there is a difference between "patro" and "podlaží". When using patro, it should be 0/P 1 2 3 4 5
, podlaží numbering should be 1 2 3 4 5 6
I dont want to discredit any inventor, but most modern inventions is not a job of a single person but rather improving, combining and expanding already known knowledge simultaneously
You can dispute almost everything as there was always someone before with something very similar
* contact lenses
* Semtex (the explosive)
* sugar cubes
* lighting rod
* meth
* nanofibres
* arc lamp
* propeller
* blood types
* polarography
Contact lenses, sugar cubes, propeller
Screw-propeler, contact lenses, cube shaped sugar and most famously in eastern region, semtex
Tangentially I recently came across an awesome [youtube channel] which features some really early street videos remastered with speed correction and some ambient sound to make them more immersive
Examples being [Paris in 1896-1900] [Jerusalem in 1897] [New York in 1911] and [Stockholm in 1913] a lot of them are from the Lumiere bros
It's kinda crazy to see all those people, now dead, living out their lives over a 100 years ago
Makes me think about what their lives were like, what they were thinking when the footage was taken, where were they going, what their hobbies were etc
Also, reminds me that they weren't that different from us
Especially the kids being so interested in the camera and just goofing around, just like today
Beer was known to Sumerians in 4000 BC
Paper was known to Chinese long before Europeans
The same goes for the printing press
Meth - japan
Nanofibres - usa - first patent
Blood types - something you cant invent, we discovered their existence

We've got a village that's called "New Village near New Town in Moravia" (*Nová Ves u Nového Města na Moravě*)
The oldest synagogue in Prague is called [Old New Synagogue]
You all are too panicking on this new directive - and media certainly don’t help in this case
I skimmed through it and I don’t feel it’s that bad
On the contrary, it brings some very nice exceptions to universities, research organizations and libraries, who often operated in a grey legal area
I feel there’s a lot of misinformation spread about this new legal framework - articles quoting old versions of it, Google spreading panic so they don’t have to be more transparent, Reddit users quoting other Reddit users without an indication of clear source and then relying on what they said as a fact (sorry) etc…
(banning memes, no free speech, link tax blabblahblah - what a load of bollocks)
I would like to point out this:
(70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with
rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to
copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users
Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users for the
specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche
[…]
As a sidenote, this is a nice hammer to force YouTube to stop taking down people’s videos thanks to copyright trolls and non working algorithms
[…] Online content-sharing service providers should also put in place effective and expeditious
complaint and redress mechanisms allowing users to complain about the steps taken with regard
to their uploads, in particular where they could benefit from an exception or limitation to
copyright in relation to an upload to which access has been disabled or that has been removed .
Any complaint filed under such mechanisms should be processed without undue delay and be
subject to human review
[…]
Yes, I admit, there are some parts that aren’t that great
However, I don’t think they’re that unreasonable - e.g. Yes, **large** content providers shall do filtering - but of the kind that is appropriate and reasonable to their technical and organizational means
If you have time, it's not that bad of a reading:[
I don't care
Expecting our parliament will use some stupid version of implementation and will blame EU for it
It might stop shit services like ulozto,hellshare and others
I am pretty fine with it
Joj mamo
VPN should solve this right
Personally, I think not much will change, because it's unfeasible to implement such a thing on such a large scale as the directive is suggesting
Yes, Youtube does it, badly
For one it barely works, and secondly it's stupidly easy to abuse (both by people trying to get copyrighted content trough the filter and by people impersonating IP holders)
And let's not forget, Youtube is not even profitable
How is anyone else supposed to pay for this is beyond me
Really, the extend of the damage cannot be gauged until someone actually sues someone over it
I'm pissed, but I'm glad that most of my countries represantatives voted no
In fact, they're specifically excluded
To quote:
(70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users
Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users for the specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche
\[…\]
I though about this and I see two issues with this
Yes, parody of something is protected
But *technically*, memes are not parodying
They are using (copyrighted) image to parody something else
So, in my opinion, this wouldn't hold up in court
And secondly, as the other poster said, automated filters won't care
> but it looks like many people (also here on Reddit) allowed themselves to become useful idiots of the megacorps
Imo it just so happens that common Joe benefits from the same *lack of copyright laws* as some Internet corporations
But sure, they took advantage of it to rally us
They're specifically excluded

we are really good in this sport
It should block only if you are from EU, so if you connect through VPN it should think you are from US (or some other country outside the EU) a let you upload and download
(not an expert in VPN, just thought it might work that way)
The other side of the coin didn't actually put up much of an argument, has she
What is said in the article boils down to "But there have to be rules
" and "Without intellectual copyright, they don’t get paid
It was just declining, with fewer and fewer people who could actually make a living out of creating
" (which I would love to see some numbers on)
In reality, this is going to save money for established media corporations, because they won't have to track as much IP infringements, but won't matter for the little guys
And it's not going to affect large tech companies, because they can afford to either setup filters or fight the law in court, but will hinder small companies who can't do either of that
And that is putting the possible danger to freedom of expression aside
This new directive also deals with this - which is why Google/YouTube was spreading their propaganda so hard
They need to ensure that it's possible to dispute those automatic claims and they have to reviewed in a timely manner by a human
No, but there is one Pizza stand where I live that specifically labels itself "American Pizza" and there you always get some garlic sauce
I don't like it together with the pizza, but I find some other use for it so I don't have to feel bad for wasting food
I like Tobasco, Sriracha or Mayo-Garlic dip
But I'm generally for thin slice originals like a very fresh Margharita 'za
Is it good pizza
I'm looking for a good American pizza
Can confirm that it is not a thing here
Personally, I like the idea though
Not a fan of eating dry crust, but if I had something to dip it in, I would
I like it and google reviews are also very favourable
Check for Pizza Comeback, they are at two places in Prague

It seems these words will have similar origin in central European countries (or maybe originally catholic countries), because in Czech the word is "andělíčkářka", which could also be translated as "someone who makes angels" (which by itself is strange, because these fetuses would not be baptized and as such should not be able to get to heaven)
Thais is a question for historians, there probably was some
oh I almost forgot that this word even exists
Andělíčkářka
An "angelist", angel maker as in neighboring countries
Yes, but probably only in "Četnické humoresky" :D
I didn't know that abortion laws are stricter in Austria and Germany
I only know about Poland very strict abortion laws
Interesting but sad
The Ottoman [Mecidiye Marşı]
The Polish [National anthem]
The Ukrainian [National Anthem]
Red Army Choir songs
And probably many others
Tons of them
Some from Britain, some from Ireland, some from the US, some Italian, some spanish, I found very interesting argentinian kids song about Falkland war
I also know some from Russia, but best ones are from Germany (Panzerlied, die letzte Kompanie, was ist des deutschen Vaterland, wo alle Straßen enden, unterwegs, der offene Aufmarsch and many many more)
Natural: The 2002 floods;;
Manmade: Coal mining in the Ústecký region (viz Starý Most)
Well, there was silver mine Marie, where, during fire in 1892, died 319 miners
Oh, I've heard about the Palomares nuclear incident
Is it true that not all of the bombs have been found and retrieved
Came here to say this, it definitely has to be the 2002 floods for us
We don't get a whole lot of natural disasters here, pretty much only floods, and these ones were particularily devastating
Yeah, but few people mentioned it already
Look up "Czech desserts" and one of the first things to come up will probably be [this]
No, locals don't normally eat these and it's not even Czech, but Hungarian
It's just being sold in touristy places and tourists love to make photos with it and upload it on Instagram
In the Czech Republic, definitely Trdlo/Trdelník. It’s just a trap for naive tourists, you can find it in literally every food stand in Prague for hilarious prices
Definitely not traditional food as it’s presented
Ah, trdelník, traditional bohemian dessert
Jan Hus liked his with ice cream and sprinkles, as is tradition
Yea, I've never had one in my life
tbh I eat it like a few times a a year in the winter, cause there's a stand near my house that's selling them for like 40Kč for a big one
They're not traditional, but they are delicious (if you're not buying them for 100Kč lol)
I think I had it only once in my life and I don't even remember when
I never see them outside Prague but Prague seems to be FULL of them
> but it's not really a thing we get that often
your loss
Dutch herring is super-good
Sauerkraut is indeed very popular here, both red and white cabbage, both mild and strong one
Yeah, we eat a *lot* of sauerkraut here, absolutely adore it (especially the red kind)
Bigos looks a lot like some types of *Zelňačka* (sauerkraut so up) and that's reasonably common here, same with Koblížky (pac,zky)
As a tourist, i found it to be gross
Give me a bratwurst or something else
oh my god yes, *Bramboračka in bread* just seems so impractical to me for anything but touristy stuff
Like what on earth would you do with the
bread part of the bread
Yeah, it's mostly tourists
I am Czech and it's nice to have once a year, but it's not like we make them at home
It is an american dish, not an italian dish
Carbonara is American then, as it was invented by American soldiers
That's the story I always hear when I look it up
I don't want it to be true, really
If the dish was created with military rations, there's no way it was a refined dish
But what is the most expensive part of carbonara
Pecorino romano
Guanciale is either expensive or unavailable in the USA, but it doesn't seem like it should be expensive
When I went to school we didn't have folders like that as we had to just write our notes to notebooks (exercise books)
The only colour difference I can think of is that:
red notebook - lined paper
green notebook - squared paper
blue notebook - blank pages (without lines or squares)
Maybe it's different nowadays when laptops are more prevalent in schools
I wasn't organized enough to have color-coded folders or notebooks, but I colored in my timetable with somewhat stable colors
Humanities always tended to be warm colors and sciences cool
Usually I would use yellow for Czech, red for English, pink/orange for History and Art, brown or grey for PE, blue for Math, shades of green for Biology and Chemistry, and the rest was kinda random based on which colors I had on hand
Ah that memories
"For this year, buy 6x523 2x 520 and 1x524"
In elementary school
We had to buy books in high school too, and some teachers insisted on the newest edition (especially for fairly expensive foreign langauge books - very annoying), but elementary/middle school books definitely should be provided
That's harsh
I always thought it was dumb enough how much we had to spend on very specific art class supplies in elementary that ended up being used like twice a year
Same in Prague and bigger cities in Czech republic
We have the second highest rising housing prices after you
But we don't make nearly as much as you
\**cries in Czech*\*
Whats the cause
What
That doesnt make sense
You are the only country that as state makes profit
If you had your own currency it would be 62 CZK which is almost double the value of €.
And someone told you its because Chinese and Eastern Europe competion
Thats bullshit mate
German companies produce high tech things which Chinese cant replacate with proper know-how yet
you suffer
Look up how much money Germany gives to EU to "keep it running" you could use that money in other way
They can easily be (or become) misanthropic from their loneliness
Nice to hear that
Sadly most people dont want to think about these problems
What people in r/de think so far
I see
Well good luck in your fight
I am student myself but I look closely on economic situations and politics in world
Mainly Europe
I think Pilsen gets the least hate from the bigger cities
Well, thanks to you I have a new city on my bucket list
Sounds pretty dope
Could you tell me something about Krakow
I'm planning to visit in a few weeks
Cologne
I just love the city, people are so friendly there
I go over there every year for a vacation
Would like to live there
Thanks
Smog doesn't bother me much, but I guess I'll see myself
English only, I have self-preservation instincts and don't want to deal with code commented in Hindi
I study CS and English is mandatory even though my study programme is in Czech
Is Lidl in your country considered a good market
Here in Czechia it’s one of the better one, while when I was in England everybody made jokes about how bad it is
Why is that
The same is true for Czechia
Perhaps OP doesn't remember it, but 10 years ago Lidl was utter shit, and their slogan was, literally, "Lidl is cheap". A few years ago they rebranded to "Lidl is the right choice" and "The best from Czechia and Europe" and rebuilt shops, quite often starting from scratch (bulldozing the existing one)
Yeah i agree 100%, a lot of people seem to not like LIDL in this thread but in Denmark its one of the better stores to go to
And its a little bit cheaper then Netto i think
Not offending, you are actually right
It’s pain in the ass when I think about the stuff they got in Scandinavia etc
I don't mean to offend but even Czechs know that eating polish meat is kind of like a russian rulette
You will most likely live but there is a chance you catch salmonella
Maybe you keep the good meat in your country and export all the leftovers, who knows, but then you can't be surprised stereotype like this exists
The fact is that many companies take one product, make it two different ways and then they send the worse and cheaper one to central and eastern europe while they keep the good stuff in Germany and the rest of the western europe
It's kind of a big topic in Czech Republic
Mate, if it were Slovaks instead of you, it would be way worse
People would be extremely offeded by it while when it's Poland people are mostly annoyed and simply distrustful
Unless this stops happening people won't change their mind about it, it's simple as that
I looked it up and there were around 22 cases of bad meat from Poland in the last 6 years
That's a lot
It doesn't matter if it's done by private or by public companies, it's happening and that's the problem
I have no superiority or inferiority complex towards Poles and honestly can't say I know many people who do (Slovakia or Germany and even partially Austria on the other hand
Well, that's a whole another level of complicated feelings)
I think there are some things I disagree with on the government or social level but I am sure you are the same with Czech Republic
I always liked Poland, I always looked at Poland as part of our central european family, I root for Poles in the Eurovision even if I don't particulary love the song, I always defend you from morons attempting the blame you for WW2 and I hope your economy will only flourish but I won't pretend that the meat situation is alright on any level
Also, personally, I think no central european country has a good food
It's all meaty, soupy, fatty and heavy and I am just not into it
Nothing against it, it just dispeases my tastebuds
So I judge all our neighbours with the same amount of bias
Oh, that's surprising, we have Billas and Pennys
Yes
One of my best friends is a guy
We meet for a coffee basically on weekly bases
We go to cinema together
And we definitely aren't romantically involved with each other
Maybe it's a bit different in older generations
My parents for example found it weird at first and constantly asked me whether my friend's girlfriend isn't jealous that he is meeting me
Because they assumed, she would assume that there is something between us, because surely when a young woman meet a young man, there must be some hidden romantical interest (or that's what they thought)
For unknown number on my mobile phone only simple "Prosím." (which is literally "please" but it has more meaning, one of it is common response on the phone)
At work: "Prosím, (my family name)
" For friends and family the response is actually similar when I see them in person
Well Sámova říše was established around 624 and that is probably the first time we existed as a separate country
My country is 27 years old and it was founded in 1993
1993 when Czechoslovakia split
Same applies for you
By your logic your country was "founded" somewhere mif 90s when you finally had a constitution
It's not that easy, nobody in their right mind would argue that Czechia has existed only for 27 years
As far as I'm aware, all the countries/entities all the way up to the year 1198 (founding of the Kingdom of Bohemia, not sure how is it with the preceeding duchy) are considered Czechia's legal predecessors
If we're going for a more relevant answer, the year 1918, you could say that it was the proclamation of independent Czechoslovakia, which would be later ratified in 1920 and 1921
If we're going conpletely by contemporary administration, then the year would be 1969, the year in which the Czech Socialist Republic was established as Czechoslovakia was federalised
While 1993 is the birthyear of the current Republic, it is very far from representing how old the country is, which is at the very least  822 years
You wouldn't argue that Canada as a country was only born in 1982 (as it was given complete sovereignty by the Constitution Act), or that Russia has only existed since 1991, would you
No it didn't and Great Moravia didn't have any connections too
Most accepted date IMHO is 28
september 935 when Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia was murdered
is also a national holiday
With a ["big Škoda"] filled with everything, if there is still stuff, we return with the same Škoda and pick up the rest (when moving)
Honestly if you own a house or anything besides a simple city appartment, buying a small trailer is a massive investment that will pay off hundredfold
I have used mine for almost anything in the times I built two houses
If you live in a city then you have to either use a rental company, fit it in your car or ask a friend with a van/trailer
I don't think so I am going to buy sheets of drywall anytime in my life for the rest there is a delivery service or friend with van
Can also attach a trailer to our car or there is a friend with pickup car but some friend with van is always available so most comfortable way always win
You fold the back seats in your family wagon, and pray to good which we don't believe in, or keep the back door slightly open, make sure it ain't going nowhere, put a red flag on it if its long enough (red flag=any red old rag) and hit the road
Or you have a friend with a van
From a cost perspective, buying a small trailer is the best
It is relatively cheap, lasts forever and you can use it for anything
But then again, new shiny trucks are beautiful and who doesn't love a bit of fiscally stupid amortization rush
2 HTP engine Fabia, I can’t think of anything more Czech
If the load is so big so even 2 Fabias or Octavia can’t haul it, renting a van is always great cheap option
Rusty blue Ford van, with visible place where used to be post logo, can cost few hundred of crowns pre day (less than €40)
unless you are a lumberjack or rebuilding gardens a van do better job than hilux
Plot twist: You have an absolute monster king kong dong and she didn't because it could never fit
Hmm exact same thing from our hornbach is with free delivery, but looks to me they do free delivery of everything over 1500 CZK (around 55 EUR) if it fits into boxes
once in German class and only because our teacher saw a recipe in our textbook and thought that it could be fun
In few schools there's a option to learn to cook
But it isn't very common
Actually, yes, but only for one school year
Both girls and boys had to take it and each week we would cook a different type of food (fish, desserts, and so on)
But I later learned that this isn't the norm in public schooling, my school was just an exception
We had
afaik it is not really possible here
you need to pass language test, both written and spoken + test from Czech things, all the shit is for whole day
Czechs speak Czech
If you don't speak Czech, you are not a citizen and idgaf what any paper says
No way
You want to be the citizen, you need to speak the language, period
A gigantic, overwhelming portion of the Czech national identity is being able to speak the language on at least a fluent-ish level, generally not giving a fuck about any "heritage" or other crap
I feel like if you want to double-down and become a citizen, you should learn the language at the very least
You can ask your mum to practice a bit with you
No, I am not aware of any tradition connected to this day
I greet them when I meet them, have some friendly chat frkm time to time
same
Yeah, sounds like it
25 minutes by tram/bus or about the same time on a bike
Bike is a bit slower but I do not have to wait for connection
2-3 minutes by car, depending on traffic, weather and direction
15 min walk
Cca 20 min
3 min walk, 10 min metro, 7 min walk
Prague, CZ, 20 minutes by subway
Few minutes to and from subway on foot
5 minute walk to bus, 5 minute bus ride, 15 to 20 minute tram ride
20min walk OR 15 min bus+walk OR 10min bike ride
5 minutes drive with my car to the train staion, 25 minute long train ride, few minutes to walk to the bus stop, 10 minutes long bus ride, 5 minutes walk to school and you are done or just take the car and be there after 25 minutes
So I drive to school like 2-3 times a day (not because I want to cut the time in almost half, but because I enjoy driving a lot)
> put on sweat pants
You're more disciplined than I am
You know: Ordnung muss sein
I'm just lazy
And it saves 20-25 minutes of time every day
Of course, the fuel costs something
But if I actually cared about it, I wouldn't use a V8 Jeep for it
The bastard is 20 years old, and refuses to die
I love the name Dimitri, it just sounds badass
I think it's mostly around 25-30
Seems to be decreasing with the good economy lately
I plan on moving out once I go to uni, but one of my friends, who is 18, is planning on moving out in about a month
I'd say between like 18-27 is the standart
We have the oldest university in the Eastern and Central Europe
Now it barely ranks in top 500 universities
We owned half of Europe once and we had some very powerfull rulers (Charles IV
for example)
Charles University in Prague
Mainly 40 years of communism, I guess
More like the metrics are skewed towards anglo-sphere schools
During ski race somewhere in Norway there was an aerial shot of the first group and in the snow you could see a GIANT "Babiš je zlo" in the snow
Babiš is our prime minister and has a LOOOOOOT of controversies around him - investigated by the police for stealing 2 million euros, his past in STB(Czechoslovak KGB) and other stuff
And Farkas in Hungarian, I think

At least a dozen
i dont know
never tried
I am too shy
I'm just too poor
you can always try but i wont garentee you will succeed
My logic says pretty common, considering how many other ethnic groups have Russians assimilated over the centuries
I feel like that's not a stereotype, that's just the truth
We have the biggest beer consumption per person in the whole world, even though you won't usually see drunk people if you're not out really late
:-D
Not at all
I haven't seen it in a very long time
Little late, but my parents watched it full, I watched a part of it
We have thrown people out of a window as a political statement
And not just once
Czechoslovakia, as a part of WW1 allied war reparations, received a certain part of the Hamburg harbor in a form of a lease for 1 Czechoslovak crown with the duration of lease of 100 years
It used to house the Czechoslovak trading fleet
The lease expired several years ago and was renewed
Also, Czechoslovakia won a naval battle known as the Battle of Lake Baikal, the only known naval battle by Czechoslovakia
We had naval battle on Baikal and WON
Awww
Beer is the cause, beer is the solution, we are saying it all the time
French did it
Germans introduced potatoes by german way, they gave an order
AFAIK no, or maybe it wasn't as notable
After all Prague has always been the capital city
Kifli
In Czechia it's as common as bread and I naturally thought it's as common everywhere
Rohlíky
Other countries don't have rohlíky, therefore other countries shouldn't exist
Yeah we have that,Mattoni produces it
TIL the English name for rohlík.
I miss Danish hot dogs
So it looks like that we,Slovakia and Hungary have rohlík.What about Poland
I only passed through Hungary, sadly
Nope, but that's what I found on English Wikipedia, we call it rohlík.
In Czechia, I’d say that [marlenka] It was made in Czechia based on Armenian recipe tough
Sacher is my very favourite
What I found surprising tho was when my Austrian friend had it as a birthday cake on his birthday
Really shows how popular it is in Austria
That we could've 1v1 Germany in 1938
That we hate church because of communist regime
We hated church hundred years before that
Why do you delete your posts
We were (again) in the middle of a conflict with Poland
I think that had we actually ignored Těšínsko for a while and allied with them instead we could definitely have a chance
Someone actualy thought that
We were winning against against motherfucking Crusaders with just farmers, some nazi punks are nothin'! /s
German military was biggest in Europe, we might have had good fortification on German borders and decent industry, but we would get our cheeks clapped, war would be over in matter of days once they got through mountains, not to mention they could flank us through Austrian border wich was nowhere near as fortified as north
This is my "favorite" tidbit: [ (1933)
Your numbers are wrong
Battle for france was almost 7 weeks, not 5
The number of dead germans was 27k, not 90k.
It wasn't 1000 pilots, but 1000 air crews
Yes, kind of
He said: "look for the truth, hear the truth, learn the truth, love the truth, speak the truth, hold to the truth, fight for the truth to your own death"
This is current motto of the Czech republic: [
Well, I didn't even notice the typo, I don't think it's necessary to delete it because of that
Destroying Rechkanzlei is probably the only thing 14 aircrafts can do
Neither USSR/Czechoslovakia or USSR/Germany shared common border
Even if it was true, they had no way to help
It was postwar propaganda, in line with the rest of anti-west communists focus
Also USSR and Germany were allied at the moment
\> did Stalin poison Europeans
Did he conduct cruel, crazy experiments on people
No, he was doing this to his own people
Ironically, nation who suffered the most under Stalin is full of his apologists
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was a final piece of years-long cooperation
For example USSR allowed the training of German tank and air forces on it's territory, because Versailles Treaty prohibited such things in Germany
No sane person would allow Red Army to enter his territory
Especially not Poland, which was attacked by USSR just 19 years ago
The problem with missing is, you don't a have reliable way to differentiate between unidentified(both dead and wounded), lost, deserted and captured
The POW's especially are inflating the casulties numbers
It's still only 14 planes
They might a be lot in todays minimalistic warfare
But in 1938, Germany had probably more planes than we have anti-air missiles at the moment
Do you even know what was Molotov-Ribbentrop about
It was about creating spheres of influence, similar to the Portugal-Spain Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494
The Soviets didn't support Republican Spain during the civil war, because the other side was fascist, but because majority of Republicans were communists
That's why Western powers didn't get involved, there wasn't anyone allied to them
In my household my dad would always buy crate of Pilsner Urquell because it’s considered premium beer and he never bought it to drink at home, if he drank it it was from tap in a pub or restaurant
However that is some years ago and lots changed, now it’s usually a combined crate of different premium beers to try or Christmas edition of our favourite beers
Always have Pilsner for Christmas dinner though
Are there trees in Iceland
Our most imperial moment (apart from being the pivotal part of the  Habsburg Empire which we usually pretend to be a victim of) was Czechoslovakia and the subjugation of unsuspecting/s Slovaks and Ruthenians (sorry Hungary)
Most of us still believe it was a good deed after all
Hell, I wouldnt mind if we joined together again
Having monarch as representative person and person who unites us is great
Austro-Hungary is portraid rather nicely in Good Soldier Svejk
Also some rulers in our history were good
Rudolph II, Joseph II, Maria Theresa
Also fun fact I have Habsburg genes
Except it was tolerant only in the Austria-Hungary phase and only in the Austrian part of empire

And for journalism, Martin Řezníček, no discussion
Among educated people, it is Andrej Babiš. On November 16, 2019, around 300,000 people demonstrated against him in Prague
Among other people, it is Miroslav Kalousek
He was a good finance minister, but unfortunately it was during the Great Recession, and uneducated people like to blame it on him
And among communist-minded seniors and boomers, it is Václav Havel, because he was a symbol of the Velvet Revolution in 1989
Everything is Kalousek's fault
It seems it's something between toasts (commonly made with toaster linked many times here) and [topinky] wtih nothing or anything you like on the top
We have the same toasts here, but we make them in "toasters" which are not toasters but rather have the appearance of a small contact grill (contact as in the toast touches the iron grille of the toaster on both sides), the regular toasters we call "topinkovače" but translates as toaster to english, so I guess I can't really explain a czech toaster without showing you a picture (which I can't, because all search results for toaster show
well, a toaster)
I don't want to nitpick here but isn't "fried" supposed to be on oil or fat ? Toaster will just compress it and heat up
and why do you call them grilled cheese when they are not grilled cheese
Ok and how do you call grilled cheese then
Yes
Seen that but how do you call grilled cheese which is actually grilled   cheese
Not sandwich with cheese
of course you can, that's the source of my confusion
Here a grilled cheese is a grilled cheese and having some sandwich instead would cause some "excuse me
I guess [this] [this] [that] and a whole lot of [this] And also the **good** mafia game
Your meth production is behind tho

After personal experience of miltiple times, I'm not sure I would regard Brussels as a contribution hehe
Maybe to the annual red tape bullshit competition
And you won the first Eurovision
To be fair France is trying to use common defence and military for their own political gain in Africa
I wish we all passed on that
Wasting military lives trying to do some french bidding in Mali or whatever colony is not really useful for anyone other than France
I mean, on the other hand, holding us hostage like that is not that nice
It's ok mate
We picked up the German demand needs for you
I'm not saying you're the bad guys, far from it
I'm just saying you have to distinguish between specific missions
Helping Greece with defence is a big difference from interfering with internal conflict in Mali
And I said that France can do that if they so please since they have history there, but that other countries may have 0 things to do with Mali or other countries in Africa and may be reluctant to waste lives on it
Also unlike the US or France, other countries have limited military funds and lives just to play world police
Which is also a big reason for opposition to it
Well I'm mostly talking about the fact that France has the most important European military and it has a lot of geopolitical interests in Africa and elsewhere
Therefore they have a tendency to assume world police role with America
And if there were shared army projects, it's likely France would influence the missions to suit their needs in Africa and use others to help them do it
Like US does with NATO often (or rather did in the past)
Sure, that's a necessary condition
But in such case, it would be rather unnecessary, since NATO already has many EU members in it and it has a common defence clause which is (externally) more valuable than EU alone since it has American military weight behind it
I get that
But I'm just not confident you can effectively deter Russia, Turkey, Iran and others threats without the US
Especially in cyberspace and unconventional warfare
However faulty the Americans can be, their military is still a massive deterrent
Nowadays NATO is built around specific member states doing parts of work
So for example CZ has a great biological warfare regimens, good specialists and some decent techs, but we have comparatively very small raw manpower and infrastructure
That's just not there without the Americans
It would also mean that France would have to pick a lot of the responsibility as the strongest military
And as you can imagine from historical reasons, the trust in French military and diplomacy is very very low in a lot of countries
Especially in CZ after we were given away to Nazis at Munich '38 just because the French and British didn't want a war
Just saying the factors that I see as to why I'm not huge on this idea of EU army without the US
[France]
If it's a person, for me it's definitely Karel Čurda
He exploited Heydrich's assasins, who then fought bravely against dozens of nazis in a fight they could not possibly win
I don't know, this seems pretty reasonable
Taking the revolution further would hurt Germany quite a lot
Yes, he killed some commies, but rather have them dead than a German civil war
Munich Conference probably
Yeah it wasn't betrayal per se, it was total incompetence of French third republic in general
If anyone outside Germany should get blame for WW2, it's France
"Hey, it wasn't us, it was the guy in charge" is the world's oldest way to get rid of responsibility
Besides, wasn't it Chamberlain who was mainly for the appeasement policy
Japan is complicated
They were in war since 1937(1932) and their alliance with Germany was only symbolic
WW2 is actually two separate wars at the same time
France arrogance during the Versailles peace conference on the other caused the rise of Fascism in both Germany and Italy
And they also alienated the Japan
And then, when Germany officially broke the Versailles treaty, the France did nothing, although they were legally bound to act
The Munich conference was the last nail to the coffin
Wait, no, the Phoney War was the last nail
Most French accepted the guilt already
Just few individuals like you feel personally attacked anytime something unfavorable from history of his nation is said
That's true for every nation, not just France

I don't really like beer very much
I don't hate it either, but out of all alcohol options that you can get, beer occupies a low spot on my preference list
I don't like *vepřo knedlo zelo* (our national dish) and I'm not an Atheist
As Czech I hate bread dumplings (except with  sirloin beef in cream sauce )
I don't drink beer, or any alcoholic drinks for that matter
Why the fuck would anyone choose the bitter rotten piss that is beer when cider, wine, and all these other low-alcoholic drinks exist
It's not the medieval ages anymore, people
I drink a lot of wine from Moravia and eat lots of smažák to make up for it, so yeah, I think I pass
Basically, in Czechia we call whole Germany "Německo" which refers to that we can't understand them
You know, different language families
It's funny since the Slav name for germans and germany (Německo, Němci) comes from the word  mute'
We also have the village saying, but they are Spanish
My personal favourite is The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians
Someone is even killed with cello, which I play
Oh, classics
But recent events should turn the meaning completely around
Age gap relationships with 15 year olds
Reddit keeps going on about predators but I don't get it
It's not like they are children
Socks in sandals
pretty normal here as well
isn't going into sauna nude expected everywhere
I thought that was Balthazar
nah here as well
Yeah, I remember when I was around 15, it was a kind of status thing among girls to have a 20+ boyfriend
And a friend of mine for example has been dating a guy 15 years older than her since she was 16 and they're still happily together
At the time it was considered weird but more in the sense that we wondered what they could talk about with each other rather than it would be considered "predatory" from the guy
Fuck yeah it isnt
everyone with brain should hate it
Also that dark humour should be mentioned in brochures about our country
I think most foreigners arent ready for it
Hell Gott died today and Ive already heard jokes about it
Nah, we literally built our national identity around pub culture, so we count as well
We eat horse meat, usually in the form of [koňský salám] but it's more rare and occassional product
There are no farms that would specifically breed horses for meat but simply when a horse gets injured or is too old to work (and it's not like a beloved companion of the owner), it's put down and its meat processed
Yes, you can have towel around if you are shy
Going into sauna in some clothing is really unhygienic
True
But I would not consider someone who is interested in a chick with a rack like Alps a pedophile
I'm suffering from Stockholm syndrome 12 years later
We even got a kid
where and what they wear
from my experience with sauna all over Europe staff will kick you out if not naked
(these places I visit in asia have sauna outside and apparently all saunas around during my US stay were some undercover gay club by reviews)
so not finding a real sauna during my US stay was in fact a benefit as they will kick me out in no time :)
have to try :) for distance reason we usually visit "something around Gastein area" and due to near border with Germany you will never encounter this in sauna
Yes
The small numbers of good gypsies only confirm that majority are thieves and leeches with shitton of kids
that's correct
Thus by definition not a pedo
However this is misguided
It is Ephebophilia when the sexual interest preference is mainly towards adolescents
Simply happening to fall in love with (or being attracted to) adolescent while still being into "adults" is not Ephebophilia
It's too late
I'm trapped under a pile of diapers
Send help
all over Europe was apparently exaggerated
(but my brain still can't cope with how is anyone comfortable in sauna wearing anything)
I feel like this is nothing new by now but on Easter Monday guys go around and whip girls with whips made out of willow branches
Burning witches
We've got a lot of them
We throw this doll during spring (I think) into the river, we used to do it in kindergarten so pretty old tradition
We burn a witch doll and it's basically this big event that usually the city itself makes and there's a lot of beer and alcohol around it and it's cool
During spring we also celebrate easter, by basically "whipping" women with a willow stick (The whipping is just going back and forth behind the woman's behind) and then we get either sweets or alcohol (The women actually want to be "whipped" because the tradition is they will stay young for longer)
On Easter men spank women with wooden whips
I’m not kidding nor exaggerating
Burning witches is better
Yeah we do that too
It's a tradition over here too
I've never seen it though
It's a thing, but it's dwindling
It still a thing
I grew up in a small village in Moravia and I still technically live there so I get whipped every single year
Not my favourite tradition
More and more people are abandoning it though, especially in the city
Jan Žižka, Czech general from the 15th century
Even though right now the biggest statue in Czech Republic belongs to him and even one district of the Czech capital is named after him, he did pretty nasty stuff
He was a leader of religious movement called Hussites that fought against Roman Emperor, who was catholic
Even though it could be called the first reformation in Europe (almost 100 years before Martin Luther), they were really radical and killed anyone who didn’t agree with them
They were also iconoclastic (destroyed religious icons- statues, paintings, churches
The only reason they are now celebrated is because communist regime glorified them a lot (because they fought against catholics) and used them for propaganda
Bohemian nobility electing Ferdinand I. of the Habsburgs to be the king of Bohemia (1526)
Granted, he was a very competent candidate at a very young age
Nevertheless, through him we have lost independence for centuries
I like the Liechtenstein one, looks like a plate from 50s.
Helsinki development is insane
I wish we could make a Kalasatama in Prague but building here takes so fucking long
Well of course it takes long, when everybody and their mum can delay the process through bureaucratic machinations to squeeze some bribes from the state
A village nearby has been waiting for a highway for 20 years
They are still dealing with complaints of eco-activists who live on the other side of the country
Doritos
I love them
The only way to get Doritos here is to go to a special shop like Iceland, because they sell stuff from the UK
Google Store
Our wikipedia is pretty huge but the quality varies a lot
There are certain areas where the articles are generally pretty high quality with reasonable depth
Astronomy articles for example tend to be surprisingly good
But in other areas it's not so hot
Almost all articles about history are pretty garbage from my experience
Haha, i feel this
Was in a bar at dresden
There was a sign on the doors that thay accept card payments
I was like: finally, hello germans welcome to 21st century
So we had couple of drinks with friends
We were about the pay and asked for a card payment
They told us they dont acxept standard visa/mastercard and only accept some weird german shit cards
Deutsche post or something like that
After some talks lady came and covered for us lel
Exactly the same here
They have warehouses here and we get a "Czech" website that is just the german one ran through google translate
And you still usually have to come pick the parcel up at the post office because česká pošta is a fucking joke
> A normal republic with a good legal system, no corruption and people making a descent income
This is far from being available "almost everywhere".
Ah, good old GSV paranoia
Czech Post
Pretty sure all my Amazon packages were delivered by PPL or PDP or someone like that
Not I would care, Czech Post works fine where I'm from
Everything I've ever ordered from Amazon was delivered by česká pošta, but I guess that may vary
Also, I've never received a single parcel from them at our house, they always just leave a card saying nobody was home and that I have to come pick it up
I guess since I don't live in a large town, stopping by the post office is really not a huge issue
If I had to park somewhere in a city, I would be way more annoyed about it
It's just transliteration to the English Latin alphabet and as such it's a little bit clumsy
Yeah, I live in Prague and even though the post office is not very far from our house, it's always busy and you usually have to wait there anywhere from 30 min to 2 hours
Modern office building will have AC
Older ones, may sometimes be retrofitted with it, but it's not terribly common
But regular houses or flats
Basically unheard of
It's pretty expensive for something that you will use for 2 months per year at most
And the little stand-alone units are just shit and still expensive
With that said, I will be fitting an AC in the attic I'm reconstructing
I don't see summer getting cooler any time soon and the attic would be unliveable otherwise
No, I think window fans are not common in most of Europe either
As far as I know, your windows usually just slide up
In Europe, [tilting windows] are the norm
Meaning we would have to have the window fully open all the time which is just hugely impractical
I put a line  in the middle otherwise it looks like a 2
Not a huge problem in a text, huge problem in math stuff where z and 2 are very common
Unless you are from house of Kinsky or similar noble family (and then it is usually more than 2)
I do have two first names, never met anyone else with a second name here in my life so its probably very rare
Legally you can have second name
It's very rare, I don't think I know a single person who has one
Not at all, at least in my area
No, they are not anymore, but we gave our daughter middle name anyway
Bringing that "Národní obrozeni" mood back, all them writers had two names XD
No, which is sad, I honestly like middle names
Or if you were baptized, still pretty rare
200 years ago it used to be different, but XX century broke this tradition
Do we even have that option
My nephew's name is Jonáš Jan (surname) but I don't think that there will be 2 names in his OP
Rarest of the spiciest spices
I don't even know how this works for these religious nuts here
but was it really second name or just that baptism name
yes we have (been there last week) two names are possible, can't be same and if there is a dash (anna-marie) it is considered as single one
Two are maximum and it has to be existing name in correct grammar form
(and correct gender except these two or three multigenders)
But in overal it is quite strict, for example any girl is born with -ova (unless you are foreing, etc
just default case) and has to be changed later if wanted
If you have two names you have an obligation to use both when communicating with authorities
(don't know what punishment is if you don't)
You just kinda have it but it's not on official documents
I'd guess second name, because of Magdalen Dobromila Rittigová. I have feeling (not being a religious person myself) that for baptism you have to take one of the saints' name, and I haven't head of saint Dobromila
I might be completely wrong in this tho
Yes I guess so it is somehow this way, remembering filling naming papers for our daughter and they were quite strict what you can fill in (but lot of things can be changed later, like father form of surname etc)
I have no clue about these religious things as well but it makes a sense
But on other hand, she was German and didn't speak a single Czech word till her 20 or something like that so it might be an influence from there and not really our thing
Comparing with "real" Czechs from that national revival era like Hanka, Palacky, Celakovsky, these are always just with one name or sometimes with the religious one
So not sure she is good benchmark for this
How restrictive society is
Even some European nations, like Spanish people, do that
If they meet with a bigger group, they say like "hi, how are you
" and then they greet with another person
To me, this feels so rude
When you ask a question, you should always wait for the answer
They were thinking of dumdum bullets
that was part of my young years as well, probably any summer camp had some game like this one
We were usually not alone but together with some adult or someone in 15-18 age but not giving us any help just stopping us doing something really stupid
Pretty much the only thing I can think of is [Polárka] It's a multipurpose hall used as a [shooting range] [ice hockey rink] etc
But the best thing about it is that it [lights up differently every time] for example when it's closed it lights up in orange, when there is a concert it lights up in yellow, on the New Years eve it lights up in the colors of Czech tricolour, etc
Prague - Czech national library of technology is beautiful building located in technical university campus in Dejvice
Its main hall is amazing sight
Sadly the building has one fatal flaw - the glass panels on the outside are miserably designed, and they keep falling down
Luckily they didn’t kill anyone, but the temporary fence around the library became kind of permanent
In Poděbrady (eastern part of the Central Bohemian region) there are many historical buildings, but because Poděbrady is a spa town, you can fing modern architecture as well ( like the [train station] [art nouveau villas] [Libenského Kolonáda] and many others)
Dang, wish I knew that sooner, when I was visiting

Pretty briefly but yeah
Never encountered one in my life probably
The Dancing House
Such a beautiful piece of architecture
I'm a huge fanboy of [Jan Santini-Eichel] an ingenious architect living at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries
He invented his own style, baroque gothic, [mixing up] an old gothic architecture with then-modern baroque elements and construction techniques, about 150 years before historicism in art became a widely popular thing
On top of that, he was obssessed with [insane] geometrical patterns and symmetries so all his buildings are filled with them
Here's probably his most famous works, [St Barbara Church] in Kutná hora and [Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk]
Flaktürme are absolutely breathtaking constructions
I've seen bigger buildings, but in from of a Flakturm a man is merely an ant, so titanic it is
What is that
WTH is TV licence inspector
In 2008 Czech researcher found memo that Czech-born writter Milan Kundera in 1950 could report a person he thought was a Western agent to communist regime authorities
(Kundera was devout communist at that time)
His foreign fans started defend him immediately and eleven internationally recognized writers came to Kundera's defence: these included four Nobel laureates
Although I'm pretty sure they really didn't know much about 1950's Czechoslovakia
> If Russia wanted to influence Germany by shutting down the Gas supply they could already do that with the other supply lines
They don't want to shut off gas to **Germany**. It has been discussed million times, and here we go again
Eastern flank of the EU and non-EU countries like Ukraine
Currently, in case of an all-out military conflict, gas supply to Germany might be affected; with the Nord Stream, it won't be, what almost guarantees German passivity in case of further Russian aggression
On a question: where are you going for vacation I answered: Yugoslavia
I got drunk by drinking beer while wearing socks in sandals
I've never climbed a mountain in flip-flops though
How did you feign to be Mafia members
We have a phrase: "to be drunk as a Dane"...
To be honest, this phrase is at least one hundred years old
Probably much older
as a person with dual citizenship im happy that it's allowed :)
Italian all the way
Well slovak, it sounds way more fluent than czech
Slovak feels like a german autobahn opposed to a field road czech
Norwegian and Japanese are probably my favourite languages sound-wise
Yes, if it is mean-spirited or just plainly some ignorant incorrect criticism, I have the tendency to get defensive basically about any CEE country
V4, Baltics, Romania, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Slovenia, Croatia
not so much the Balkan countries as I am not that familiar with them and so don't feel quite as confident defending them
In some particular circumstances, I can get defensive about countries West of us too
It all depends on what the topic is and what the insults are
But in general, it's usually CEE countries that I defend because I feel like they just need it more, in the sense that they are more often a target of retarded misconceptions and prejudices

I kinda-learned Spanish because I spend more than a month there yearly for the last 10 years
But I never learned it properly, so I decided to take Duolingo course
It is fun experience
The pronunciation, the words, the way they construct phrases -- all this is so weird to my ear
Not only they speak with funny mexican accent, they believe that "coger un coche por la mañana" is wrong, and one should "tomar un carro en la mañana".
I'd say zoophilia
In Czechia, and other European and non European countries, zoophilia is legal as long as the animal isn't abused, the person doesn't record the act and distribute it which is still really fucked up
Jóžin z bážin
We have even song about him:
Apparently the most common folkloric being in Czechia is the vodník / wasserman / vodyanoy
Czech folklore has a combination of Slavic and Germanic beings, possibly even some early Celtic influences (especially with the vodník and how it sometimes appears as a horse)
I'd say it's mostly in fairy-tales now, I can't say that I recall a current "cryptid" when it comes to our lands
So it's the classic chorts/devils, dragons (crocodiles), víly/rusalky, noonwraiths, ghosts of White Ladies, hejkal, dwarves in mines, vampires/werewolves (the Slavic vampire is not distinct from a werewolf, unlike the more "western" kind), witches, bludičky/will o' the wisp, fexts
Seems like Austrians brought this legend to the US, they have Goat man cryptids there
Surprisingly legends about White Ladies (especially foretelling death) are really, really old
It seems they just moved from castles to roads, though
Slavic countries have vodník / vodyanoi that do the same things, except for the naked part :D
Almost every country has some kind of a legend about household deities, so far I'd say it's an Indo-European legend or even something very intrinsic to our species as a whole
Off the top of my head, Slavic people have domovoy, Egyptian Bes, Anglo-Saxon hob, French lutin, German kobold, etc
I think we call them skřítek domovník or domácí skřítek
They're afraid to put their weight on the flashing
I was in a restaurant in Switzerland that served Hawaii pizza with cherries on top
No articles, no problems :) Czech language is hard to learn in many different ways but at least we don't have these
Yeah, it's mot that hard
We have On, Ona, Ono for singular and Oni, Ony, Ona for plural, but the declination is different for male, female and neutral "gender", so I can mostly tell
You mean if we know if a new word is masculine of the feminine
Yes we do, until it is in an official dictionary it is based on previous experiences and what people decide
Meme is masculine in Czech
It’s die ‘cause it’s feminine in Czech
Regardless, we do have gendered words and the gender just naturally comes to me (us)
It’s not that we feel the language’s soul or something, unlike in German, there are noun declinations, every word falling into one of them, depending on the combination of forms in different cases
It’s a bit of a loop logic, but through declension is how we find the category the noun falls in
Since OP wrote as examples _der, die, das_ in German and _le, la_ in French, I suppose that they meant articles connected with gendered nouns so _ten, ta, to_ in Czech
However, these are not articles in the same way as in English, German etc
(even though it serves similar purpose of stressing out that you're talking about a particular thing)
Also, we don't put anything in front of general nouns (*a* cat etc
Yes, but this is usually connected to determining the correct form of adjective to be used with each noun
It has nothing to do with articles
So, what are articles
Not sure if it's eqully common, but one can find them here in popular hiking areas
Yup
They are mostly from Germany, the UK and Sweden
They are romantic/soap opera (Rosamunde Pilcher, Danielle Steel)
The german films were mostly shot in the mountains and I watch then purely because I like the scenery
I watch them with my grandma
There is also a lot of detective films (Rex and Alarm für Kobra 11 are VERY popular)
There are also some turkish soap operas
I love the Magnificent Century, because of the history aspect of it
These films are my guilty pleasure lol
Fun fact: My friend wrote a fan fiction about Kobra 11, because she likes Tom Beck
Do you mean if our TV participated in Eurovision Film Week and similar things
then yes
We have few of them
Some children animations (I don't remember the names, but they were from Spain, France, Italy,...), some soap operas/romances (like Inga Lindström, 1001 Nights) Action (Cobra 11), Sci-fi (Doctor Who) etc
>  Czech or Slovakian films

Right on brother
Usually from around 15° C and more, doesn't need to be sunny
I despise anything above 22° C as it is too hot for me and I wear shorts even when it snows outside (so anywhere from -5° to 15°), granted, only for short amount of time when I walk my dog but still, I'd rather freeze than burn and sweat lol
If I'm working or walking around lets say 15C, if it's not windy
But for sitting down for longer time  - 23C at least
around 10°C as long as the wind isn't too bad
I know this isn't the norm and a lot of people call me dumb cause of it but I don't see much of a problem walking short sleeves outside in that
Depends how long I am outside
Under 5 minutes it can be in negatives (but above -10 degrees), over 10 minutes above +10 degrees and over 30 minutes above 15 degrees

Radetzky was Czech
I get that we were all part of Austria empire, but yk I think he is not austrian 'national here'. Sadly he is not national hero of Czech Republic either
Basically everybody connected with monarchy was forgoten
I believe his father, Jan Lucemburský (Johann von Luxemburg), was of the Luxembourg dynasty
We see him as a Czech (also because his mother was Přemyslid)
Charles himself was a very cosmopolitan person, and spoke French, German, Latin ad Czech
And no, his dynasty was not German, but French speaking, and he himself spent his childhood in the French court, so I don't see much reason to regard him as a German
Czechs see him as Czech
Sorry
You cant call Prague 'german town'. In that time over 70% inhabitans in Prag were Czech
Yes, due to Josef II action, the most spoken language there was German
But that doesn't say anything about nationality
Do you call  Kenyan who speaks english English
Of course he studied in Viena
Vieana was center of empire, the most  prestigious school was there
And as you said, he was noble
Of course he spoke mostly german
He was noble
Everybody in Austrian army spoke German
And about his nobility
He was actually from Czech low nobility, with mostly czech ancestors
&#x200B;
I can list you a lot of more arguments, but I don't thing it would convince you
So I will tell you what he wrote
It was to inhibitans of Berounský region and he refered to Bohemia as his ' beloved Czech homeland'. I can link you his letter, but it was written in Czech
And if you call  Radetzky  Austrian, because Bohemia was part of Austrian Empire, you should call Mozard German, because independent city of Salburg was part of HRE
But I get your with nobility
I just don't think it include low mobility like  laird
Yes every czech, moravian etc would be german then
I consider it it faulse logic tho
That was my point .
I disagree with your opinion on nationality in 19th century
If I am not wrong you refered to that   Groß/kleindeutsche Lösung thing
In that consil in 1848 Czech deputies protested againts Großdeutsche Lösung
And in same year Hungarians tryed a little independece revolution
That is a direct evidence that something like nationality like existed in Austrian empire
And about Radeszkys nationality
He clamied to be Czech, he talked to with his children in Czech
He was hero of Austrian empire for sure, of Austria of that day
But he is no hero for nowayas Austria
My dad as a 11-year-old helped distributing anti-Soviet leaflets during the Warsaw Pact Occupation of 1968 and my mum was the first to return the Communist Party membership card at her workplace in 1989
My parents participate in demonstrations in November of 1989 (first in Teplice, then in Prague)
Many ancestors fought in various wars (earliest one I definititely know about being Seven Years War)
Two of my great-grandfathers fought in WW2 - on opposing sides
One of them rode through home village of other one
My great-grandmother was a field medic during WW2
My great-grandfather made his apartment a safehouse for the resistance troops during the occupation by Germans and he got a medal for honor
Every member of my family who was alive at the time took some part in the velvet revolution in 1989
Yes, with the Velvet Revolution to be specific
First thing needed to mention is that the Party had a massive membership base, something above 10% of the population were members
People who wanted a higher education or applied for a leading position at work were often pressured to become members of the Party, this practice allowed the Party to have these people under control and also it discredited them in the eyes of political opponents
As many things, it wasn't offically mandatory and you could refuse if you wanted but there was always this phantom of possible retributions for your refusal so people who didn't care much and didn't want to be bothered just signed it
During the events of the November of 1989, many members publicly broke their ties with the Party by returning their membership cards which was seen as showing support to the revolution
My mum and her friend returned their cards right on Monday after the events of the 17th November
Everybody was like, "don't be stupid, things may still turn out bad and you'll be super fucked" and she said she no longer cared but after a few days when it looked better, most of other employees began returning their cards as well
We used to be a part of the HRE, but it would just sound silly otherwise
Exactly 0,000000000000000000 times periodical
Prague became the capital of the HRE during the reign of Charles IV
, in fact
You kind of forgot about like a dozen of Czech kings that were also Roman emperors
However you are right, we only joined one such entity and been in it for 800 years
McCoffee
In Europe we have that small isolated part of McDonald's where we can get coffee, smoothie or some dessert/cake/snack
There are cheesecakes, macaroons and some other stuff
Just like normal cafeterias
I was actually surprised when I didn't see that in US and some Americans I asked never heard of it
So I guess we have rather different approach in regard of food
Probably more civilized if u ask me
Proper (dark) [bread
Sensible gun laws
Metric system
I saw Polish school where kids around 16 learned how to shoot and repair Beryl, learned tactics and teamwork
In the meantime it was normal school/ gymnasium
Idk if Poland has gymnasium as one the school types
What else
Talking about Starbucks I bought few across countries
One in France, one in Spain and one in America oh yeah and also few ones in Czech Republic
Everywhere I ordered the same Caramel Macchiato and personally the worst was in Spain
A little better was in US
Best ones were my country and France and thinking about it
Best was really in Czechia
But I usually buy coffee in McDonald's or Czech version of Starbucks because it's much cheaper
What I heard no
I got into talk with some Americans that visited Europe and were actually sad it isn't thing in America
Our way is "na random"
In Czech it's sometimes 'soráč' (*so-raach*)
Both sorry and soráč are very informal tho
Used cars
Fixed price, mileage negotiable
Don't take the taxis from Prague airport to city center
Don't sign the petitions for disabled people when approached, especially if they are of the darker shade
Don't buy water at the Prague Castle, "cannabis/weed" anything from minimarkets, Absinth-anything anywhere
Don't buy anything off the kind black nigerian dudes in the city center, it's either bullshit, stolen or it's drugs
Don't eat out at the city center, it's all extremely overpriced
The whole city of Prague
Pořádný black Friday ne
It happens in Czechia as well
Same here in Prague
It's usually soms foreign gypsies
Oktoberfest is extremely expensive as it is, I can't image wiener wiesn being even more expensive than that
Jedině v AAAauto
I looked into Ukrainian car market when looking for classic car of certain model that's not common here
Germans buy new cars
Some get stolen and transported to Poland through Czechia
The totaled cars are sold to Poland and repaired
The crashed(but not totaled) cars are sold to Czechia
While in Czechia, they are either totaled and sold to Poland, where they are used to legalize cars stolen from Germany, or stolen to Poland for spare parts used to repair totaled cars
The cycle of cars
Bullshit
Škoda as a company and as a carmaker was a hot mess before the VW purchase
As of present, the cars and the company are at its peak and growing
Or do you seriously think that the Favorit, Felicia and 1st gen Fabias and Octavias were the pinnacle of Czech automaking
Scandinavian school systems are used as examples of successful non-discriminatory school systems here, exactly because there is no way to separate the smarter kids from the rest
>I wouldn’t visit it unless you’re going somewhere like Kruger National Park and nowhere else
I didn't know it was that bad
I've never been to an especially dangerous country, but most stories that I hear or read about tourists getting robbed and killed are about people who were clearly rich (in comparison with the standard of the given country) and looked like it
I wonder, if there's anything you can do to blend in and reduce the risk of getting mugged
After all, the average South African has to survive somehow, no
Which food in particular
Svíčková is love, svíčková is life
It’ll most likely be really hearty food, so use your preferred method of preparation for that
I’d suggest česnečka to start with, then svíčková if you like creamy sauces, or, my favourite, roast duck and fruit knedlíky for dessert
Hungarian and Czech goulash are so different I don’t think it’s fair to call it a copy
More like a inspiration
Theyre both good, but both so different
I'm the youngest sibling and youngest of all my cousins, so the most common game was "Ignore the little boy" where they were doing their own stuff and running away from me
Zvonkohra
It's when you ring on random people's doorbell and then you immediately run away, so they don't see who rang it
We played this exactly once
Mine doesn't anymore, because I'm now the tallest one
“Tři tisíce tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček přestříkalo přes tři tisíce tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
That’s a czech tongue twister, where “Ř” is a letter in czech alphabet that no foreigner can ever pronounce
Probalby "'žiš a co jako
" - Jeez, and like what
Nice, almost perfect translation :D now try pronouncing it xd
Almost :)
Same here
Liechtenstein
Yes, Liechtenstein
After WW2, Czechoslovak government stole some property in Czechoslovakia which belonged to the house of Liechtenstein based on the fact that "they were germans" (which is debatable) and "they collaborated with Nazis" (which is not true)
The property was not given back and in 1993, after the Dissolution of the Czechoslovakia, Liechtenstein refused to recognize Czech Republic as an independent state
Czech Republic acted in the same way and refused to recognize Liechtenstein
It took until 2009 for the countries to exchange diplomatic notes
The property of Liechtensteins is still not returned though
Most people in Czech Republic have no idea about this
What
This plot keeps getting crazier and crazier
Yeah, I would also be pissed off, if 80% of my country was occupied and actually somewhere completely different than the remaining 20%.
Yeah, yeah, I wasn't really serious
Pre-1989, we did not have Monopoly here due to its capitalistic nature which the USSR did not approve of, so we had another similar board game, still played today, called Dostihy a Sázky (something like Horseraces and Bets), where instead of buying businesses, you are buying horses, etc
It took Monopoly, simplified it a bit (not that much diversity in horse racing) and made it acceptable for a population living in a planned economy
Also, it looks much better than Monopoly, imo, which means a lot to me if I have to stare at a board for 5 hours in order to finish a game
As many said before : Dont be upset, man
But we have like five different games played with poker cards
I think most wildly spread is Prší. (raining)
Člověče nezlob se (Don't be angry man) and Prší (Raining) which is a card game
We have a game called dostihy a sázky (horse races And bets) And its like monopoly But with horses
I have such fond memories of hookah and backgammon in Turkey :)
We have the same game here, it's just called "don't be upset, man" (člověče nezlob se), this really brings back memories
If no big football club is important, then it's definitely Brno
I would say České Budějovice in English Czech Budweiser
The city where the beer brand Budweiser originated from
It’s the capital of the south Czech region
In Czech *linecké těsto* (Linzer Mürbeteig
) makes Linz (actually traditionally called ''Linec'' in Czech) quite known, probably even better known than Insbruck and Salzburg
It also helps Linz is closer to our borders
And [these] Christmas cookies
I always wonder if Linz has a museum or if you can buy Linzer Mürbeteig in every bakery
If so, I know where I’m headed after covid
Budějovice  are 8
Yeah, i wanna know too
of course it's a thing

Ma man
Osobně by mi nevadilo mít monarchu jako reprezentativní osobu
Mít formu nezávislosti jako Maďarsko, ale být součást císařství. Nezní to špatně.
Ale zas na druhou stranu Národní obrození mělo svůj důvod
Mít vlastní zemičku je krásné.
Full of austrian ogres
Sice je, ale nezávislé Československo vedlo k znásilnění nacisty a poté sověty
A rozhodně radši Karla Habsburského (vnuk posledního císaře) než-li Zemana
Kuk is czech onomatopoeia for 'look' (here/there)
It gets pretty funny, reading about 'look' army or 'look' ministry of finance
To jsem si neuvědomil :D to je podstatně horší.
To je pravda, i jako monarchista musím uznat, že se Slováci neměli nejlépe
There's no other way around it
We are cunts
If we don't know you, fuck you
Fuck you for being black, for being gay, for being rich or poor, for being different or too same as the rest
Fuck you for having power, fuck you for not wanting any responsibilit, fuck you for working for the government, for beeing employed, for beeing an employer or for not having a job at all
If we don't like a law/rule, fuck that, we will find a loophole or a way how go around it
However if you manage to get to us and befriend us, we really don't care about anything mentioned above and we will gladly drink beer with you
Fuck you if you don't drink beer
We overaly don't like foriegners, and we complain but don't do shit about it
> That we are lazy
Who is not lazy
Relaxation is more, ehm, relaxing than work
Haha replace cup of tea with coffee and ciggaret and you have a Czech version
There have been many smaller changes, but I'll go over the major ones
There has been a total of 5 constitution of both Czechoslovakia and Czechia - I include both, because technically, Czechia existed under the Federation since 1969, and both states are continuous
After the post-WW1 Temporary Constitution, 1920 was the year the first "full" Czechoslovak Constitution got adopted
It stayed during WW2 (the events of 1938 and after had been declared unconstitutional and the legitimate government continued in exile) and was replaced in 1948 by the communist May Constitution, that codified the hold over the country by the Communist party
It got repealed in 1960 by the so-called Socialist Constitution, that basically just added the word "socialist" to the name of the state
This one got greatly alterated in 1968 after the Warsaw Pact invasion, when the Federation laws were established
They were implemented as a sort of divide-and-conquer tactic of the new hardline communist regime, and national autonomy was practically just on paper, since only communist subservient to the party committee sat in both national parliaments
The Czech and Slovak republics under the federal one had been created, and were supposed to be given their own constitutions - it never happened though
After the Velvet Revolution, many changes were made, like stripping away the glaring communist relics, but a new constitution never was made, since by then talks of dissolving the federation had been underway
New national Constitution got created in 1992 and is in place today
Its most important changes up to now were the 1997 establishment of higher territorial units (provinces), the Euro-amendment of 2001, and the direct election of the president in 2011
As for changing the constitution, 3/5 majority of all deputies and then 3/5 of all present senators have to agree on it
There is currently no constitutional law on a referendum - the only one that took place was on the entry to the EU, and it was written as a one time constitutional amendment
about 8 times since fall of AH empire
What do you count as change/edit
If you count only complete changes then this number is too high
If you count all edits then this number is way too low
that's why I wrote about 8 and not exactly 8
basically just major events from this
But to add some of them and not all doesn't make sense if you talk about all changes
In czech its veverka
... and in slovak drevo kocúr :)))
Veverka
Well
there's no Ř in it
Veverka
But hamster (křeček) is much more [interesting]
I've heard you call them *drevokocúr* (woodcat) as a joke here, is there any truth to it
In czech translation scoia'tael are "veverky".. guess translator did not miss this connection
I’ve fooled many people by this
It's indeed a cognate with Latin viverra, both coming from PIE *wewer "small forest rodent"
The Crusade against Atom doesnt really make sense to me
And your minister of health attacking Czechs for their use of nuclear power
While I am as anti-commie and anti-PRC as one can be, it needs to be said that recognizing RoC as the legitimate Chinese government would be a big economic hit to any country
Despite all the hate they get, I really like Poland's current government
The country, at least for a tourist, looks awesome, clean
There is no trash on the streets of Warsaw, no homeless people, great schools with modern technology
Like I said - from what have I seen, it was awesome
And if that is the impression your country leaves on someone, i d say the government is doing something very good
Quite sure, I have spent a week in Warsaw and a day in Gdansk and Gdyna
I never saw someone here not keep them in a fridge
Maybe only if have their own eggs, but that's all
Fridge
Unless it's cold outside
Then we put them on the balcony to save space in the fridge
I store them in the fridge just as anyone I know
They are sold on refrigerated shelves in shops and fridges usually have got a dedicated shelf for eggs as well
Whether Czechia is a legitimate name or not, at least on the internet
How's there a discussion
Are there neuter nouns that end with an "a"?
I usually shop in Aldi because it's the cheapest
This
Also if EU is good or not
I mean, to make it worse, people say "Česko" overwhelmingly more than "Česká republika" in Czech, it's just English where they start having boundaries
It's more of an "sh" sound, isn't it
There's no "t" in there
I'd assume it being a foreign word is an argument for a feminine noun, since -a is sort of an "international" feminine ending
Although now I'm looking and you have "der Gorilla", "der Mozarella", and "das Straciatella". Dear god
Tbh our official short name should literally just be the flag emoji
Yeah, that's not "ch".
There kinda is though, the "ch" sound is like pronouncing "t" + "sh" at the same time
Czech doesn't sound the same as tjek
Compare the Czech words [šel \(shel\)] and [čel \(chel\)] Granted the "sh" is not the same as "tj" but it's closer to it than "ch".
So many people will think its Phillipines
So let's make it "řř"
I traveled Prague to Copenhagen by night train it was fine
But I was uni student at that point
I would definitely fly as I have family now
Prague Porto we flew
That's quite a distance
Lots of it depends on the train availability
I wouldn't mind traveling to Hungary from Czechia even with a child
It's a single quite comfy train ride
Anything over 12h with no sleeper is a plane
19h from Rome to Prague killed me (broke down twice) and I assumed there would be a cafe on board so was starving, I settled for a can of coke and a bag of crisps from a stop in Vienna (this is not good food at 7am
I've never traveled by train abroad (mostly because there wasn't any reason), but I'd like to
To the bus or plane, if the travel by bus is more than 12 hours I'd rather take the plane
Price is an important factor for me
Trains tend to be the most expensive option in many countries
Even the train ride from the airport can be more expensive than the flight itself
This issue can be avoided by buying the ticket well in advance
When traveling in buses, I prefer 8 to 12 night rides
It saves time and money, I don't like to waste time at the airports
Overally I often choose flying as I can't afford any other option
Comparing just comfort, trains would be the best
I hardly travel by train domestically and will unlikely use train internationally
All my previous experience with international train travel was just uncomfortable waste of time and money
Ye, I noticed it ended about a year after my Erasmus in Denmark
Quite a shame
True, but that lasts only for a time
If I remember correctly the train ride to Denmark was 13 hours
Which compared to 1,5 hour by plane is too much for a younger child
You can put a movie on and they'll be okay
But with the far longer train ride not even double Frozen marathon will save you
They'll be tired and insufferable
The true is there is really no socialist country in Europe
Definitely not the countries in the north nor the countries in the East are socialist
Not even Belarus is socialist - it's just plain authoritarian
Some people would say that Transinistria (which is an autonomous republic in Moldova) is *the last bastion of socialism* in Europe, but under the layer of its flag with hammer and sickle lies a corporativist state
It is interesting how USA forgot what was cold war about and who was  their enemy back then
And it is just 30 years ago
In one episode of the latest seasons of the Simpsons, the Simpsons flew to Denmark and Lisa said Denmark is a socialist country lol
>  in every communist country in history
was there any in recent history
One example is from Spiderman:homecoming, where they were in Prague and there was this weird south-american festival thing going on
I have no idea what that was suposed to mean, also the opera is about 300meters from the square the monster was on :D
According to foreign movies and TV shows, there is a big shootout between CIA and FSB (aka KGB) agents every night in Prague
From time to time, other intelligence services join the battle
It usually starts in secret underground dance club, when hacker meeting went wrong
Then there is a long car chase through the city with use of automatic weapons
Usually it ends with a big explosion
I guess you didn't have a dinner on the roof
Not a movie, but they nailed it in The IT Crowd
Or stupid people who refuse leave Midsomer despite it is full of murderers
>  tradition of fookdancing
They dance and fook
Love Actually
The monster was on square 100 km away in Liberec :D
Otherwise festival imho should be atempt of portraing Signal festival
But it looks completely different in reality
Well Karluv is mostly empty from around 2am, but yeah the russian wheel maybe on naplavka
shiit, didn't play
Putting on wishlist
Except the insanely bad google translate level translations
It was a bit embarassing honestly
It's against the popular belief, but most of the victims of the witch trials happened (1) not in medieval times, but in late renaissance and even in relatively modern times (1600s, some even in early 1700s) and (2) not in Catholic regions, but Protestant ones, like in Germany, Switzerland, and even England, Sweden and the US
I am Czech and dont really like beer
I feel you
Yep
It should be festival of light
so probably
WTF, do they still use commie addressing in the army
The only one I know about, that's why I wrote "and even in".
I learned it between 3 and 4
Most Czech kids learn cycling before elementary school, typically using auxiliary side wheels
I learned pretty young, probably around 5 y/o, with support wheels
However, I haven't ridden a bike in ages
Or rather, I've rode it once in last like 12 years
It was last year, my parents got those electing bicycles and I wanted to try it
I had trouble even getting on it and getting going
But once I got on, the muscle memory kicked in and I was going somewhat fine
Though I completely forgot how to shift
And I hated it
My ass hurt for next few days
I'm never getting on a bicycle ever again
Some wars in Middle ages or early modern age wars
For example: Bohemian wars and 30-year war
That would be a really great video game
The 30-years war would be best if it took place in Bohemia
I really hope KC:D will have a sequel some 15years later
WHEN THE CRUSADES COME
Damn Swedes, invading us all
We probably need Denmark and Finland in this group, probably more :D
Germans-skopčáci
The Germans our ancestors met came from mountains, s kopce=from the hill, can be offensive
Also Slovaks, Bratři, or Bratia
We have a slur for Germans, the word
“skopčák”.
A bit of etymology-
Z kopců - from the mountains (since a lot of Germans lived in the mountainous area of Sudetenland)
I often hear Germany being called “Říše” - reich/empire
We also call germans Skopčáci as mentioned before and french žabožrouti - frogeaters
I heard it in Czech dubbed movies
Last time in Taxi Taxi
We call you "pšonci"
Also žabožrouti (frog eaters) for the French,  although that is quite offensive
Bratia = Bros
Or Maďaři (Hungarians)
>'Tschechei'
It's also percieved as mildly offensive here and often connected with Nazism and the way they called us during the Protectorate era, ["Rest-Tschechei"] (after they conquered the borderlands)
The word also accidentally resembles our word *čekej* ("Wait
") as in a command you give to a dog which doesn't add much to its popularity
Yeah, forgot that
Looks that way
Well
Rise of NSDAP and Hitler
Münich fucking betrayal and then 1939 and Poland
We mostly went away from battles and operations
There was D-Day, Stalingrad and Kursk but not much else
Also assassination of Heydrich followed revenge of Germans by burning villages like Lidice
Our teacher was women so she pushed more emotional point of view on war
Holocaust was her main topic for most of the time
I had to do presentations myself on tanks, planes, equipment and notorious battles
Sadly the after war history is kinda
well blurry
we dont really learn about what happened after war
About the commies I mean
1948, 1968 and 1989
I think thats a bad thing
The Hussite Rebelion and the Hussite Wars
Romanticized both by nationalists and communists .
The husitte revolution
It was a religious uprising that happened after Jan Hus was executed
Its celebrated because the peasent destroyed like 3 crusades but people tend to make them into some egalitarian heroes or even communist which are also idealized a lot
1st republic
But that era was highly prosperous for Romania
Plus reigns of Přemysl Otakar II
, who became a Duke of Austria for a while (but that's more of an interwar thing), and obviously emperor Charles IV
I'd say that the First Republic is far more often used as the "goold old days".
Why
What happened thats to be celebreated
The thing is, Slovakia was sorta kinda promised federalisation back when Czechoslovakia was being formed
But once it had been a thing, federalising was a dangerous precedent
There was more Germans in Bohemia than Slovaks in Slovakia - so as far as the state was concerned, there was a langer 'Czechoslovak identity', for the sake of being bigger and better than Germans
An organised German substate was something fiercely fought against during Austria-Hungary, and by extension, federation was not on the list
Slovakia of course had a strong desire for federation anyway, and strong catholic presence in politics (that was against the secular nature and separation of church from the state)
So when they did become satellited by Germany, many viewed it as a win, considering catholics got into power, and you know, the first independent state kinda drives people
But the reigns for Charles IV and Přemysl Otakar II
were actually succsesful and good for their people
The Hussites really werenn't.
Ducks: quite common, readily available in bigger supermarkets
Geese: much more expensive
Usually available during the Christmas season only or in the biggest supermarkets
Quails: eggs are readily available, the bird itself is quite rare, but you can find it in biggest supermarkets
Pigeons: not a thing
EDIT:
Turkey: never sold whole, but parts are available in bigger supermarkets
Pheasants: only frozen ones and quite rarely
Available at wholesale retailers
Duck is a staple of Czech cuisine and is very common at home and in restaurants
It's usually slow roasted and served with cabbage and dumplings
It's one of my favorite foods
Since it's such a heavy dish, it's more commonly eaten during and around the winter months
Goose is traditionally eaten on St
Martin's day (11th of November here) as part of a feast
It's usually cooked and served in the same ways as a duck, it's just bigger
Quails and pigeons aren't that common these days, I've never had either, but I think they used to be eaten more commonly
There's also pheasants which are eaten during hunting season - they're pretty good although they tend to be pretty dry
Turkeys have also made their way into Czech cuisine as well but nowhere near as common as chicken or duck
Same in Czechia, goose with wine is the best thing about my nameday
Most (can be translated as Bridge) is one of the ugliest, typical communist architecture and poverty
Chomutov and Jirkov most likely
Now listen, these cities are both good looking in certain parts of the city, but there are so many ugly parts in those cities, that it almost outbalances the good parts
Mainly the "sídliště" (flat region) in both these places
I have family in Most, I've been there a handful of times in my life and I have always thought it was the ugliest city in the country
That was until I visited Karviná for the first time last year
Eugh
Honorable mentions: Ústí nad Labem, Trmice, Ostrava, Nový Bor, Česká Lípa
Most also has a Romani ghetto/hood called Chánov, which
isn't the nicest looking place by a long shot
Most cities in Sudetland, like Ústí nad Labem, Nový borl, or Jablonec nad Nisou have a kind of run-down feel about them
Another honorable mentions: Strakonice, Břeclav, Moravský Krumlov
I’m from trmice and actually trmice look great (i’m not saying great like great but it looks way better than for example ústí nad labem) but most people when they think of trmice actually think about a part of ústí nad labem called předlice but if you look at trmice i don’t know of any part that actually looks bad
Břeclav was honestly pretty nice, at least the center
Although I've been there during the summer, that might've helped the appearance a bit
Uff, sorry, I confused you guys with Předlice
That was the one suburb of Ústí I was thinking of
It’s allright many people do that (about half of ústí does it) so i don’t take it badly
When you speak Moravian Czech, people think that you're some peasant
Moravians may chuckle at it occasionally, but in general our accents aren't all that strong
And in cities, you're used to meeting people from all over the country
We have that same with Moravian accent
When you speak like that, people think that you're some peasant
Economy says that climate change is the biggest business opportunity, dont worry, everyone want´s to have their piece of pie
Cause politicians don´t know shit about anything, they can´t even repair roads, I have no idea why someone would expect them to know or even do something intelligent about climate
I mean at least in our parliament, majority of those dudes never really had a real job, and they have no real field of expertise
i/y is common as there is no difference in spoken language, similarly "mě" and "mně" is pronounced exactly the same
Also some people try to follow English rules for ordinal numbers, writing "1ní" ("první") like the English "1st" (first) but that is really crazy and the only way to write correctly is "1
", "2
" etc
Byste × by jste
*mě* vs *mně*
There is one that boils my blood
It’s not technically grammatical, but here it goes:
There are signs in public places that remind people to “watch their belongings”:
„Hlídejte si vaše osobní věci“
It’s **SVÉ** osobní věci, you fucking illiterate imbeciles
Try to put it into singular
„Hlídej si tvoje věci"? I think not
It really bothers me way more than it should
> Le instead of lo/la and vice versa
First make up your own mind
I gave up totally, it appears that no one is using the schoolbook "le for dative, lo/la for accusative". Some always use le with people, in some cases I failed to find any logic behing the usage at all
Also S and Z
I thought  the rule is easy: if it's "что делатЬ", then -тЬся, for "что делает, что делают" it's -тся
Wouldn't that be correct in the case of a group of people mutually watching their belongings
Thus that imperative sentence would be more general, but I'm not sure, it's late
(non-native here)
* por qué? == why
* porque == because
* (el) porqué == (the) reason
* por que =~ something between 2nd and 3rd, as far as I understand
Ordinal numerals are also declined in Czech, but in the written form you put a period behind the digits, that's the grammar
If the numeral can be read both ways (either ordinal or cardinal), i.e. behind a name (e.g. _volume 2_, _page 17_, etc
) it's without a period
If you make adjectives which contain numerals, you don't make a space between digits and the rest of the word (if you want to use digits), e.g. _80% alcohol_ vs _20 % accrued_ (yes, you can substitute the particular words for the percentage symbols)
byste is Conditional mood which is often misplaced with by jste which is plural would be
[čtvrthrst]
The latter is simply a hypercorrect form (i.e. incorrect) of the former
It shouldn't be used ever
> "одеть Надежду, надеть одежду"
questionable mnemonics
Not better than одеть одежду, надеть Надежду, maybe even worse because the first letters don't match
Yes
Sorry for your experience, I know very well from mine that starting from some point people don't correct you, what makes progress quite problematic
Well it's written down there (č is _**ch**ase_; and if you can say the trilled r, you'll just say all the letters in succession and that's it), basically if you have a lazy and/or untrained tongue and you make schwa vowels around some consonants, ~~you done fucked up~~we'll be able to tell
However, you could try [scvrnkls] it's one consonant shorter
Yes they are legal if they are a part of the school plan
In my final year one semester will be intership 4 days, school 1 day
They can be unpaid as long as we don't do any productive work (aka do actual work for the company)
Manhattan is definitely something else, it's enchanting to be completely surrounded by massive buildings and skyscrapers, and the city feels so bustling and alive
I definitely need to visit again some time after this craziness is over
It's definitely a vibe
When I was in New York I was expecting a dingy rugged rattling metro and that's exactly what I got
Wouldn't like to commute by it though
Richie Rich - Sám doma a bohatý - Home alone and rich
In Czech it’s smrtonosná past
Lethal trap
Wouldn't it be lethal trap
Because of lethal weapon - smrtonosná zbraň.
I got hit by a car and the guy drove away without providing any aid
They never caught him
I think I lost the last debit card, no clue what happened with that, but I think I lost it rather than somebody stole it
The more when no money were missing and nobody tried to pay with that
Other than that, no
The less of violent crime
A bycicle was stolen from my friend once, but that's all
Gypsi kids from my town stole my bike when I was a kid
A prostitute snatched a phone from my neck when I was in elementary in exchange for used Sparta prague tickets
Thats about it
Our baby stroller has been stolen from the lobby of the apartment building where I live
somebody stole my scooter when I was 10
I'm not the biggest rap fan, but I love [Galantní Jelen by Vojtaano]
[Please don't kill me it's catchy
*Promovaní inženýři*, especially because at one point the lyrics go "*I'm bright, my sister's not*" and as the younger, less bright sister, I identify with the statement
My brother's got an Ing while I'm working towards mine, but even once we both have the title, it's going to be clear who the brighter sibling is
Oh and pretty much anything from Čokovoko, especially *Sebevražda* and *Etapy v životě ženy*. The music is so bad but the lyrics are so smartly crafted and so hilariously Brnoesque
Záviš is also a big guilty pleasure since his lyrics are so obscene, but the classical instruments he uses to convey them are really nice
As for Germany, my go-to is *Moskau*. I may regret confessing this but I know the lyrics to *Dicke Lippen*. I read the lyrics shortly after I started learning German and was encouraged by understanding them (because they are do fucking stupid)
It's 6 years old
I'm old
How could I forget *Mám v p... na lehátku* (perfect OST to housework) and  *A já sprostá*.
We have word for it too
Same like Fatherland or Vaterland
In Czech its called Otčina - Otec means father
Deux, Rex, Patria
Czech word for vaterland/rodina is "vlast" as in vlastenectví=patriotism
Just for non-czech redditors
To make it a bit more clear, here are direct/literal translations:
* fatherland — otčina
* motherland — matčina
* homeland — domovina
* ~eigenland, the land proper — vlast
In sense of country it is vlast but direct translation is otčina
Although it is rarely used
Nice one
Also Honor makes more sense now because Rex is king
Both Vaterland and Rodina translate to Vlast
I know
lmao that's just a normal ass window bruh
i haven't really seen any other type here
i'm originally from Toronto so yeah when I first saw em I was buggin too
That's a normal window
The only difference is that nowadays there is one handle for everything; 30 years ago the windows had a handle for opening and a lever in the bottom corner to switch between horizontal/vertical
100% For new buildings these days
Only if you live in city center and look of the building is protected by historians, you have to have regular wooden ones
Windows in usa are not plastic, we have to conserve energy, because energy is more expensive in europe
Same is with door knobs
I dont know why every american have the ball ones
we have these everywhere
I don't think I have ever encountered a window in Europe that couldn't do that, up until now I thought that was the norm
> faux wood finishing
Why do you think it's faux wood
This mechanism is used in modern wooden windows as well
Yeah, they are definitely more expensive, which is probably why few houses have them (my parents have them, because they consider the plastic ones ugly)

Kovy makes some of the finest content in Czech Republic
I think
I can't think of someone more rational on the small Czech YouTube scene
PLASMO, a very talented model maker, with very down to earth approach
McGamerCZ, a Warframe Youtuber
I only watch his stuff when I return to Warframe, but he's friendly, informative, to the point and doesn't scream
Coincidentally, they both make content in English (though Plasmo used to make them in Czech)
Stejk
Probably the most down to Earth and cool one
I enjoy Tartarus Cast
Love that guy
As usual as for women
Usually more formal meeting, or meeting of two families, meeting for the first time
In casual setting, usually no
Friends definitely don't. Distant relatives who you don't see often
Yeah, you can shake hands
If it's in any way a bit more formal or business context, always shake hands
In Czech rep I feel like it depends how well do you know the person - if it is a formal situation then you would most likely go for a handshake, but if it is your friend you would use some kind of other greeting - it might be a hug, just saying "hello" or holding hands "in reverse" and bumping into each others shoulder
We used to shake hands as first thing at work everyday
Definitely a cat person
It is more common to own a dog than a cat in the Czech Republic
The entire continent
Probably cats
I prefer cats
Dogs are fine, but I like cats more
I'm a cat person
Czechia is absolutely a dog people country, we have one of the highest dog ownership rates in the world IIRC
Dogs are allowed on public transportation, in pubs, basically everywhere
I would guess that the whole continent leans a bit more towards dogs, but not as much as most Czechs
How much is the dog tax, just out of curiosity
We have fees for owning dogs too (60-80€/year in my district, plus chipping became mandatory this year), but that doesn't seem to affect their popularity at all
I feel like it doesn't even really compare to all the other costs of owning a pet
My mom is really afraid of dogs, so we can't have any
She can tolerate cats, but she is terribly afraid of dogs

[Sencor] \- not B2B but a lot of people doesn't know it's Czech
Doppelmayr is pretty well know imo since there's no spot on the ski lift where you wouldn't find their giant logo
And Glock is not doing just B2B business
not reliant but it makes things comfortable
Idk if it counts because this is more of a bizzare situation rather than law, but one Czech family got robbed
Theyve put up cameras to get some evidence in case robbers return
I think one or more robbers returned and their face/s got captured on camera
Quick trial and off to jail, right
Wrong
The camera had evidence of robbers face but it also had partial view on square which is public space
And having private camera overlooking public space is illegal
in the end the robber attacked their evidence
The family ended up fined
I dont know where the robber ended up
EDIT: typo
Balkans end with Slovenia, Hungary and Romania
The question is whether you include these three countries as well
Does anyone consider Istanbul to be a part of the Balkans
If you do, I choose Athens as my pick as well
Even though personally I like Sarajevo the best
Over my dead body
Prague is the most important city of the Balkans and also its center
Digging in our backyard will not reveal some fascinating artifacts (unless you are superlucky, but in general these areas are elsewhere) but just some abandoned cemetery or some abandoned stuff dated up  to 15th -16th century (or older if you are lucky)
A building from 1880 would be just a default building where I live, whole area was rebuilded during 1880-1910
Well, digging down in your garden will probably give you nothing
But in almost every village you'll find a landmark of some sort - a calvary, birthhouse of a famous person, a memorial to the fallen of World Wars
And every 15 km at least you'll pass by a castle or a chateau - I walk by two every morning when going to town square alone - Old and New (because why settle for your old folks home when there's enough place to build a mega-mansion in their backyard eh
And yes - every once in a while something happens related to earlier history in my tiny town of 8
000 people
A hotel fell through the ground in the town square a few decades back because everyone forgot about some medieval cellar for storing beer barrels it was built on
An escape tunnel going down to the town river was uncovered a few years back going from the Old Castle
Every once in a while construction has to be halted in nearby villages because they uncover a few medival coins and pottery shards - in the ground or in old walls
Depends how much you look for details, but I don't think, that we have many blindspots
There are chronicles, some official documents from inside and outside (mostly HRE), there are holes, but we moreless know what happened
At least as far as I know
We have Lítačka card here, which with you use Prague public transport in PID P zone, if going beyond P zone, you have to buy aditional ticket for small charge (like 50 cents
) You don't have to put the card against the chip when entering, you can be controled by controler, if you don't have coupon on your card, or a marked ticket, you'll get a fine (about 70 euros
) The controls are pretty much random, so lot of people get away with riding withnout a ticket
In my city I have an annual ticket that I buy online
Outside of that I'd probably use cash or mobile apps
It's same in czech (obviously) - sýr, which means cheese in english
"Do you have /insert any regular equipment everybody has the last 30 years/ since you are some central Russia village or something
Don't do any Czech word puns (unless you are 10 years old or younger)
And then there's those horrible "czech" puns
"Oh, you're from the Czechia
I visited Prague three years ago
I am not one of those Czechs who hate on Prague, but if it's literally the only thing anyone knows, it becomes a bit irritating to hear about it
Happened to me with Pavel Nedvěd in Rome
I laughed embarassingly lot at "Don't touch my spaghet
Oh I remember this one time I got invited to a "Russia-themed" party by a girl from Scotland
Of course everyone came dressed as fucking Stalin
Don't worry, at least we know you well, because you are the pun of another annoying "cliché" I very much hated
- "Where are you going on vacation this summer
" "We are for  Malta
" Because malta - mortar in Czech, usually meaning you are going to work on the house (or "Malta and Písek", Písek being one town and also sand)
But I hated it so much because of the personal meaning "our dad made up some stupidity he won't finish again and we end up home the whole summer working on something unnecessary he wants while he proudly and openly proclaims buying material for his idea is so much better than trip over the border, since he as truck driver was already there anyway".
The absolute peak of comedy: *Czech yourself before you wreck yourself/have you Czeched/do your stores take Czechs/Czech it out*...

if you would had a Croatian flair it would make at least some sense

Although my friend didn't do this, I have no idea how he didn't get shot or something on a Christmas trip to Dresden

Interesting how Americans talk about their wages a year and by a month
That was actually amusing
We got a lot of hatred from some Americans a couple of years ago because of a bombing that took place in Boston
It was done by Chechens
Haha, got me
I guess you're right
It just gets kinda tiring, if it's always the one thing, that's all
Whoa, I'm all for some fun pokes at each other, but I don't wanna get murdered by a drunk would-be Soviet at a party
Obviously is Luxembourgeoisie
Ehhhh, I literally don't know what you're talking about
>you're jealous of the sea
because we are (and all these plans to make a tunnel to the sea says so, including Croatia where 8 or 10 % of our population goes every year because of their sea, and they have to compete with charter flights to Turkey/Morroco/Tunisia/Egypt/insert anything you know from TUI catalog)
It is just not the Baltic sea we are jealous of (and yours North sea doesn't really makes any difference, Rügen island wasn't a dream destination not even during socialistic times) So the question "how is our acces to the sea doing" from Poland have only answer "yeah, it is better than yours because we have it closer" :)
Should used "beer mug broken over his head"
Luckily not the company I'm longing for
Gotta invent a new drink, Trockij on ice
Interesting, thanks
Oh you guys are the ones to talk :D. I think we could spend the afternoon looking for conflicting and hilarious Czech-Polish expressions
Empty one of course, what am I, an animal
He was drunk of course, he decided he wants to sing Deutschland by Rammstein
But I dunno if he got the lyrics right, since he started yelling "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles"
The fact he could be described as, what I would describe as very tanned, made the sight ever weirder
>in Dresden chances aren't slim that people would sing along
My English isn't the best, does that mean that they would or wouldn't?
Luckily he didn't know about Auferstanden aus Ruinen

Oh wait
This will be a fiasco

Well, time to switch to the Karlsbad dumplings and bread dumplings
As for myself, nothing
I don't eat out and I'm lazy to peel potatoes, so I eat potatoes only very little

We're crazy about anything we're good at (mainly Ice hockey)
That's when Czechia plays against Russia
It's basically national holiday everytime we win
Hasn't really happened for the past few years I think tho
We are very touchy when it comes to anything with Russia
Or Russia
We’d drink the most beer yet we’e be the least drunk ones
We would bring our own food, neatly packed from home, to be on the safe side, then drink beer all the evening and return home with food from the table messily dumped in our bag because, hey, it would be a waste to leave it there
We'll be fighting over every piece of pizza with Slovakia, then complaining about everything, pointing at Germany and Russia, gossiping about others, went over to table where Great Britain is sitting, scream at them they betrayed us, get's back, get's blackout drunk with Slovakia, went home, calling them "my brother" singing various traditional songs and state anthems
It would go south pretty quickly and we would end up with Ireland, Germany and Russia
Each country trying to outdrink the other 3
No doubt
Dunno why but Jára Cimrman was completely removed from our history
For example when Alexander G. Bell invented telephone
Bell had already 3 missed calls from Cimrman

Breaking bad can work well in Czech setting
Meth is produced and consumed here (it was even mentioned in original show), and Mexican cartel can be replaced with Vietnamese gang
Instead of dessert, it can take place in border mountain regions
Let's make a movie about independence war or civil war and ruin it completely
That we "changed" our name to Czechia
Every time someone mentions the Czech Republic, you can see someone else commenting "I heard they're called Czechia now". The fact is nothing was changed, only a short name was officially codified  and added into the UN list of country names
"The Czech Republic" is still a correct long name just as "the French Republic" is as correct as "France".
Every UN member is supposed to state its long name and the short name in the country's language and in the official UN languages
Back in 1993, a Czech short name "Česko" and an English short name "Czechia" (respectively French "Tchéquie", Spanish "Chequia" etc
) were proposed but government couldn't agree on it so a compromise was made and we stated only the Czech name and left the rest blank until we would come with better alternatives
Twenty years passed and we didn't come with anything better so we filled in the original proposals
/r/Prague is "shit expat says" from time to time, it is quite interesting to see in how big bubble they are living
They never heard of all those ships, airplanes, the whole quisling thing
About the resistance at the shore
I was in the care of NHS
Dear Americans, if you want to take inspiration of European health system, please get inspired by Norway, Germany, Italy, Romania, Albania
All are much better
Seriously
Yeah lol listening to Austrian radio wasn't exactly something rare in commie CZSK
Communism was pretty shit but like come on haha
hard to say, it is English speaking sub so you have no idea where are these people from
There is one british person I can say he is totally living here not just expating
On the other hand it is couple days ago I've read total nonsense about how health insurance is paid here from fellow Czech
Do you think they are just stupid or is it misinterpretation of permittenttrafik by some tour guide
not understanding text
Yes, that's a big problem everywhere
I came to Reddit because of a stupid Prague tour guide comment
Might be an interesting story to track it back to the source

Does your country have a tradition of sending children to summer camps
Yes, almost everyone is send away for 2 weeks in summer
You usually live in tents and do a lot of fun actvity stuff while there
You usually go to the same camp with with the same people every year until you are ~18
You make good friends there which are usually scattered across the republic so you meet people from different towns etc
Some people keep going there as workers once the turn 18, so you can keep in contact
Very fun tradition :)
some of them was "international", was somewhere in GDR together with Hungarian and Poles back then and  Germans, poles and Hungarians were going here as well
Parents worked for same organization, just in different countries
What is SVC
Best subreddit, hands down
Twice a year for a check up as you are supposed to
My mum is a dental nurse so she makes sure I never skip
A lot of people I know however seem to visit a dentist only when they have got a problem and often haven't even got their own dentist which then causes troubles because there's a scarcity of them and many don't accept new patients
Twice a year for checkup and clean as that is payed from the public health insurance
Most people I know goes that often
Some only once a year
In Czechia- Twice per year to the dentist for check (its included in your insurance) and twice per year to dental hygienist (paying this from my pocket)
My motivation is actually my dentist being angry if i don't go twice a year
And you don't want an angry person sticking steel instruments into your mouth
The assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia
He was the highest German official to be successfully assassinated during ww2
In the protectorate the only higher ranked nazi was Hitler, so it was a big deal
He as killed by Czech and Slovak paratroopers who were flown over the Protectorate by a plane in 1942
Well because we were part of your empire learn it well
It indeed took a Herculean effort to read all those reviews of 2016's Anthropoid without getting a hernia, what with half of them starting by calling the operation "obscure" and "unknown" and ending by concluding that "the movie reminds us that Auschwitz and the beaches of Normandy weren't the only places affected by WWII".
Yeah
So nice you dont need to calculate how big extortion you have to pay
So you dont even see this money
Its stolen directly from employer hand before it reaches you
So basically they steal 33% and you dont know about it
And after that you pay VAT and other "consumption taxes)" on gas, so you get ripped off twice or three times
How nice of them
This
In the general Western European consciousness, an entire half of the continent just somehow sprung into existence in the 1930s, completely out of the blue
Though moving the date to 1990s isn't rare either
Guess that explains the permanent desire to teach random Easterners how to use a washing machine
It was abolished easily in 1990 as a part of major changes after the Velvet revolution (fall of the communist dicatorship)
It was also briefly abolished in 1787-1795 during the rule of Joseph II

Like the other guy said
Neutral is the best word to describe it
There are barely any latin amricans living here and I never met one
So czechs haven't been able to create a stereotype about latin americans
Not sure, probably neutral
Most of the things I have associated with these countries were related to things that popped up on r/watchpeopledie when it was still there lol but other than that no opinion on the people as such
The difference I was learned (and was named and from my experience was heavily used here) in late nineties was that expats were expatriated by their companies
Company I was working for moved me to UK (and then elsewhere) and everyone here and in UK call me expat
If I would pack my shit, hop on the plane and ask for job in the UK I would be an immigrant
no we don't shift holidays, both may holidays are saturday this year
I actually forgot that 1
is a holiday
and 8
(end of ww2)
I am surprised that you don't have end of WW2 as a national holiday
It feels to me as much more important holiday than May 1st
What the fuck
A) that will dull them real bloody fast and B) we use one of those roller things because we are not animals
let me go back on that
Most of us are not animals
Why have I never thought about this before
I already use scissors for many things in the kitchen where other people would never think about using them but never thought about cutting pizza with scissors
Scissors are a great tool, much more convenient to cut many things with them rather than with a knife
I second this
I think it's a bit sad that he's ranking so low
He might not have been the best "emperor", but in my opinion he was one of the best people to ever become an emperor
Out of five good emperors, only Marcus Cocceius Nerva has not been mentioned so far
And fucked his coach driver (also called himself his coachdriver's queen)
And wore make-up
Praha (Prague) and Brno, our two largest cities always fight who is better and rest of the country is on one of the sides or doesn’t give a fuck about it, and as someone from Czech part of Czech Republic we always make fun of Brno and in Moravia it’s the other way around
There is Brno which is laughing stock for people from all of the country and then there is the capital- Prague which is a laughing stock from people from Moravia
But in the end we all know who's got metro and who's got black dildo on the main square
We also use it in Czech but we spell it skanzen
I guess Barandov Studio is the closest to what you're describing
Not to be confused with the tv channel ran by Jaromír Soukup
Also maybe Ateliéry Bonton Zlín, but those don't exist anymore
Prague (1
5 million), Brno (0
4 million), Ostrava (0
3 million)
Prague's official mottos had been the "head of the kingdom" and the "mother of cities", which gives you the idea of how self-important Praguers are
/s It has been the capital of Czechia and the largest city of the country for more than 1100 years
Brno is the second city (or the first village as some snotty Praguers would probably say) with a bit of an inferiority complex towards the capital
It is also a rather nice and livable student city
Ostrava used to be a little town until the industrial revolution kicked in
The once "steel heart of the republic" is now trying to shake off its "sooty" image
I'd say it's the other way around, Brno doesn't have inferiority complex, Prague has superiority complex
Everyone outside of Prague hates people from Prague and vice versa
I am from Prague
We do have mandatory vaccination
In czechai they are for quite some time
Sure, Elizabeth II=Alžběta II
To be precise, it is inconsistent
For one, her son is Prince *Charles*, but the beheaded one was *Karel* Stuart
But it's completely random who gets translated and who doesn't. Juan Carlos was Juan Carlos in Czech, not Jan Karel, but Felipe of Spain is Filip
Hans Adam of Liechtenstein is not translated (Jan Adam), but Margrethe of Denmark is Markéta
Yet king John of England is always translated as Jan
Pope Francis is also always translated as František and in general names of popes are always translated
There is pretty much zero consistency, which is pretty typical of our language in general
In Czech:
* John Lackland = Jan Bezzemek
* Richard Lionheart = Richard Lví Srdce
* Charlemagne = Karel Veliký
* William the Conqueror = Vilém Dobyvatel
* Henry VIII = Jindřich VIII
* Mary of England = Marie Tudorovna
* Phillip II of Spain = Filip II
Španělský
* Charles I = Karel I.
* James I = Jakub I.
I suppose ruling monarch names are much more likely to be translated
Prague isn't just cesspit of junkies, tourists, hookers and arogant people

Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg
Netherlands - everyone smokes weed, it’s flat, full of windmills and tulips, everyone cycles everywhere
Belgium - two languages, basically split in half, the EU lives here and waffles

We have four combinations
Děkuji ti - (I) thank you (sg
Děkuji vám - (I) thank you (pl
or formal)
Děkujeme ti - (We) thank you (sg
Děkujeme vám - (We) thank you (pl
or formal)
Díky
Dík
Hvala sound like chvála - praise
Děkuji is more formal than děkuju
If you want to use only one use děkuji
In Czech grammar approximately 1/6 is germanisms
Brno dialect "Hantec" is a drunk mix of German and Czech, for example Zoncna (sun), Hózny (pants), Šalina (tram, derived from Elektri*she linie*) etc
Many of them, and generally they fall into two broad categories:
* the ones that got domesticated and don't feel German anymore (knedlík from Knödel, helma from Helm)
* the ones that are not domesticated, these are used in colloquial speech or slang and in formal settings another word being used: kšeft from Geschäft (obchod), ksicht from Gesicht (obličej), kvér from Gewehr (puška), hajzl from Häusel (záchod), piksla from Büchse (dóza, but it is German too), mašinfíra from Maschinführer (strojvedoucí) etc
Himlhergot, I can't remember any
flaška-Flasche (bottle)
A lot of, if those angainst which Jan Hus protested count
I came here to say this
Especially the Brno slang
If any Germans would like some examples would like some examples, just comment, and I'll reply with more tomorrow
Did you get really get that from Austria
Palačinka has quite [a long chain of loaning] and you could take a short cut
Please can you post examples
I’m unfamiliar with Brno slang :P
Yeah
The latter
The words from the second category belong to the Austro-Bavarian dialect group, since they are usually borrowings from Austrian German
EDIT: Another example for specifically Austro-Bavarian word, but this time fully domesticated and entered literary language: žemle from Semmel
Depends on what you consider long hair it ranges from very common to not as common
Long hair is pretty much accepted
I'd say it's not rare, but not exceedingly common either
I have long hair myself, and nobody really minds it
Also worth noting that having long hair was somewhat seen as being counter-culture under communism, which might be one of the reasons why it's so accepted
Not too common, but I am sometimes one of them
I get a hair cut once a few years
Nobody cares about anyone's hair
I would say it used to be more common up until maybe the mid-2010s, then it started dying out
I used to have long hair for a long time and I there weren't a lot of times people gave me shit because of it, but it happened a handful of times
That said, once I cut my hair to a much better haircut, dating became *a lot* easier
Yes, Czech people stare
It has probably not much to do with your appearance
They are bored because there is no view
So they look at something at least marginally interesting, aka
other people
It's not personal
They will forget you as soon as they get off the metro
You need to stare back deeply into their eyes to assert dominance
*Kudlanka*, derived from *kudla*, "jackknife". Praying mantis is then *kudlanka nábožná* meaning it's "religious".
The insect order is called *kudlanky* (would be *kudlanka* in singular) and the praying mantis is *kudlanka nábožná*.
Kudlanka - derived from the word "kudla" which means jackknife
"Kudlanka Nábožná"
It literally means "Religious Cricket" (or also Religious Mantis, but that's lame)
It's an example of [Euro English]
you mean a jump cock ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nábožná indeed means religious
*Kudlanka* apparently traces its etymology to the word *kudla*, which means **jackknife** in reference to the shape of the front legs
Pretty cool name imo
magyar nyelvben is also pretty clear, "in hungarian language".
New world symphony by Antonín Dvořák, was even in spave
I think Je taime moi non plus is pretty popular also
[Moldau] is another well-known masterpiece
Damn that’s right
I wanted to go with Karel Gott and his Vcelka Mája or just generally with him, but I believe yours is WAY more famous
Or is it Škoda lásky, better known internationally as Beer Barrel Polka
I would also choose Modlitba pro Martu for the important role in our modern history
That we are part of Russia
Boils my blood
Eu favela)))
Merely German-speaking Czech province
This was terribly confusing for me while learning English - in Czech, Slovakia is Slovensko and Slovenia is Slovinsko
So I always wanted to say Slovensko, logically, as Slovenia at first
Some were executed or imprisoned, some were killed ehm
disorderly, some were deported to Germany or sent to Soviet union, some were blackmailed by communist police to become THEIR collaborators
Of course some innocent people were also marked as collaborators and vice versa
Not really possible to count
Hard to say, especially since the line is quite blurry
Does [zámek/chateau/Schloß] count
Does fortress/Festung count
Does [tvrz/fortified house] count (this one lost the tower)
Or [Arab guard tower]
Castles are everywhere
Just everywhere in Europe
A few dozen, mostly as a child
I got kinda bored with Czech castles by the time I was 9 or 10, to be honest, it was more of an excuse for my dad to go with me
He was the kind of person who'd always ask questions during tours and play the smartass
I also worked as a guide at a castle for one summer in high school
Jsem na tom stejně
Was it Trakai castle
People mention laptops as benefits
If you're given laptops to work on, it's not a benefit, it's a work tool
A phone (with subscription), a laptop and a car all free to use for personal use as well
Lunches are paid for by the company and since you included healthcare, that as well, although it's not really a benefit because it's mandatory
People don't scold me when I arrive late, which I do, even frequently so
And nobody really seems to care when I don't check work emails when not in work
That's pretty much all I need for a happy work life
The other stuff that people mention here like phones, laptops are a thing too, though I don't really need that
Sick days and food coupons are nice tho
5 (up to 10 depends) days off
8 sick days (without doctor note, max two in a row)
30 fully paid sick days (with doctor note)
fully paid public transport in Prague
sim card (which I have no clue where it is) with some tariff (I don't use and have it redirected to my personal number)  + some (midrange) Android phone for these interested
(or Blackberry)
about 2EUR daily contribution to meal vouchers
some monthly contribution I can recall the number (about 40 EUR in local currency if I remember correctly) to pension funds/ some other non meal vouchers up to your decision
better bank rates as it comes to interest on savings accounts, interest on loans, mortgages, credit cards, better exchange rates, better card benefit programs
Some discounts here and there, list is quite huge from theaters to coffee places, including access to Makro (known as Metro Cash & Carry elsewhere)
shitload of things and activities for childrens
yearly bonus, free working time and many things I can't remember right know or I don't even know these exists
Pension retirement insursnce (on top of state mandatory one)
Extra healthcare
100 % paid sick leave
Sick days 4 are standard, but if you need more, its not a problem)
Extra vacation above the state minimum
Bridge day (2x - basically extra holiday)
7hrs work day (9-17, 1hr lunch break)
Homeoffice (not really lol, its one day per month)
Meal vouchers
Multisport card
Discount on out products (16-33 %)
Activity vouchers valid in pharmacies, gyms, cinemas, some online shops etc
Also its possible to transfer unused vacations to the next year, so this year i am able to use 37 vacation days
I dont see a laptop/phone as a benefit since its usual work tool
Also none yells at me, none cars if i go early or come late, no e cares how i actually fill the attendance (none checks), if you need to leave mid day, you just tell the manager you are going to get a haitlrcut or whatever
And btw its an american company
As opposed to using your own laptop, or having to pay for job related trainings, certifications
> If I can use it privately, it's also a benefit
Curious trivia:
My work contract allows me to use office equipment for personal purposes "to reasonable extent" and in law-abiding manner, with one specific exception: I can not use it for watching porn, even out of the working hours
I would never do a job where it would be my responsibility to get a phone/laptop/certifications/whatever
It doesn't really work like that here, everyone has the same basic insurance which is mandatory, the services don't differ
You can have extra private insurance with the basic one (for example for dental medicine, which is not covered very well by the basic one), but it is not that common and very rarely provided by employers
True, but i work in a field where people are used to working outside of regular work hours (tourism, hospitality)
should wrote +5 (up to +10) above legal minimum
Yes Blackberry, we are still using this crap
Yeah, there are a lot of American companies that have this mentality
Not saying I like it
I have a friend who had to do required continuing education, and she has to pay for it
Weak
Sorry, but /u/Archidiakon is right
Yes, these letters (graphemes) are traditionally referred to as "vowels" in the English mainstream, however from a linguistic point of view, it is wrong
Last time it was maybe remotely true was before the Great Vowel Shift
Similar widespread mistake is to talk about "long vowels" when referring to eə eɪ aɪ ɔɪ aʊ ɪə ʊə. These are not long vowels (i.e. monophthong vowels with a greater quantity) but diphthongs
Let's agree that we both use a different definition of "vowel". Your definition would be frowned upon in the field of linguistics, mine would maybe confuse uneducated English speakers
nope, just drinking
Nah, Slovak is still fairly inteligible :^)
Eh, never had a problem understanding Slovak
Yeah, me neither
The Munich treaty - It allowed for later German occupation, which led to demise of many people capable and willing to resist undemocratic regime, which together with disappointment in behaviour of UK and France significantly eased the communist take over
The repercussions of communism still have large impact on the country as can be seen on  personified example of our PM
Well, the first thing that comes to mind are Husitte wars, but I'd say, that Czech National Revival is more important, because for few hundred years, only peasants were talking Czech-ish and this event changed everything
People started speaking Czech, started writing Czech books, poems, plays, ancient manuscripts and it really strengthened our national identity
> It's either 1866 and Austria's end of German hegemony after losing the war to Russia,
I believe you mean Prussia
Was Marianne that lady with her tit out
I see, thanks
When I was younger I didn’t like most of Czech food, because it’s mostly veggie sauces, but the more older I am the more I love them, but there is stil one think I wouldn’t ever eat, Prdelačka- soup from blood
Aspik, it's so disgusting
I don't know if it's the texture or the taste (probably both, to be honest) but I really hate it
Damn you just reminded me of it
One of my favorite foods that I haven't had in like half a year
Haha that’s my grandma’s favorite
Funny, here when something "jde do kelu", it means it's going into shit
One of my most favorite dishes
I have heard “jdu do kelu” only in Moravia, especially in Ostrava
Other end of the country but I hear it anyway
No, they are pretty much the same language with small differences
In CZE:
National Museum in Prague
National Technical Museum
Museum Of Public Transport
National Gallery
Czech RepuBRICK
Škoda Auto Museum in Mladá Boleslav
and practically any castle u see
We have more than 2000 castles, so enjoy
In Algeria:
I'm half Algerian, and I know this is AskEurope, but I think any information is good
Museum Of Fine Arts in Algiers
National Museum Of Arts And Popular Traditions
Museum Of Modern Art in Oran
Cirta National Museum
Martyrs Memorial and Mujahid Museum
I second [Technical Museum] I loved it as a child
It has small aircrafts suspended from ceiling of main hall
Also [Museum of Decorative Arts] in Prague is nice, if you like design
Its building was recently renovated, too
Same in Czech
Pretty common
I mean, it's def not at every second corner, but if a town has about 50-70k inhabitants, there will probably be a KFC
(plus many more in tourist locations, plus a few kfcs on highways)
In 2019, there were 105 KFC places, but earlier this year, they opened one near me so might be 106
40, so almost half of them are in Prague, and they have actually more restaurants than McDonalds, which had 101 in 2019
Very, every city with over 50k population has at least one KFC, and the bigger cities have several
Prague for example has dozens
Wow, TIL that our neighbors have almost no KFC’s whereas we have a ton of them
Interesting
Yeah, Czechs are batty about their KFC
When I went to school in Olomouc, my czech girlfriend took me to Brno
It was my first time to Brno, And we only went to the mall
She insisted we go to KFC because she loved it, and thought it would make me feel at home
I'd never had kfc in my life up to that point
Eh, I guess most people can cook to some extent, but way too many men still expect their girlfriends/wives to do it all the time
Some millennial men who cook like to present themselves as God's gifts to humanity because they know it's still not the standard
My father has almost like a phobia of even trying it - he was a stay at home parent for some time when I was a kid, he'd do all the cleaning and everything else around the house, but cooking was still up to my mom
I (female) also didn't learn much about cooking until I moved out for college, and I feel like that's not uncommon, in some families you're just expected to figure it out for youself later
Special family recipes and such aren't a big deal here IME, I just like
googled it
>  in some families you're just expected to figure it out for youself later
Thank you, up until now I thought I was the only one who experienced this
Weirdly, my family's refusal to teach me how to cook because I "would make a mess" was coupled with constant moaning how I'd be one day completely lost in the big bad world because, among many many other reasons why I completely sucked, I "couldn't even cook". The skill was supposed to just somehow be divined into my brain without inconveniencing anyone
That sounds pretty funny, NGL
Here, almost all restaurants stayed open and switched to offering delivery, maybe there would have been a lot more chaos in the last 2 months if that had been forbidden
It was shocking enough for Czechs to have no draft beer for so long
I've dated two Italian girls in my life and, ironically, the first one was the worst cook I've ever met
Her repertoire of dishes included completely wooden pizza, burnt eggs totally stuck to the frying pan and cereals spilled under the heater
Although, to be fair, she was very careful about pasta being al dente and everyone's pronounciation of Italian names of dishes
The second one wasn't a horrible cook and she took the "no corn or pineapple on pizza" thing very seriously, but she liked it with french fries on it
While I still love Italian cuisine, I've become a bit sceptical about every Italian claiming to be a cook
No offense
Same with "mess" being one of the reasons :D My mother luckily didn't blame teenage me for it, she just considered cooking fails a natural part of college life/early 20s, she'd joke about stuff like "don't worry, when I first invited your father for dinner, I made him spaghetti with ketchup and I thought that was so impressive"... My grandparents would ask if I went to the mensa regularly, so that "I'd have at least one hot meal a day", the idea of cooking as a student didn't exist to them I guess
I suspect it could have something to do with the older generations (and Czechs in general) relying so much on lunches in school and workplace cafeterias - you could basically go your whole life from preschool to retirement home eating in cafeterias, and for dinner, you could survive on some bread and butter every night until you got a wife to cook for you
I mean
we don't exactly have the healthiest eating habits compared to countries that love cooking like Italy or France
OMG, up until right now I thought my family was weird, that's exactly how I grew up down to the you'd-make-a-mess part
what weird aspect of our culture are we up to here
Right
I feel like I don't know almost anyone under 35 who irons
The only reason I own an iron is because my friend gave hers to me saying she was probably never gonna use it again
It's not that you can really "not know how to iron", but it's fucking pointless for most people
If something dries too wrinkly, I'll sooner chuck it into the washer again and try hanging it better the second time around, before I'm gonna iron anything
Hungary, maybe
It is the closest one
I guess Denmark, during summer they make up around 99 % of drunks on the streets of Prague, so they must be people of our culture
Honestly
None
Hungary would be the closest
Russia feels omni-present even though it’s quite far
I'd throw in Serbia, Croatia
Actually it was Yugoslav border right
All of the stans except Kazakhstan
Because we have a long-standing historical friendship as nations beginning with the alliance between interwar Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which was only tarnished when we buckled to political pressure and recognized kosovo
Czech republic considers diplomatic relations with Serbia as one of it's top priorities and is one of the few supporting and lobbying for Serbia's approval into EU
Here's a list of the big official meetings and co-ops between our two countries, politically and business-wise
[Bilateral relations]
I would rather forget
Politicians have no integrity and they deemed that recognizing kosovo would go a long way with EU and NATO
We also had euro qualifier against Kosovo last year and both away and at home we had regular people cheer that kosovo is serbia
People had serbian flags at the home game
We're still waiting for some kind of fat fine for that
We are unfortunately part of something which is called post-Soviet bloc (or post-communist country)
But Czechoslovakia was independent only formally (1968 invasion and 20 years of occupation)
I would not call it complex
It’s more like historical experience
I don’t mean it in bad way
Nothing against Russia
I just wanted to point out that Soviet Union did not bring our nations closer to each other, but exactly opposite
That’s it
Lmao I understand, already admitted my mistake and my apologies again
I misunderstood
Okay man
Sorry man I was reacting because I thought it has something to do with the Czech Republic
Chill out :)
It's different
Czech republic is quite Prague-centric and it shows
People in Prague earn more money and objectivelly have better quality of life
Most of the cultural shows happen there and it seems that anything interesting happens in Prague
Also, lot of people want to move there
Personally, as Czech from Moravia, i like my life here and I don't ever plan to move to capital
But it is everyones choice
I’ve been to both Rome and Paris and personally, I found to Rome to astronomically more dirty than Paris
Paris wasn’t even that bad compared to the piles of garbage on every street in Rome
Austria: Family gatherings in the outskirts of Vienna, pubs under trees and in vineyards
Belgium: Walking the streets of Bruxelles, exploring various ethnic cuisines
Bulgaria: Crossing Rila and Pirin with friends
Croatia: A week on a yacht with friends, streets of coastal towns
Czech republic: Living there, lots of memories
England: Evening on old hillforts near Scottish border
Estonia: Long summer evenings in the old Tallinn
France: A week long stay on a cottage of an old family friend in the Pyrenees, visiting local historic sites
Germany: Visiting Bautzen with a local Lausitzian guide
Greece: Renting a motorcycle with my dad, travelling the interior of the island of Crete
Hungary: Fading memories of camping near Balaton in the 1980s style
Ireland: Sleeping in a haunted hunting lodge
Also when fog rose near an ancient cairn and suddenly the mountains were visible
A sound of beating drum (actually a plastic canister being hit with water) in an abandoned adit
Italy: Sicily visit, staying there with relatives
Netherlands: A nice contemporary legends conference in Amsterdam
Poland: Exploration of underground corridors of the MRU
Romania: Mountain hike over Hargita and Caliman with friends, getting lost there in a funny way
Scotland: Skye, climbing alone on Sgurr nan Gillean while the rest of the tour stood somewhere seaside
Serbia: Just passed through Beograd when travelling from Bulgaria and woke up for a while
Looked quite ugly, sorry, there is definitely more to explore
Slovakia: Walking in old mines that looked almost like Moria
Slovenia: Repeated caving expeditions to the Karst, discovering local landscape and remains if the WW1
Spain: Two seaside double weekends by sea with a summer camp in the 1990s. Nothing that special, but I liked one of the girls
Silesia, no one would be able to stop them since no one knows what they are saying half the time also the dust and fumes from Ostrava would cover any tracks of an uprising rather quickly
Moravia, historical land/region of the eastern half of the country
But I don't think there are movements advocating for secession, if anything they are advocating for the return to pre-1948 state when the country was [administratively divided along the borders of our historical lands] (Bohemia-Moravia-Silesia until 1928 and then Bohemia-Moravia/Silesia until 1948)
These historical lands had some power of self-governance in certain areas
But even these current movements are fringe with no prospects of succeeding
On a more serious note, there are actually separatist movements in Moravia
Used to be quite strong in the 90s, now their position is much weaker and they are mostly calling for a federalization of the country
Frankly, they won't be missed too much either
Moravians made fun of people who wrote they are not Czech but Moravian in the lastest census so
So [something like this] is happening after all
There are tons of dogs, but not strays
I've only seen one dog roaming around without its owner and it was 13 years ago, but I'm not sure if it was stray or just got lost
I've seen foxes and deers sniffing in the trash on the edges of villages though
With cats it's more tricky
There are definitely loose cats in the countryside, but again, I'm not sure if they are strays, or have an owner and just roam around freely
Dogs and cats must be all chipped and registered here
When I lived in the Netherlands, the largest problem were stray rats
They were freaking everywhere
Rats and mice
Roam freely in towns
What
What if they ran under a car and caused an accident
Or ate a poison
Or bitten someone
Do people really not care about their pets
Not violet
It probably depends on the age of the kids and the social group in question
At our 2 year olds birthday party it was both kids and parents since all of the parents know each other and we've been friends before we had kids
If she invites someone when she's older idk
Probably just the kids
There is no attention given to teaching about dialectal variation
Usually, any dialectal feature is frowned upon, and getting corrected by some  pedantic teachers is common
I remember learning briefly about different registers of Czech (standard, spoken, etc
We were taught about something called "obecná čeština" which is in English misleadingly translated as "common Czech" (it's an interdialect spoken in Bohemia)
And that's basically it
Sometimes, there would be more focus on local literary authors, but otherwise not much attention
The school curriculum is to my best knowledge everywhere the same
So, no matter which dialectal region you're from standard Czech is taught everywhere the same, from the same aspect, same preposition, absolutely no localisation whatsoever
So, for example, if you're a kid from Ostrava (no i-y merger, long vowels merge with short vowels) Czech is taught to you the same way as to a kid from Prague (i-y merger, no long vowels merger): you spend countless hours on learning where to write "i" and where "y", and no hours on where to write long vowels and where short vowels
I didn't know there are so many differences between Czech and Slovak regarding usage of the colloquial language
Here (Prague) it's completely normal to speak in colloquial Czech while in public, even our teachers often use obecná čeština while teaching (except Czech teachers in primary/middle schools who are "trying" to use the Standard language while teaching but stop the moment the class ends)
EDIT: I'm talking about speaking, when writing you basically have to use the standard language
period
We were taught about Czech dialects at my school and how they differ
Not very in depth, but we have had several lessons about that
But yes, everyone was expected to use standard Czech, not common Czech or any other dialect
Especially our Czech teacher required that even in oral exams (like you actually got a mark depending on not just what you knew but also whether you used proper language)
This was a high school in Brno, btw
Cool
>But yes, everyone was expected to use standard Czech, …
My Czech teacher at elementary school went as far as not allowing us to refer to "y" and "i" as how they are pronounced, instead we had to use "tvrdé y" and "měkké i", lol
Either regular cheese and ham sanwich or bacon, fried egg and mayo
Traditional Czech [*chlebíček*] (open sandwich):
Butter, Italian ("vlašský") salad, ham, cheese, pickled cucumber, boiled egg
Sandwiches aren't big thing here in Czechia
For me it is tuna sandwich from gas station
Do I see padrones
Because I'm pretty sure I see padrones
Leber = Liver
Käse = Cheese
Leberkäse tho is not "liver cheese", but a [meatloaf] If you want a meatloaf with cheese, it's Käseleberkäse, i.e. cheese-livercheese
Semmel is a small round bread
Usually [this]
Probably ODS/KDU-ČSL/TOP 09/STAN coalition for the next Parliamentary election
I hope they will make it
* The Senate has passed constitutional action against the president
Unfortunately it will probably get rejected in the other chamber of our Parliament
* Right-wing opposition (4 parties) is talking about forming a coallition for the next parlamentary elections (our D'Hondt coefficient is really harsh and puts small parties in a great disadvantage)
Our president who is disrespecting the constitution is finally getting sued
Let's hope they'll be able to put their ego aside as well as old grudges between KDU and Kalousek
Even though I am not a fan of KDU, I think it is important for centre-right parties to unite and do something about this joke of a government
Goodbye corruption
Hello even more corruption
I'd rather have another term of Donut Emperor than let ODS take the wheel
Hell I'd make myself vote for ANO if that would prevent it
At least Andrej pretends to give a shit about people that are worse off
ODS actively despises anyone who need to make use of our social security system
The only thing they're interested in doing is making sure the haves get more and the have-nots get kicked to the curb
Expansion of mortgage interest deduction system
WHAT THE FUCK
Pretty much every economist on the planet agrees that this is some of the worst economic policy-making you can have
ODS is keen on imposing massive government austerity that will shit on those who need it most
Almost a quarter of people who work in CZ are low-wage earners, and any cuts in social security will turn their lives into living hell at a point where this really ISN'T THE FUCKING PROBLEM
Don't even get me started on their disaster of a environmental "priorities
" How can a party show [THIS MOTHERFUCKING PIECE OF SHIT GARBAGE] AND CALL ITSELF A SERIOUS POLITICAL PARTY WTF
ODS and its inbred corruption has fucked us over before
Most of the people who were in the party 10 years ago are still there, and they're greedy fucks that don't give a crap about social mobility or the environment
ODS can go choke on a big fat meaty cock for all I care
Such a diverse coalition won't have common vector
It is going to be a mess from day 0
Looks like you need some freedom
why do you dislike them more than far right
A high chance of Babiš not being a prime minister/in the government
Imagine if the CDU, FDP, and the British Tories had a baby that was twice as stupid and ten times as corrupt as any of those parties
That is ODS
Also because there is a chance of KDU, TOP or STAN not being able to get into the next Parliament since they might not pass the 5% threshold
One would think that "I'd rather vote ANO over <literally anything that isn't commies or fascists>" wouldn't be an idea people would hold in 2019
Guess Babiš will literally have to come to people's homes and steal money directly from their wallets to make people wake up
Bernie is a leftie even by Europe’s standards
Nowhere in Europe would you find socialism in the political mainstream
Lmao they are not socialist in the slightest
Nordic countries frequently top the rankings in ease of doing business, they are very capitalist albeit with high levels of redistribution and strong welfare state
That does not make them socialist by any stretch of the imagination
Austria, it's like us but better
Austria as it seems to be the closest to us
Austria
Culturally I would feel at home
Austria
Their German is the most understandable
Switzerland
I've been there as a teenager and I loved it
The people, the nature, everything
If Switzerland was "full", then Germany
Probably Switzerland
The second choice would be Germany
"Czechia, it's like Austria but worse"
Yeah, but to Czech, Austrian German is somehow closer
And those accents they have across Deutschland
For example, have you ever been to Hessen
Well I have been only to Salzburg and Wien, so you are propably right
When I was at the university and travelled home to weekends, I almost always took the train, because it's the best option considering the price, comfort, and speed of travel
Recently, the tickets for that journey (\~150 km, 2h 20min) are about 6-8 eur without any discount (there was 45% discount for university students back then)
There's a complicated system of discounts, but for the normal price you can ride 15 to 25 km for one euro
For me it's the most common mean of transport after walking
And since September 2018, students pay 25% of the full price
Back in 2017, I went from the Czech Republic to Edinburgh
Since I never travelled by plane at that time, I decided to take a bus from Prague to London and a train from London to Edinburgh
Unfortunately, I didn't make it from Victoria to King's Cross in time and my booked train left without me
I didn't want to think about any other way to get to Edinburgh so I went to buy a new ticket
It cost £137
I begged my brain not to convert it to CZK
Unfortunately, it did it and I wanted to cry
And then again when I saw it on my bank account
Yeah, it's kinda funny how cheap travelling by public transportation can get
I paid about 20 Kč (that would be about 70 cents) for about 80 km of travel distance by train
Yup, I travel around 360 km as student and usually pay between 2-4€
Yeah I as a student can go from Brno to Prague which is approximately 200km for 50 kč/2 €
Fun fact: a full day ticket for ČD trains costs 599 Kč (22,88€)
I find especially funny that it's cheaper for me to visit my sister who lives 20km from me than to visit my grandparents (by city transport) who live on the other side of my hometown
Supreme Court is in Brno, but it seems weird to me
Constitutional court is in Brno, everything else is in Prague
As well as Constitutional Court and Supreme Administrative Court
And Ombudsman
However otherwise it is unusual to have HQs of state institutions outside of Prague
Brno just doesn't have a good location - from my home town, it is like 5
5 hours to get there with public transport and it has quite good train and bus connections and it is still quite far from the borders
There are simply not any similar towns even in Moravia/Silesia with that long travel time to Prague
>It takes 2 hours to get from Prague to Brno
Well, the quickest train I found is 2h 26 min
I can get to Prague train station at similar time (2
5 hours), but there is another \~30 minutes waiting time which is in total 5
5 hours
And there are actually many places in Bohemia with much worse travel times
Prague is just better located and it is like 5 times bigger, so it wouldn't make much sense to put more offices in Brno
We had a list of about a 100 books from which we had to read 20, so I avoided the ones I knew I'd hate
And usually reading a summary was enough anyway
Even as someone who enjoyed literature, this was
screw you, Mácha
Máj is something I can appreciate now  for the language, but having this as a study material
and that's highschool, you have this also during elementary school
We read Máj. My brother read Máj in the class and was required to make Máj analysis in 6th grade
How TF was he supposed to do that
With Máj?? So I wrote it for him in the most simple way I could but still with the basics of analysis from our highschool teacher and he still got 5 because it was not enough and wrong
"gospodin"? We called "Hospodin" the God
coincidence
I don't think so
[Superawesome]
Related languages have cognates
I'm shocked
> Is tovarish a lost word or do you have other uses for it
I believe that in Russian this word used to mean "deputy" as in "deputy minister": tovarysh ministra
Not sure this meaning survived communism
Sounds like "hospodář" which means householder or someone who takes care of property
"Host" in czech also means Guesst :D
For Spain: "public transportation is always late", actually I don't remember any significant delays and I have travelled through Spain a lot
Also, I have heard how Spanish people start working late, but it is similar like here
It is true that dinner time is super late in the evening (well, at night for me), but people wake up the next day quite early anyway
So I don't quite understand when they get enough sleep
The traffic in Italy is a little chaotic, but it's really easy to adjust to
Adjusting to home traffic after returning was worse
I received many honks during that time
Where I was, life didn't start until 9 AM
But you gotta realize that Spain should be in GMT+0 timezone, but they decided to be +1 with majority of Europe
That's nothing
Spanish bikers are the true hell
Is it
Wasn't it Breivik who travaled to Prague in order to get illegal firearms and failed
And ended up just getting his license and guns legally in Norway
Well, after what happened with the Gamestop stocks I definitely have more than enough lol
This has been the case in my country as well, but I am coming to terms with the fact that the pension system I am currently paying for through my taxes likely won't bring me that much benefit
It's simply unsustainable with the current birth rates and aging population
And it's not something any government so far wanted to get dirty with because it will be painful and the benefits will come decades later, which is way past the horizon the 4-year-electorate cares about
So it's more and more common for people of my generation to do some investing for when they are older just in case the pension system really does go to shit
Well, if one can afford a decent life with a low salary, then it's just the country getting poorer, rather than the middle class disappearing, no
I see
In my head I interpreted "pension" to mean the public one
Putting money into a private pension product already sounds like investing to my ears, just through a (hopefully) less risky product
Thanks for clearing that up
Yeah the state pension is similar to what we got here I think
There's basically an extra mandatory income tax which goes towards paying for the (current) pensions
That's the type I was saying I'm not certain will bring me any real pension as there won't be as many people when I'm old to pay for me
Private pension, on the other hand, is more about investing your own money (and potentially getting some extra from the employer/govt) and then cashing in on the result of that investment - not relying on others to pay you when your time comes
Yes, for same reason
Yep, all the time
It is rather embarassing
There are also the situations where someone asks me to translate an English text and I can 100% understand what the text means but I just can't think of the words in Czech
I bet it happens because at this point I probably read far more in English than in Czech
Yes, I did
It can happen to everyone
All the time
Even after being back in the country for year and a half
Yes, I don't really mind it with friends who often suffer from the same phenomenon, but it's kind of annoying and even embarrassing in public
I image it's simply down to exposure
While I'm exposed to Czech by talking with other Czechs, I literally don't really consume any media in Czech
Fuck, I read some of the books for our the Czech language Maturita exam in English
Yes
In my defense, I have to say that I speak Russian with my wife and mostly English at work
Add Spanish after work as I learn it, and you will understand why I often sound weird speaking Czech
Or any other language, frankly
Yes, same reason too
[Icelandic]
I like Swedish
Swedish (I prefer the more southern dialects
though)
Oh I'm not Swedish
One commercial tv channel called Nova
It is, I would say, the most popular TV channel here
There is also ČT, which is a national TV station, and it is popular, too
ČT 1 (jedna) one of the four publicly owned tv channels here, the others being ČT 2 (dva) ČT 24 (dvacet čtyři) and the most recent ČT 3 (tři) they also have a kids channel which is an art channel after eight in the evening ČT D/art
ČT 3 is called Kmetflix as Kmet is elderly person who is the target audience
You forgot ČT Sport, formerly ČT 4
The i/y and í/ý dichotomy
Both i and y are nowadays pronounced the same in Standard Czech: i/y - /ɪ/, í/ý -
/iː/. There was a difference few centuries ago
They could be merged into a single grapheme however we have a lot of words that are pronounced the same and although you cannot hear the difference you can see it when you write the words down: e.g. *bít* (to beat) vs *být* (to be)
Also some consonants are palatalized before i    but that could be solved making palatalization explicit - e.g. writing *ťi* instead of *ti*.
Czech is so hard
Don’t know if it is true, but it was told that it is the hardest slovan language and in top 10 hardest languages in the world
Adding to that, there is no real grammatical rule for when either of "y" or "i" is written beside of "well, that's just how it is". So you essentially have to just memorize a long list of words when the "y" is written
Because that's just how it is
We can use both ways in Czech
Padesáttři or třiapadesát.
It really depends on your first language
If you are a native Slavic language speaker, it's easy
If you are a speaker of an Indo-European language that still has cases etc
it isn't that hard although not easy
That said, Czech is full of irregularities, has many declension and conjugation patterns and also the free word order changing the meaning of a sentence doesn't help
Orthography is pretty simple though
Then there is the thing with Common Czech: you learn the language (Standard Czech) and then you realize people around you speak what sounds like a different language
There's a huge gap between Standard Czech (with its archaic roots) and a Common Czech
That's true, I just assumed that u/dsmid was specifically talking about "vyjmenovaná slova" - which is a list of words in the root of which the "y" is written
just because
As was previously mentioned, there used to be a difference in how you pronounce those words but not anymore
Hence, all grade schoolers now have to at some point memorize the list of words perfectly and it's a big part of their evaluation
Making a mistake in relation to "vyjmenovaná slova" is considered to be severe and you can lose a lot of points for that
Yes, i/y has a different function but only in the orthography
The softening can be solved by making it explicit - e.g. writing *-ňí* instead of *-ní*.
OTOH i/y distinction is a nice relict and it illustrates how Czech has evolved (writing i/y is not "random", it has deep etymological roots)
Removing it would make Czech simpler but some information would be lost from the language
"No man ever steps in the same river twice"
let's do the same shit for 3rd time :)
Equivalent of re-marrying amicable ex
Slovakia: Eh, sure
Maybe we could work again
Poland: they dont like us much, but it could work, overtime the languages would get simmilar
Austria: yes please do it
Germany: not again ... (But sure)
Germany- oh fuck
Austria- well this is wierd
Poland- oh fuck but smaller
Slovakia- might be sustainable

We get along reasonably well with all our neighbours and aren't so culturally different
Also, sweet subsidies from Austria and Germany
yes please
They own half our companies anyway

> Czech Republic: remove your fucking atmonic litter from our border
Why
It's safe
I don't care
Glad to hear that
Don't think we do, but we consider Zalozie rightfully ours
Like hey, we might start to value our history and culture when we lose our country
It worked during the National Revival

Why do you even comment on this thread
That's actually quite surprising to me that you first realized that there are other currencies here in Czechia and not in your neighbouring country Sweden
Oooh that reminds me of when I was a little kid
I knew people here learn English, so I thought people in England must learn Czech
It was pretty disappointing to realize pretty much nobody learns Czech :/
In 2018 we had a geography textboox in which Slovakia literally borders the Soviet Union
The map was labeled "The world after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia" (Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Czechoslovakia in 1993)
Blame whoever came up with Benelux
And some of them still are
Dobře ty
Lol
That really is kinda freaky
Where did you learn it
Well, I am a Sudeten German and I still live here
It’s true that we were expelled from Czechoslovakia, but some of us returned, even though in much smaller numbers
This is our home after all
Even after Communism made the country twice poorer than Germany
That sure is some dedication to tradition
But yeah, Sudetengermans aren't unheard of in my hometown
Both of my friend's grandmas are Germans who never had to leave because they were either married to Czechs or considered essential employees
Returning is fine too, as long as you don't come for my family's house
I’ve been to Germany many times and I can tell you, the Czech Republic made a huge progress in the last 20 years
Now if you go to Germany you don’t see practically any difference to the life in the Czech Republic
I mean sure, paperwise the salaries are lower here, but so are the prices
OK, I suppose it's a matter of opinion
I've lived in Germany too, and I feel like the quality of life is still a good bit higher there, not only in terms of purchasing power, but also the way stuff works (administration, customer services, etc
Sure most of our streets don't look totally derelict anymore, but the post-Communist mentality is ingrained much deeper
Until about a year ago, I did not even know "kid's table" was a thing that existed anywhere
We had it for big birthday celebrations usually for kids under 6 or 5 (or whoever wanted to join them, usually we all until puberty preferred playing with "fellow kids" instead of sitting and listening to adults)
Small, shorter table without the tablecloth, easy to clean, where they can make mess freely and have fun together
Of course not in the case there were just one or two of them
We used to, but now, sice "kids" are 20-30 yo, it's Young  table
I didn’t know until now
Being a fan of Florence and the Machine, I actually first heard the term "adult table" in [this video] and I thought it was a joke
Because while we learned about American Thanksgiving traditions at school, it never involved an information about children sitting separately
A few years later someone mentioned "kids table" when talking about their Thanksgiving family gathering, so I remembered Florence's song, googled "kids and adults tables" and found out that families actually do have kids dining at a different table or even in a different room
It was quite shocking
A nordic guy looking for AC when its 20+C is the most danish (nordic) thing ever lol, its really not that hot here right now, especially if you live by the sea where its windy
No, I don’t think so
not at all, why would you stay next hotdog stand when that thing is designed to be eaten during walking without problems
Right now
" To be, or not to be, that is the question "
I think it is self-explanatory in this current pickle we are in
"Czechs are laughing beasts
- Reinhard Heydrich the "Butcher of Prague"
The "laughing" part is because we have an undying sence of humor which knows no boundaries including self-mockery
And humor was probably the only way to survive the betrayal by the Allies in the Munich Agreement, nazism, communism etc
And the "beasts"? Well Heydrich was killed by the Anthropoid group and was the highest ranking Nazi assasinated during WW2
It's complicated
Above the normal courts we have 2 high courts, Bohemian and Moravian ones
Above them there are 2 highest courts: Highest (or Supreme) Court of Republic and Highest/Supreme administrative Court of the Republic
Both have close to 100 judges
Supreme Court (the first one of the two mentioned) consists of two *collegia*: Criminal *collegium* and Civil *collegium*. Normal cases only being heard in a *senate* of three
In special cases, a *plenum* with more judges being called
Also there's a Constitutional Court of 15 judges, but it only concerned about the constitutional matters, i.e. whether a law is in accordance to the constitution
EDIT: as this question arose in comments to other countries' courts: all judges retire at the age of 70
We have that option too
6 - šest
20 - dvacet
26 can be "dvacet šest' or "šestadvacet" (a means and in czech, notice that the second form has no space in it) i'd say the first one Is more common
But we go further
1326 can be said as "tisíc tři sta dvacet šest" or "třináct set dvacet šest"
The first means thousand three hundred twenty six
The would be translated as thirteen hundred twenty six
The second form is far more common, but doesn't work with numbers greater than 1999
The first is rather formal
Conveniently omitting numbers 14, 15, 500 and all ordinals
Also instead of devadesát, Russian has devanosto
Hey guys, it's like sedmdesát and osmdesát, don't overcomplicate
I saw it
They are not complicated, but they are not directly connected to the spanish cardinal numbers, but to the latin ones
Former Soviet bases either fell to disrepair or were repaired and used as housing or storage spaces
There were two large military zones used by Soviets and lots of small facilities they used and their final destiny depended on many factors like distance from nearest town or means of privatisation
For example large areas were managed by the state, not the municipalities, and the government preferred to try to sell them whole for large-scale projects like a planned cargo airport in Milovice - but most of the buidings were vandalized and damaged by theft meanwhile
Nowadays, there are many different uses for these parts of landscape including nature preserves amd game enclosures, solar power plants, housing, light industry zones or sporting (e.g. ultralights and similar) airports
Unused objects are slowly falling to disrepair or are demolished, but remain popular among urbexers, larpers, airsoft and paintball players and similar groups
There is also one former rocket base at Křivoklátsko that was transformed into post-apocalyptic town for larps and festivals
There's underground bunkers and many tunnels
It's always a blast going there
As the sub is young, many might still be exploring their ways in the sea of sex

Let's refrain from using good or bad
We can still analyze music consumption a bit further though
You can imagine two pathways in getting to like a particular song/album/artist/band:
passive listening
* active listening
For both cases, you can like a song straight away or it can grow on you (or, for completeness, you aren't gonna like it)
Now you can either distinguish between these two pathways or consider them equal
Let's skip that
You can make a metric, a ratio of active to passive listenings which led to liking a particular song/whatever
You could probably cluster the songs by this metric, each cluster would have popular songs and less popular songs
The songs heard mostly passively are heard through specific media which impose certain conditions
One can optimize the songs with these conditions in mind
And the point is, while it's a great feat being/becoming the embodiment of the contemporary taste/fad, it's only that
Note, that I'm not talking about quality whatsoever
I'm also not saying that the songs are listened passively over their lifetime (I was talking about the phase when someone is introduced/introduces themself to songs)
> > while it's a great feat being/becoming the embodiment of the contemporary taste/fad, it's only that
> You're using a lot of words to say that they're bad
No, I'm not saying that, I'm basically saying that Max Martin achieved a great feat, but it's short of godlike
Most used bus in Prague has capacity of 160 people and rush hours on busy lines will explain you this number is just theoretical number from designers office without actually trying how many people can fit in
It also stops every minute or two, in rare cases in three
There simple isn't space to discuss anything with driver in this traffic
Also that thing is 19 meters long so unless you are near to him, he is not going to hear you at all, he is locked in his driver booth and there used to be a pictogram sticker saying "do not talk to driver" It is probably still there
so yes, it is complete different here
It usually depends on the number of people involved
You say hello and good bye in an elevator, small waiting room or a train compartment
Definitely not in a full urban bus or similar
But it always ends with greeting, any small talk is very uncommon
It's more about big city/countryside difference
If you travel to a small village with like 5 other people in the whole bus, you usually say thank you and bye
Pat a Mat (A je to)
Stories about two neighbors/friends, who always try to solve some easy task with tinkering
They are really clumsy, they usually fail at first, so they try more and more bizarre approaches
In the end, they succeed, is some ridiculous and stupid way
I didn't know that
I loved that because I was introduced to it during vacation in Itally when I was stuck the whole day indoors one day and this was the only thing I could watch
So I, Czech, watched french TV series in German language in Italy
At least there's not much talking
Spongebob was the same, in German first, but since I understand only little German, it wasn't easy to watch it
Not entirely the same language but we've got a few with Slovaks
When we talk with each other, we each usually use our respective mother tongues because they are mutually intelligible
For example, in Czech, *sprostý* means "vulgar" while in Slovak, it means "stupid". A friend of mine once almost got into a trouble when he with his other friends met a group of Slovaks somewhere and they talked and the Slovaks spoke in a very vulgar manner, cursed all the time etc
so the Czechs said by the way something like: "You're cool guys, only that you're a bit too vulgar," which the Slovaks understood as "you're a bit too stupid" and almost got into a fight before the misunderstanding was clarified
Some other possible misunderstandings that came to my mind are *chudý* which means "slim" in Slovak but "poor" in Czech so when a Slovak wants to compliment a Czech that they look "slim", they might accidentally call them "poor". Or Czechs may get excited when a Slovak casually mentions they've got *pivnica* ("cellar") at their home because *pivnice* means "pub" in Czech
Or when a Slovak asks a Czech for *"horká čokoláda"* ("dark chocolate", literally "bitter chocolate"), they get "hot chocolate" instead
Its archaic meaning (in Czech) is also tidying or going around the house
It's famous here thanks to Němcová's novel Babička
TIL Greeks are dwarves
I was the same
I had a weak moustache, chin and sides
I thought I'm lost forever and then I stopped shaving due to the pandemic for 3 months
And dude now I have a good beard that filled up everything and can be shaped
Honestly all follicles grow at a different pace
My cheeks looked empty until like the third month
Moustache only got better after like 2 and a half
So if you have time where you can look funny for a couple weeks, Def give it 2-3 months of growth
If even then you don't see a chance, I say go clean shaven
But you can never tell after like 2 or 3 weeks
You're a deregulated heaven compared to Belgium and Netherlands
Belgium especially
I see what you mean
Well in that case, probably better to go clean shaven for now and come back in a couple years
It does get better with age I found
And even if it doesn't, it's not really a big deal
I don't expect anything, that way, I can be only pleasantly suprised
>Is the football one really not the one that comes to mind first tho seriously
no, because football not the sport number one by the audience, not even second
Pretty sure audience in countries you don't live in doesn't really affect your perception of what comes to mind first

I don't have Austrian flag next to my ID so I had no need to talk about Austria at all

sorry I missed that completely, not being native english speaker I can't read "between the lines" all the time
From my perspective you was "genuinely" surprised that there can be a championships in other sports than footbal
Actually so many languages, but Polish is my favourite right now, kind of because i can understand it a bit, plus it sounds so soft, almost artistic
It makes me go: You should learn it, so you can understand it fully
I really like how arabic sounds
Also Irish just because I love a certain irish song
Well english is my favorite, but I love to hear german and slovak (sup brothers)
But my german is very bad *shrugs*
Swedish man: *erection*
The kaiser Sigismund of Luxembourg is considered a huge villain in Czech republic
He guaranteed safety to Jan Hus, who was among the first to speak against the catholic church only for him to be later burned alive for his beliefs
He is considered a great emperor of the HRE by Germans though
Teddy Roosevelt
Yeah, both Metternich and Bach (Alexander, not Johan Sebastian) are big bad guys of our history
I blame Alan Moore for this
I remember a post at /r/ShitAmericansSay where an American guy explained to a Brit how the 5th of November is an awesome holiday because its point is to remind the government that if they will attack citizens' liberties, the citizens will revolt and blow up the parliament like the brave Fawkes guy tried
Yeah, the whole hussite movement was just a bunch of raiding religious fanatics who tore down most of monasteries in Bohemia, such a shame
In our history classes we are taught about them in a neutral way - they're not pictured as heroes of the nation
I think English just changes the languages which adapt words from it but they won’t perish
Czech, for example, is extremely efficient in taking the words and changing them to fit
It can be easily seen in the case of verbs which we conjugate as if they actually were Czech
With Czech being an official language of a 10 million country, there's not a big reason to be concerned so far
Our language survived germanisation under Austria-Hungary, I am not concerned that it will disappear anytime soon
What would be needed to happen is National Revival
We had this, when most of the population were speaking German
And Czech language did comeback
A lot of famous Czech writers are from that timeline and its basically very important path of our history
On the other way, we lost easy connection with our neighbours
And a lot of useless words were invented
Like sorry, but I dont see any good reason to have months named differently then rest of the world
It is better to look for things that unite rather than things which divide  IMHO
The revival is somewhat a double-edged sword as it saved the language but it also efficiently kills anyone’s will to learn when taught in a school
I think it’s basically just you, us, Finns, Croats, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Lithuanians of the big nations in Europe
Slovaks for example have months named normally
I envy them a lot for that :D
That’s not really correct though
I don’t want to play that game of who was in worse situation but to make it clear Czech was supposed to be suppressed be German when we were a part of Austrian empire
I understand the uneasy situation of Irish nonetheless, hopefully it will get better
Ah, I’m sorry to hear that but I do believe Czech can be pretty hard to learn
Slavic languages are all like this
Good luck with learning though
I’d like to give you a piece of advice but I never learnt Czech as a foreigner ofc
I’d go for a language course at least for the beginning to get  the grasp of the basics
The badassest job group in the history apart from mercenaries would be voraři - timber rafters, who would steer huge rafts made of tree trunks from lumber camps down the rivers to port cities to further process
It is said that it was especially hard and taxing job that was strictly regulated and I just can’t imagine driving a 100 tonnes worth of loosely tied tree trunks through whitewater, selling it after a week or two of floating and then walking back to the mountains to make a new raft
We had those too, although probably just in the part where I live (Wallachia)
I'm not sure as I don't know exactly how the Slovaks feel about them but generally, I'd say they're less glorified here than in Slovakia
There were also portáši - the ones who fought them on the side of the law
Definitely 90s or early 2000s. Would be very interesting to see time I spent my childhood in with eyes  of (almost) adult
1920s during the First Republic or around 1870 in A-H.
>To live in New York full of mafia families
You might want to visit Italy
They still live like this
Or, you'll end up in Dark Age
They can also take it throught Norway Oblast
From the comments here one would think that Poland is gonna be a new North Korea
I hope PiS does well
Brave and stunning
In Czech we have this awesome translation od Simpsons joke, where Homer sees a sign 'Die' and freaks out and than a tree bends and shows the whole sign 'Diet' and he freaks out even more
In Czech it's 'zhebni' and 'zhubni'
The Czech dubbing of the Simpsons, especially the early seasons, was amazing overall
Zhebni = die
Zhubni = lose some weight

Let me know which one are correct
2 of them are on opposite sides of Prague, 1 in Brno and 1 in Ostrava
Maybe there's another one being built somewhere, I'm not sure
Ikea is love, Ikea is life
All 4 stores, with 3 more on their way, will give us meatballs and hours of pain
When we try to build our furniture, some would say, that this is torture
But it Doesn't matter, why should it
Because their design is fucking lit
Really
That's pretty strange, unless your IKEA is cheaper
Interesting, "černoch" is OK here
"Negr" is the slur
Pretty much everyone agrees that we are in Central Europe
We like to correct people who says otherwise
Definitely central, I'm sure most people here noticed Czechs can get upset if someone calls us eastern europeans (not me though)
It does make sense though to be called central, both in geographical and cultural sense
Culturally I feel we are very close to all the nations of former Austria-Hungary + Bavaria and Saxony
Visiting any of these places doesn't really feel any different to what it's like here, while I can definitely start feeling the difference when going further west/east/south/north
Well, I think I can say, that almost everyone in my country consider Central Europe as our region
Central, but a lot of people, mostly from over the pond, are saying Eastern, which is wrong
Exactly
This is why you need a defined region of central Europe
Basically along the lines of historical Austria Hungary + parts of eastern Germany
Anyone who claims that Slovenia and CZ are more similar to Russia and Ukraine rather than they are to Austria and Eastern Germany they are our of their mind
>Cz
Not only Eastern Germany - Czechs have also many things in common with Bavaria - for example they have Baby Jesus (Christkind) as a Christmas person same as us and Austrians
It does for any west Slavic country
Yea Bavaria as well
I kind of took it for eastern Germany cause it borders us (mostly to differentiate it from like Nordrhein-Westfalia
From what I've heard, Bavaria is closer to Austria than Prussia, so it makes sence
Sure, I understand that
I am currently living in Munich, so I had to point it out
:-) It is quite interesting to see that we have pretty much the same culture - they are also celebrating "Maibaum" (májka), "Hexennacht" (čarodějnice), St
Nicholas also on the 5th and so on
Well, isn't in other parts of Germany more common Weihnachtsmann
Sure and then 400 years of Austria (Austria-Hungary) :-)
Well I think that it's best to do a geographical division as the following one to be at least moderately accurate
Western Europe (France, Benelux, west Germany, possibly Denmark if it's not North, British isles and Switzerland)
Central Europe (Austria, Eastern Germany + maybe Bavaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland)
Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece) and you could do a Balkan subdivision or include them in this
Northern Europe (Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden Estonia and maybe Denmark)
And then Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, maybe Bulgaria
As per your point, making it a Slavic Vs Germanic thing is more of a cultural split than a geographical one
There it would be a slightly different map based on language groups and such
Although for instance CZ is much more closer to Germany and Austria than it is to Russia and Ukraine culture wise
The thing is you could eternally argue subdivisions until you'd end with one that has Limburg being a different part of the planet than Brabant
You have to make some rough rounding up eventually
But some round up strategies are just plainly stupid
For instance completely leaving out the idea of central Europe is way too broad and in the end it's basically the equivalent of saying someone from a Swiss village is the same as person from Arctic Norway
Hh, I am glad you have nice memories from Czechia
The beer is cheaper is than water is also an argument which an Austrian living in Prague mentioned in my podcast interview about expat life in Czechia :-D
Same here
I remember when I was a kid and no one could explain to me why they're coming on 5th when St
Nicholas day is on 6th
Well I guess that you are probably talking about the infamous Vietnamese markets which are selling fake brands, cigarettes without the stamp (Gebührenmarke),... which are also illegal in Czechia and you can hear about police searches at those places periodically in the media
I've only heard about those places as it seems that they are somehow focused on Germans who cross the borders for cheap shopping
Personally I wouldn't go there
I see, thanks for the explanation
We have just the Christkind (Ježíšek), no Weihnachtsmann
Of course there is also visible in past years Santa but that's probably the same all around EU
Yea, I know that someone will always disagree
That's why I tried to put Denmark in both west and north and was really struggling with Latvia and Lithuania since they could also pass as more options
But I was simply trying to pick a slightly better geographical model (albeit imperfect) than East X West which is super useless
Yes, that's what I thought with the same on the 5th - even-though the Nicholas day is on the 6th he comes on the evening of 5th :-)
That's the Bohemian lifestyle I guess, hh
Those must have been really interesting times
How difficult was it in the 90s to speak with locals in German/English
Yes
Even at school, we had to take off shoes and wear slippers
Hygiene, people, hygiene
Sometimes guests are allowed to keep their shoes on - a big party, wedding etc
When I imagine dog shit smeared where little children play
Well of course
They are very comfortable
We didn't have crocks when I was at school, so I wore foam sliders
Hey, just because your Trump's wife is younger than our Trump's wife doesn't mean you are any better
I know, white socks in brown sandals, that's a big controversy here
I don't care about fashion anyway (at our school, nobody did, we were mathematicians) and Czechs you meet are mostly on vacations, thus in "beach boy" style
You think I wear my hawaiian shirt, tesco sandals and cargo shorts in our streets
Nope
I dress accordingly in army surplus clothes
Not exactly poor's people, but Smažák.
Oh those are great

I haven't seen this dish offered to tourists though
Yeah too simple probably
Vltava by Bedřich Smetana
Everyone knows it and it is very symbolic of our nation
I'd say [Ktož sú boží bojovníci ] is the most patriotic song I can think of
It used to be unofficial hussite "anthem".
Most of songs sang by Karel Gott
[My colour - red and white]
I'm certain we would like it
We're generally proud of something with a Czech background made by other nationalities, so at least that'd be in your favor
Is it normal to eat rabits in your country ?
Thsi might be a weird question, but I heard few people say how they don't understand that some people eat rabits, deers, ducks And stuff which was a little bit weird for me because in Czechia we eat those normally
Is it actually weird for some countries ?
Ani Pinďa to už nežere
OP is reffering to the domesticated rabbit, not wild rabbit
Haha thanks :) that song was pretty funny, but really sad at the Same time .
Same :)
Some people here actually still keep their own .
In Czechia eating horses would be probay the same as od someone ate a dog here
Are there some parts of Poland where it Is normal to eat horse meat ?
We use duck fat too, just not for vegetable, but usually for cooking some soop And using it instead of water, beacuse it tastes better
Do you really ? I never heard of that
That looks really good :D
That's really sad :(, but thanks for answering :)
Horse salami is normal in Czechia
Just google "koňsky salám"
Uhm, I believe some 10 years ago I used to buy horse meat
Haven't seen it for ages tho
Actually yes :D
That's pretty interesting
I Will for sure :D thanks :)
Czech Republic and Slovakia, at least our languages
Czech republic - Slovakia
Yeah, old times of Great Moravia
If that were the case, the country never would've split up
The only thing that is truly similar is our languages, other than that, basically everything is different or at the very least on a same level of similarity as our other neighbours
I will preface this with the fact that I hate creating multiple-tiered reply-arguments, but you set me up for this one and I feel like I should respond
>We share a common history (of over 70 years)
68 years, to be exact, when I subtract the war years
Before that Slovakia and Bohemian Crown Lands were largely foreign from one another and there was little to no communication between the two nations
Czechia also has 392 years of common history with Austria, for example; if my memory is correct then modern-day Slovakia also has 700-900 common years with Hungary
>traditions, culture, food
Only partially
On in a wider picture, when really considering "traditions" and folklore, the Czech ones are largely different from Slovakia's, save for Eastern Moravia
Not to mentions that the Czech ones are way more extinct than the Slovak ones
Slovaks are also on average pretty devout christians, something that Czechs absolutely aren't.
> My dad is Czech, my mom is Slovak, I have both citizenships and to say that we have no similarity is so very nuts
I think it is obvious why you think what you think since you live in a very specific type of a family
Of course you're going to be exposed to both cultures and preceive them as one when one of your parents is a Slovak
This is also very individual, my grandmother is Slovak and she's dropped basically everything Slovak about her and is a naturalized Czech at this point, and so is everyone from her family who moved here
>Seriously, we watch the same movie during Christmas,[...] understand each other, listen to similar music
This is something that stems from having mutually inteligible languages and Slovakia historically having a smaller creative base
Of course your media is going to be dominated by another country's media if the domestic market cannot satisfy the demand
I also do believe that this phenomenon only works one way - there are very, very few Slovak songs and movies that I've ever watched
>like the same sports
On any larger level of similarity than any other country in the region
I don't think so
>eat the same food
Only in a limited fashion
There's a single Slovak meal that I've eaten in my whole life and that's halušky
>drink the same alcohol
For lack of domestic suppliers, perhaps
Also Czechs on average favour beer over spirits
>You’re telling me a German will have svíčková for Sunday lunch
No, but I doubt an average person from around here has svíčková for lunch as well, or at least not any more commonly than any other meal
>bake some koláče
The only person who I've ever met that does that would be my Czech grandmother, maybe twice a year
>afternoon visit which they will drink slivovica during
They'd probably drink beer
So would the Germans, funnily enough
>while watching some Hrebejk movie
People watch Pelíšky literally once a year, my guy
I hate myself for taking my time to dissect your comment like this, and I feel dirty as a result of it, but to me it seems like you live in a very specific bi-national family and have probably only really experienced Czechia in the form of Slovácko
In other words, my mileage varies by quite some margin
If you removed the slight language barrier, I'd even say that Poland is culturally closer to Slovakia than Czechia is, at least on a wider level, and I'm saying this as a person who's lived most of their life in the Czech-Polish borderland
On a similar note, when I get past German or communicate in English, I find that a lot of Austrians I know are closer to my mindset than most Slovaks are
And as more people speak English on a better level, these barriers will slowly fade even more
Just my two cents
absolutely not
for example
Kyslík-O
Vodík-H
Draslík-K
Dusík-N
Actual element names are translated, but the abbreviations are not
Aluminum is still AL (in czech Hliník)
Well, some are pretty same to the latin names, some are just in normal language
For example, gold is zlato in Czech, but it's Au, but Wolfram is W, like in latin
> olovo (Sn)
Wait for real
In Czech olovo is 'Pb', 'Sn' is cín.
But we still managed
For example, to remember dusík, we just said "udusíme (we're gonna choke) N(disliked teacher with N-name)
And then there is C-uhlík, Na-sodík, Mg-hořčík, Al-hliník, Si-křemík, Ca-vápník, Fe-železo, Cu-měď, Ag-stříbro, Sb-antimon, Au-zlato, Hg-rtuť, Pb-olovo, and other minor changes
We wanted to be original, so we call it "draslík".
Fortunately, some czech names were rejected: lithium(Li)-japík, beryllium(Be)-sladík, bor(B)-bledník, fluor(F)-kazík, fosfor(P)-kostík, chlor(Cl)-solík, titan(Ti)-chasoník, chrom(Cr)-barvík, kobalt(Co)-ďasík, nikl(Ni)-broník, arsen(As)-otrušík, selen(Se)-švábel, brom(Br)-brudík, tellur(Te)-župel, jod(I)-řasík, wolfram(W)-chvořík, osmium(Os)-voník or uran(U)-nebesník
Nebesník is epic
Yeah, I had a class at university with an Italian professor who told us about the highway assassination
My mind was blown (no pun intended) when I heard about it
Mafia doing something so high profile, that's insane
We have tons of great vietnamese places
There's also some good indian, chinese and thai stuff
It's quite hard to find anything good from americas though, apart from burgers&steaks
- Italian restaurants are also sort of common
- Indian cuisine seems to be gaining popularity
Heck, I saw a fast food place recently with bunch of Indian sauces
- While sushi is available pretty much everywhere, Japanese cuisine is otherwise unheard of
There are few restaurants in Prague, but they are stupidly expensive and there are still many popular Japanese dishes we simply can't get here at all
^Yes, ^I ^am ^a ^bit ^salty ^about ^it
- No idea about Mexican
There are 2 in my 100k city, but neither is very popular
- Burger places are everywhere, but as you said, you will rarely see them serve other typically American dishes
I don't live in Prague and I only look for new restaurants there every couple of months
But simply by being in Prague, the prices are ... not very affordable
And my **quick** search confirms that
Quite simply, I'm not paying 300Kč (~€12) for a bowl of ramen
And that's not even accounting for the time spend getting (~1h30m to the center) there and the price of transportation and/or parking
Because every single one of these places is trying to be everything, but affordable (unlike many actual ramen places in Japan)
Obviously you can go to expensive ramen bars in japan, but my point is there isn't really a cheap alternative here
Furthermore, there is more to Japanese cuisine than ramen and sushi
I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of ramen
It's alright, but I can easily live without it
I love Japanese curry and okonomiyaki and those two I cannot get in Czech Republic, unless I make them myself
Okonomyaki is thankfully not terribly difficult to make
Do you use Japanese mayonnaise and okonomitaki sauce, or do you substitute them with something
"Robot" - this Czech word it's quite used here
I am not sure if this word is popular in other countries
Wtf
Lmao

Oh cool, we've qualified
We won't get off the group stage anyway

There's no word for that so we just read it as "and" but it can be called by its latin word (et) or English word (ampersand)

In the 9th century, the Přemyslid dynasty moved its seat to Prague
The Prague Castle was built and soon it became an important trading and cultural centre
Since then it's been the seat of Czech rulers
Premyslids moved their capital from the *Levý Hradec*, which is a few kilometers north from Prague (now part of a 8,000 inhabitants town of Roztoky) in late 800s or early 900s.
In the next century, Premyslids partially wiped out, partially incorporated Slavnikids, their main competitors for the leaders of Bohemia role, so Prague became the capital
Wasn't Vyšehrad a seat of Czech rulers for some time
Ah, you're right
It was - from the second half of the 11th century until 1140
Thanks for the correction
We've got a lot of idioms with that meaning that are associated with sausages but sadly, English language is not much colourful when it comes to words for specific types of sausage
*Je mi to buřt.*  - "It's a scalded fat sausage of thick short cylindrical shape to me
*Mám to na párku
* - "I've got it on a thin cooked sausage
*Mám to na salámu
* - "I've got it on a salami
We've got a lot, normally quite colorful ones are used
* As others have pointed out, the German-derived "je mi to buřt/párek/salám" (It's sausage to me)
* The variation "mám to na salámu" (I've got it on salami)
* Mám to v piči (I've got it in the cunt)
* Mám to v prdeli (I've got it in the ass)
* Prdím na to (I fart on this)
* Seru na to (I shit on this), but also "To mě nesere" (I'm not shat by this)
* Mrdám/píchám/jebu na to (Fuck this) but also "to mě nemrdá" (I'm not fucked by this)
* From Slovak, and quite recent: "Mám v piči na lehátku" (I have in my cunt on a deck chair)
This one is not about not caring about something specific, it's about not caring in general
* Do toho se neseru (I'm not shitting my way into this)
There's probably countless others that I'm missing right now
For Czech,
* *Je mi u prdele*, lit
"it is near the ass for me"
* *Mám v píči*, lit
"I have it in cunt"
* *Je mi buřt*, lit
"it's a sausage to me"
* *Mám na háku*, lit
"I have it on a hook"
We can say "Je mi to u prdele" which means "That's by my ass". Otherswise and worse "Mám to v píči" - "I have it in my cunt". Otherwise and more civil, "Je mi to jedno/egal/fuk" - "That's no matter to me
To je mi buřt is like verbatim translation meaning exactly the same
I love the circus one, occasionally use it also in Czech
Or more vulgar:
Je mi to u prdele ( It's by an ass)
Je mi to u piče ( It's by a pussy)
My favorite one is: "Na to ti sere bílej tesák!"
I also know ,,Mám v píči" - I have (it) in cunt/pussy
This is a good one too
In my family, we say: "Na to ti sere pes Alfons a kočka Minda
All credit goes to our Slovak bratia :) I legit laughed out loud when I heard that first a few  years ago and still I find it quite funny
We just love asses
It's screwed/I'm screwed - To je v prdeli/Já jsem v prdeli - It's in ass/I'm in ass
Leave me alone/Fuck off - Jdi do prdele - Go into ass
It's fun - To je prdel - It's ass
He doesn't take it seriously - Má/dělá z toho prdel - He has/makes ass of it
Or simple Fuck
- Do prdele
- Into ass
Edit: It all is of course mildly vulgar so we also have civil idioms :)
I just say it in (mangled) Polish, but in Czech it would be "Není to můj cirkus, nejsou to mé opice," but it does not quite roll off the tongue as easily
The word "robot" comes from a play written by Karel Čapek
It is called R.U.R. -  Rossum’s Universal Robots
In the play, "robots" was a name given to the artificial workers
It was suggested by his brother Josef
It stems from an archaic word for hard work - robota

Isn't Jo Nesbø popular everywhere
Most of crime fiction is just him in our bookshops
That is seriously fucked up story
Good but insane
The word robot to be precise, we won't claim it whole :-)
Yes, that's him
I too love this book
Well, claim, I don't think there's much for "claim" as he basically was Czech - he was born in Czech lands, he lived there, he worked there, of course he also lived in other countries as many others, but if he wrote in Czech I think everyone would consider him Czech author
But because he wrote in German, he's part of "Prague German literature" group of authors writing in German
But I'm far from expert
Not exactly, it's made from that word which is robota (and it's still used as synonymum for hard work in Czech and for work in Slovak), so he made robot from that, as robota is femininum and robot masculinum
"Democracy is fine until it serves what I want" says everyone
Only truly free system is individualism
Weird
In Czech, that's the standard phrase
What does one use in Polish then
"Co tam" a "jak tam" is very weird for me
Like asking what you'll be doing when you get somewhere
In Czech, you can also say "Jak se vede", literally "How's it going".
Like, I understand your phrases, but their meaning is not at all what I'd expect
Funny how archaic and perfectly normal are often polar opposite in our languages
-a at the end is common for colloquial shorter versions of given names
Sometimes, a name has radically different colloquial version originating in a somewhat transformed German version of the name
-ouš is also used sometimes in similar context
And some names are just shortened
Examples:
Josef - Pepa
Jan - Honza
František - Fanda, Fanouš
Antonín - Tonda
Adolf, Adam - Áda
Bohuslav/Bohumil - Bohouš
Daniel - Dan
Tomáš - Tom
Yep
Same in Czech Republic
But we have Jan - Honza (derivated from german Hans)
Also Josef - Pepa
If only he had put his huge talent to a good use and built industry, trade and cooperation, rather than waging a senseless war

Let's say that Český in this case refers to the territory of Bohemia proper (Čechy in Czech), not the whole country or its people
The first sentence of your response might be a bit confusing because Bohemian and Czech are (or at least used to be for centuries) synonyms
To be precise, Czech language used to be called Bohemian language until the early 20th century
In English
Yes, it's an exonym and Czechs never used it in their own language

No, but:

I don't think an amendment from 1789 can be called "recent", even if its ratification was completed in 1992

We don't like being considered Western European either or yes, we are impressed when somebody calls us Western European but it's not that we would actually feel a part of it
We consider ourselves being Central Europeans and basically "the most Central of all Central Europeans". We often talk about our country being "in the heart Europe" or when we are self-deprecating, then being "a beer belly of Europe" and generally consider ourselves being something between the East and the West
We simply hate when someone says Czechia is an Eastern European country because we are a Central European country and the fact is an important aspect of our national identity
We are taught at school that Central European countries are Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary
Parts of other countries, namely Slavonia (Croatia), Vojvodina (Serbia), and Transylvania (Romania) are sometimes considered parts of Central Europe as well
Afaik, V4 countries generally prefer being considered Central European and then Austria and Slovenia I guess

Point is, in post-war Eastern Bloc, there was a metric ton of shitty, cheap beater cars, including interwar cars like the Praga Piccolo and other affordable 1st Republic cars, a lot of these cars' top speeds were rarely above like 70 km/h and that is in _pristine service_ condition

I'm surprised especially about the Asians
There are tons of vietnamese people here and the ones younger than 30 mostly grew up or were born here so they are fully integrated and I know many mixed Czech-Vietnamese couples and mostly haven't heard of any issues
And if there were any issues it was mostly coming from the vietnamese parents who wanted their child to be with another vietnamese only
To be fair, is not wanting your kid to marry a gypsy or a Muslim (without further specification which makes most people imagine your typical immigrant who can't speak our language and has completely different culture) xenophobic
I don't think so
It all comes down to the way the question was asked
If you ask it the way that makes people imagine typical Asian selling cheap stuff in a market with their super broken Czech, there is no wonder parents would prefer their kid to date a native Czech
I think this is again related to Czechs being negative on default and since they have no experience with Jews they rather say no than yes
Overall, I don't think this survey implies that we are as racist or xenophobic as people try to make it out to be
The situation is also getting better and the younger generation is much more open towards different cultures and ethnicities
I asked my mother and grandmother and they do associate them together
Gypsies are even often refered to as blacks
I mean, it's not that this affects a shitton of people, since the Jewish, black and muslim (and asian as well to an extent I guess) populations are pretty low, but holy crap where is this coming from
I don't think most Czechs mind Asians at all
It's just that your average parent is going to imagine a guy in a shop with shitty cheap clothing imported from China speaking broken czech if you ask about Asians
That's why the number is so low IMO
We don't really have black people in the sense most people know the word so gypsied take the honor as the darkest-skinned group of people living here
For afroamericans we usually use "černoch" which basically means black but people know you're referring to afroamericans
Estonia is doing so many progressive things it's honestly inspiring
Shows everyone that you don't need to be super rich and properous to think out of the box and come up with modern and unconventional ways to improve different aspects of our society
I wish my coutry was like that too but Czechs are really backward in so many things

Actually it's likely not a coincidence
In Czech, fat is *tlustý* and it's also a common surname
Quite a lot of Austrians, especially from around Vienna, have got Czech surnames because a lot of Czechs moved there for work in the Habsburg times (as well as other nations from all of the monarchy)
Over the time, they lost Czech diacritics or were fully transcripted to German pronunciation but they're still easily recognisable
Tlusty is likely one of those
It's strange to me why so many people consider learning 'just' a trade to be a bad thing
I don't perceive those people to be inferior
It also seems to be a better choice for the society
I don't see a productive reason why most people with <105 IQ (or true intelligence  equivalence, to avoid inevitable 'IQ doesn't mean shit' reply) should go to college, perhaps with the exception of extremely motivated people in non-STEM fields
I frankly have much more respect towards a good and honest plumber than to some humanities graduates who consider themselves superior to people without university level education
>(or true intelligence equivalence, to avoid inevitable 'IQ doesn't mean shit' reply)
[Also Kazakhstan] ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Ah, the French empty diagonal, we meet again
So far it's been a normal summer, compared to last years
Temps mostly between 20-25, occasionally above 25, rarely above 30
May and June have been quite rainy as well, which has helped a lot with the drought that we've had since 2015
I think I'll pass, thanks
Teplice, so one of the warmest areas of the country
We've had 2 days above 30 and don't know how many days above 25
There were 3 days this week alone ([Monday] it was 27°C, [Tuesday] 26 and yesterday slightly above 25)
I approve of temperatures like this
Checked what was the weather like [on this day last year] and we had a 38°C heatwave
> formerly part of te USSR
Hungary was never part of the USSR
It was part of the Eastern Bloc, but so was e.g. Slovakia, which has 91 % in the table
[Seznam will actually be one of the default search engine options in Czechia and Slovakia
Just because some countries consume a lot of potatos because it's a very forgiving plant when it comes to climate and ground fertility doesn't mean all slavs eat a lot of potatos
It's amazing how this sub can be sometimes so progressive yet be casually racist (inb4 "slavs aren't a race", I know, I cannot find a better word for it) about slavs
EDIT: Before you reply, this is nothing personal, I'm venting out frustration about a really irritating trend that has been sweeping the internet for the last couple of years
I know you're just trying to make a joke
What is a dark fact about your country not many people know about
I have recently found out Czechia ranks as [the third worst slavery haven] in Europe
Kind of a shock, if you ask me
What about you
Forced and coerced sterilizations of Romani women were happening from the 1970s until 1990s, with at least one known case as recent as 2007
I mean, I'm afraid that most Czech have at least heard about this on the news, but they would agree
Holy shit
I didn't know that
I thought, that the forced relocation of German speaking Czechs after WWII or Hilsneriáda were the worst, but this is equally bad or worst
Definitly didn't expect us to be that high, but interesting on how that correlates with the recent crackdown by the police on PublicAgent porn
Why is Těšín gone
Also still a thing in Czechia
Sigh
So did we
We learned about it a little in school, though
But the way Germans who lived in Sudetenland were threated after Czechoslovakia regained the teritory was quite cruel, too
Same
Most Czech people still get angry if you suggest that there might have been any problems with the deportation of Germans from our territory in 1945 and with how they were treated before it (in some towns, people got straight up shot or thrown into the river just on the basis of their nationality, and it used to be taboo to even research these deaths; some of the deported were German-speaking Jews who had just returned from concentration camps, women were being raped as "punishment", all kinds of messed up shit)
Yeah it's pretty bad
I hope people in charge are actually doing something about it, but as I know our beloved government it will probably go at a snail's pace
I mean 3rd
Only better than Albania and Montenegro
Come the fuck on
Why do you think that's the case
Other Baltic countries don't have it as bad
Damn
This should be definitely more talked about
I read that people did this normally, they believed in healing powers of blood of any executed person, of positive effect on pregnancy when hanged man touches your belly, I read they tried to steal parts of bodies of executed, that executioners sometiems even allowed sick people to take the blood etc

Wouldn't be nice to have sea in middle of Europe
Spain
Portugal deserves to become an island with access to Mediterranean
That would make them a top tourist spot
Poland
It’ll give access to the sea and that’s good enough reason to me
Poland
Nothing personal, guys, we just want to have a sea
Well since the only reason to do that would be to finally get sea access the only logical choices would be Poland and Germany
And since Germany is historically known for trying shit and the fact that they have not for 70 years is quite unsettling, I'd go with them
Sorry guys
Poland
Poland or Germany, I wanna sea
Bye Austria
We finally have glorious sea
Cons: Parts of Alpes gone
Pros: We can claim ownership of schnitzel
I mean, if Poland becomes sea, we will have access to sea
Slovakia
Austria
Sorry, we want some sea
Slovakia
It's not connected to the sea, so the water wouldn't be salt, it would be interesting to have this giant lake next door in this drought aand
we would have nice beaches on the border
Sorry Germany, but we really need that sea
Iceland would make no difference
If its even part of EU in the first place
We can pack up and move west
Germany can accomodate, right
Bavaria has nice beer and all that
You'd kill grandayy by erasing Malta, are you sure you wanna do that
We could also say farewell to another tax haven
I am not complaining
I am in if we get Arnold Schwarzernegger to return to his drowning homeland, shooting the water with a giant automatic from a helicopter and shouting at the drowning Austrians "Get to the choppa
" and "Get aaut of hieah

Ok, I have no idea how to write "here" in his accent, but you get the point

Protection of property, health and life are valid reason to get a gun license and a gun permitting a concealed carry
I am sorry but why can't those women just buy tampons
€ 170 to € 350 here
There is a fixed budget of around € 8,600 and the parents can choose to take it 2 to 4 years
And I think they raised it to € 11,700 this year so it's even more
We have up to 4
And can't drink a beer in public
But you pretty much can't use it unless they point a gun at you first
That's cool
We have a tax break of € 43 per child
It can last until 26 if the person is studying
Edit: Just learned that it was raised to € 50 and that it's 63 for 2nd child and 80 for more childs (per every child)
It's also one of the tax breaks that can go below zero so even low income families can enjoy the benefits
By that logic tampons should be free for everyone, not just the poor
HA HA

My reactions was "Finally someone who will finish Brexit" and also

When French gave up Czechoslovakia to Germans and then Germans defeated French with Czechoslovakian weapons
The Munich Betrayal, or more specifically what followed it
I guess that was more like everyone else's bruh moment though
Same for Yalta Conference
One rebelious religion group didn't like the parlament, so they went there and literally yeeted everyone out of the window
Well, the worst possible scenario looks like this
You are working lowest manual job available
You have much more kids than is usual, and your name shows that you are not ethnically czech
This combined causes, that no one wants to rent you a decent living
But there is an option, you can rent a trashy room in building that is falling apart, for rent that costs like a fine apartment in fashionable area of city
How the hell can you afford this
You can’t, but the government can
They pay for the living in said hellhole for you
The owner of this building never tries to make it liveable, you are lucky if electricity and water is working
When your trashy neighbors steal the pipes to sell them, you aren’t getting a replacement
then hygiene office comes, and decides that it isn’t acceptable, and decides to torn the house down
You are moving again
The smart owner already bought another ruin to move you into
And the cycle repeats
Making money of poverty is huge issue here, and integration of Roma people often fails
Towns and cities now can prohibit this kind of business, but it just move it elsewhere
Sad fact - there were a politicians who were making money in this business
For example in far-right party that often attack gypsies verbally
Reading all these, there is a jarringly stark contrast between post-Soviet countries and the rest of Europe
Fuck communists
I think you're confusing terms, they are not talking about communist buildings as a whole
They are talking about concrete blocks of flats - like [this] not apartment buildings - like [this]
As a Czech person (75% ethincally Czech) that has lived here his whole life, I do agree
&#x200B;
EDIT: No, I'm not poor
I agree with the Roma part
My wording is kinda bad
This
So much this
I think we can say this about the entirety of the former communist countries in Europe
This isn't really the case in Czechia, I'd say (or Prague at least), lower middle class at best
Upper middle class either has a mortgage for a house in some satellite town or at least a better flat, not in an apartment block
Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Only one thing bothers me - capital letters
&#x200B;
The rules for writing capital letters are already mess in czech grammar, and each other language I learn have a different rules for writing them
In czech grammar handbook there are several pages for it
how the fuck I am supposed to remember that and other languages as well
i do often, but i dont really mind since i will be leaving this place in a few years and have no use for it anymore
We use more and more English expressions in our language these days,  but I can see I tend to use quite a bit of English words that are not actually common and slap czech conjugation on it, baffling non English-speaking people around me
I feel like I'm getting worse at both English and Czech
I’m byelingual
I mainly use English on daily basis on internet, almost never write in native language there, plus, when I'm in Germany for a long time, I mix up Czech, German and English
I would not say worse, just mixing English and German words to my native language
Yes
It happens pretty regularly that I first recall a word in English and only then in Czech
I also sometimes catch myself thinking in English, which is pretty weird
Also, because I learned English words mostly through media sometimes I really struggle translating English text to Czech even though I know exactly what it says
Yes, definitely
Luckily my friends know english well enough to understand it in english most of the times
Yes
I *sometimes* use at least 1 or 2 English words in a Czech sentence
> Not really, the languages are so different so I can separate them almost completely
Pullnout, pušnut, uploadovat etc
Despite my efforts to normalize the phrase "natlačit do chobotu", people in my office still use "pušnout do trunku" :(
Well, since I got my accent from watching British and American movies and TV shows combined with Czech, I'm technically drowning in Atlantic ocean when I'm speaking, but besides of that, I like mine
I hate my accent
It sounds like a mixture of Swedish, British, German, American an maybe a bit of Australian
I dont care that much to be honest, and i dont mind if someone speak with accent at all
Surprisingly many people thought that i am from Germany based on my accent :-D
Many people think that Czech accent sounds similar to Russian one, that is actually furthest from the truth, the accent is dramatically different despite being from the same language group
So i assume if we don't sound like Russians then Germans is the next easiest answer
Unlike English, I don't hate Czech accents in German, for whatever reason
Might be cause my German isn't nearly as good as my English, or because German seems much easier to pronounce to me and many other Czechs who learn it
Some English words are just plain weird, whereas German is mostly consistent
But that's my fault because I learned a lot of my English from YouTube
Because electronics are more expensive here, and Apple products even more so, so most of us can't afford Macs
The difference is pretty significant even for rich European countries, I'd guess it's mostly because of our high VAT rates
You can go on about various other reasons, but I think the price is most significant, kids who could afford iPhones and Macbooks in my high school/college would mostly pick them over high-end Android devices (those who didn't study in IT-related fields, anyway)
Germans specifically are also very into online privacy and tend to favor open software, which could play a part in it, but I'm not sure if selling your soul to Google is that any better than Apple these days
Money
Our prices are about 30% more
Network providers are usually offering just full price or something like 5% off when you subscribe for most expensive plan
(the "discount" I can have from Vodafone with my plan is about 40eur more than buying it anywhere else) Last interesting offer on iphone was for iphone 5
We are not wealthiest part of EU so 11pro is for average czech salary
But have to say I see more and more people switching to iphone in my circles but they don’t buy latest stuff
Because given the average income, taxes, exchange fees and such, it easily gets more expensive for Europeans (especially Eastern countries) than it is for Americans
As well, lot of Americans buy it on credit, while I think most of Europeans buy the phone upfront
As well there is the effect of American company
> Well, you'll notice that more then 45 minutes have passed and the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
9 hours passed and there isn't really any war here
lot of nonsenses about Apple and Android but discussion is civil
well if you really believe one platform is objectively better than another not considering everyone has his own subjective needs then it is not really surprising people don't want to listen how objective you are :)
Technically Czechia is also a whatsapp country but I don't know anyone who uses it
it's really weird
Exactly this
I always have to laugh when people make fun of me for "wasting" money on Apple products, but then they buy a new crappy Android every 1-2 years, while I still use my over 6 years old iPhone 6
So, I am not quite sure who is the one "wasting" money here
Same works for Android, unless you want to use just app which came with phone you will end up at situation where new app will simple not work with old os due lack of features of old os
There isn't real difference if life cycle is determined by IOS releases or Android releases
I am not expecting every piece of software on old hardware is going to be supported endlessly, these more than five years of support on iphones are more than enough for me so I was never forced to update phone because of that
For you it is objectively worse phone because of that, for me it is objectively not even the criteria I care about
I don't see buying Samsung as being somehow „tech savvy“ because you are also paying for a brand with Samsung and Google phones
I think it means that price-performance ratio comes first, brand after that
Maybe you, because you can buy an Android which will last for the same amount of time and the price will be on par with an iPhone, but that Android most probably will have better specs

Like, the rectangular building was split into even rows od offices, and only the ones on the edge had natural light -- and the company was considered quite friendly to the employees
Nope, you would say "Mr

At most, you'd call them "Mr

we had to be an excellent company then as our office didn't have this
But once I've been in some reddit thread about classrooms without windows
Well it has to be hard for other groups then
All what I can see from here are some statistics,  like your officials sayings you are arresting more than 10 millions people every year and till around year 2010 it was close to 15m. With the population a bit above 300milions people it is completely insane number
A bit of everything you can see in this thread, the company I was working for was British with British management, no one really forced US office works in this way, they set up these rules on their own

Czech person would be surprised rather in an opposite way as our gun owners are used to carry their guns everywhere
No, "pana" is the accusative form of "pan", meaning mister, sir

There are very strict laws about that

We have a bunch of old Slavic names that are rarely used
but there are a few problems
The more popular ones are routinely shortened, and the shortened form have very different feel
*Miroslav* sounds like a king, *Mirek* just like a regular guy
*Slavomír* sounds like a pagan warrior-poet, *Slávek* like a simpleton
Similarly *Boleslav* \> *Bolek*, *Lubomír* \> *Luboš*, *Rostislav* \> *Rosťa*...
At least there are options in male names
Most Slavic female names are just weird
Kajetán, Havel, Zvonimír, Cyril for males
Ida, Hermína, Apolena for females
even though now it's kinda fashionable to give your kids rarely used names to make them more "unique"
Some names are from the old Testament
Like Adam and Eva
I know a guy who is about 23 years old and is named Adolf
It's kinda taboo here as well, but when we were talking he said that he never had a problem with his name
Good question
It's a Polish cartoon, not a Czech one
And Lolek is apparently short for Karol
Don't ask me why, I have no idea :D
Yeah, it was a bit of an exaggeration on my part
Of course, a person's name has a negligible effect on one's qualities
And believe me, I know a bit about that, because my name (Honza) is used by a universally known fairy tale character "Simple Honza".
It's just that the shortenings have trivialized these ancient beautiful names laden with symbolism, and it's difficult to translate this effect across a language barrier, so I have used a strong tool to break through :)
Zořena, Žizňava, Hněvka, Hodava, Kvašena, Nětka, Pluhava, Božetěcha, Bratruše, Bratřice, Ctěna, Černice
Yeah there are several versions for many names
Miro sounds like the Slovak form though, was he Czech
I mean, I won't be throwing stones from the glass house that is Czech
The familiar form of Jan is Honza
The familiar form of Karel is Kája, the familiar form of Josef is Pepa
Ignác used to be shortened to Nácek (but that is now used as a derogatory word for Nazis, so
haven't heard that one in a while)
Yeah, especially since our languages are quite closely related
In Northern Czechia (N. Moravia and Silesia) many folks actually understand Polish
Sure you can
Just be aware that people may think that you are Czech if you do :)
It's mostly things you don't think about
Like in English, you don't think it's weird that Jack can be a diminutive of Jonathan and Jacob and James
It only gets weird when you start explaining it to an outsider :)
And there are reasons behind all of those, they're just obscured by several layers of historical development, so if you take your time you can uncover them
E.g. Honza for Jan is derived from the German Hans
As I mentioned, German used to have a substantial, even dominant position in this country, so that's why it stuck
Pepa for Josef is apparently from Italian Giuseppe, where it was shortened to Beppe
Not sure how exactly it spread here, but it did
I think many languages do this, in fact
Names too long are unwieldy so are shortened
In English, Jonathan is shortened to John, James to Jim, Benedict to Ben, Timothy to Tim, Thomas to Tom
I am quite sure common examples in other languages can be found
Some have occurred in this very thread :)
They should do this in China, Russia and the US as well
Europe is quite green already
It's good that they're trying to implement policies like this here, however i fear that the taxes will raise and it won't help unless other continents join as well
I almost feel like everyone here really think we only have 8 years left
These ecological countermeasures could have catastrophic impact on economy and our European standard of living

Its all about green energy and electrical cars saving our planet

With their efficiency they will never pay for their costs
be it ecology or power produced
Nuclear powerplants are the only way for now
Why use 10 000 grasshoppers when we can have 1 horse
European economy is fully depending on German economy
And German economy is fully depending on fossil car production
Planning for 2050 is waste of time

Sometimes but more often I can’t tell if the laguage I’m reading or hearing is English, Czech or Slovak unless I really focus on the language

That beer will be 5 CZK cheaper because of a new clusterfuck of a law about beer VAT
Just a little insight: Bottled beer is 21%, draught beer is 10% if served in a restaurant with facilities, 21% if not
Alcohol-free beer is 15% and Radler type stuff (beer mixed with lemonade) is
well *nobody knows but jesus* i guess
10% VAT is only used on stuff like baby diapers to help moms
The prime minister said that this will result in beer being cheaper if the pubs are generous, but the real outcome is probably that everyone will just do it randomly, just like they did before and the accountants will have to deal with that shit

We should have it try
Won’t be in it that much difference, but I can think of something really weird
Like, if you want we can but what from that we will get
Don't-know(i) what will(i) write, nor don't-know(i), if it doing(i) right, but is it kinda fun
If want(you), reply(you) with a sentence, which would have(i) write next
Ok, bye
I don't know what will I write, nor do I know if I'm doing it right, but it's kinda fun
If you want, reply with a sentence I should write next
Ok, bye
The (i) and (you) represents the verb conjugation
The don't-know is put together because in my language, it's only one word - nevědět - ne means no; vědět means to know
You just think about the sentence in your language and then translate it word from word
Or as others might say: Just think about the sentence and word from word translate it

Few days ago, our PM Andrej Babiš praised our coping with COVID and accidentally made zombie cure when he said "we saved thousands of dead people".
There was tv debate before last elections on topic of culture
Most parties sent usual gray mice, but far right SPD sent weirdo, who wasn’t able to speak fluently on his own
This nominee for minister of culture wasn’t even able to read from paper, and when show host told him not to read it, he kept going
He wasn’t able to pronounce some of words he had written on his paper, and his speech became meme
This guy got elected, and later he turned out to be gypsy holocaust denier
...from his book "On the Nature of Things".
Businessman Babiš also once said he won't do politic, no way, because he'd be really terrible at it
He is the PM now
He's a goldmine when he speaks by himself
"Yes, not everything is perfect, I understand and I too don't understand, I was looking for a vet on Monday and they were full everywhere, then we've found out that saloons, dog saloons, are closed, which is nonsense and when we've fixed that everyone was lauhue at us"
To be honest, he wasn't wrong
He IS really terrible PM
At least once, and mostly by accident
haha, no
It's really bad and we're not doing fine
our country is changing into babišstan sadly
True
Especially with the LGBT+ stuff
Pubs being closed

It's definitely on my bucket list
Yeah, I'd support high speed railways anywhere
It would also be great for us going on summer holidays, so I think there are some strong arguments
ETA: I would also insist that it has to be affordable when it's finished, though
I'm usually more than willing to take trains or even buses instead of planes for the sake of our environment, but when plane tickets are 4 or 5 times cheaper than public railways, that makes me a bit salty
I would rather see high speed network Berlin-Prague-Vienna
I think this should be priority
I absolutely support it
It is fast, comfortable, and environmentally friendly mean of transport, and it will increase quality of travel for both locals and visiting people
High speed trains should connect as many major cities as possible, both in new and old member states
In long term good infrastructure is always good for business as well
> high speed rail is a staple in Western and increasingly - Central Europe
Sad Czech noises
Sounds like the Prague airport
We only have one major airport in the country, and the only options for getting there are bus and taxi
Population density definitely has to be taken into account, most countries can't have train connections to every village like Germany, but HSR connecting the largest cities
I feel like that would bring large boosts to tourism and business
Obviously it couldn't work as a commercial project, but I find it hard to imagine that it would be a loss overall if we include other investments in the long term and the externalities of flying (also, we should tax the hell out of aviation fuel, that shit is ridiculous)
What's your standard for a "working" high speed rail, if the TGV doesn't qualify
Like
the Shinkansen and nothing else
You don't know how good you have it
Sure, but why not do both
If the question seems to me that there will be Czech response I'll try to find one
Yes, as I didn't find any czech reply, I shall give mine
Yes I skim to czech answers, but I read few upvoted answers aswell
Yeah, its pretty common
There are two big charity organizations, UNICEF and Czech based People in Need, both running on monthly subscribstion model
Its quite common as a gift to give someone for example 1 year subscribstion to UNICEF
One example of the campaign in Africka with Czech YouTuber shopaholic Nicole
Its kinda cringy
Well there are local NGOs which helps in Africa and they place these ads
You can check it if you believe they are not correct - [
Yes and so did our parents
And because of that particular thought is creeping around
Thought that cause of african poverty aren't Europeas but, and I beg Africans for forgiveness, Africans
It really took me a long time to come to terms with some non-English surnames being pronounced the English way (esp
in the US)
So Weird Al is not  jǎːŋkoʋitɕ but ˈjæŋkəvɪk. W.E.B. Dubois is not dy'bwɑ but duːˈbɔɪs, etc
Lollygagging
Are you guys gagging when you see a loli in an anime or something
Oxford dictionary explains lollygagging as "dawdling".
Thank you so fucking much, Oxford dictionary
How else would you describe black person
Weirdly enough, both meaning would be translated as "stolice" to czech
So a inhabitant of, let's say, Nigeria is African American
No, we usually took them when we went to buy there something
I don't know, I am in Madrid now, and today really feels like the usual winter day here (10°C during the day, and slighty above zero during the night)
a thing i also find irritating, its September 10th and i already see Christmas shit in supermarkets, not even to October,
and once Christmas ends, Easter stuff just immediately appears in stores, like what the hell
Fuck harsh winters, Mediterranean temperatures are the best
But the "Christmas since October" is really annoying
Yeah, it made winters interesting and pretty
Now they are just cold and depressing
\> supermarkets seem to begin putting up christmas stuff earlier every year
And literary every year are people complaining that Christmas shopping starts at late September/October
We used to have at least 1
5 metre of snow and at least some snow during whole winter
In the last 10 years, I don't think it ever got over 0
5 metre, and it melts right away anyway
It is shit
Without fake snow, ski-resorts would bankrupt very fast
Previous winter I didn't have to shovel at all - all snow was rained off immediately
I grew up in Northern Bohemia, never really heard anyone being anti-German, I think we've switched to anti-Russian
Some people are irritable whenever Sudeten Germans are brought up, or when they comment on our internal politics or have contact with our politicians, as it is, quote, "not their business anymore". But no, there isn't any public sentiment against Germans anymore outside of that
I don't think so, after all, it was 81-75 years ago
We still have memorial ceremonies about WWII war crimes (Lidice, Životice, all the ghettos like Terezin or Jewish Quarter in Prague, mass executions, etc
), but like I said, it was long time ago
Also, if we had to keep grudge against every nation, whose armies either attacked or pillaged through our country, we wouldn't be speaking to almost any Europian nation
In czech republic I still encounter it, but very rarely
Usually it is about World war 2, anexing of Sudet and Munich agreement, or as we call it Munich betrayel
Not really, actually German tourists are usually very polite and the give much bigger tips, plus we hate the Russians more
Not really, Czechs and Germans get along pretty good these days I'd say but whenever my dad sees a group of Germans he says "The fascists are invading again
" or something equally as unfunny
Yes, it went down a lot, but people still complain about "Damn skopčáci"
I have no idea if this is very common in CZ but where I grew up (Vysočina and Prague) it seems like Germany fucked us so hard there was a buffer overflow and not counting the old folk it really isn't a thing here
I'd say it's still quite present, especially with our older generations
It's not only because of events "70 years ago" - living in the Eastern Bloc, WW2 was reflected differently, there was an emphasis on the Soviets being our allies because they liberated us in WW2, so of course you needed to still dislike the enemy they saved us from
East Germans were our friends, if course, but we all had to be on the lookout for any attempts at revenge from the imperialist West Germans
in the former Sudetenland areas, this was further amplified by fearmongering about the deported Germans coming back and "taking your houses"... We didn't have any insight into changes that were going on in the West German and western European societies for 40 years
Czech communists created their own interpretation of history, in which the villains have always been Germans or Austrians in some capacity, and at least 2 generations grew up with these narratives
Obviously nowadays most Czechs are gonna be civil and perfectly fine with dealing with Germans in business, tourism or everyday life, but I'd say that some of the negative sentiments are still lurking under the surface, especially in Sudetenland
I can't really imagine we'd attack somebody for speaking German in public, though, it's more snide remarks like "see, they've never actually changed" when our media report about cases of far-right extremism in Germany, and stuff like that
It seems to me that people are more angry at the UK and France for their betrayal in 1938
And at the Soviet invasion in 1968
From his point of view, no one is angry on the Germans
Depends
In general I think there isn't much anti German sentiment, definitely not among young people
Occasionally you can find someone who is bitter about Sudeten Germans / Beneš's decrees (our current scumbag president Zeman used the decrees against his opponent Schwarzenberg as a dirty scaremongering strategy in the presidential election back in 2013)
The extremes both on far left and far right also hate Merkel due to the migrant crisis
Other than that I think we get along well, we have lots of German tourists here, never heard anyone say anything bad about Germans in real life
For me personally, I am in intense contact with Germans due to work (my boss is German, before the coronavirus I used to travel to Düsseldorf every month), also live in north west Bohemia, 10-15 km from German border so people around here go to Saxony often for shopping or hiking in the mountains
Generally I feel like at home there
We are quite similar in many regards
Yeah, it pops up from time to time, especially among people with strong "slavic nations unite" or "fuck EU" mentality
Yes, not as big, but a thousand years under the German boot will take a while to heal
Yeah, I think we hated them more mainly because the German thing was a thing everyone knew of but no one could anything about
The Russian thing was a bit of a backstab
Why Poles
Interpreting last thousand years as living "under the German boot" is a perfect example of the bullshit that was rammed down our throats last 150 years by our nationalist elites
Maybe, but very few people wanted that
Hungarians didn't like Habsburgs and there were revolts against Austrian rule, Czechoslovaks were so fed up with Austrians, that big chunk of our units just switched sides and went fighting for allies as Legionaries (really Interesting stories actually
Especially Russian legions) and Balkans hated Austrians so much, that they assasinated Franz Ferdinand
The Empire would probably fallen apart in big civil war sooner or later
I thought that Fanta was from USA
Actually it’s quite interesting that worldwide known beer Budweiser is American
Name Budweiser directly refers to the Czech town České Budějovice (Budweis in German)
There is beer company in the town named Budweiser Budvar, that is really Czech
There were disputes over the brand name in the past and American company won - they can use word Budweiser referring to the Czech city (I think that it is okay as well)
I thought for a long time Tic Tacs were Czech until I started travelling and seeing then literally everywhere
The games Mafia and Mafia II are Czech games
Many people don’t know it
When I was a kid, the Disneyland could have been in the freaking Atlantis for all I cared, I just knew I'd never visit it
It is brewed in eponymous Moravian town
I thought the same thing as a kid
You should look up how much baked beans the UK consumes
It's unreal
No one is even remotely close to you
Boggles my mind
Can't disagree with that
They as indeed delicious
I think it's an absolutely necessary thing for any country to have, but our healthcare system is still far from perfect, at least from my experience
The main problem is that we don't have enough healthcare professionals, I've heard so many stories about nurses having to cover two more shifts just to make everything look good in the papers, I don't really know how to explain it properly
And it's basically impossible to find a new GP, especially for children
I've also heard bad things about our mental health care, but I don't have any first hand experience so I don't want to really say much
And this problem is also starting to appear in schools and post offices, I know some people who teach at public schools and one of them said that throughout the last 5 years 8 teachers left and they only managed to hire 3 new ones
And the Czech Post (Česká pošta) is kind of a running joke, because there's basically zero chance of your package actually being delivered to your house, they just give you a piece of paper saying that you weren't home and to pick it up at the post office (and those are often really busy because of it)
It is funny that USA is claiming how christian is and doesn't have it
Perhaps I am wrong and real Jesus's teaching is to mooch enough money so you can afford jet, nice house, ...
It's good idea fo US
Yes of course, universal healthcare is something all countries should have
The issue is how you achieve that and there is great diversity in the actual systems
Some countries have private insurance companies, some don't etc
From my understanding Bernie wants Medicare for all with virtually no private insurance
That might or might not be the best path forward especially  considering the difficulty he is gonna face passing any bill
However the need for universal healthcare shouldn't be controversial at this point
In Czechia you have to be privately insured but the health insurance companies are very controlled
You pay some 16% of your income for health insurance
When you're unemployed/child/retired/student the state pays it for you
If you're unemployed and not registered as seeking a job, you have to pay some minimal amount (I think around 80€) on your own
If you're self employed you either pay the minimum amount of your income is lower than some threshold or based on your income if it's more (the minimum is slightly bigger than for the unemployed, around 100€)
You also pay some small fees that exist to prevent abusing of the system (e.g. 3€ per night staying in hospital, I think they already cancelled the 1€ per doctor visit, but I'm not sure)
Pretty much anything prescribed is either free or really cheap
When you go to doctor, the doctor either has an agreement with the insurance company (the better option) and thus you don't pay anything, or they don't and you first pay it out of your pocket and then file a case with your insurance company which will pay it back
You can even get some nonstandard procedures for free if your doctor and the insurance company agree (e.g. breast enlargement if your psychologist agrees that it would help with your low self-esteem and the insurance company's expert agrees, too)
I probably forgot something since it's a pretty complex topic, feel free to ask
I absolutely agree with you, my point was just to share my own experience with healthcare where I live, not to say that the same thing would happen in the US as well
In my opinion, implementing a universal healthcare system is the best thing they can do
Absolutelly, I think there are some small places with quality (or distribution) problems here and there but generally tap water it is
I never bought bottled water to drink at home
Bottled water is the most sold thing in my local Tesco, but many people do drink tap water
I don't know about other people, but tap watter is basicaly the only thing I drink at home
As you said, I buy bottled water when I need it on travels but at home
tap watter all the way
Everyone I know drinks tap water - don't see a reason why someone would drink bottled water when tap water is often of superior quality and taste
The quality of water depends on area, city, type of buildings etc
The city I live in is lucky as we get our tap water from a water reservoir in the mountains - the quality is great
We call these fridges "american fridges" and they are not really common in my experience
I would say 95%+ people have the normal non-dispensing fridge (ymmv)
The only benefit I see in that type of a fridge is the ice dispenser, that's what I use when I visit someone with that fridge
I still get the water from the tap just because it is faster to fill a glass/jug due to faster flow
As for the filtering pitchers, that's also not very common
My flatmate got one recently because she's a coffee enthusiast and wanted to see if having filtered water would improve the coffee taste
But for normal drinking tap water it is
We have both, but just because I don't like the taste of tap water in Prague (we had well water back home, which wasn't chlorinated, or not as much) and the ice is just so convenient
Plus the Brita really helps keep limescale down to a minimum
Maybe only "[google
dk] shows that
Google shows me this for "best tap water": [
Only once Denmark is mentioned
Way too often and it's so damn frustrating
The problem is that these days, I probably consume more English than Czech during day from videos to podcasts, reading stuff
It gets especially bad when I am talking about an area that I almost exclusively encounter online in English
And the worst part is that my English proficiency is completely fucked up
I think I have almost 100% understanding of any text at this point and almost the same level with listening
Translating Czech to English is usually fine but translating English to Czech is sometimes very hard for me even if I know exactly what that sentence means
Same here
It got really bad during quarantine because I spent all day in my room watching movies, reading books, posting online etc
all in English
I used some Czech with my family and during online lessons but not nearly enough
I now prefer to discuss topics in English instead of Czech
It’s pretty embarrassing and also worrying because maturita is coming up in a few years and I can’t see myself passing the Czech language/literature part of it lmao
Well look on the bright side, you'll ace the English part
The Czech part is also so on-rails (or atleast that's what it felt like to me) that it's impossible to go very deep into the subject, so rudimental Czech will probably do lol
Don't tell others what they should or shouldn't do
Mind your own business
We feel the same way
Sadly experienced this while visiting our company's office in Düsseldorf
What a barbaric crime to put sauce on perfectly fine, crispy schnitzel
I find it hilarious that the Finnish have a sauna code of ethics
>Calling us bigger, neighbouring nationality
No Southern Czechia or Western Hungary
Aww man
Can we keep refering to you as Upper Hungary
You guys don't speak Czech in Slovakia
Is it ok, to speak Czech in Slovakia, or should I try my best to speak Slovak, or just avoid them and speak English
Wait
You can order milk for a drink in a restaurant
Czech children with ketchup
It sound weird, but after my one year stay in Germany I love it with sauces now
But it's common in other parts of the world too
Last year I had a great schnitzel in curry sauce in Thailand
idk why but this question is so weird you asked that question like we were foreigners to each other
That's kinda sad
So if you dislike someone, the way to go is visiting their sauna and breaking the sauna code of ethics in it
I hope they said "no homo".
Sorry, I think I watched too much US politics, that I even thought of this question
Well
I guess our restaurants have milk for cooking too, but it is not on the drinks menu, so no one ever orders it
I think that if anyone did, they would get some funny looks from fellow diners as well
I think people who say "Eastern Europe" just mean Former Eastern bloc, they just think it's the same thing (it's not)
It's quite easy to pronounce
It is a bitch to read tho, háček ftw
Every passenger buying a ticket from the driver
Or even showing the ticket to the driver
Sounds terribly inefficient
(The other north)
Here in Prague standard-length buses have 4 doors, articulated buses have 5
All are used for entering and leaving
Even stopping to show your ticket to a driver is terribly long process, even if it takes 3 seconds, for a dozen of people -- normal amount for entering/leaving on every stop -- it's half a minute
With stop on average every two to three minutes, it makes bus 25% slower
That's why purchasing tickets from the driver in Prague is penalized: you can only purchase more expensive ticket and you pay 20% premium on top of the regular price
The thing is that cyprus is sometimes considered an asian country, so you might be last
Ovidijus
Like the Roman author Ovidius Naso
Mostly not, people who interact with other nationals - and know either English or German and are therefore mostly of younger generations - don't sweat over it
It's interesting to compare different perspectives, and if there is contention, you'd just agree to disagree, since different things are important to others and that's cool
Things might get heated or rather awkward if the topic gets on the Sudeten Germans though, yeah
Germans might call it unlawful exodus of millions blamed for crimes of a slim minority, Czechs might call it as an inevitable consequence of a century of clashes and, you know, the dismemberment of our freedom and danger to independence
It's an uncomforable topic even when Germans are not involved, so
I can thing of two things that Czech people are somewhat sensitive about
First, it would be the Beneš decrees and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from Czechoslovakia after the war, the second would be the invasion of Warsaw pact armies in 1968
Speaking of the former, the Czech interpretation sees it as a necessary consequence of german irredentism and the crimes of Nazi Germany, the German interpretation sees it a crime that was done on civilians, many of whom did not support the Nazis
I agree
In fact, the only slightly awkward conversations I've had with someone abroad about history were with Russians
I don't think most people are really salty about history anymore, but the Soviet occupation of 1968 is still a living memory for some
Otherwise, talking about the old wars, paradoxically, makes me feel hopeful about today, because if people from two countries that used to be at war can now sit together and drink beer, then something must be going well
EDIT: Fixed the year
Nah you get off the hook for this one of course
We'll criticise you enough when it comes to facilitating tax avoidance
People from two different countries were drinking beer together even during the times these countries were at war
It was 1968, but you are right
Yeah, you're right, embarassing
I genuinely mistyped
It’s ok, I remember it because of the eights
1938: Munich agreement
1948: victory February (communism in power in Czechoslovakia)
And 1968
Probably because of the diet
If I am not mistaken Central European countries like Germany have significantly more cases of esophageral, stomach and bowel cancer that say Greece or Italy
I guess it depends on why you are speeding
I am gonna go ahead and admit that I am driving faster than a speed limit on a highway (obviously when the road is clear, safe and the traffic is mild), but not because I have places to be, but because I enjoy driving a little faster
So I would take the time out instead of a fine every time
Honestly speaking, knowing that I could just stand on a side of a road, have a smoke and browse reddit for an hour wouldn't deter me from speeding again
Do I understand it correctly that they have a big display there showing when you can leave
I don't know why, but it looks hilarious
Switzerland too
I think the three strike rule is a pretty good deterrent
Three speeding tickets and you can wave your license goodbye for a year
We already have something like that for speeding 20 km/h+ in a city or 30 km/h+ out of a city
For 40/50 km/h+ you can get a driving ban for up to a year on your first offense
But one of the best deterrents that we inadvertently already have is the quality of our highways
State of some literally doesn't allow speeding unless you have no regard for your vehicle
Also, to clarify, when I say I am speeding, I don't mean I am doing 200 in a 130 zone
I am talking 140 - 150 and of course there is some leeway until your speeding becomes worthy of cops' time
140 - 150 usually isn't, not on the highway anyway
We have this thing called "poslední zvonění" (last ringing) where you wear costumes (soldier, worker, witch, whatever
) And stand in front of some school and spray vinegar and paint stuffs on kids' faces (appropriate stuffs like the name of your class, hearts, etc
) with lipstick
Nothing harmful, noone complains
I liked planning my way to school beforehand so I wouldn't get sprayed and painted on felt like an assassin
Yeah, calling police there is a bomb in the building
And it is happening whole academic year
Except the beginning when no tests are being written,

K98 stojí pouze 15k, to jde :D
Danny DeVito had few Czech lines in some movie and he learnt it very well that you cannot tell it's not his language
But there are no more significant roles in Czech because it's really hard to learn for foreigners
If the actor speaks well and tries not to speak with his accent, ok, but otherwise no please
I don't remember movies where they tried Czech really, only now I remember one single line in the last Spiderman when they were supposed to be in Prague and some extra told him in Czech that he dropped (the pivotal) glasses, but none of my friends understood her, we were just confused why this sentence wasn't subtitled and WTF and it took time to realize it was supposed to be Czech sentence
No idea if it was Czech or foreign girl but it was really butchered - and they should keep English
looks to me it is either some Russian like gibberish or a basic three words sentence from second chapter of beginners language book
I mean, to be fair, this is what French people tell me all the time, too, and I'm not even an actor
In Anthropoid the actors spoke English, but they got the accent pretty spot on, I was afraid they were going to do some pseudorussian abomination
I can't think of a foreign movie where anyone speaks Czech, maybe except for a few lines in Saving Private Ryan (but those were actual Czech people), but in video games, the Czech language gets absolutely butchered pretty much every time
The worst offender that comes to mind is the latest Deus Ex, which takes place in Prague
If it was a line or two, I wouldn't care, but since there is a lot of Czech dialogue, it makes me cringe a lot
I know it's japanese, but damn is it funny and kinda good at the same time
My sister watched this show and she was very mad by their Czech
She told me that there are also a lot of mistakes when they write something
Yup
We say "Dobrý" nebo "Dobrý den", meaning Good day
Essentially everywhere except for towns and cities
When you're hiking, but also just walking through a village
Explains the weird looks I've been getting from people when I greeted them when walking by, in a small town
I'm more familiar with people saying "Ahoj" than "Dobrý den" while I'm cross country skiing and also while canoeing
On water and snow yes, but like when you are hiking people(and me) usually say dobrý den
When I go up to the mountain Kleť everyone says "ahoj" ("hey"), except for elderly people and families
and some people don't say anything at all
Prime Minister who is currently being prosecuted by the police for fraud with EU subsidies and investigated for number of further crimes while also having around 30% in polls
It's insane
Still a thing here
A lot of people say they do it "for kids to have fun" (and usually just torture the carps, my little brother once straight up poisoned them - he poured them the washing powder to "eat") and it is terrible, especially if they keep the carps for like day or even more
And considering they already were fished out the ponds long ago and sold in huge cisterns, starving for who knows how long, packed with all the other carps and then taken home most times in plastic bag and in the end, they are lucky if the person is actually able to kill them quickly and on the first try
I don't like this tradition and we personally (I'm always with my parents on Christmas) don't do that luckily (they are some attempts from my dad but I just throw huge fit that he won't block the bathroom with carps for days so we can't even bath, so
Not just any film
Try some 80s porn, it was also dubbed this way
Aren't these both things common in whole Europe
And I thought we have premature Christmas when all shops start selling decorations in November
Oh he is trying to
He also shipped a witness in this case - his own son - to Crimea and then to Switzerland so the police wouldn't find him
That sounds like something I'd be very uncomfortable with
Here it's handshake for everyone
Yeah, that's pretty much it
I don't know the extent since I didn't really watch any, but I saw some clips from such movies and it was a thing
Well, I know it's not common in Spain, but that's because they don't have the sauna culture (because of the warmer weather I believe)
But do you go to sauna
Before the Ausgleich nonsense, the whole country was called the Austrian Empire or just Austria
Idk, just a thought, but what about no alcohol in blood while driving
Ok, so the comment was about not going to sauna at all
I was thinking that you are going there fully clothed (or with swimsuits which is even worse)
Veselé Vánoce a šťastný nový rok
Veselé Vánoce
Pije jako Dán (He drinks like a Dane) - Someone who is drinking too much alcohol and behaves inappropriately
Španělská vesnice (Spanish village) - Something you are totally unfamiliar with or confuses you
Švédská trojka (Swedish threesome) - Basically a threesome
Čínská kvalita (Chinese quality) - something of a very poor quality
Americký úsměv (American smile) - a wide smile showing bright white teeth
Jednou za Uherský rok (Once every Hungarian year) - when something with a repeating nature happens after a very long time
Ruský kapesník (Russian tissue) - Sneezing into your bare palm
(Added the last two in an edit)
"That's a spanish village for me" means I don't understand that
I have no idea where it originated, but I believe germans have the same saying, just with czechs (czech village)
We have plenty more, but this was the first that came to my mind
We have few
"To be Scottish" means to be cheap and greedy, "Drinks like Dane" means to drink a lot, "It's all Spanish village to me" means I know nothing about this and others
*Odejít po anglicku* (leave in English way) - leave without saying goodbye
*Mít se jako pánbůh ve Frankrajchu* (have youself like lord the god in Frankreich) - like a pig in the rye, live in luxury
I think it's older than that
I've heard it from a plenty of older people
We have the same thing but with Oklahoma
never heard this one, where are you from
Northern Moravia near Jeseníky, but maybe it's not that common in general
propably, I'm from southern Moravia but I will ask my friends if they know it or if it is just Jeseníky thing lol
What
Orban is a thug and criminal who belongs behind bars

Shy FX - Original Nuttah
For all you who wonder how UK + Jamaican accent sounds like
I woke up after a very long afternoon nap and turn on the news on TV
I could not comprehend a single word
Since I'm living in dorms, I meet people from every corner of the republic and sometimes I understand Slovaks more than someone from my country, but we always find some way to understand each other
Often when in a film or a show from the US they try speaking Czech it takes me few sentences to recognize it's supposed to be Czech
From my head I can think of examples like Jane the virgin or The Vampire Diaries
In these cases it really didn't sound like Czech at first, and even the word order was a bit off (when the wrote something) and also some mistakes in translation but yeah, can't really blame them hah
Yeah, my dad is expert with this
Once he was speaking with some Hungarian guy and for 30 minutes
He doesn't speak any other language than Czech, so I have no idea, how they were communicating, but my grandpa was always saying, that alcohol connects people
From what I've heard, pretty much, yeah
You will end up sweeping the streets in an orange vest
The same, or garbage man or "You'll be digging holes".
Before they closed down all the mines we had in my region we used to say that if you don't study well you will end up working as a miner
Same in Czech, "budeš kopat kanály".
I think we will all end up digging trenches
You know what, I never thought about it that way
brb, dropping out of law school
I think we will experience another war in Europe during our life time
There won't be enough machinery to dig all the trenches
Before some high school exchange with Danish students these guys were curious if we have electricity in our country and were told by their parents not to eat home made food because of hygiene
(Paradox: I stayed in let’s say very alternative life-style family that lived in semi-squat with many pets and dogs living in the house as well)
No, we are not Russains nor Germans, we don't speak any of those languages
No, Czechoslovakia is not a country anymore
Yes, we are civilized place like THE REST OF THE FUCKING WORLD FUCKING AMERICANS
It seems that americans think that there can't be civilization anywhere in the world excecpt the USA lol
You don't?

In czech it ist a toast And not anything liek thank you

A good move, if you are an anti-vaxxer you’re a moron
To be honest I like it
I don't understand people who don't do research or if they do research the 'research' is only from Google and articles they won't confirm themselves
It's like flat earthers but it kills children instead of humiliating yourself
Also
I'm 13 so take this with a grain of salt I don't know shit about this stuff just saying what I think about it from what I know
Couscous, the semolina pasta, is called kuskus in czech
But word 'kus' means also 'a piece'. So some genius translated kuskusový salát (couscous salad) as piece piece salad
We have a Camembert-style cheese called Hermelín, which is also the name for ermine fur
And one restaurant translated fried Hermelín as fried ermine
I live in dorms and usually through summer holidays there are mostly foreign students and staff can't speak English that well, but they try
For example, one guy wanted to say "Be right back
" And wrote "I will be soon" instead
Also I've heard, that they once wrote "...toilet will be constipated
" instead of "...this will clog the toilet
In Czech it's Smrtonosná past (lethal trap) and people always confuse it with lethal weapon

Never heard that Prague was a "party" destination
(And I live 50 km away from it) Could someone please explain the claim to me
This is probably the best idea ever
You know, we have beautiful architecture everywhere in the city centre
You don’t have to puke all over it and scream like a banshee when you get out of a bar in the middle of the night
Most of the bars/pubs are overpriced anyway
Just go see the Prague Castle, then buy alcohol in a local shop and go get wasted to the Petřín hill, like everyone else does lol
And for other Czechs who live outside of Prague
Go visit it now while it's not overflowing with foreign tourists, it might be once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
Just go see the city centre on a weekend night (especially Národní Třída)
It’s disgusting, I found it hard to believe coming from a small town
I mean part of the problem is them being expats and not just immigrants as anyone else
'real low drinking age'? Its 18
I think thats just normal number across europe
Oh yeah it's not as empty as it was few months ago, still not as extremely packed as pre-covid tho
I'm not a local either, just really enjoyed the city when I was there around July iirc
Even better are the Russian memorabilia stores, they are oh so great
Who doesn't love buying Russian stuff in a completely unrelated country
It's like going to Britain and buying the French flag as a souvenir
In Czech republic, they usually sell fake weed (illegal even when fake but cops can't be bothered when everyone is doing it) or matryoshka dolls
Well, this year there were only two days with temperatures above 25 °C so far here, and that's quite below average
Right now it is 24 °C, which is actually nice
It's colder here (than  last 5 years)
And I am glad it's like that 23°C max is ideal
Not hot, but still comfortable warm
The weather was so beautiful today
The sun was shining while it was raining from a giant grey cloud
The temperature was around 25°C. But tomorrow
oh boy
It’s gonna be 30°C. I’m gonna melt
It's about 25 degrees here (77° F) and sunny but last weeks thunderstorms caused some flash floods in some places, the Vltava cascade is full of water and still the weather is really volatile
Hot but not unusual for a beginning of summer holidays
Nobody died so far and the floods are already over
Some millions czk in property damage and a few dozen people without homes ://
Oh hell yes
Are you going to tell somewhere if you'll decide to do it
Like I really would like to read it
We have a saying that every Czech is a musician (Co Čech to muzikant)
Shame I am totally tone-deaf
I read somewhere that there are two types of poles - those born with a bottle in their hand who drink all their life and die of lung cancer and those born with cigarette in their hand who smoke all their life and die of liver cirrhosis
I think it fits czech people more
Being tone deaf never stopped me from professing my fondness of alcoholic delirium through a rude song
[Karviná] Consistently voted worst place to live by various metrics, it's still characterized by the heavy industry and coal mining that raised the town out of obscurity in the 19th century
Orlova, Karvina, Havířov and honestly the entire county
That looks like every city in my county, so you don’t have it that bad
They also has the highest amount of COVID cases in the republic
What a place to live in
I personally find Kladno really ugly (haven't yet had the pleasure of visiting Karviná) and some people say that they don't like Bruntál, Nymburk, Most, Rakovník and Hrubý Jeseník
Honestly the entire
district is ugly in general
u wot
Ye i work in usti and its really digusting
to be fair Ostrava most likely looks more shit but the smog hasn't lifted since the 90s so we can't really see how shit it looks
It looks like the unrevealed sections of a map
I mean some places in the Karvina District are fine, but generely nothing special
I think europeans are much more calm and peaceful
Boi you don't have to blame the entire right wing
It's the republican party
European right is much different from american
Article 1
(1) The Czech Republic is a sovereign, unitary, and democratic state governed by the rule of law, founded on respect for the rights and freedoms of man and of citizens

Česká republika je svrchovaný, jednotný a demokratický právní stát založený na úctě k právům a svobodám člověka a občana
Česká republika dodržuje závazky, které pro ni vyplývají z mezinárodního práva
The Czech Republic is a sovereign, united and democratic state based on the respect of law and freedoms of man and citizen
The Czech Republic follows the commitments which are given to her by international law
Article 1
(1) The Czech Republic is a sovereign, unitary, and democratic state governed by the rule of law, founded on respect for the rights and freedoms of man and of citizens
(2) The Czech Republic shall observe its obligations resulting from international law
some czech(?) politicians should read this
I have a question on german - what does the mansait (manzeit, I dont know) means
My colleagues from germany is saying that almost from 9am to 2pm
WTF is that
We have "Středa, je ho tam třeba" (Its wednesday, he is needed over there)- meaning that "your GF needs a dick"
This is exactly whats happening at my workplace :D
Everyone in Egypt wanted a photo with me
Maybe because I’m blonde
I’m not really sure
But I have a photo with an entire female class somewhere
Actually your memory on acid can get kinda loopy
Probably anything involving our president and alcohol (or [these] [two] ) I don't know if anyone else finds them Czech enough, but that is something I would show to someone if they asked what are Czechs like
There's plenty beautiful things about Britain and noone can claim otherwise with any seriousness
But you do have to admit that the drunk thug culture is overwhelmingly common among people in Britain
I have personal experience with British tourists in many countries I was to and the drinking problem is very prevalent
He joked with Putin about "liquifiyng journalists", so one supporter made him a wooden gun with Becherovka supplier (Becherovka being Zeman's favourite liquor) and on the side there is written ( 'on journalists')
I live in a town with a Hydrogen cianide factory, I would feel safer if we have just a simple nuclear reactor here
All of them, to be honest, but the surprise that the Hussite Wars were a thing is by far the most egregious
The assassination of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich
He was a chief of the protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and a big time cunt
He was called the butcher of Prague for a reason
He was assassinated by Czechoslovak paratroopers who were flown over Bohemia by the British
He was the 2nd highest ranked nazi official in the protectorate with only Hitler being above him
LOADS, from Hussite wars to Velvet Revolution, if you tell any person outside of Czech Republic about it you'll just get weird looks
There's a movie about this, right
I believe youtube advertised it to me
The spanish civil war(s) is the main theme of one of the most popular books of all time, I wouldn't say it's that unknown to people
El ministerio del tiempo demonstrated me that there's a huge period of Spanish history I know shit of
A few carlist wars, coups d'êtat, Bourbons replaced by an Italian guy, all this stuff
Well, at least I knew about "the desired king", liberal revolution and reaction in early XIX century
Actually the Turkish independence war is an unknown fact itself, you don't even need to go into details
Halifax explosion is not that unknown, because of its scale you will surely find it in any "sensationalist educational" material, you know what I mean, "the biggest catastrophes", "the unwanted records", like this
Why don't you link this  ?
Eating on Christmas day, you're not supposed to eat anything before the Christmas dinner (so that you can see the Golden piggy
It's a saying for children, so that if they would not eat anything before the Christmas dinner, they would see a golden pig
You should visit Cyprus
I didn't know it is possible but they have even more strays than Greece
Our language has a letter "Ř" ([r̝]) which is pretty unique to our country, not even slovakian, a language most similar to ours, has it
Czechs will often try to get foreigner to say "řeřicha",  since it's a very hard letter to pronounce correctly even for many Czechs
It's also the reason why many Czech kids need to go to a speech therapist
I'm not sure how unique it is to our langue, but we can make entire words with no vowels
We have a whole tongue twister based around that "Strč prst skrz krk
" Our longest word without vowel is "scvrnkls" with eight letters
What's also quite different about our langue is that when we put C and H together it's considered it's own letter "CH" ([x])
I live in the Czech Republic and we have the letter ř Ř. I'm pretty sure none other than us has it
Czech can use some consonants (r,l,m) as syllabic and therefore function as a syllable nucleus (usually a vowel), so sentences without vowels aren't unusual
A common Czech tongue twister is Strč prst skrz krk (stick your finger through your mouth), but even more bizarre creations exist;
Blb vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
A perfectly valid sentence
Ve have "měsíc" with lower case M for "natural satellite oribiting planet - like moon" and "Měsíc" with capital M for "Earth moon"
You have it wrong
The longest word without wovel is "čtvrtsmršť" with 10 letters
Zdrh krt zkrz drn zprv zhltl čtvrthrst zrn
Čtvrthrst is longer by one letter
It means quarter-hand
My teacher said it is because peasants rised cows and nobles ate beef
Czech have this too
But as per usual it's not as simple as adding -je or -tje
The suffixes are different for different genders, different endings in the base word etc
Dům - domeček (house, small house)
Kočka - kočička (cat
Pes - pejsek (dog
Kuře - kuřátko (chicken
And sometimes you can even go few levels further and make up words like pejsánek, pejsáneček for even smaller cuter dogs
Happy cake day
Happy cake day
Is it actually used anywhere or is it artificially created to be the longest word without a vowel
It's actually quite funny to see people struggle with the tongue twister after growing up here
It uses very basic words "strč" put, "prst" is finger, "skrz" is through something and "krk" is neck
So it's, "put a finger through a neck". Very basic to us but a nightmare to look at
Ale to nic neznamená xd to reálně nikdy nikdo nepoužije xd
PIE had dual, so all descendants had dual in some form
Czech lost its dual in the high middle ages, retaining only a few forms of "irregular plural" for eyes, hands, legs, breasts etc
It is challenging a bit for me to say
It is a compound of two words "čtvrt" and "smršť". The first means "quarter" and the second means something like "whirlwind".
I would say it's easy to pronounce by itself but when it's in a sentence it more difficult
I think, no
I prefer keeping changing times which is more natural (you have sunrise closer to the time when you wake up), but generally summer time is better for me (more sunshine/daylight in the afternoon after work)
Winter time is the original, so winter time
But it would be best if it is as it is
I like my light not at 4 am
So summer time sounds great
Even with standard time it was dark when I went to school in winter, so whatever that it gets light bit later
I'd love it to be the standard, so called winter, time because I hate getting up early
Winter
I can live without late summer sunsets
The idea of having to wake up before sunrise the whole winter
I hate it
Standard time (winter)
People who prefer to wake up and go to work earlier can do so, but those who hate it cannot do the opposite
I find the seasonal change annoying, so I'm in favor of abolishing it
We are mainly doing it for health reasons so the decision which time to keep should be up to specialists not common people
Also, one hour move this or that way doesn't significantly help anyway
Some people here say the sun comes out at 3-4am in summer
And 4-5am is better
It sucks just as much
And during winter it can be dark by 5-6pm, while in summer it's still pretty bright at 9
One hours does shit to help
Get yourself some blinds
I just moved and my new bedroom gets so much more sunlight in the morning and I love it
Waking up has been so easy since
You have daylight until 23
The latest sunset here in late June is around 21:15 already with summer time
With winter time all year long it would be at 20:15
Yeah, but here only like within 15 minutes after sunset you can still read, but at 22h (after 45 minutes) it is practically dark - only at the west, the sky is not fully black but dark blue
400 m² is not that big
It was actually Gorbachev who stopped our bolsheviks from basically gunning down protesting students
There absolutely were these tendencies in the party until the end
God bless him
Actually no, but I've been in France only for a week or so
Here in Czechia, I often go to so called hypermarkets, because the variety of foods is much bigger than in small ones
And one of the things annoying me in say central Vienna is that all shops are really small
Bratislava
London or Moscow
1990s Ústí nad Labem or Most would be interesting
Palermo, no discussion
And if they if they set it in the 80s (Including murder of Falcone and stuff), I'd buy new computer just to play that game
Does it have to be just one city in one country
It could be more fun to have multiple
Most probably
Even shady looking neighborhoods where the protagonist can have his 1st safehouse
Also traffic would be fun, and a subway you can use
Ah yes, Semir Gerkhan as the main cop antagonist
1st quest, steal yourself some Polonez
Like
all of the old Prague centre
Overpriced food, scamming taxi drivers and exchange offices, kitschy "street artists" on the Charles Bridge, souvenir shops full of ushankas with Soviet emblems, private museums of wax figurines or whatever that have nothing to do with local culture
don't get me wrong, there's still a bunch of really nice historical buildings and things to see, but the commercial zone that surrounds them is hell
Don't go there without some prior research and common sense
You can go only a few hundred meters away to some side street and find lunch that is 4 times cheaper, etc
Whole centre of the capital city of Prague
Including food, souveniers, transportation and especially historical sites
Let's no forget to mention the marijuana products and imagery in even single one of these *gift shops*. It's ridiculous
I was showing around a friend from Japan recently and haven't been to the center myself, since like high school and I was flabbergasted
It's awful
The gift shops look all the same and are on every single corner
Yes, the sights are great, but the areas surrounding them are an eyesore
I wouldn't have though I would care, but I genuinely found the state of the historical center quite sad
I hope that coronavirus help change the abomination that tourism in Prague have become
It is an opportunity to let tourist traps go bankrupt, and to rebuild them from scratch
Airbnbs flats are already changing to long-time rent, and rent prices are decreasing
That is win for locals, both rents and apartment prices were getting out of hand before the pandemic
My dad is Turkish and whenever we visit Istanbul he immediately starts talking in Turkish so that we don't get ripped off
It's funny
I actually kinda got the "lonely Paris" experience - by going there during the big public transportation strikes last December :D Now I can't imagine coming back at a time with a normal amount of tourists, I think I'd have even more of a shock
Oh yes, and hemp flavoured absinthe, the traditional Czech drink of choice
I had to run straight across the Old Town Square on my way between classes in different faculty buildings several times a week, and I kind of developed a hatred for everything to do with mass tourism in just a few years
People from places where public transportation is really bad, so they don't even think of it as an option
To be fair, the system has its quirks too, I've seen a good deal of very confused tourists getting scolded in Czech by ticket inspectors for not stamping their tickets or buying the wrong type
I mean it wasn't intentional, we were visiting family in western France for Christmas and just spent a few days in Paris along the way, but I guess most other tourists cancelled because of the strike
I thought there would be still quite a lot of people for Christmas time, isn't that supposed to be a romantic thing
I don't wear sandals, socks or not and never been in Croatia by car or bus
Everyone likes cheese
Cheese is life, cheese is love
Are you thinking raw beef perhaps
Raw pork is dangerous to my knowledge (parasites)
Not just nordic
I hate it too
But when I think about it, I'm pale blond with blue eyes, almost all of my furniture is from IKEA, I don't really like people being close to me
I also really like hockey
I guess I just might be nordic
Czechs also think it's their trait
I guess almost whole central Europe thinks that suprisingly
Well . . . been looking for some czech comments
and I found none
So I guess in the films we just don't exist
They alredy have the Germans for the beer trope
Is it because Slovenia is the most developed country from the Eastern Bloc, but a lot of people still thinks it is a "shithole"? It is the similar to Borat, where every "Kazakh" character actually speaks in different language, but average American viewers cannot tell the difference, because to them it is some "third-world language".
Only movie including Denmark I remember is the one where some American girl marries the prince
Lodz moment
The name is strange, because according to one old Czech folk tale, there were 2 brothers, who led Czechs in Czechia, Czech and Lech
Lech then went to east and founded Poland
Maybe there's some relation
Also the tale says something about third brother and that they came from Balkans
But it's just some folk tale
Why Latvia, tho
Hungarians are from outer space
That would explain why no one can understand them
Yeah, the old chroniclers had to take the names from somewhere and since Poland was the closest independend slavic country, it could explain the names
a - but without the serif, it's basically a flipped 6
In school we teach α
That's when a turns into ə.
Sure, but that's cursive, isn't it
I stopped writing cursive when I got into high school
In Czech Silesia, we sometimes joke about wanting the rest, which is now in Poland, but it isn't really national joke
Just small regional joke
I personally “joke” about taking Silesia and Lusatia back
Would be nice
You actually care about Eurovision
In my country nobody gives a fuck
Jist curious
Ah shit, here we go again
What about Moravia reclaiming you (only North, but Alps aren't that important)
I wanna Great Moravia back
But you wouldn't be able to change sides here
Would it even be fun without helping to start/starting war and then changing side to the attacked countries
Jo, mimochodem nechcete ho zpátky
Přihodíme i prezidenta a jeho mluvčího zadarmo
Yeah, we also sometimes joke about wanting Polish Silesia, but mostly we Czech Silesians do
I’m from Prague and I’d take it back too
Not even Ireland
You can have Brno
It was one of the top topics yesterday
But then again, we had a large building fire that killed several people, so it obviously wasn’t the very top one
They had foreign relations expert to talk about it
All I know is that they arrested a close person to the opposition candidate and that she is hiding somewhere, that they minimalised public transport, so people can’t protest, they’re arresting people, and that around 40 % voted before the election date
They also banned independent people so that they can’t see what’s going on
I personally think that the results are rigged af
EDIT: Belarusians, who live in Czechia, had a small protest in front of the Belarusian embassy while they waited in the line to the voting room
It’s so angering, honestly
He gave himself almost 80 %. How dare he
When I see what he’s doing to your beautiful country, I just wanna punch him in his pig face
And there’s no way in hell she got only 7 %. Wtf
Btw, what are your thoughts on the opposition candidate
P. S. With your English, I think a lot of employers would want another Belarusian
I heard about the internet
It’s awful
But also laughable because it doesn’t work when people use VPN, which is such an easy tool to use
It somewhat reminds me of 1984 by G. Orwell
But the book was meant to be a warning, not a guide
Maybe you can overthrow him like we overthrew the commies
Please, stay safe
Why is their "small coffee" so huge
The concept of home owner associations and how much power they apparently have over what you do with your property
No clothes hanging outside
No basketball hoops
Fines for having a damn VEGETABLE PATCH
I have no idea how common those rules actually are, but when I see articles about them online, it's pretty confusing
Also super specific dresscodes in schools, I've never seen anyone care so much about what kids/teenagers (let's be honest, girls
) wear
Everybody keeps saying how insane the drinking age is, but they don’t actually know shit about the reason
It’s biological
Consuming too much alcohol before you reach 21 years of age is fucking bad for you
We have an all-volunteer military too and no one really gives a shit about it
If anything, that makes the people who join less of a "hero", they voluntarily chose a dangerous occupation for the money
What developed countries even still have a military service, besides Israel
Not everything
At least bottled beer looks quite small to me (like a kids version)
Or Serbia or Lithuania
Haven't been to the US, but I've never seen anyone flying more flags than those guys
Serbia is the winner in Europe, I'd say
Yeah
I've always loved flags, too
When I was 7, I knew the flags of all the countries in the world
The only difference between communism and other ideas is that other ideas didn't lead to 100+ million corpses and devastation of dozens of countries
Trust me on that one
be glad that your snow speaks Finnish
My words exactly
Most times, when I speak to Americans, I just have a weird feeling that they're only being polite
It's something in the way they speak
Like the words they say are kind, but their tone of voice sounds kinda insincere
There is literally a notable difference between how your body deals with alcohol consumption when you’re 16 and when you’re 21
Can't speak for Germany, but the closest thing to this that we have on our census is "nationality" and it's optional
Most people don't even fill it in
In fact, I think that gathering information about race is illegal in most European countries
Though don't quote me on that
Can confirm
Disregarding Pa, I rather like kg/cm^2 (technical atmosphere) which is very close to the standard atmosphere
Probably Rožnov pod Radhoštěm, Velké Losiny or Písek [*literally translates to sand*]
I think Brno
Even though we make fun of it, the city center is beautiful
It’s also a really short train ride from Český Kras (beautiful cave system)
And it’s definitely not full of foreign turists
I'd say Mikulov, it's quite the way away (about 4-5 hours from Prague), but it's a really beautiful town
I loooove Bamberg and the beer
We went there during advent (a few weeks before Christmas)
The architecture is so beautiful
Jeseníky mountains is a hidden gem that nobody outside of Czechia and maybe few Poles really know about
Šukat
In Czech it means to fuck
In Polish it means to search
Droga
In Czech--Drug
In Polish--road
This is not a word, but it's fascinating to me nonetheless, compare the Japanese `ん` and European `n`, they're so frickin similar and represent the same sound
Body - points in czech
Host - guest in czech
And example by pornhub: Horní Police ~ upper shelf in czech x horny police
In colloquial Czech people frequently say "Fakt, jo
" meaning roughly "Oh, really
". The pronunciation is very similar to fuck you
Foreigners listening to Czech conversation might think we swear all the time
"(Die) Kurve" sound like "Kurva"
(Die) Kurve= curve
Kurva=slut
Mbabaram for "dog" is
you guessed it, "dog"
Same here
*Pusa* is "mouth/kiss" and ***pusy*** are "mouths/kisses".
If we're talking about our words for cat, don't forget to mention "mačka". It means a cat in Slovak, but in Czech, it means a crampon
Also Finnish seitsemän looks very similar but once again, there is no proved relationship between those langauges
Also list - leaf in Czech
Otrok in Czech means slave too
It's not Czech but Slovak
In Czech departures (of buses, trains) are "odjezdy". Also "autobusov" is Slovak, in Czech it's "autobusů".
Yeah, there Is plenty more
Pass read as [pa:s]  means belt
Two [tu] And ten Are indexing pronoun in czech
More doesn't mean anything related to moře (sea) etc
Well, we have our own language (Czech), but we have a lot of news about Germany and Poland
You know, I think it's better
We need only one big country to see all bullshits of our president (stupid idiot with dementia) and prime minister (thief, murderer and ex-agent of communist police)
I hate them
Ireland
Language wouldn't be that much of a problem as my English isn't that bad and I am trying to learn Irish, but there are other things holding me back home
Finland
I love the nature, the weather, for the first time in my life I would be the outgoing person in the group, and t education system is a dream
Right here
Somewhere in France, closer to sea the better
Awesome language and I could use a different setting
No, it's just a hobby
But just the idea of relocating to different country is scary to me
I am not very adventurous type
I do have commitments, but who knows how it will be in the future
I bet he felt safe
Like who speaks Irish
Five people
Ten
Here in Czechia we are using [German deck] and French too
Never seen them
We call the French ones "normal" or "standard" (didn't even know they are French)
We also use the German ones (which I also didn't know were German) which we call "mariášové" which is derived from the card game "mariáš" (funny thing I learned today, the name comes from the French word "Mariage", so we use German cards to play a game with French origins but use French cards for almost everything else)
We have our own Bohemian deck, vastly similar and coming from Bavarian (south german) deck
Fun fact, Bavaria (Bayern) was Bohemia’s best friend for a long time in the middle ages
We use it too (Czechia)
I think something like that is in Czechia at the age of 65
But I could be wrong so correct me
Here they have to do it when they are 65, then 68 and then every two years
I think for people that are getting in the senior age around now even that won't be necessary
The grocery deliveries are pretty much everywhere
We just need to teach our moms to make few clicks
For me it's below 10°C during longer stays outside (let's say 30+ minutes)
Also it depends on alcohol level in my blood, physical activity or wind
30°C is my limit
Anything below that is very uncomfortable for me
Given the fact I live in Central Europe, I was apparently born at very wrong place
20+ is t-shirt weather
15-20 is denim jacket weather
5-15 is denim jakcet with a hoodie weather
5 and lower is I should've bought something warmer than a denim jakcet weather
So that would be cold for me
When my old diesel has problem to start
So below 8°C
I'm The type of person who likes it colder so around 20C is comfy for me
Below 10C I usually wear somewhat thick hoodie and below 0 thin hoodie + jacket and gloves or hat depending on the temperature
I'd say under 8, generally speaking
It's 6 degrees right now and I just started wearing an autumn/winter coat this week
For me it entirely depends on what the temperature was yesterday
Czechia confirms
European Union, the map of Europe and Germany for some reason
Ha, in my place we didn’t even have snow this year
Gatekeeping coldness like a pro
In Czech we wouldn't use "having big balls" (mít velký koule), we would only say "having balls" (mít koule)
And it would mean being brave
I believe in the party I vote for, but of course some members of it can be corrupt or incapable
No one is a saint
I was unironically a hardcore edgy libertarian in my teens/early 20s, so I voted for our small and irrelevant libertarian party once or twice with great enthusiasm
Later on, I believed in the Pirate Party for some time
Nowadays it would definitely be a lesser evil kinda vote, and it always is in presidential elections
I don't believe in politicians, so it is always the lesser evil
It is always a bit of both
Of course there are parts of the party that I don't quite like, making it the 'lesser evil' - but still I believe in the party as a whole, else I'd just sit the elections out
I don't know, if that counts, but I agreed with their program, because it looked doable, so there was little chance of empty promises
I didn't believe, that they would win, but I agreed with their opinion
Lesser evil
Parties that align with my beliefs the most are too small to succeed (meaning nowhere near 5% of votes necessary to get in the Parliament)
I always had that kinda "I have no clue what am I doing here" from Pirates
That sounds pretty cool, I always wondered what it's like living in a country with less than 1 mil people
But then, I live in a city of 400k and I don't even know my municipal politicians at all, maybe I just go to the wrong saunas
Yeah IDK, they're bland centrists, I guess I thought they would be a part of some huge pan-European reform movement, but that just didn't go anywhere
About 25%.
Generally seen as bad habit, but generally accepted
way more than that probably, whenever i go outside there are tens of people smoking, in restaurants basically everyone is outside because smoking indoors was banned
I live in Czech republic
I have a long weird history with Czech republic
It started after the end of the cold war, when some czech people came to my small town to work in factories
Then I became intrigued with the country
Came when I was 17, and for some reason it keeps pulling me back
"Where are you from
"The Czech Republic
"Ah, Czechoslovakia
For the love of god, don't say that Polka originated in Poland
Calling our country "Eastern European". It's central European
I might be ignorant here, but what exactly is wrong with this
Finland is geographically in Scandinavia, isn't it
even better yet Czechia
yep, even worse we have a fuck ton of memorials as well and no one says "Well I can't visit the CZ because there are too many memorials for concentration camps
" fucking dumb honestly
totally understand, reddit likes that dad joke with czech check
I've heard way too many times as a kid that the Roma originate from Romania
Same with us
Calling us Eastern European or outright Russian triggers me to no end
sure they do, time ago I read some interview with Slovakian ambassador here in Prague, he said something like once per week there is a meeting of people from Slovakia and Slovenia embassy where they just exchange wrongly addressed mail
(and have some beer and booze because it is in Prague after all
Czechia FTW
To answer your question, both Czechia and Czech Republic are completely valid/official names
You can choose whichever you like more
No, Czech Republic is still the official name, as is Czechia
Czechia was accepted as an official shorter version a few years ago, since a lot of the countries around us are also republics but have other, more convenient names (e.g. people call it Slovakia and not the Slovak Republic)
However, the name only partially caught on and a lot of people don't like it, including me
I'll keep calling us by the longer name
And to answer your first question, no, it's not the same thing
Czechoslovakia split into two separate countries in January 1993 - the Czech Republic and Slovakia
Czechs, all the time, intentionally
Prague people to Brno people: North Slovakia
Oh, okay, thanks for the explanation
I always assumed that everything north of the Baltic was Scandinavia
It wasn't for a long time but nowadays it's official
People aren't usually very angry when you call it that, but they might consider it a bit rude
Yeah we didn't create that flair
Borrowed from Polish and used without regard for actual Czech word rules
For example, some countries are female some male and some neutral
To Německo (Neut), ta Amerika (fem), (actually can't come up with male on the spot but it exists)
In Czech Čechy or Česko is neutral
However, in English, it's used as female
That is my personal problem with it
Another one is that we have been a part of many, many, many countries over the span of our existence and we like to show off that we are on our own now
That is quite easy when you just add Republic on the end and are done with it
But nooo NATO just HAD to have a shorthand name
We put Czech republic as our shorthand name and said fuck it that will do, but our new politicians really wanted to help our branding by doing the great thing of adding another name to the list to add to the confusion, now you can call us any of these and are guaranteed to piss off someone
\- Bohemia
\- "Basically just another part of Eastern Europe"
\- "Basically Russia"
\- Czechoslovakia
\- Austria-hungary
\- Yugoslavia (for some fucking reason)
\- \*insert any middle eastern country because no one has any basic geographic knowledge\*
\- and now newly Czechia
Also, you know, the fact that people mistake us for Checnya REALLY doesn't help
Like when some terrorists from Chechnya a few years back bombed a public place and a bunch of idiots on twitter started going hard against the Czech republic
Even though we had fuck all to do with it
yes
sauce: am a Czech who says that all the time intentionally
love you bratia
I mean when you look into our history, we have nothing to do with Eastern Europe except for those 41 years under communism
You guys have a lot of history with it as Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was a major Eastern European power
It's because Czechs don't speak Swedish
Ten Uzbekistán.
That’s dumb
Maďarsko, but Uhry too
cool, most people living there don't tho
Czechia, in Czech it would be basically Čechia which is female
And yes I know that Czechy in polish makes sense
What I am saying is that in English saying Czechia makes none
When the crisis come ppl need to craft protective equipment to survive because state is unprepared to protect the nation
You can throw in to the sea and expand the state
Yeah, but most of what you consume is consumed in Prague
We have subway
I think only positive thing is we can work together and help each other to provide protective equipment for everyone if state was not able to
It is also scary
when the war come what we will do
Craft weapons
Shelters
>So in this perspective I'm quite positive about this
It shows that our people are eager to fight together
That's always a good thing
Yeah you are right
Definitely not 50%. I’d say 10-20% and that is in the country known for not caring about nudity
Been in Croatia, depends on which beach you're going to, usually the big beaches noone is but swim a few meters farther and basically every single one
nude beaches are still a thing here, dozens of people lying around completely naked, kinda creepy to walk through when you randomly come across it honestly
50% is too much
Yes, you'll always see 1 maybe 2, but the big majority are not
Definitely not 50%. Probably some wishful thinking by the British redditor
If a woman takes her top off while sunbathing she will generally be the only one in the group or she is prone (face down) in which case she is not actually showing anything, she just doesn't want to have lines from the straps on her back
I have a feeling that 20 years ago more girls in their 20s went topless than now; now it feels like a domain of middle-aged women
How is LEGO expensive in your country compared to your wages
I honestly like LEGO, one of the best toys kids can get these days
But in my country it is very expensive
The bigger sets range from 1000 - 3000 Kč (40€ - 120€)
For a normal job you get like 800€. I know it sounds like we are underwaged but our country is pretty cheap to live in
But since LEGO is internation product i think it sells at relatively same prices everywhere
How is it in your country
Actually median pay in Czech Republic is around 30000 kč, so ~1125€
I quickly searched for the Millennium Falcon
The price is 650€. Honestly i didn't expect such a difference
If someone was to arrive into my home for a long time, I would definitelly try to find out who is it and not only by what he himself is saying to me
It's stranger
And if it's information given to all public to find by simply putting your name into regular browser, it's not really private, everyone can see it
But without finding anything worrying, it seems weird to tell you about that
Middle quite, Early modern no problem, then nothing and the last bit also not really a problem
All written, I don't think it would be easy spoken for me since I generaly have bigger problem with spoken word
If I can name the authors and the poem without looking up in google, am I disqualified from answering
* Macbeth: unknown word here and there, but otherwise perfectly ok
* Canterbury tales: a bit more of unknown words
One quickly adapts to the spelling, and I have enough exposure to German to survive some declensions more resembling German than modern English
* Beowulf: total gibberish
Here and there I *feel* like I understand the grammatical construction, but words
very few and far between
Early Modern and Middle are doable
Beowulf is impossible for me
And Scots can be understood but I have to fill in some words that I cannot make out and hope I got the context right
I study English though, idk if it’s relevant
> Knight ther was, and that a worthy man, and then I don't really get anything, but it still looks like English more or less
From the times he sat on the horse, he was a cavalier, truth-loving, honorable, etc, and these positive qualities made him one of the most famous in the christian and arab worlds
Too lazy to translate word-by-word
I believe that the most notable holiday in Czechia is 17th of November, due to two events that happened on that day
In 1939, the Czech students protested that the Nazis closed down Czech universities
About 50 students died iirc
That’s the reason that the International students day exists
50 years later, in 1989, there was the Velvet Revolution — a peaceful attempt to overthrow the totalitarian regime we had here since 1948
It succeeded (though it was more of a symbol, the Communist party was in ruins already back then)
In conclusion, not as interesting as many pagan holidays mentioned in this thread, but really important for the Czechs
We celebrate it too in Czechia
Bonfire, music, chill-out and witch costume party for kids
Similar thing in Czech Republic
Here it’s called Morana
Yes, Pálení čarodějnic
IIRC people made a figurine of a witch/winter, threw it in a river and then burned it on a huge pyre
But I might be confusing it with another folk tradition
Now that I think about it most Czech folk traditions sound absolutely insane when we explain them to foreigners, like whipping women on Easter, or Devils, Hell and Water spirits who drown people and keep their souls are common children stories protagonists
Oh yeah, Easter (Velikonoce)
It’s mostly on the villages nowadays, but it’s about men going door by door, slap women’s butts with pomlázka (“a braided whip made from pussywillow twigs”) to make them young and get rewarded with a shot of slivovitz
Additionally, they may throw the woman into a river (or at least a bathtub)
It may sound a bit savage, but it’s mostly fun
For the men, of course
Women (especially the younger ones) hate it
Our former prime minister Bohuslav Sobotka:
Our current president Miloš Zeman:
There is also the famous interview with our minister of finances Alena Schillerová, who couldn't even understand a simple question:
[Ex- Prime Minister Sobotka]
[Sobotka's rap (remix of the previous vid)]
[President Zeman]
Now, Zeman's English is actually pretty good, but this one sentence on 5:45, to this day nobody really knows what did he meant by
whatever he said right there
[Alena Schillerová - Minister of Finance]
Shorter versions - [1] [2]
So, this is a long video, a big part of it is in Czech, but basically, she doesn't speak english that well
When she has a prepared talk, it is written phonetic Czech
Otherwise, she doesn't know what to say at all, and if you ask ger something in english, she just runs away
On her Twitter tho, she claims that she speaks fluently
And that's all I can remember from the top of my head
Of course, there is [Stanislav Řezáč] but he's not a politician
Also this [
It is mostly famous for saying “Bubble bum” instead of “Bubble gum” and for the immensely weird quotes about steaks and bubble bums
He actually used to be extremely smart and well educated man
The aging and alcoholism just counted that in the last years
Also the [pasy] riot gate
this was a giant clown fiesta
It was so big, that it is a meme for like 5 years
The expulsion of most ethnic Germans (about 1/3 of population of the country) after the WW2, especially its first "wild" phase with lynchings and mass murders (for example at least 800 civilians in the town of Postoloprty)
It was mostly seen as a just retribution for all the Nazi atrocities and German separatism that was tied to Nazism until the 1990s and is still a popular rallying issue for nationalist and communist parties today
The communist regime rule can be seen as one big atrocity too, especially the purges of 1950s.
Then there are some medieval things, for example various massacres during Hussite wars, but that can be mostly seen as a standard medieval wartime stuff nowadays - cities razed, religious opponents being executed en masse etc
Probably deportation of 2mil Germans because of "bad man with moustache", apart from that I can't really think of anything
I would add the systemic sterilizarion of gypsies during the communist rule
That's some pretty evil shit
It was being prepared and there were some unorganized attempts, but GB and USA objected against it during the Potsdam conference
There was, however, an exchange programme of citizens with Hungary later, they were stripped of most civil rights and some of the Hungarians were also dispersed inside the state, mostly to places vacated by Germans
Many Hungarians were expelled as well, it's just not remembered much
It's mostly because Slovakia had it's own independent legislation for postwar retribution, so all that happened in nowadays Czechia between 1945 and 1948 cannot be applied there
Edit: It's worth noting taht Czech retribution was one of the most severe and bloody in all of Europe, whereas Slovak was very mild
We cannot assume some moral high ground here, especially after voting another awful regime to power
I really don't feel like they deserved to be killed
I can understand moving the to Germany
But killing them
I mean most of them were probbably regular citizens
I think there is quite a big leap from not liking someone to systemic extermination
They were sterilised after already having 2-3 kids though
I am not saying it was ethically OK, but it certainly wasn't a "systemic extermination".
That's interesting
It's a bit hard to find info on this and I never really bothered to dig deeper, but now that I know what to look for it does indeed seem to be that way
Personally I think the deportation of Germans living on czechoslovakian soil directly after world war 2
Thousands of innocent civilians were brutally murdered and slaughtered for no reason, those actions were often very organized
The murderers have never been punished
Definitely the expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia after WW2
It was allowed to do ANYTHING to Germans, so people taking German babies and throwing them in the river, for example, was really common
Most fucked up thing
Trust
We trusted our western allies, ( looking at you France and Great Britain ) only to betray us at Munich
Then we turned to east and trusted Soviet Union, and they taken our freedom and we became practically a colony inside Europe
Maybe thats why we are the most atheist country in the world (by some estimates)
I feel kinda embarrased i can't think about anything for czech rep
/czechoslovakia/bohemian kingdom etc
What do you know
You did some crazy shit in WW2 too
Personally, I rank our willing participation in the Roma genocide above that
The ethnic cleansing and post-war violence were a result of previous circumstances, and while abominable, they didn't fall out of the blue sky
Meanwhile, the fact that we ran the Lety concentration camp so brutally it shocked even the Nazis, and the population invented reasons to get their Roma neighbours willy nilly into it had no justification other than that we really, really, really didn't want any filthy gypsies around
Exactly
This is way worse in its nature than the retributions after the war
And the fact that the massacres agains the Germans are probably more recognized than the ones against Roma people tells a pretty bleak picture about our own awareness of our history
I dont understand
What do you mean
The trust also led to many deaths but its kinda complicated thats why I mentioned it
Its simple to say, yeah it was that time we went and killed x men and woman, we also have those
We're much closer ;)
But I wanna
We make bonfires on April 30, children dress as witches, and in some places a figurine of a witch is burned in the bonfire
So like a mashup of pre-Christian traditions (Beltane) and Walpurgisnacht, it must be a pretty old holiday
As someone who practices witchcraft, I practice more traditions than others
Or at least I know the meanings behind them
Like Beltane (Walpurgisnacht)
Most people just burn a fake witch and do bbqs
When in reality it’s mostly a celebration of fertility and love (like a May day, which comes right after)
So yeah, I like to celebrate pagan holidays (mostly Celtic and Slav)
Yeah, this is practiced in some parts of Czechia (mostly eastern Moravia I think), but only in certain villages
The figure is called Morana or simply Smrt - Death
You mean Laurel
My favourite celebration
Wow, thanks for the award  [u/FiveDaysLate] Very cool
Syllabic r go [brrrr]
Me, abstinent Czech person who doesn't like the taste of beer, wine or any other alcohol really
A Czechperson who is a vegetarian
I know that they exist, but that doesn't mean that it's just weird
Czech that doesn't like beer
I don't drink beer
I'm Czech
I don't like alcohol
I also don't enjoy watching hockey (or any sport really)
a Czech who doesn't like beer
a czech who doesn't drink beer
Me, a Czech who doesn't like svíčková
Dude Czechia is one of the best countries for vegetarians and vegans in Europe
It could be worse
You could be enjoying hugs
Burn this heretic
beat me to it
Slunce, the Sun, is neutrum, Měsíc, the Moon, masculinum inanimatum
The Sun (Slunce) is neuter and the Moon (Měsíc) is masculine
I haven't really seen them depicted as significantly gendered entities, like in kids' books they mostly had generic smiley faces or something like that
They were never distinctly feminine, for sure, either vaguely masculine or neuter - in the same way that cartoon characters default to male unless they have a pink bow and eyelashes
The ancient Slavic religion had a Sun god depicted as masculine (Dazhbog)
To Slunce a ten Měsíc. So the Sun is "it" and the Moon is "he". The Earth (ta Země) is "she".
In language the sun is neutral (to Slunce) and the moon is male (ten Měsíc) but in culture they symbolize man and woman principles like basically everywhere where pagan religions mixed with christianity
Czech has 3 genders
He, she, it
So the sun is "it" and moon is "He"
Isn't the word месяц used for moons other than earths
Also 'luna' - feminine is sometimes used in poems and stuff (not really in normal speech)
Because except Latin, I know it only in Czech :)
Definitely the era of Charles IV king of Bohemia (1346 - 1378) and Holy Roman Emperor
He rebuilt Prague, found the Charles University, the first university in cental Europe, built many castles (including Karlštejn) as well
Most of the well known sights in Prague are from his era
The interwar period
We belonged to the 10 world’s largest economies and we were a hugely proud nation
We were the “beacon of democracy” in central europe and everything worked as it should
People gave up their retirement money/military pay from the state so they can rebuild the nation
Industry was booming and even to this day we have the record of “most vehicle industries per area”.
And I agree with this
Probably during the rule of Charles IV and in recent history in the First Republic (1918-1938)
I agree
Charles IV
was pretty good king
So was Ottokar II
King of Iron and Gold (Přemysl Otakar II
) reign was also good
We had the biggers area expanse, all the way to adriatic sea, foreign masters came and taught us various crafts and also started mining of silver
He was so powerfull, that no other duke or king wanted him as Holy Roman Emperor, so they voted for little known Rudolph Habsburg as their puppet
Which went well
Also reign of Rudolph II
who was the last Bohemian king and invited lot of alchymists, astronomers and other smart people to Prague
We had many small gold glitters rather than 1 long golden era
That was some 300 years later tho
More like 50 years, since the game takes place in 1403
Damn, my bad
I thought Hussite Wars took place after Bitva na Bílé hoře in 1620
You can see history wasn’t my favourite subject
On the other side of the spectrum is Finland
A friend of mine told me that she forgot her phone in a bathroom in a club and when she came back looking for it about half an hour later, it was still there
Too many to count in Prague, lemme think of something
I took a bike ride from Liberec to the Baltic sea following the German-Polish border, or more like the Oder and Nisa rivers
The nature is spectacular
I was stunned the moment we arrived at the Dreiländer and things looked pretty great since
Not to mention the perks of living off of German food and Polish booze for a week
Apart from at least the basics of local language of whichever country you want to work in, I'd say German
French is definitely worth knowing as well
Russian can help in some countries of Eastern Europe
Most people know Pat & Mat
Polish people keep arguing, that their government is worse than ours
Serbia has a lesbian prime minister
It is somewhere illegal to pick mushrooms
American beer is sh*t
Blackpool is apparently some sort of a ghost town and not British Hollywood as I initially thought
Your government also apparently hates satire, immigrants and East Timor

We do
You're part of many jokes in our country - the Czech word "malta" means "cement grout" in English
This reminds me of Ukrainian friend
She told us she was born near Chernobyl, and when we asked if she is irradiated, she answered that ‘near’ means 200 km
In Czechia that’s a huge distance, out borders are closer that 200 km from capital
Distance scales sometime feels weird
And since last week I actually believe it
Children's animated cartoon from Czecho-Slovakia
Yeah that happens, I did the same for "Maya the Honey Bee" which I thought was Czech (probably because of the opening song by Karel Gott) and many years later I found out it was actually Japanese anime
I have no idea which one you mean, but most likely it was us
I personally know it from Strictly and on this subreddit, they say it's a place where young people go to lose virginity (or smth like that)
Reminds me of a coworker in my previous job - he said he was "from a small city near St
Petersburg" - turned out the small city had 500,000 people (which would be the 2nd largest city in Czechia) and near was 300 km
Who dat
I, too, have no idea which one they mean
I mean, just look at them:
* Chrt pln skvrn zdrhl z Brd
* Chrt pln skvrn vtrhl skrz trs chrp v čtvrť Krč, prv zhltl čtvrt hrst zrn
* Chrt pln skvrn zhltl hrst zrn
* Plch zdrhl skrz drn, prv zhltl čtvrthrst zrn
* Zdrhl krt skrz drn, zprv zhltl hrst zrn
* Vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
* Škrt plch z mlh Brd pln skvrn z mrv prv hrd scvrnkl z brzd skrz trs chrp v krs vrb mls mrch srn čtvrthrst zrn
Right, and what does medium-sized mean in Russia
In Czechia I would call a city of 50,000 medium-sized
yes, and there is also a group "We want sea instead of Poland" :)
Only one of the kids was almost bald in Lolek and Bolek, but yeah, different cartoon
Yep, pretty much my reaction the first time
Just wanted to say that I love your cheese and envy you the easy access to the Alp mountains
50 000 má Jihlava, medium je pro mě třeba Rakovník, nebo Nymburk (15 k)
Oh yeah, I thought it was a person
Thanks
Did it work
Are you offended
If not, I have something to say about the "hen" pronoun
Not only r but l as well
It's called "syllabic consonant" (sometimes also "vocalic consonant"), English has them as well
Well, mission accomplished then, I could offend a Swede (though it would be much easier in person)
Heh, it's not really that important in real life
Using i/y is much more (lucky you you don't have the same shit in past tense as we do)
Yep, a guy
And I didn't really want to offend you
But based on your replies, it worked anyway
Maybe it's not so hard to offend a Swede after all
Nah, I meant more of you using "lol" and going into offensive
We Czech would really fight about anyone connected to communism, lot of (especially elder) people say it wasn't that bad back then
Even Hitler would probably get some advocates, since we are one of the most xenophobic nations in Europe, but I think that we could all agree on the **Stellvertretrender Reichsprotektor in Böhmen und Mähren Reinhardt Tristan Eugen Heydrich**
I dont know about a single person from the past we'd hate, but maybe the Habsburgs
They were kinda shitty on the czech people, but idk, nobody's really out there saying how he hates them
Rn many people hate our premiér Andrej Babiš, but he also has his supporters, so thats kinda mixed
My picks would be Emanuel Moravec, Zikmund Lucembursky, or just Habsburgs in general to name a few
Though Heydrich and communists are some strong contenders too
I’d say that Heydrich is kinda forgotten, but I’m not sure
Oh, I totally forgot about E. M., agree, this fucker is the worst (as most traitors (not Snowden and others alike tho))
Habsburgs were bitches too, but in my opinion still not as bad as nazis/commies, and I also think that Metternich was a lot worse than your averidge Habsburg
But those are only my impressions from history lessons
Maybe Jiří Paroubek or David Rath could be added to the list too
EDIT: misstype
Well yes, kinda
But I really couldn't think of anyone else who would be hated by the most Czechs
We cannot agree whether communism was good or bad so anyone from this era kinda fails
Zeman and Babiš are the ones currently holding power, so they had to be elected, so it's as if American said Trump
-> nonsense (certainly for A LOT of people, but it divides people so much that it certainly is not the most hated persob in US)
Any former president, prime minister etc had their upholders and protestors, and it was usually almost 50/50
And anyone from anything older than 20th century is way more forgotten than Heydrich
So I chose him
But I'm really curious what would other Czechs, who's our archnemesis :D
Don't worry I paused there for a second as well
Other Slavs are able to master the pronunciation, for example my mum had a coworker from the Ukraine and he learned Czech in couple of months and now when he speaks you wouldn't know he isn't Czech
However I have never met anyone whose native language wasn't Slavic who would pass for native Czech
Well, if you include an _indistinguishable_ accent, it's very hard to achieve for any language
Probably like 10+ years of full immersion
But yeah in general, Czech is considered one of the more difficult European langauges
There's a lot of declination (7 cases, 4 genders and 5 verb classes with very different patterns + a bunch of irregularities), verb aspects, hard to pronounce consonant groups, and Czech native speakers are not very used to talking with non-natives so they may not have enough patience
The biggest difference is always in motivation, though - if you really need to, you'll learn any language to decent fluency
Speakers of other Slavic langauges tend to have a much easier time than everyone else, obviously, but their accent will always be at least a bit recognizable
I've personally never met anyone who could pass for a native speaker and didn't live here since at least elementary school age
Same as you, but our pronunciation is harder because of "ř"
This
I love languages and I’m currently trying to learn Norwegian
The grammar is easy and I see a lot of similarities in the vocabulary with German (bc their both germanic languages)
The pronunciation is however kicking my ass
Haha, yeah, usually it's like that
I know one person who is truly bilingual in Czech and Slovak with native accents, but he spent his youth moving back and forth (preschool in one country, elementary school in the other, etc
Well yeah, we learn it as part of the masculine, but since the declination is different I'd still kinda count it as "another gender" for the purpose of foreigners learning the language
I'm sure linguists have a more specialized term for that sub-category
Oh yeah, we have these paradigms too
6 of them for masculine nouns (4 animate, 2 inanimate), 4 for feminine and 4 for neuter
Sure, it's not necessarily about the number of days, but I think it's a good idea to gradually reduce full-time working hours
France has 35 hours instead of 40 and it seems to be working fine
Work hours haven't changed for the last 100 years, while technology and productivity continued improving, I think we just have to accept it can't stay the same forever and that there won't be as much human labor needed in the future
We should incentivize shorter hours, more PTO, and also come up with a realistic UBI scheme
Yes
Last year I had almost whole old vacation days so I needed to take it all to the end of the year
I choose to have free friday every week for more than 3 months during summer and it was awesome, 3 days weekend was great, I enjoyed free time much more,  and I did all my job all right in time anyway
I truly feel it was much better for work/personal life balance
But it would have to be figured out about economy of this and I'm not qualified to talk about this aspect
Are they cutting the hours as well
I don't want to have a 10-hour shift, not even for an extended weekend
Sure, but first I like to have 8 hour workday, Monday to Friday
I mean, they already can and the 4 day work week isn't happening, so
Absolutely
I worked a 5 x 8 week for like three months some 3 years ago and I hated it
I've never had a "regular" full time job since and I don't miss it at all
As a freelancer I also probably work more than what is the average, but I love that whenever I feel like it, I can just do all my work for the rest of the week on Wednesday and then slack all I want
Or take it easy and stretch the work all the way to Saturday
Even if the weekend was 4 days of the week, knowing that you "have to" go to work on a certain day, even if you really don't feel like it, would be crap
Yeah, I definitely wrote that in the most optimistic voice I could muster
I don't actually believe it will happen anymore
Sure
I freelance, so for me this is not an issue, but you're right
People tend to forget that there are many other options out there
Thanks Romania, Albania and (Yugoslavia) for refusing to take part in the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact troops in 1968
Slovakia for keeping up with our shit, Luxembourg and Austria for our royal dynasties, Poland and Hungary for the V4 and Charless de Gaulle Eurovision and Jeux sans Frontières
Thanks to our brothers and sisters from Slovakia for Korbáčiky
I would like to thank Romania for not invading us in 1968
I would like to thank Slovakia and all the Slovaks for not disowning us after the split like a bad father we essentially were
Thanks Slovakia for being bros and for our peaceful divorce
Czechs understand better with Slovaks, but I am able to communicate with Poles too, it takes much effort though
spoken polish is complete gibberish for me
Sometimes there is some familiar word but it is going to be a false friend most likely
if it's written, looking for some time into it, remember how czech looked about 500 years ago, add some knowledge of slovak and other slavic language and I get some idea what is it about
But honestly all my tries were on some multi lingual product labels or leaflets out of pure boredom so I know what I am looking at from other language versions
Not sure if this is going to work with some random text
Yeah, if they speak slow enough
But it takes much more effort than communicating with Slovaks
My understanding of Polish is not bad
I don't understand every word, but I can always derive meaning from context
Poland/Czech is incorrect
Correct is Czech/Slovakia
Before we split, we was Czechoslovakia
P.S.: We can understand Poland little bit, but Slovak language is like Czech language and conversely
My dad once had long conversation (like 40 minutes) with Hungarian guy
Dad was speaking Czech, guy was speaking Hungarian and none of them cared, mostly, because they were both superdrunk
Also my dad eas speaking this way with few French and Swedish people
As my grandpa always says, alcohol brings people together
Also I should add, that my dad speaks only Czech and few words in english
You are right, the languages are so similar, that some people even said there is no czech language and slovak language, they said it's czechoslovak language
I could go to slovakia, pick up first person i meet and have endless coversation in which I would understand 99,9% of words
The fact we were once one country also helps, because we also know the meaning of slovakian words, that are different, because it became part of our culture
There are also many slovaks, that didn't learn czech at all, still get jobs and have a normal life and czech friends
if I remember stuff from school correctly both czech and polish used to be very similar languages hundreds years ago but we did lot of language reforms, they don't or in different way than us
That's my experience as well
When I met Poles on vacations or at my work when visiting our Warsaw office, I usually had little problems understanding Poles but they had problems understanding me
Tried watching and reading Polish news and I could understand the general meaning (understanding was higher when written)
I know, I just wanted to show how similar our languages are
But I don't think they are the same
Slovak is often perceived as some sort of "esperanto" of Slavic languages, I guess that's understandable given its central position among all the 3 slavic language subgroups
Not in the news that often, but it feels like the internet is drowning in US politics despite Americans being the minority
It infiltrates even the most innocent sites and subs like r/pics or r/murderedbywords or r/whitepeopletwitter
There was even a political post in r/idiotsincars
I hate it
I think daily we have a few
It's "usa this" and "usa that". It's very often about Trump
Yeah, I personally don't mind too much
Whether we like it or not, America is economically and militarily the most important country in the West
I just scroll past the news that I don't care about

I traveled a lot over the years and lived in 4 countries so let me chime in with a non-western European opinion
I am factually from Europe, therefore at some level of analysis, I am European, it's just a matter of how much I identify with that label
And the answer is not a lot
I feel 0 connection to Dutch people even after living there for years
Feel 0 connection to people from Greece (just as a representative country) just because we are on the same side of the Pangea split
However I feel connection to west Slavic countries (Slovaks and Poles) everywhere I go
Similarly with Serbians
So I would say I identify with like-minded people, then with nationality, then perhaps with some form of Slavic identity
and only then maybe as European to a small degree
But I'm definetely heavily against any form of federation or superstate
Our country has been ruled and ordered around by pan-european superstates for decades and I don't like them or trust them
No, I do not, and imo something like federation is never gonna happen, but I'm all for European cooperation
> Hello everyone,I would like to know what do you think about this topic: The so called "Common European identity".
People who were outside of Europe and surroundings usually understand how much do Europeans have in common
Ant-fucking about the tiny differences between neighbours is the pastime of people who never left their village
> First of all,do you believe that this actually exists and do you believe also that it is possible in the future that this common identity could be the basis of a hypothetical "European state/federation" ?
Let me quote from the "Demon-Haunted World" by Carl Sagan, chapter 25, "Real patriots ask questions":
Some  of  the  opponents  of  the  US  Constitution  insisted  that  it  would never work;  that  a  republican  form of government spanning a  land  with  'such  dissimilar climates,  economies,  morals,  politics,  and peoples,'  as  Governor  George  Clinton of New York  said,  was  impossible;  that  such  a  government  and  such  a  Constitution,  as  Patrick  Henry of Virginia declared,  'contradicts  all  the  experience  of the  world'.
I would prefer to be called European over my nationality
I have friends all over Europe and besides language I don't see much difference
If it was widely accepted, I’d state my “nationality” as european
I have been learning european languages, history, culture, cuisine, geography, and politics since kindergarden
Pre-covid, travelling abroad in Europe was not a big deal, I’d leave the country 2-4 times a year, and that was before I started dating across borders
My family’s nostalgic places are strewn across the continent
Though I go into drunken ramblings about the unfair history we’ve had with out neighbours, I love y’all, even if you did my country wrong or if you’re passing some concerning laws
There is some kind of European identity, because after all, nearly all of our languages came from one family
When you look at european mythologies, you can see some simmilarities
But I don't think it's a full identity
There are still differences between us
I can see that we share something in common with countries who used to be in Austria-Hungary + with Germans
I can see it with Slavic nations and Eastern European nations as a whole
But for example I just can't see simmilar identity between us and Spain, Portugal, Ireland, UK, France or southern Italy
It just doesn't click
What I personally hate about this European identity is to see how people, who we call here "europhiles", fetishize it
They basically don't approach it as something naturall, but rather they try to artificially create their vision of the true European identity and that's just no go for me
I think it exists
I've never had a cultural shock when travelling in the EU or meeting people from European countries who come here
Sure, it is not quite like home, but it is similar enough
I did, however, have several cultural shocks when talking to people from came here from other continents
However I think that European identity is not as strong as American identity, so not sure if we can ever have a true federation - even now, there are bigger countries who have a tendency to just take over and try to bully smaller countries into agreeing with whatever they decided
Maybe it's not because they are Asians, but because they are locals
I did my exchange in Germany, but never had any local friends
I befriended many Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, Americans or other Europeans, but no Germans
Hm interesting
I think I feel much bigger connection to, for example, Austria and Germany, than to Serbia
I feel like our mentality is much more similar to Germans, we have over a thousand years of common history, we have a very similar beer culture xD
With Serbia I have not much to say
The only connection I feel to them is that somewhen one and half thousand years ago we split from the same Slavic branch and now we speak a vaguely similar language, but the mentality is different, culture is more distinct and overall I just feel more like home when I’m in Austria
You're absolutely correct mate
And Czech Republic has the same minority in superpower problem
While I agree with most of what you said, I think you are thinking of western Europe
Go to Poland and ask them about LGBT, go to Russia and ask them about democracy, go to Serbia and ask them about pacifism, go to balcans and ask them about accepting history
There is still notable divide between east and west
East tends to be more conservative and anti EU
Many eastern countries were for centuries opressed by their neighbours and don't want to give up their independence again
Fair, that has been my experience of knowing Serbians for decades
I always click instantly
But I agree with you that with Austrians and Germans there is a bond
Just more complicated due to all the wars, envy and disparity
Yes, that is definetly true, but still, our values differ throughout the continent
I was really disapointed by Pisa
Other places in Tuscany are much better imo
I love Pisa
It was beautiful
The white building really poped up after we reached the entry to the area
Then we had great lunch for a quite good price and while eating we were listening to the cliche Italian music played by busker
It was the most beautiful lunch of my life
I’m sorry for the horrible shoes some of us wear
I don’t get that either
The Czechs approve lol
I personally like Brighton and Hastings
But I’ve been to England only once and I really want to visit other places
Prague is great, but it's a way better experience if you understand the language a know all the cool hidden non-touristy places to go to
yeah Ayia Napa was kinda a shock, still very nice but it felt like I was in Ibiza
The beaches were beautiful but so crowded
I loved Tenerife
I guess Russia
Not really sure
Slovaks are our bros and we're kinda cool with all our neighbours, so Russia is the best pick, especially when it comes to sports
Wassup Slovakia
We have strange fraternal/rival relationship with Slovakia
Most hated country is probably Germany
Not really a country but Moravia
It's mainly Praha vs Brno but it applies to the the whole country
I was also thinking Russia
Germans gave us Sudety back so we are cool, Austria is nice quiet neighbour, Slovakia is our little brother and Poland is a big weird guy but friendly
I think I'll disagree on that one
You need to be an equal first to be a rival
I love our country, but c'mon
It's like ants thinking they are rivals with humans because they stepped on an anthill once
I visited Russia last year and you know what their reaction mostly was
"Oh, you are from Czechoslovakia
So yea
I have the same feeling, for everything Russia have done to us
With Slovaks it is like friendly rivalry
Next prove of Russia is that, what happened today
Russian extremists ,,attacked'' our embassy in Moscow
Never heard of it
Drunk people here usually go to bed, no to shower
I have
Had been drinking hard night before, went to bed around 5, woke up at 7 to get to work, still drunk obviously
Tried to gather myself, failed and decided that shower would freshen me up
Went there and passed out unconscious, woke up soon enough in my shower cabin and thanked God I was sitting
Terrible experience, never drank gin afterwards
In German, Meer sometimes means lake, and See sometimes means sea
So it is not that clear-cut
Otrok in Slovenian means child, in Czech it means slave
Eventually - in the end in English
Eventuálně - at some instance in Czech
Slavic languages have lots of them
Hladna pića = cool drink on croatian And hungry pussy in czech
Otrok = children in croatian And slave in czech
Host in czech means guest
Čerstvý means Fresh in Czech, Cherstviy means rotten in Russian
The pronunciation is very similar
German - der Stuhl - a chair
Czech - stůl - a table
This made me so confused when I first heard it
Pronounced the same, a small difference in meaning
Polish: Szukat = To look for something
Czech: Šukat = to fuck something
I've got one
CURVA means in Spanish an italian curve or corner
KURVA In Czech and Slovak and KURWA in Polish and Sorb means bitch
Robota drogova would remind me selling drugs as robota means work in Slovakia
Also remember that dívka means girl in czech And děvka Is a bitch
In Polish these meanings Are reversed
Trus in czech means shit
Kačka can be either duck or familiar nickname to crown (currency)
Trus in Czech means excrement
> Trus in Russian is a coward
Trus in Belarusian is a rabbit
And in Czech, it's manure
Pila in czech =saw (the tool)
Children are technically slaves
They do a lot of works around house and parents dont pay them minimum wage
They just provide them clothing, food and shelter
In the past, children did a lot of works around farms just to support family
Families didnt have any buypower to buy machines, so they they got "bio-robots".
I remember in Bulgaria I saw a dish named "nervozno köfte". Googled it, it's a thing:
Imagine a dish called "nervous köfte".
It literally means: "I fuck drugs into the toilet"
I heard that from NFKRZ I don't speak Russian but I was just curious
It's not that bad, but of course I'd like to move away eventually
Ideally, pretty much any of the  "dark green" countries would be great (Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, possibly northern Germany, New Zealand, Canada,...), I'm not too attached to any particular place
Realistically speaking, France is probably my best option because my partner being a French native makes things easier
I've never been a francophile, but Duolingo is going pretty well so far
EDIT: As for why, obviously higher purchasing power is a big factor, but also the quality of public services, real estate prices (Czechia is insane in comparison with incomes), and more progressive open-minded societies
I'm really not vibing with the Czech mentality, especially in the 2010s...
I kinda like living in the Czech Republic
It's close to every other country in Europe, in case I feel like traveling, I like the countryside and the multitude of old castles and chateaus everywhere, there is a lot to do in the cities, our standard of living is not half bad, even though our wages are much lower than in Western Europe, and overall I don't have all that much to complain about
Of course, we have our problems
I wish people were a little warmer and the politics wasn't such a mess
But seeing what problems some of the more western countries have, I'd say we're not in a bad position
I certainly do
Yes, there are problems in politics, but that happens everywhere and yes, not every public service is perfect
I still like living here, the rural areas are beautiful, there’s a lot of things to see and do and because we’re in the middle of Europe (I know that’s technically Lithuania) we don’t have to travel too long to go to other places
I love living here
I love how things (in day-to-day life) work, the countryside, architecture, etc
I'm not so thrilled about the political situation and the relatively low GDP (and wages) compared to the EU
I constantly get confused by people's opinions and I can't say whether most people piss me off or whether I just see input from the loud minority
Although I am probably going to have the same issue anywhere
I'm thinking about moving abroad for a couple years, depending on how I perfect my German
Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, UK, Belgium
though I only know Germany and Austria well enough to actually consider moving there
The cultures are similar to mine, the language isn't that hard, living standards are higher according to some lists
And I legitimately miss Germany's trash collection and recycling system
It's a pain at first but later it's so, so satisfying
I like the monuments that are everywhere here and our colourful nature and culture too (it's mix of a lots of anothere cultures)
I like the living standarts - living here is cheap, but we're developed (it's somethink that you can't see at most countries)
Similar here :D
(But we aren't TOO small and don't have too high mountains, but we have similar culture and living standarts)
Yeah that's only thing I miss here too
Your English is great for that age
Haha, you know what
I visited Finland in 2013 (absolutely loved it) and back then I thought that Finland was one of those utopian countries with pretty much no problems
My friend, with whom I was staying the first couple of days, cured me of that illusion right quick
He told me about all the things Finnish people were complaining about and that was the moment when I realized that no matter where you go, there are always problems and issues to be solved
And that people elsewhere complain just as much as in my country
In the end it's about being content with what you have and improving what is within your power to improve
I believe that a couple of years back, there was a petition to replace Poland with sea, lol
Perfect location for travelling, everything in Europe is close be it UK, Spain or Bulgaria
Lack of sea sucks, always thought what it would be like to live close to the sea and just casually go there whenever I'd like to
I love our borders, almost all of our borders are natural, formed by mountain ranges
This also creates a bit of a problem especially during autumn/winter, our country is basically one big bowl/valley and clouds/fogs tend to be trapped here during the colder months so it can happen I don't see sun for several weeks
Being located in the center of the continent is cool now when we have peaceful neighbours but historically it was a big mess and we got caught in power battles all the time
I wish we had a more Atlantic climate, I hate the big differences between suffocating summers and freezing winters that we get here in the middle of the continent
Also having to own clothing for all temperatures, both heating and AC/fans, etc
I just want a stable 10-25 C temperature range and an oceanic breeze, that would be perfect, even without being directly at the sea
We have a saying that Czechia is the grain of sand between the gearwheels of west and east
Czechia kinda sucks for renewables - not enough wind, not enough sun, relatively small rivers
That's why we need nuclear
Yeah, Ano is just a scheme to rob the country of as much money as possible
From one countryman to another, I just have to ask: do you actively dislike our country as a whole, or do you just have a feeling of not belonging (being apathetic, I guess)
I'm not gonna judge you either way, I just wanna know since I honestly love it here
you can lay the cable (položit kabel), you can throw a poop (hodit bobek), jump away (odskočit si), or go for the big one (jít na velkou)
Trůnit - sitting on the throne, literally "throning".
Also - going where even the king has to walk
Ztrestat porcelán - punish the porcelain
"Oh god, he is calling me again
" "Who is calling you
" "Poopin
" "Who the hell is poopin
" "What
You don't know him
The Russian man, Vladimir Poopin
He's calling me like every day
Now in Czech, it's not actually Vladimir Poopin but instead Italian man Franchesco Serruti
I had to change it a little because of translation to keep the joke
In Czech: "Ty jo, už mi zas volá." "Kdo ti volá?" "Serruti
" "Kdo je Serruti
" "Cože? Ty ho neznáš? Ten Ital
Franchesco Serruti
Volá mi snad každej den
My uncle owned one when I was a kid
He was swearing about it constantly, though
Best car on the normal market
Especially with 1500 engine as Skoda didn’t produce these
I wouldn't necessarily call it the best car
so what was better
(From normal network, not expecting answer like Ford Escort from tuzex
Wanna go out
Yeah
*ordering* I'll have a coke please
EXCUSE ME WHAT
Italian cars don't bother you if you don't have a seat belt
I remember an interview from a lady who came here over from the US and her mother was freaked out that she's flying to soviet czechoslovakia so she packed her bags with cans of various foods to survive
She expected there to be no cars or clean water
Not even Kofola
You could always buy a Kofola
Non-alcoholic beer is everywhere in CZ and considered an acceptable choice if you've got a reason for it
Non-alcoholic beer is everywhere in CZ and considered an acceptable choice if you've got a reason for it
Cola is a kids drink
What the fuck
What the fuck
Yeah, but Coca Cola is just crazy sweet and that's the main reason why adults usually don't drink it (but kids love it)
We have Kofola which is little better
Same here
We're earlier gen Z, and my schoolmates get wasted weekly

Many, even the most classics of classics, like Cinderella's sisters choping chunks of their feets off, Red Riding Hood and grandma being actually eaten and cut out of wolf's belly, evil queen put into hot iron shoes, Jeníček a Mařenka who put the evil witch in burning oven
then some Otesánek who ate everything starting with his parents and I would surely find more, I vaguely remember some fairy tale where goat intstines and murdered step sister played a role I read around 10
But since they are child stories, these things in them are said in such manner that I don't think it disturbs children, only parents who think about it as adults, I certainly didn't find anything weird about girls cuting off toes and heels to fit in shoe as a child, because I didn't think about it more than "it's just magical story".
We have nice movies
As a child I loved books from Finish author Hannu Mäkelä about Mister Hoo( *Herra Huu* /  *Herra Huu saa naapurin*  /  *Herra Huu muuttaa* )
It's about small wizard living in present times, but don't understand them much, who  sometimes experiences quite scary adventures
I remember some TV movie fairy-tale with blinded prince who had to roam the world too, but it wasn't Rapunzel I think
I don't know but it was there
Also, every story gets many variations and some pieces are taken and made into another story so you can find many other kind of similar
If I remember correctly:The girl is living with her grandma
A message arrives from her father, saying they finished the house and grandma should send their daughter to them
The daughter travels to a deep space colony,  but when she arrives her parents aren't there, only robotic grandma, who will say her that her father will return at 1:30PM
But the father will not arrive and something goes wrong with the robot
At the end - the real grandma arrives and saved the girl from the robot - presumably because she had got a new message, that parents will not be available
And there is also some metaphor there I believe
> Logan's run
Logan's run book was published 5 years latter and the movie 16 year latter, but the 60s was a fountain of inspiration in general
Depends
Was the place easily accessible by public transportation
I wouldn't call anything further than 1
5 km "nearby" unless you can get there under 15 minutes
Well, in here (at least in the younger generation) day drinking is not really a thing
We just call it drinking and we don’t really care what time it is
That being sad, it usually doesn’t really have negative connotations
But the drinking usually consists of beer and some shots anyway, so it’s not really drinking
But getting drunk is (at least in my social circle) okay
If you do it alone, it's not good, but it's normal to go with friends in pub
I would add that lot of people drinks after sport during the day
It's common to make bike trip to pub/restaurant and have a Beer or two
Nobody usualy gets hammered during the day
In my fields it is most common, that people drink mainly when together at pub and would not have a beer at home
I'll give you a kind of a Czech answer - letting minors drink in bars
Not that they changed the legal age or anything, it's been 18 as long as I can remember, but the first time I got drunk was when I was 14
It wasn't even in a horrible dive bar, it was in a major club in my hometown
That was about 14 years ago
I vaguely remember that when I was around 16, they suddenly tightened the laws around the penalty for letting minors drink and it became extremely difficult to find a place to illegally drink, if you were a minor, so we had to resort to drinking at home
Then I turned 18 and stopped caring about it
In fact, it seems like a weird dream that it was a thing in the first place
Nowadays I fully approve of the tighter checks, because I certainly don't want to sit one table ovee from the likes of 15 year old me in a bar
They sometimes ask me for an ID card when I'm in a pub/restaurant I've never been to and order beer
I'm 23
Huh, I recently turned 18 and it was still pretty easy to find a put where minors would get served
To je smutný. Je mi líto současných teenagerů.
Can I hear the sound of that whistle anywhere
They keep asking me in shops to this day
I'm fucking 28
People tell me I look 24 at the most, though, and that's when I'm not wearing a mask
But surely they wouldn't sell you beer just anywhere, right
Where are you from
Yeah they're asking me in stores aswell
At one hand it's nice to know I'm not aging too much, on the other it's annoying to carry ID every time I wanna grab some beer
not anywhere, but it's not like Večerky and pubs that serve minors are rare
It raises question
Why does god need advertisement
No, some religious weirdo (mostlikely jehova whiteness) might have something written on the house but I didn't see a billboard
I haven't seen any in Czechia
So I don't think there are
In all of Europe, I’ve seen one semi-religious billboard
It was a commercial for a new edition of Bible that was special in some way
I think
Not this kind of things but we do have posters with butchered fetuses from time to time (Prague here)
Well, you can guess how it is in Czechia
Ah yes the gynecomastia Jesus
I've seen one by some cult, not sure if it was by Jehova witnesses, but definitely by some weird christian cult
we had family nearby with house like this and they were openly jehowist (and probably something else) but yes If I remember correctly these nonsenses on the house was just nonsenses, not jehova related
I think the government wanted to ban advertisements along roads so that people wouldn't stare at them when they are supposed to pay attention to the road
I can understand Slovak probably like 99%, the easiest one after that is probably Croatian, then all the other Slavic languages
Most slav languages (not the Balkan slav tho)
Slovakian, Polish, Russian and Ukranian (in that order)
Slovak, both spoken and written is mutually inteligible with Czech
It's almost identical
. | Singular CZ | Plural CZ | Singular PL | Plural PL
nominative | voda | vody| woda | wody
genitive | vody | vod| wody | wód
dative | vodě | vodám| wodzie| wodom
accusative | vodu | vody| wodę| wody
vocative | vodo | vody|wodo| wody
locative | vodě | vodách|wodzie| wodach
instrumental | vodou | vodami| wodą| wodami
Who were these people
I always hear about Czech people not understanding Slovak, but I've never met any
I was born in '88 and so I never had much Slovak on TV, but I still find it very easy to understand
(Even if I'm not foolish enough to try and speak it)
TV is completely irrelevant nowadays
Ask any kid or teenager if they watch regular TV stations
I bet you will find very few
People watch  Youtube, Social media etc
They have more contact with Slovak than I had in the 90s.
Not always always, it depends on grammatical gender and each of them have ["template nouns"] and after that you have each of the suffixes
They're very similar in all those aspects, so you should understand one when you know the other
(Apparently, that's not true for younger people, but otherwise, it's usually fine
) They're not as close as dialects of the same language, because some vocabulary is rather different, there are some variations in their grammar, but to me, the core thing stays the same and they're as close as two languages from the same family can be, probably also because of the shared history
They do sound different, which is probably why Polish or Russian people have an easier time understanding Slovak
I'd say those are all 'softer sounding' Slavic languages, while Czech is pretty harsh
Sometimes a person can say a few words in one and it takes you a few moments to realise they're not speaking the other
And we can totally spend an evening together drinking and understanding each other, even if the topic of "what's that word" or "why would you write an i there, it should be a y, it seems wrong" will come up pretty often
Misspelling of cigarette brand names
No matter how well you speak English
Camels are /kamelky/, Viceroys are /vícerojky/, P&S are /pé-eska/, etc
Deep fried cheese
[Párek v rohlíku] would be the most iconic one
It's like a hot dog, but the sausage is stuffed in a [roll]
But a simple "klobása" with bread, which is just like Polish "kielbasa", is probably more commonly purchased at festivals, hockey matches etc
If you are in a buffet then it’s probably smažák (fried cheese) served with fries and tartar sauce
But as someone mentioned it’s párek v rohlíku or klobása with bread and mustard or ketchup
Fried cheese in a roll
Langoš - deep fried dough with cheese, garlic and tomato sauce on it
Here's a picture of our prime minister eating one
It’s pretty fucking good but I think more national one is svíčková.
See, I always thought bramboračky were a more ubiquitous fast food
Common fast foods are also bramboráky - sort of potato pancakes or originally hungarian langoš - often with cheese, garlic and  ketchup / tartar sauce on top
Maybe one of those is the thing you mean :) Fried bread and garlic is what we call topinka but it's not really sold on it's own, it's usually served along meals like beef steak tartare
I wouldn't call svíčková fast food
That's not a fast food though, it's considered a standard meal (well, you occasionally can get burgers with fried cheese, even McDonalds tried it)
But yeah, it is one of our most defining culinary pieces, whether we like it or not
Oh I didn’t notice it said fast food
And why are we talking in English
It is a fast food
You can get it at almost any food stall on the street
Even our highschool kantyna offered it during velka prestavka
So they will understand
This ain't r/czech
I guess so
Owning one
I don't know a single person that actually has one
But when It comes to Ice hockey people usually paint them on their face and also wear scarfs with czech flag
Having it no, having it on the wall inside not really if you are sport fan (my brother used to be a big football fan (meh, soccer, ok
) and he had our flag on the wall of his room) or if you have it like decoration in some not crazy way
Having it outside, waving it outside, heck yes, most people would think it's pretty weird
Only some important days it may be "forgiven" but a lot of people would still think you are overreacting, that it's just for government offices to put it on without being cringy
Having it is fine I guess, but displaying one in public is odd, unless there's some kind of a major sports championship going on
I would assume that that person is a nationalist
Really
I had the same feeling in Lithuania - they are really really proud of their independence - but I don't recall seeing a single one in Latvia
And I was in Riga
But maybe I just didn't pay any attention to them
Damn
I spent half a year in Lithuania and thought that the Lithuanian flag was everywhere
And when I told this to other Lithuanians, they were like "what are you talking about
Yeah
And they do have one, they often hold it upside down
I hear the pride of the Croatian flag is a bit controversial
Because of the checkered bit and what it's supposed to represent
I am no expert on Balkan politics, though, so I don't know, if that's true
A proč? To sem nikdy neviděl
Haha, yeah, what's the deal with that
It's a thing in pretty much every country where people are allowed to protest
If people of all opinions wave the flag at protests, what's the point
Like, I get it, you are from this country
Yeah, I was fascinated to see that people even had it on their luggage and pillows on a plane
Thanks for helping me keep my sanity
I suppose not
It's always about context and the beholder
[This] is the beginning of Velvet revolution on 17th October 1989 - peaceful protest soon to be violently ended by communist regime's forces
Alternatively, [this] is from October 1938, after the Munich agreement, which stripped Czechoslovakia of its borderlands, ring of defensive fortresses and any hope for help against German aggression
Search for the Slovak one here - the Bratislava picture is the most famous in regards to 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion
I would say that it could be one of these three:
[Hitler looking out  of a window at the Prague Castle]
[People at the Wenceslas Square on 27 of October 1918]
[Soviet tank crashing into a house in Liberec] or [a protester standing in defiance on a Soviet tank
Knew I'd find it here
I've seen that first one in some youtube video
It said it should be a historical photo, not a work of art
What is the worst specific thing about your country that affects you personally
In my case it's the absurd prices of mobile data
I knew you were Czech just by reading the post lol
I would also say our government uncapable of actually doing anything that is prosperable for the people
I read the text and I was like
Must be a fellow Czech
Yup
For me it's more of urban design and the roads
Even after a part of a city is closed forever for repairs sometimes I feel like people who made those decisions didn't think about any access options
I'm not disabled but I've got a pram and sometimes it's such a hassle
Good distinction
I hate when people conflate faith and church (usually Catholic) dogmatism
The former can exist without the latter and usually when people are annoyed at a religion, they are annoyed at actions of corrupt or politically motivated church body that often doesn't even reflect the belief system itself
I can't for the life of me understand why churches get so politically involved and desire to control lives through legislation, rather than through the social fabric and traditional tools of their functioning
The second one hits way too close home
News articles comment sections and the comments under Facebook posts are prime examples
>The botched response to the coronavirus
Are you challenging us
>I don't think it's too bad
*Cost similar to that of Switzerland and the US, where salaries are multiple times higher*
Germany has huge surpluses yet refuses to invest money, preferring sitting on a bag
It's all weird to see
Prague is pretty awful regarding housing prices
You basically need to have a relative there or find someone to live with you and share the cost, otherwise you won't be able to afford it as a student or someone without large savings
That said the dorms are nice and there's lots of them
So it's not all that terrible while you are a student
Same here
American tourists in Prague can get pretty startled at the fact
I actually prefer this because it makes people more polite to the staff, because you know they will treat you the same way if you aren't.
On the other hand you then hear comments about how rude and unprofessional the service here is
€23 monthly = 4GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
€31 monthly = 15GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
€43 monthly = 40GB data + unlimited calls and SMS
There are some bonuses attached to it like discounts on electronics, but the point is data are expensive if you don't care about the other stuff
But why
It's not like you can't get rid of it and people surely know it's a health hazard
I've grown up in peaceful Europe, so I wouldn't say it feels strange
However almost everything here was shaped by wars in a way, so that is definitely a reminder that peace is something to be grateful for
It is just how things was
Remains of WW2 are all around where I live and you can't unsee them
Not really, maybe some really ancient ones that only historicians know about
None used or within public consciousness
Wonder is, that we're still alive and there wasn't WWIII yet
The Stonehenge and surrounding landscape
The Acropolis of Athens
The St
Jacob's route(s)
The urban lanscape of Paris
The landscape of Iceland
The Danube
The Auschwizt camp, to remember that cultural heritage aren't only things we would like to have
Yeah, something worth living for
You need to escape the number like this: `\7
dude wtf` otherwise the reddit Markdown will renumber it
(Also pinging /u/onlinepresenceofdan)
Yes, the idea was that all the places are in one or another way representing something characteristic and monumental related to European identity or civilizational feats
The Auschwitz is ugly, but is, unfortunately, a pinnacle of most bad trends in history, a representation of persecution, industrialized killing, prejudice, corruption and complex social organization that allowed it to grow so much
It inspires emotions, just different kind than the other places, and serves as a reminder and warning
Says that we can not pick only good achievements when thinking about our cultural identity, but have to be aware that there bad things that share roots with the good ones
It is actually already an UNESCO site because of some some of these reasons
So the hypothetical alien can wonder and ponder what we are
Leberkas-Pepi from Austria
any broodje haring place from Netherlands
There are a few Nordsees in Czechia, but I have feeling that they are worse than in Germany
I'd like to see some burger chain better than BK/MCD here
Also [Puzata Hata] from Ukraine
Not an entire chain, but I'd like triple cheeseburger from German McDonalds
Second that
So simple, cheap yet so efficient
But they would need Austrian Leberkäse
Have you ever saw non-homemade *sekaná* as good as they sell in Austria
>There's not even enough Leberkas Pepi within Austria
I know I know, we often choose Linz route to Alps instead of Munchen one (a bit longer but fully on highways so you save at least an hour) just to stop in Linz branch
I think it would be quite success here (in Prague) and they would not have to be dependent on tourists
It is basically a streetfood lot of people want's here
A good butcher here sell some meatloaf in a bun, globus (german supermarket chain) have this as well and that's more or less all
> Have you ever saw non-homemade sekaná as good as they sell in Austria
Yes but it is quite rare and only one option
Billa used to sell absurdly cheap (20Kč?) sekaná v housce
But the taste is lagging behind Pepi
Older generation would have no idea what it is and the younger generation if they use e-mail say just mail
Or e-mail, but mostly just mail
In official setting, "electronic post" is also often used
Many people also often write it as "email" but that's enamel, the hyphen is important
No, we say "mail", so "gmail" would just make it longer
But I still hear people say "skype" (skypovat) for video calls in general, even though Skype isn't really popular anymore, right
(right
I don't know)
People say "mejl" or just "e-mail".
Mainly because largest email provider is seznam
cz and not gmail
Lots of people are using company emails for private mails
Never heard somebody say "to gmail somthing"
Also I'd say a good portion of people still use seznam as their email provider, gmail is not as ubiquitous as it might be elsewhere
Imo the hyphen thing is a bit nitpicky, it'd be extremely difficult to confuse to two
Interesting and uncommon
Why is that, if you don't mind me asking
I do that too
I have Gmail is for spam and other bs and my Seznam account for serious emails
I see
And would you consider it immoral to use a free service and block ads
Isn't Seznam free, though
I would also like to know what that means
It is
However, I didn't finish reading the first comment so I do the same only with Gmail
Slovakia
Austria
Germany / HRE
Soviet Union
Poland or USA (Poland because of proximity, USA because of its general influence on world history)
This is difficult, but I tried my best (in brackets are reasons)
Austria (royal marriages, Ottokar II
, Havsburgs, Austria Hungary, neighbouring nation
Various German states (mostly Bavaria and Saxony; because of HRE, neighbouring countries)
Poland (royal marriages, Cieszyn, Boleslav the Piast)
Slovakia (Duchy of Nitra, Czecho-Slovakia)
Hungary (Neighbouring country, royal marriages, Matthias Corvinus)
France (House of Luxembourg, post WW1 allies, art influence)
Russia (Pan-Slavism, USSR)
Slovakia, Germans, Soviet Russia, Austria and maybe France
You Aren’t right at all
Definitely Austria
Germany
I would say France because of the wars with Franks during Samos ages and the Napoleonic wars
And maybe Slovakia here, definitely not 1
Here would be Poland or Hungary
The top 5 you typed is maybe during the WWII, but the medieval history is mostly about Austria and Germany
I would swap Poland with Hungary, due to history
What's slovakia doing there
We learn about hungary as a whole not about specific upper hungary history
If you count only post 1918 history this might be true but our country history didn't start in 1918
I think giving all games featuring loot boxes 18+ rating and treating them accordingly with local online gambling laws should be enough
Maybe make them unbuyable with real money
If it's gambling (such as slot machines), it should be handled by gambling legislation
Otherwise what is the point of such legislation
In premium games 100% I don't pay for game to pay more
Even lot of micro transactions are pushing it
In freemium, ehhh, probably
Maybe not ban the mechanic itself but regulate it so it doesn't fuck over people more than trading cards or kinder surprises or whatnot
(Disclosure: I freelance as match 3 level designer)
Also ban lottery
Also ban Kinder Surprise
Also ban raffles
Also ban everything random
This is why socialism is coming from the west, not from the east as it was in the past
Government should know better than people what is good for them
Yes but if you just ban it, then EU game developers using loot boxes will likely move where they are legal or find subsidiaries there, people will buy the games from abroad and use proxy servers to play them, nothing will change and we will have even less control over it
If we say: okay, use this damn game mechanic but admit it's a gambling and behave accordingly, there's a better chance the companies will abide to the laws, will make players register their IDs, pay proper gambling taxes from each microtransaction and whatever else online gambling laws require
It will lower the number of children being advantaged on this (though of course, some of them will always borrow their parents' or whovever's ID but even that's okay if it will raise parents' interest in what their children are doing online), and in a long run, the loot box mechanism may cease to be a profitable model for the companies
>F2p will take over gaming by 2025 no matter what, lootbox ban or not
LOL no it won't, single player is making a comeback as gamers push against this games as service nonsense
At least there are not getting diabetes from chocolatte
Now seriously
They can gamble for free
There are apps at google store simulating all popular game lootboxes (CSGO, FORTNITE
), also there is free roulette, poker
We dont need bans on gambling if you raise children right
The same is with alcohol, drugs
It can be fun if you do it occasionally with small amounts
But it can be deadly fast
You have to teach children money discipline
Start with pocket money cash for sweets
"You have this money for whole week" If they spend it, they will not have a sweets for the rest of the week
Then extend it for month
After they are able to budget, try to give them money for example for commuting to school, food
and be backup
If they fail, reduce their money and repeat
If they want plastic card, give them debit card
I dont know why people who have kids doesnt have this basic idea how to teach budgeting to their kids
If kids are forced to buy skins or food, they will not spend it on skins
If you give unlimited access to your funds to your kid, you are either stupid or have strong belief that you raised your kid responsibly
So if they spend this much, its your fault and you have to pay for it
You raised them wrong
As far as I understand, childcare
It used to be you got lower (capped) the more babies (future taxpayers) you had
They also do grandma childcare more
Which is easier if they go early
My mom still has few years till retirement and it sucks with our 1 year old
It's nice when grandmas can babysit
Iam not buying any cosmetics in game, Iam just opening free ones when i receive some
Didnt spent a penny to buy them and didnt buy even key to open them in CSGO
I miss the time when you could sold unopened boxes on market for some small or big money
But Iam still for lootboxes
If person is not responsible with their money, they dont deserve the money
Bonus points if they pay for development of game which i dont need to pay for because its free because people are buying lootboxes
I would go for another solution
If there are lootboxes, there have to be official marketplace for items found inside
Its always cheaper to buy item than to gamble because lots of people are overbuying randomness and the items on the market are undervalued
There is some kind of natural ratio of hard to get which is rewarding and fun as you are making progress and on the other side is stupidly hard grind
These games are balanced very well in fact
When you discover after some time this nonrewarding grind, you either stop playing or take out credit card and realize it few hunred bucks later
For people enjoying gameplay its nothing neckbreaking
For example take this Apex Legends
Game is free, everything is inside free
You unlock new heroes after some acceptable time or at instant when you pay
Everything else is just pattern
jpg on weapons or character
You dont have any advantage
Even basic skins are better for hiding that expensive ones
Same is for Heroes of the Storm
Only impatient people pay and what they get is instant gratification which depletes very quickly
Federalisation is the only viable future
Its going to hurt, especially countries like Germany as we create common fiscal policies, but it is the only way Europe will survive and prosper
I agree with you
When I read this sub it seem to me EU means more for you than for us
I do hope there will be friendly relations and cooperation between nations, but I don't want us to become one nation
We have fictional character Cimrman  I reccomend to read it whole
There is huge [memegroup] quoting any quote which was used during theatre displays to comment anything in real world
**Basically anyone on the street knows at least 20+ quotes from the plays
Many people know and recognize word by word any moment from the play when someone is saying expression used there
Its commedy, but really funny full of inside jokes, for example Cimrman's Ten Commandments for Novice Actors
Cimrman's theatrical company (called Lipany) had a significant share of untalented and inexperienced actors
In the lecture preceding the play The Stand-In (Czech: Záskok), a list of Cimrman's "Ten Commandments for Novice Actors" is presented, after which the commandments are broken one by one throughout the rest of the play
Do not drink for courage
Even the part of a drunkard is better played sober
Remember that on the stage you generally have a different name than in real life
It is good to know the names of the other characters also
It is best to express strong emotions with your back to the audience
You can best portray both laughter and tears by shrugging your shoulders
Do not thank the audience for objects thrown on the stage
After a cue do not repeat everything
Some lines are for other actors
Go to the bathroom before the performance so that you do not slouch during the play
If you play a devil, remember before sitting down that you have a tail
During applause on an open stage do not bow
It is most likely for someone else
Remember that some doors are just painted
Do not eat during meals on the stage
Everything is rubber
During the final applause make bows deep enough for the audience not to notice it is you who shouts "Bravo
Documentary about pedophiles on social sites was released
(In site - V Síti) All predator faces are blured but eyes and mouth
There Is a famous memed scene where little girl asks: don't you mind I'm 12
He replies: 12
That's cool
"When you forget how many beers you have had, So you ask the bartender… 12, that's cool"
Tak to je v pohodě (translation : 12
That’s fine
It’s quote from documentary, it was told by pedophile commenting on age that actress told him she was
Cool fact Is you can pick Jára Cimrman at oral part of school leaving exam in czech language
Then there is the president, and Hamáchad and lately České dráhy (about the train crashes)
This one
Cimrman did sculpture himself but later it was used by hat-maker (hatter) Lešner to iron shapes of the hats, which lead to destroying all the recognizable features of his bust sculpture so noone knows how he looked
He was portryed on many photos at that time but either from huge distance (100s of meters) or standing facing back to camera
You are right but It is called high school "final exam".
I agree
While our economy is a tiny bit better I must say culturally you are ahead
Whenever I see the "memes" around here it physically hurts
It feels as if people just left rage comics and discovered Facebook
Come here, bro, gimme a hug
Say Czechia one more time, I dare you
I'd say they are, because only a few words are different
It's like American and British english
It's all definitions, politics and "agreed upon lies"... The fact that Arabic and Chinese are considered one language but Czech/Slovak and the Scandinavian languages are independent is a proof of that
Cross the border from western/north-western Slovakia into eastern Moravia and tell me where Slovak language ends and Czech one starts
I am pretty sure you will not be able to tell
I am not saying Czech and Slovak are one language but often the definition of what are separate languages and what are two dialects of one language is quite blurry
Zatímco švagrová štrikuje svetr a fotr plundruje špajz, sestra v ešusu ukuchtila fašírku s erteplema
Snad nám ta šlichta bude šmakovat
> que cada una haga
it's subjunctive of "hacer". Here subjunctive expresses desire
"let everyone do".
> lograr
to reach, to achieve
Lo llamo stereovisión. Cuando hablas dos idiomas de familia, entiendes lo que es importante y lo que no, que es un atributo común para la familia y que es un específico para la lengua, así que puedes concentrarte en las partes importantes
Lo sabe de las lenguas esclavas, hablo dos y así puedo entender mucho de las otras
(espero que arriba tenía sentido, castellano es mi cuarto idioma)
Eating from the same plate with one spoon and also sterling the bride
The groom needs to find her quickly because he must pay for alcohol that get drink until the bride is found
If the groom has good friends, they even put him in house collar
The husband and wife, side by side, share one bib around their necks and then eat one meal together (usually soup) where they take turn in feeding the other
We do this as well
I wouldn’t change anything on the Czech one
It’s simple and easily recognisable
Remove the blue
Those filthy Poles made us change it and I don't like it
I like the one we have, though the old Bohemian style [flag] would be cool too
Remove the blue part (It was the representation of Slovaks anyway) So that people would have no chance to tell if it is Polish or Czech and the best part is that we wouldn't get confused with Philippines anymore
I wouldn’t. But I would change the anthem's pace so it’s right again
I would add a blue horizontal line to the middle - from one side to the other
Just a little wide
Yeah because UK left the EU
It always bothered me that the two small red stripes arent symetrical so maybe change that
There would be another defenestration I suppose
I agree, but the roaring lion is just badass
Not on the official flag tho
If you have a full-time job and live at your parents, they would likely want you to pay at least your part of expenses
Not a full rent though, it would be weird
I don't think full rent, but part of expenses yes
If the house/apartment is theirs, it's usually some contribution to water and energies, if not, some contribution to their rent
Idea of getting of paying full rent is crazy
But in an argument, you can throw them out lol
I've heard anything from: "Your language sounds like a mix of French and Swedish
" to "Stop speaking Spanish
Yeah, close enough
Polish people always claim it sounds cute and child-like to them
It's kinda weird for them, because we have accent on the first syllable, so when we are talking faster it sounds like machine gun fire
To me, Hungarian, as well as Finnish, sounds like it has no intonation
Like, you can't tell when a sentence is going to end, haha
I think some of us call you "Pšonci" for the exact same reason
Lol, what
Who was that person and what planet were they from
I commonly get told that Czech sounds either like a machinegun, when I speak normally, or like Russian, when I try to sound good
Oh yeah, that's definitely true and occasionaly irritating
I always wondered what's the origin of that name
Kinda unrelated, but when we come to visit you in summer, many of us giggle like idiots in restaurants and fast food stands, because you word for drinks "pića" is the same as our word for pussy - "piča" xd
So seeing the prices for sparkling pussy, alcoholic pussy, hot pussy
is a little bit funny
Some dude from the US
He also thought Czech Republic is an island
Maybe because včela is pszczoła.
This is pretty accurate
I remember when I was a kid, I just sang along gibberish to english songs that sounded aaaalmost right (to my ears)
but were complete nonsense
Thank you Croatia for being such a great vacation destination and being welcoming and all
Thank you Romania for being such good pals throughout the 20th century (1919, 1945, 1968)
Don't forget the inspiration for croissants to go with the coffee
Best bro countries forever
Do you lock the door of your house/apartment when you're at home
I live in a small town in Czechia and I think it varies
My parents often argued about this - dad didn't really care during the day but would lock it at night
My mom always wanted the door locked, especially after one of dad's colleagues who was looking for him just entered because nobody heard his knocking and basically went through our house without anyone noticing while my mom was showering
No, you can't enter building and the flat without key anyway so there isn't any risk someone will randomly walk in
Home with parents on the countryside - no, only for the night, we were never used to lock otherwise
Home with just myself in the city - yes
You can't get into the main door of the building without a key from outside and there is only few people living here but I still lock the door and leave the keys in for a simple reason - I easily lose my things "somewhere inside" and I always remember where my keys are this way
I lock the door all the time even though the door can't be opened from the outside and you need a key
I also leave the keys in the lock
This way I never forget my keys when going out
When at home where you can’t open the unlocked door from the outside, no
In my student appartment where you can unless it’s locked and where neighbours and workers leavse the downstairs entry open, yes
Living in a village, we don't lock the door during daytime since anyone who wants to enter the house needs to walk through the front yard first and it's *very* unlikely that someone with bad intentions would just enter our property like that as they could be easily seen in the open by neighbours or random passersby
True, occasionaly someone (usually a friend or a relative) enters the house itself uninvited when looking for one of us (like if they are not sure that the doorbell works) but they usually just open the door into the entry hall, shouting "is anybody home
" without actually entering when there's no reply so we've never seen that as a problem (also, this obviously used to happen more before we had mobile phones - it's pretty rare these days)
We do lock at night
And I did lock my front door when I was living in a city
I mean I only actually *locked* them at night too but there usually isn't a door handle or a knob you can use to open the door easily without a key from the outside on front doors of houses which you enter directly from the street or flats in apartment buildings
I'm also from small town/big village and I lock my doors only when I go sleep
Nope, there is a handle on both sides and you have to lock them with a key
Coutryside
Sure, but an apartment won't have a door handle at the outside
About [this] Left is from outside so no need to lock yourself

We are changing our Health Minister once again
He just went to a restaurant at night even though he himself closed them the day before
Our Minister of Health breaking his own goddamn Anti-Covid state of emergency rules
He went to a pub (they are closed now) after 22:00 (absolutely forbidden) and he was photographed getting into his car without a mask on (also forbidden since his driver was around)
It's fucking hilarious
It has to be, otherwise it would be really sad and we can't take that right now
Edit: Forgot to mention the government wants him to abdicate from the post, but he don't wanna and it seems like they don't have anyone, literally no one who would want his job now
Also he's only been the minister for like a month because the previous guy couldn't take it anymore (he got blamed for our current "Best in Covid" situation which, to be fair, is mostly the fault of our government having no fucking idea what they're doing
They're only there to tunnel, after all, so they don't have a fucking clue how to actually govern shit)
The only things we talk about here are things that have something to do with covid
We had news about in Czechia as well, the LGBT situation too
It's horrible what is happening
It's like going back to the dark ages
For technical sciences it's Czech Technical University in Prague (ČVUT) and for everything else it's Charles's University (UK)
Charles University in considered more prestigious because it is the oldest university in Central and Eastern Europe (it was founded in 1348)
That would be Charles University
It's, I think, the 9th oldest in the world, and it's also 100th most prestigious in the world (that doesn't sound impressive, but given, how many universities exist worldwide, it is impressive IMO)
The Charles University is the most famous one (and definitely the oldest one), I would say
If has lots of different faculties (from sciences to theology)
They definitely have one of the best natural sciences (geography, geology, chemistry, biology) faculty and the faculty of mathematics and physics is good too
The law faculty is great (from what I heard)
There is also ČVUT, which is mostly tech oriented
There’s a lot of universities you can choose from
I might be a liiittle bit biased
I actually study at the CU (or UK, as in Univerzita Karlova)
I also applied for MUNI (also a good university) and UPCE
Basically every big city has a university
Also ČVUT for STEM subject and AMU for arts
Sadly, it only enjoys and maximizes its former glory
They are completely outdated and out of touch
Teaching there is not great or  good
Masaryk uni, olomouc, cvut, vscht all are better choices
>Brno
>prestigious
(we still love you, your beloved ČVUT)
If I learned one thing in my (not so many) years, it's that every country has something interesting going for it
I didn't think a lot of Estonia, Lithuania or Bosnia, before I visited them, but I was always surprised by the interesting things that they have and that I had no idea about
But I guess I'm easy to please
I loved Denmark for the bicycle culture and overall positivity, Romania for the countryside, Lithuania for the language and fascinating history etc
If I absolutely had to go with my gut, I would say that Andorra, Luxembourg, Belarus or Malta don't really draw my interest all that much, but I am pretty sure that if I visited them or did a bit of research, I would inevitably find something interesting about them
Probably Luxembourg
I understand it’s beautiful, well-maintained, and rich, but I feel like I don’t belong and that I can see more of what it has to offer in neighbouring countries
Also expensive to visit
Same with Lichtenstein and even Switzerland
I’ve spent plenty of time bleeding my wallet dry in Germany and Austria and feel like I would get to see a more extreme version of what I’ve already seen
I’m torn about Belarus, Ukraine, Russia, Hungary, Slovenia, Albania, and Slovakia
I’m generally disinterested in the Balkan countries save for the food and pictures of lanscapes etc
I have visited Slovakia many times but I’d say the only interesting part is the Tatra mountains, which have worse services and same prices as the Austrian Apls
Eastern Europe makes me sad
Oh, and Spain and Portugal, as I’ve mentioned elsewhere
Least interesting
I would definitely say Romania
It's the last country I can think of and I can't even try to find something interesting about it
I would love to hear some cool things about Romania, though
If anyone has any
Epic Sax guy is from there
Don't forget Transnistria, beautiful country in its own way
Don't they sell cheap booze and cigarettes
I, your czech neighbour, can absolutely say that I love the Tatras
You also have great spas
Never been to one though
Slovakia is famous here for Halušky, cheese and recently TatraTea, also for Wild animals coming across the border
Slovakia has great mountains
Do you find the language uninteresting just because we are slavic
Zdob şi Zdub is epic too:
This sounds very bad without context
You thought I mistook Bosnia for Latvia
Haha, no, they were not supposed to be related
Oh yes
I only learned about it yesterday and it kind of blew my mind
Seconded
I knew next to nothing about Bosnia before I visited it and now it's one of my favorite countries in Europe
Have visited it three times and am planning to go again
Did anyone said Beer
Mluvil jsem o medvědech a vlcích, ne o premiérech
Halušky are the shit
No idea why, but even here, in a country next door, one can't get good halušky
But that's the fun, and you better shouldn't sneak any schwas there
You could also try to say the glorious ř, hmm like in this word: třtina
(Btw
ř, rž, žr all sound different to our ears)
Yep the dual number is nice, and it sounds interesting in archaic Czech
I'd be cool with it if were productive in Czech
At least we have the vocative case productive, which is nice
But what do you mean by odd Slovenian pronouns
For all Czechs I can only say, Yes, all of it
I see, do you have any particular pronouns in mind
Because they're mundane to me as there's like almost 1:1 correspondence to Czech ones
I'd say we're corrupt the same way we've always been, be it middle ages or current year
Nepotism, tax evasion, embezzlement, bloated budgets for public works that receive EU grants, bribes, overpriced roads and highways that fall apart constantly, conflict of interest
It's a czech nature to skim the law and find new ways of bending it to our will
We are the master lawbenders
Smetana - Vltava (moldau)
I would say Vltava from Bedřich Smetana
Vltava = Moldau
Foolish choice
It's obviously [*Hejtrs v rohu*] by *Metrix Steel, legenda Hroznové lhoty*.
Nope, it's [this
To je klenot no nebo Praha žije byla jedno dobu celkem hitovka jeste:D
Don't worry, we are too
Well, I don't visit Prague city centre often, so only thing I can tell that I am really in large city is that my commuting to work is with metro which frequently goes in 2-3 minutes intervals
I get woken up almost everyday around 6:30 because that's apparently a prime time for pigeons to have a swingers party at my balcony
Also it's hot as hell, especially when there are no trees in my street
Other than that, fine
Would switch it for a nice house somewhere outside of the city in a blink of an eye if I could tho
Prague is full of tourists in the city centre
The city transport is fine
It gets progressively uglier towards the city’s periphery
There is a lot of housing estates, warehouses and some factories
Some parts are more beautiful than the others
It’s a diverse city, I would say
Some Prague residents are kinda arrogant about being from Prague lol
It’s a beautiful city though
I visited Vienna once for a day
Its like Prague but better in nearly every way
I absolutely loved it
Definitely considering moving there in the future, though your dialect makes my German feel a tad useless sometimes
The problem is probably that there are a lot of mountain ranges in between
For sure, to some extent
I think we are (or were) selling some electricity from one of our nuclear powerplants, Temelín, to the Austrians
Ironically, they were vehemently protesting against its construction back in the 2000s or so, though
Brno
Or Prague-countryside
Or Šalingrad (šalina is the term for tramway there for whatever reason real people can't comprehend)
It is the mythical land of spirits
Many, many spirits
Beer too I guess
It is Florida of the Czechs
Brno and sometimes Ostrava, even though Brno is usually called a shithole etc
I've heard people call it non existent etc
I would say the city of Brno
It’s kind of a punching bag of a city
It’s the center of a lot of jokes
Ah, I remember that
It was quite the topic back in the day, since it's just across the border
My teacher often talked about her visit there
She was stopped on the street by old women eager to speak in Czech they still remembered because they learned it in childhood
She travelled there some 20 years ago
I think we'll pass, Slovaks would get a bit nervous
Can't be stressing our lil' bro
Václav, Karel, Jiří, Otakar, Vladislav, Boleslav, František
Marie, Anežka
I'm named František, a czech version of German "Franz" after Franz Joseph I.
Those sound too normal
We need to go deeper: Mojmír, Rostislav, Svatopluk, Slavomír, Bořivoj, Spytihněv, Vratislav, Oldřich, Jaromír Břetislav
Počítají se Habsburkové?
Jasně. Pokud jsou korunovaní, což vylučuje Ferdinanda V., Františka Josefa a Karla

je jako císař Svaté říše římské.
Ta nejednotnost v číslování je někdy k vzteku - Karel IV
je IV
, protože si ho rádi pamatujeme jako skvělého císaře, ale jeho syn Václav je v učebnicích jako IV
, protože jeho císařské angažmá stálo za starou bačkoru - Němci ho sesadili
Jako císař je pochopitelně I.
Náš Karel III
je vévoda bavorský, zvolený jako protikrál, když chtěli všichni sousedi roztrhat Rakousko, protože Habsburkové jako původní rod vymřeli po meči otcem Marie Terezie (Karlem VI
/II
Že se to nepovedlo je celkem zázrak, a pro nás super věc, protože Česko a Morava se měly rozdělit mezi vítěze
Technicky jeho korunovace byla dost pochybná záležitost a Habsburkové ji samozřejmě neuznávali, ale král aspoň chvíli v Čechách byl
To z Karla I. (jako rakouského císaře) dělá českého Karla IV
- až na to, že se nikdy nenechal korunovat
Ale nikdo mu nikdy Karel IV
neřekne z dost jasných důvodů. Když o něm mluvíme jako o českém králi (jako v tomhle kontextu), tak bychom technicky měli
Bordel, co
V historii se docela význam, jen jsem myslel že mluvíš o jiném Karlovi, a to o posledním českým královi Karlovi VI
Ale poslední český král je Karel I., císař rakouský, 1916-1918
Proč Karel VI
Pokud nepočítáš nekorunované, tak je to František I.
Myslím že v Rakousku byl I. a v Česku VI
, ale možná se pletu
Já jsem právě dopočítal IV
Karel Lucemburský, Karel Habsburský - poslední Habsburk, Karel Bavorský, tenhle Karel
Nemám pocit že někoho zapomínám?
Hele to se dá lehce zjistit
Tak jsme se sekli oba
V Česku to byl Karel III
Pokud se nepočítá Karel Bavorský, tak jo
Habsburkové ho nepočítali, tak se asi tak tituloval
Na rozdíl od něj byl ale Bavor korunovaný, tak si udělej vlastní obrázek, jak to brát.
In Futurama, French is a dead language like latin
But in France, they have German as dead language
I think czech bob the builder contains some english words
Whether *koprovka* ("dill cream sauce") is great or terrible
One half of people love it, the other half hate it
[With rose hip sauce or with sauerkraut
A whip
Once again, I am forced to laugh at the Polish language
I'm team sour cream
It ain't proper borsch without sour cream
If it's not a Czech beer, it sucks, so they suck both, solved it for ya
We call it "patička", literally "little heel" or "Hacke".
I always thought in German the gender of brands is based on the gender of the product
Nutella is feminine, because Haselnusscreme is feminine
There Is only two types of czechs
Those who hate koprovka And those who Are Wrong
It's all good until weird people start putting yogurt there
I like "die Nutella" more for some reason but it may be just that I don't like Nutella
Also feminine in Czech
I imagine people who like it as someone who grew in the woods unnoticed and never went to school, and their mom was making it for them
Because once you have it in school canteen, you hate it and there's no going back
Koprovka is good, but I never ate it at school, only from fresh ingredients, made by my mom
We usually put butter on bread, so it feels more "kosher" to stick cheese on butter (both milk products) than to put ham on butter
Yes
It sounds like serník, which would derive from srát, which means to shit
This would make any kind of spread including possibly butter masculine too
Alright, this rule has some flaws
My dad makes the best koprovka
Koprovka is plain awesome
Never had issue with it even in school
We had pretty good food in school
Now horseradish sauce, that's just plain evil
here, we have sýr.
Except platypus - ptakopysk - birdylip, for example raccoon - mýval - literally "used to wash". Or sloth - lenochod - lazy walker
Also whale - "velryba" - literally "megafish".
We call raccoon Mýval - washer
First thing that came to mind is Žijeme len raz  It is a Slovak song but it played everywhere and all the time in 2012
Žijeme Len Raz by EGO
Even though its a Slovak song, here in czechia it blasts every summer too, all day long, baby
Tbh not only 2012, I still hear it blast from the radio sometimes
Blanka tunnel, Prague subway line D, Subway or rail line to the (Václav Havel) Ruzyně airport,  trams on Václavské náměstí, I could continue to the infinity, and that's only Prague
Oh yeah
Not as many badly executed projects as not executed at all for years/decades because of political squabbles
That applies to most of our unfinished highways, a new train station for Brno, any high speed railways, P+R systems, metro/railway connection to the Prague airport (currently, your only options are buses and taxis, and that's a pretty big airport),... We always have something like this going on
Sometimes there are environmental activists delaying the construction of a highway, for example, sometimes it's just an excuse from incompetent politicians
Now things that were badly executed: the introduction of electronic public transport passes in Prague ("Opencard") was known as a giant overpriced scam, they have since been replaced by a different provider
Then there was the "toll gate controversy", revolving around the government singing very disadvantageous deals with the private company that was going to administer a new automated system of collecting highway tolls from trucks
All the way back in the 90s, we had "Internet for schools", a similar scam involving famously overpriced IT equipment for public schools
And while we're on the topic of schools - "státní maturita", an attempt to standardize high school final exams, started in 2012 and has been quite a mess ever since
The number and selection of subjects have changed, test difficulty is always criticized as too low and too high at the same time, and ministers of education flip flop on the inclusion of a mandatory maths exam almost every year
I also remember there was some controversy about a renovation of the Charles Bridge in Prague, like some people thought it was badly done and damaged, but I don't remember what the conclusion of that was anymore  You can barely keep track of all the nonsense in this country, honestly
I don't see how Metro D, rail line to Vaclav Havel airport or trams on Václavské náměstí are badly executed projects, since the construction works on them didn't even properly start
I mean yeah, the planning of these is really drawn-out, but isn't that to be expected for every big infrastructure project
Media says yes, but personally, I haven't noticed any panic
Some people do, some people don't. My nation is good at having fun out of it
People at my work stay calm and we are all tired of all-going news with nonsense numbers
Heck yeah they do
Also one thing
It looks like everyone here is fucking panic buying plane tickets the fucking to italy smh
Yes, and its crazy
Yes, but shops are refilling stock quickly and some of them started even discounts of these particular items
>There is toilet roll everywhere
I can't help myself, but this sounded like a horror movie quote in my head when I read it
"Toilet rolls
they
they are EVERYWHERE
" \*Wilhelm scream as a giant tide of TP buries everyone alive\*
They are just really easy to slide under the quarantine doors
I don't know about European, so I'll just submit a Czech one - *čtyřlístek*.
(cztyř lees tech - you really can't transcribe ř into English)
It means four-leaf clover
And it's the perfect combination of a rough consonant grouping and a soft deminutive
Kurva
It's the only word you need, it can mean anything
Half French, half Germanic, weird spelling, many silent letters - it truly represents
Terry Pratchett almost did just [that
In Czech republic Herbert, Bohumil and Ernest
They are all German XD
I rly don’t Tomáš (male) and Hedvika (female)
Květoslav (essentially Florian) a Chrudoš (the one who weakens)
Did you not hear about the angry parents who named their daughters Daenerys
The word "robot" is probably the most regularly used thing a Czech man invented
Contact lenses, lightning rod, ship propeller or blood types* are also cool tho
Contact lenses and beer that doesn't taste like shit
Many good stuff, but the most important worldwide are: Contact lenses, modern-ish propeller (first one, that was better than paddle wheel), Silon, and others
Also blood plasma, cytoplasm, sweat glands and many other anatomical things were first described by Jan Evangelista Purkyňe
And Řehoř/Gregor Mendel discovered genetics and the laws of trait inheritance
[Top 10 Czech inventions]
Yeah I was wrong about that, our guy just added to the research with the AB group
(alongside other people who discovered it around the same time)
Yep, robota is the word it originates from, which is an unpaid unfree work in Czech language
(and regular work in many other Slavic languages afaik)
Fun fact: I live in town where he was born
We have a lot of things named after him there
We invented meth
Jeez
Franklin and Diviš invented it independently two years apart
Yeah, in the play they're used as slaves/cannon fodders that eventually revolt and kill all humans
Yeah, they're basically "workers".
Well from Russian point of view at least, because Russian is one of the languages where работа means regular work, so the word origin might seem kinda innocent for them
But when you keep in mind it was invented by a Czech, the robots are basically meant to be slaves
They were biological robots in the original work, humanoids similar to Frankenstein's monster
I'm sorry but *Carel Capec* hurts my Czech eyes
With no offense, makes sense
Long spoon
Tiny spoon
Sorry
ATM fees and the DCC scam
It's crazy that I am punished with ridiculous additional fees for not being a local citizen
Just because my card was issued in another EU country
Maybe not the most important, but elections could use some
Czech 2 day long elections are the most useless thing ever, and I'm sure the methods of counting votes could be improved as well
Standardized mail-in or electronic voting for citizens living in other EU countries
Can't we all just copy the e-government stuff from Estonia or something
Not politicians, but customers too
Demand for international travel is much lower than the domestic one
Both railway and roads
Personally, I rather believe politicians push for international connections of any way more than necessary
I don't think many countries in the EU are ready for it yet
It might cause a massive unemployment problem
> Power systems, track gauges, signals, platform heights, etc
These aren't standardized on the national level either :( Two different platform heights in Germany, 2 (+2 more unique single line each) electrification systems in Czechia
Train control
I'd rather point to the official map:  (and in general
Revolut doesn't help here
It's the fee charged by the ATM itself, not your bank
When the ATM detects your card is issued abroad, it adds a fee 2-7 EUR
This is very common especially in tourist destinations
Have you ever tried it
I have a Revolut card with a Brittish BIN, I have tried to withdraw money many times
In Czechia, Moneta Money Bank ATMs ask for additional 7 EUR, ČS ATMs asks for 5 EUR, on Rhode, the Pireus Bank ATM asked for 3 EUR and so on
There is reason this list exists:
Unfortunately more and more banks are using this trick to rob tourists and more and more terminals offer DCC to confuse you and trick you into using unfavorable conversion rate
It's like a plague, I've been also offered DCC few times when paying contactless, which is pure evil
We used to insult people by marking them as StB [estébák] (civil associates of secret police)
It faded away, but it's back again now, as prime minister was one of 'em and he's a great example of those fucking rats
Not in that sense
Czechs use "estébák" more
The StB was kind of like Gestapo, but during the socialist era
So the term collaborator is mostly meant like a collaborator with the communists rather than nazis
But we do use "fašista" (a fascist) and "nácek" (a nazi) as an insult too
And there actually is a neonazi group
Fun fact: We allegedly (most likely lol) have an "estébák" as our prime minister now
There are StB papers with his fake StB name and everything
It’s wild
Yes, it's still done, usually reserved for people with questionable ties with China and Russia
I'd say "estébák" is used here
Basically it is a communist version of Gestapo
It's used when someone reports something totally not harmful to anyone
Did you park your car on a sidewalk at 1am for 5 minutes and someone called the police
That person is a fucking estébák. I hope you kinda understand it
We have an ongoing argument here (sort of) about whether "Vlasovci" (the soldiers around Vlasov) were Nazis or not
The "main face" in this argument is the mayor of Řeporyje - Pavel Novotný. He even made a memorial for them
Idk what to think about it, but Novotný seems like a cool dude
He’s sort of controversial but he knows what’s up
That’s the thing
On one side, people say that they helped liberate Prague
On the other side, people say that they were Nazis
But Koněv also did help with the liberation, and most people don’t like him, because he was a Soviet (and with all the stuff that happened here after the war - the socialist era
And I don’t know what to make of it
They both liberated us
Euro truck simulator, Factorio, Mafia 1, Arma, Beat saber, Kingdom come deliverance, Space engineers, someday you'll return, Vietcong, Samorost
I only know Space Engineers, but there may more well known video gamеs out there
Euro truck Sim is a check game
Damn I never had any idea
Although I did know Arma was
and Operation Flashpoint, Original War, Inqusitor, Polda, Spellcross etc
all Czech gems
I love everything from Remedy Entertainment
I finished Control recently and it is awesome how it fits into the same universe as Alan Wake
I would love to play the remaster of the first three Killzone games on PS5
Hopefully one day
TIL, thanks
Yeah these type of people can spend their whole day in a truck and when they come home, they play ETS on their triple monitor setup with direct drive steering wheel and a racing chair and what not
But I mean, if they enjoy it, good for them
Punching above our weight
I have finished mafia 1 so many time I lost count
But I am kinda afraid about the remake, I am afraid I will be disapointed
Oh are they really
I didn't know that, good to know
SCS has a really nice HQ in Prague
Yeah Daniel Vavra has the tendency to stick his nose into everything
I don't know what opinions he has and what he prophets to public
But I don't really care
I follow the rule, judge the art, not the artist
And what matters is that KC:D and Mafia are just great games
Although it is understandable it could leave a bad taste in someones mouth knowing
He's not though
Quick question, how does a political viewpoint of a dev change a game so much that you cannot like it
If you gonna throw around these serious accusations like confetti, they will eventually become meaningless
You can disagree with others opinions but you should be really careful before calling someone "alt-right adjacent cunt".
The main guy is actually slovak, but the rest of the team is czech and their studio is in Prague
Not sure, if there are, they are probably a minority in the team
Yeah no, basically no one from Czech republic denies the holocaust
And for good reason too, [we have many cities that were used as concentration camps] and memorials for fallen man, women and children
You get taken to these places as a child with school fairly early
Terezín is a place everyone goes to before being 15 at least
I was there with our whole class when I was in middle school
Everybody in the country knows it's real and fucked
I'd be surprised if more than a thousand people in the whole country deny it
Also, you know, Kingdome come wasn't made by a single fucking person
It's made Warhorse Studios which has let me see \*rustles through the 1st page of google you could have fucking looked up\* oh you know, 131 employees
So no, the viewpoint of a single dev on the game, even a main dev on the game doesn't fucking destroy it
One Czech Journalist prove that out eight out of ten slices of bread fall to the grease sight
The report took more than 4 minutes
Here a link:
Here is the report:
She is also saying things like, there is now relatively high temperature minus 11C° (don't remember last time were it was so cold, I nearly haven't seen snow this winter but I don't live in the mountains)
But this is going to be much worse, the temperature will drop to minus 40C°! (Don't know how she got that number, It would be a record)
Its the best Netflix show imo
I still don’t why I enjoyed it so much given the fact I was totally lost for 80% of the show
I eventually lost interest in it, would have preffered if there was more vilain action and less “nobody knows what to do”. Maybe I stuck out with it for so long was because one of the characters has my BF’s name and I smiled whenever someone called out for him
I found it to be mediocre
The soundtrack was good, but other than that it's nothing we haven't seen many times before
The dialogue is a bit cringy at times, too
Completely lost interest after the first season
It was kinda pain to watch because of how long and confusing the episodes were, my brother literally had to drag me in front of the screen and make me continue watching lol
But I'm so glad he did because it was a very unique experience
The ending left me absolutely speechless
I don't think it's very popular here, feel like only hardcore series fans know it but those who do love it
I also watched the other German stuff available on Netflix, like How to sell drugs online or Issi und Ossy and loved all of it
I think their production is really good and very relatable to me too, unlike some US or UK shows
I watched it, but I've not yet seen season 3 for various Reasons
But
I can Tell that the first two seasons Are great
I’d like to thank Slovakia for the beautiful Tatra mountains and being together with us for a long time, Germany for trading with us, Poland for cheap sweets and mayonnaise and Austria for Alps
I would like to thank Romania for not participating in invasion of 1968
As a good ol' bitter Czech I have noone to thank cuz everyone sucks/sucked
Germany is buying a lots of our products
Like 100 billions euro per year
Thanks Germany
Something similiar here in Czechia
Austrains complain for us having a nuclear power plant near Czech-austrian border
Lmao it doesn't matter where is the power plant in Czech Republic, It's so small that where ever will it be it will still hit Austria with the nuclear fallout
(the name of the powerplant is either Temelín or Dukovany, cant remember which one is it rn)
Yep, it’s called Winiary, if you ever go to Poland definitely try it, it’s really good
I see we have pretty much the same look on history haha
But they buy our stuff
About 30 percent of Czech export is to Germany
Yeah man they compelety fuck us over, both of us
Zero fucks given, they didn't want to save europe from war, they wanted to save their asses from war
Yeah they moved a bunch of their industry in WW2 here, thx much <3
Probably not, I hope you enjoy the trip
It has to be Kofola for the Czech Republic for sure
Kofola is literally the greatest soda on planet earth and every living being should drink it instead of water
Here in the czech republic we have kofola, a cola with herbs
It is extremely popular here
I love it
Pepsi nebo coca-colu seženeš všude, kofola je klasika
I undestand Youtube can be confused because I switching between three languages
But damn I want results in language I am curently using, not some shity auto-translate which dont make sense
I think I've seen that once on someone elses computer
It was awful
I force Youtube to use English locale, so that likely disables the feature
Never ever seen that
I absolutely hate it
> Don't you hate Youtube auto title & description translations to your local language
Yes, I don't.
> Apparently you can't disable it
Huh
I don't understand
All videos with auto subs have them are off by default for me and I can switch them on and off as I please
Titles are always in their original language
I see
I assumed "titles" means subtitles because title being translated is alien to me
And apparently being unfamiliar with this issue is offensive
The same here
Ours wasn't a famous dictatorship, just a regular run-of-the-mill communist dictatorship, but making fun of it, not to mention talking about it, is pretty commonplace and not taboo at all
In fact, it's a subject of some of the popular films and books and generally people make jokes about communism on a daily basis
Again, it's mostly only the old people who are nostalgic of communism and it's very rare to run into someone who'll you get into a heated argument over it with
Exactly, if I had a crown each time I said "za tohle jsem klíčema nezvonil tyvole" I could get a meal in a cheaper restaurant
I fully agree
For the most part you have dealt with it great
I don't understand the occasional re-emergence of the Schuldkultur, as people today have not that much in common with the past and think they shouldn't be penalised in any way for it
The only time where I think more work has to be done is if sometimes you see people opening up old unnecessary wounds
Like some Bavarian politicians, aristocratic Germans and once even the chancellor herself talking about CZ compensating the Sudeten Germans (which is a completely idiotic proposition given the context and complexity)
Or when you still see instances of people having Nazi confiscated Jewish artwork and wealth (like the art dealer who's father got it from the Nazis
Gurlitt family they're called I believe)
But those are small individual issues and not reflective of the whole development
That's great to hear
I also visited the Auschwitz memorial around 4 years ago and it's really powerful stuff
And not feeling guilt but instead responsibility and awareness of what humans are capable of if pushed to limits is a healthy attitude that I think most people who know a thing about history should adopt
Kudos to you
Depends, if there's a Czech dub I'm DEFINITELY playing it with that but I mostly use English subtitles
English
I enjoy more complex strategies and rpgs and I usually need to search in English walkthroughs and wikis or want to use English mods
I have no problem with English and prefer consistency
Czech language is actually translated quite often, but I don’t mind having it in english
English is my 2nd nature so I don’t even notice it sometimes
Kingdome Come is such a awesome game
, I wish they'll add Czech dubbing later to make it perfect tho
How far in are you
I have a story mission related question
Vietkong
Warcraft 3
I think you forgot about the Witcher
There is Czech localisation in a bit, all menus and interface is is Czech, as well as subtitles
The Witcher 1 does
I see
I'm currently in Rattay, the watch with Slavík mission, I picked up a armor, went to the guy and it said rep lost, and he went along the lines that I'm unprepared
I dunno what to do
Thanks
I swear the amount of Pražáci on holidays here kills me
I speak four foreign languages and I definitely feel it's not enough
I would like to learn at least few more
I like it more and more with every language I learn
I mean, I can always learn another one (Spanish would be cool), but I'm fine with what I know now
No, not really
Imo it comes down to the use-case
Here in Czech Republic, everyone is expected to speak Czech
We don't speak our neighboring languages on daily basis
I speak English fluently, which opens many doors already
Probably most, proportionally
During high school and uni, I studies Russian and Spanish
Forgot most of them, because I don't need them
I have no interest in traveling to Spain or Russia and in their popculture and the languages are virtually useless in business here (definitely in IT)
Over time however, I picked up several hobbies where knowing Japanese would be very useful
I have already visited Japan once and would like to again
So I'm learning Japanese, since I now have a use-case for it
Same - model making, manga, Japanese music - Japanese everywhere
Started maybe 2 years ago and it's been a journey
It's definitely not easy, but I have to say, it's very rewarding, especially once you get few hundred kanji under your belt and can start parsing sentences without furigana (albeit slowly)
We used to build these as kids, but they definitely are not common in Czechia
"The Bolevec disaster" were tragic explosions in the ammunition factory of the Skoda Works in Pilsen in 1917
The "Střílna" ammunition factory was located on the northern edge of Bolevec in Pilsen
Since 1901, there has been a test range of cannons assembled in Skoda in the center of Pilsen, and even before the First World War, ammunition was also produced here
On May 25, 1917, one of the greatest war tragedies in the Pilsen Region took place in the factory
203 people died and there were over 1000 injured
The causes of the explosions are related to the increasing demands of ammunition supplies before and during World War
The factory was overstocked  with ammunition
The explosions caused damage up to 6 kilometers from the explosions

I used to drink a lot of milk until I was put on medication that makes me extra gassy
Milk didn't really helo with that so now I drink soy milk
not me, never liked
beer with milk
I thought I was the only one
I love it
I drink a cup each morning
In the morning I prefer warm milk
Sometimes I add a spoon of honey or cacao
Cereal with milk are also awesome
Or butter biscuits that I can dip in the milk
And sometimes I will have a cup or two in the evening
Then I prefer cold milk
Preferably not fridge cold, but more like cellar cold (which is where it's usually stored until opened)
I went trough a phase as a teenager where I drank like a 1+ litre of milk every day
Unfortunately only after I had broken a leg
However, I have to admit, I don't really like fresh milk (non pasteurized)
For some reason, the taste is just strange and I generally prefer regular pasteurized milk
And always whole milk (3,5%)
I really expected some Clockwork orange jokes in here
Milk is a blessed beverage
Unfortunately, I have broken a bone in my life already, but I try not to say that on /r/Neverbrokeabone so I don't get banned
So how is milk in Japan
I should have though of trying it when I went there
They can't stop us
Siberia
"Silent/calm like in Siberia" (Ticho/klid jak na Sibiři) is a very common saying
One term that I can think of is the somewhat vulgar "prdel světa"
We say often, vulgary, "v nějaký prdeli" which translates to "In some asshole"
Prievidza je slovenský Bruntál?
So far without any problems, no confirmed case in our hospital
We have 90 empty beds ready with lung ventilations
Only problem is that we need more respirators bud we should get a big delivery later today
Still we are little worried because our district in Prague have the biggest percentage of the old people
On monday we should get help from med students in last year of their studies
We are preparing for the worst but everyone is calm
Germany and socks in sandals stereotype
We do that too
We got one of the biggest beer cultures in the world
Germany or Ireland don't even come close
Important to note that National Socialism doesn't equate nazism
There were a lot of national socialist parties in interwar Europe and pretty much none of them bar for the German one had even a slight resemblance of the NSDAP agenda
You have great herring
Divine herring, a fish I'd kill for
Also cheeses
And stroopwaffel
But otherwise, yes
Epic rap battle of history: Portugal vs Germany
In that case, why do you eat it
Chicken is probably the most bland meat
> just confusing naming on the nazis part i guess
I guess that I may have been a bit mistaken on this and Czechoslovakia may have been the odd one out
Gotta check more sources
Bohemia/Czechoslovakia had a "National Socialist" party that was generally speaking a fairly progressive democratic centre-left party, in a cohort with the Social Democrats during the Interwar period after the communist wing split off in the 1920s.
They were a very popular party, the 2nd Czechoslovak President Beneš was a big supporter of theirs
The party got purged and reformed into a symbolic puppet of the communist party after 1948 unfortunately
If properly cooked, everything is delicious
Other meat however, can be delicious even when mediocry cooked
Because we have beautiful old buildings in almost every city, that would be overshadowed (literally) by them
If it is hide and seek quote than it is "Před pikolou za pikolou nesmí nikdo stát, nebo nebudu hrát. Už jdu
Před pikolou za pikolou nikdo nesmí stát nebo nebudu hrát.
Translation: beyond my english level forever
In front of the pikola, behind of the pikola none cannot stay or i wont play
Pikola - place where you count and say the name of the player you see
Říkáte taky někde na Slovensku: ,,Před pikolou za pikolou nikdo nesmí stát, jinak nebudu hrát. Už jdu
Also the act of being the seeker is called *pikat*. When the seeker finds the hider, they shout: *"Deset, dvacet"* (Ten, twenty) + the hider's name
At this point, the hider is *zapikaný*. I really wonder where the root *pik* comes from
We have a word - píka - pike (kind of a spear i guess) and i think a dick in danish is pik
So yeah a "pointy" object
Also theres pikola - piccola fluete and pikolík - busyboy/potboy
Slovak is not the same language but It's very close so I'm gonna treat it as such
I don't think anyone really cares if a Slovak speaks his language or tries to speak czech since everyone understands each other anyways
Many Slovaks learn czech after settling here but it isn't necessary
Being first car is more relaxing, since you don't have focus on the car ahead of you
I feel the same about Germans
Czechs reject the label of Eastern Europe because they also like to feel superior to everyone to the East of them, so it's like a slur to them
If we were both in the "Eastern Europe" category, how would we justify looking down on all the Ukrainians, Moldovans, Romanians and Bulgarians we use for underpaid labor
I mean
academics would give you many reasons why Czechia is supposedly culturally closer to Austria and Germany than to other post-Communist nations, but I don't think that's the reason why most people feel so strongly about these labels if we're being honest
You will unfortunately need to choose between summer or winter time soon, but I have read that Spanish people actually support summer time
Is this true
Because it would mean sunrise at 9:30 and sunset at 19:00 in winter
what piss me more on German highways are germans overtaking imaginary cars
Not people forget themselves in left lane or ignorant blocking left lane but Germans start overtaking car hundreds meters before it is necessary, not willing speed up so you have to simply slow down when actually both of us can overtake that truck without anyone need to brake down or speed up
literally only in Germany, doesn't matter if I cross to Bavaria or Saxony, this is something I will encounter on first 10-20 kilometers
In czech, we call vacuum cleaning "luxovat" after a vacuum cleaner brand from a hundred years ago
Yup, drak for both
And as you mentioned "zmij", we have zmije which is viper
In czech they can be both called 'drak', but a kite is often called 'papírový drak' (paper dragon)
Also koruna for both our currency and crown (either the jewel or the thing a dentist puts in your tooth when it is diseased)
I believe those are called homonyms (concretely homographs and homophones)
Zmije in our language is specifically a viper
Snake generally is had
No, rattlesnake is chřestýš, viper is zmije (or is it adder
I'm sure about Czech, not so much about English - for example puff adder is zmije útočná, sand viper is zmije růžkatá, both means zmije here), mamba is mamba, grass snake is užovka etc
and they all are hadi
Oh, well, that would be just venomous snake (jedovatý had), viper (zmije) is here only the specific snake with viper/adder in its name
There is the viperous (?)/zmijovití subcategory - only the snakes in this category aren't called viper if it's not their specific name, the "viper" isn't interchangable with viperous
Generally it's hadi - all snakes and then jedovatí hadi (venomous) - even cobras or any snake with venom (again, not speaking detailed zoology, but like laic public) and škrtiči (boa
or stranglers
or what is used in English)
It's basically the same meaning as in English - chřestýš, because his tail chřestí.
the most recent is from last Thursday, was a group of tourist (two girls one boy) having some mental breakdown after they were not allowed to sit at the bar (place was reserved and there were reservation signs) and obviously manager name they asking for was not given to them
They leave with "a threat" they are going to call a police, unfortunately it was at my favourite basement place with no cell signal so I missed these surprised Pikachu faces after response from police
A chinese female tourist taking a piss near the escalator leaving the Můstek metro station vestibul
I yelled at her that this is Prague, not Paris
There is lot of it
Changing many on streets, buying trdelník, and so on
Important to note that bike lanes in Amsterdam's historical centre (where I presume most of the tourists are going) aren't properly marked and the sidewalks are extremely narrow and often than not littered with other bikes or people just standing in the way
I had a massive headache about 3 hours into my time there because I just had to be on high alert 100% of the time in case an idiot on a bike came flying down my way at speed
I know that Amsterdam obviously isn't all of the Netherlands, and the lanes outside of the centre were properly marked and planned, but the planning in the centre is just piss-poor and inexcusable
I mean we already have Black Fridays and Santas and what not, so why not this one
Yeah, nice strawman you made out of me there, assholes
First of all, pedestrians need to cross the street sometimes
There are almost no pedestrian crossings in the centre, therefore you just need to pick a spot and expect the worst
I have almost gotten hit 3 times while crossing the street because cyclists didn't yield for me when crossing, and mind you this was after I checked both ways 5 times since I have seen people crossing before me also nearly get hit
Second of all, sometimes, as I have already stated, the sidewalks aren't usable at all due to the sheer amount of bikes and people just standing around on them, there is no real way how to avoid that
Thirdly, a lot, and I mean A LOT of bikelanes are level with the sidewalks and are only separated by a slightly different pavement tile, which makes them extremely easy to miss
In one specific instance a cyclist threw herself at full speed into me and a crowd of other people trying to cross the street, ringing her bell like a maniac and yelling at us to get out of the way
Where I come from, vehicles need to yield for pedestrians
Need I continue, or will you get off your high horse and realise that the infrastructure in Amsterdam's centre sucks for anyone who isn't on two wheels
Nearly every street is flanked or cleft with a bike lane with cyclists going at breakneck speeds relatively to the amount of people there, creating an extremely hostile feeling for anyone who just wants to walk from point A to point B. I have been to several other European capitals and in none of them I have felt as ostracised from using the street as a pedestrian simply as a result of urban planning
I live in Hradec, Czechia, the most bike friendly city in the entire country
There are bike lanes and shared bike-pedestrian paths virtually everywhere, from the centre to the very suburban outskirts
I am not bad at reading traffic, you're just fabricating an image of me to make it easier for you to shit on me
I am sharing my genuine experience I've had when visiting Amsterdam, and you saying "ur wrong lol ur just stupid" isn't going to change what I've seen there
Also, if you have read my original comment, you well know I was talking about the historical centre, the part of the city with narrow and busy streets with a very random urban layout, not about the entire city
I have also had COUNTLESS experiences where bike lanes went smack-down middle of a street, sometimes cutting across sidewalks without ANY warning
And so what that the capital of your country is popular
Prague is too, and has handled the situation much, MUCH better than Amsterdam, with a much friendlier layout that has entire streets being reserved 100% for foot traffic
Think about it, if literally everyone from everywhere around the world is saying how confusing and bad the situation in Amsterdam is in regards to the clashing of cyclists and pedestrians, it just MIGHT BE a fault of the cyclists and poor planning than just everyone's elses
Newsflash, the Netherlands aren't the only country where cyclists are commonplace on the streets, it's not like everyone who hasn't lived in your country is completely oblivious of how bike traffic should work
As I've said, get off your high horse and stop defending your half-assedly planned city centre by shouting "YOU'RE JUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND BIKELANES" at everyone
Good urban planning is intuitive and doesn't require being on high alert 100% of the time when moving around in a street
It's 'venkov' in Czech Republic, which means exactly the same thing as 'vidék'.
I don't think there is a general word meaning "everything but Prague". There is a derogatory term "vidlákov" - loosely translated as "shithole"  and it's derived from vidlák - which could be translated as redneck
It can be used for any rural area and the city of Brno :))
We use the word Venkov which means rural area for literally anything outside of Prague
I’d also say ‘vidlákov’ fits, but it is mostly referred to a specific place rather than to whole area
Never heard of this, lol
Also provincie, meaning the provinces
This made my day XDDD
Well I knew that it was used and had similar meaning in other Slavic languages but I didn't know it existed in other non-related languages like Hungarian too
I mean your expectation of Czechs not understanding it wasn't exactly unfounded - we have jokes about how is Hungarian language completely uncomprehensible compared to basically any other language :D
You guys in Greece wear socks in sandals
Because if not, you cannot call your clothing “similar to Czech”
You don't need anything to cross the border
Well you should have an ID on you, but it's not like you're going through some border checkpoints
You're just hiking through a forrest and suddenly you get a message from your operator welcoming you to another country
It's no different than going the same distance in your country really, traveling wise
The trains I usually take in my hometown near the border are often starting in one country and ending in the other, you just hop on the train like on any other
Unless you live near the border, we dont go often
Language barier and also we dont have euros, so its another small hinder that you cannot pay anything without card (parking, entrance fees, icecream
There was no real change, you just dont wait at borders 30min-1h.
People in border areas casually go shopping abroad, either because of better product quality or cheaper prices
Also there are people, who Are working abroad, but living in Czechia
Here in the Czech Republic some people are married or have families in Slovakia so people visit them regulary
You just need your ID to get into countries that are in the EU
fuck, there are so many people using czenglish, even mcdonalds used it once, it was like "Jsi hungry na new burgery
" and the combination of half czech half english whole words is really fucking cringe
People seem to be amused by our informal greetings, whether it's *čau* (from the Italian ciao) or *ahoj* (from
sailors
I guess it was first documented in English
It became widespread some time before WWII because of the enormous popularity of river tourism among Czechs
Also čus from tschüss
Ah right, that makes sense
I also never thought about that despite speaking German, I'd assume it was just a variation of čau
Well, you can always take the first step and try to start a new quirky trend
Definitely Slovak (partly from immigration, partly from similarity)
Definitely Slovak and if I don't count Slovak then it is Russian
Slovak - The language is mostly the same as ours except for the ř. Almost everyone here can speak Slovak, not because they learned to, they just can
probably polish or slovak since we have a lot of people here from there
Surprising amount of my classmates are quite clueless unless you really guide them step by step
Which imo is a bit troubling in an engineering uni
I'm kinda forcing my two younger brothers to be a bit more computer literate whenever I'm back home
Explaining sw, how internet works, what each part does when we're cleaning their PC etc
Basics, but they can build upon them
I don't agree with this
I think here it's a big hit or miss
Either the person only understands phone apps and that's about it, or sits at their pc all day and can troubleshoot most problems
Though that might be because I grew up only in a few Krajs and it may be different in Morava and Slezko
Totally agree
I'm a senior software engineer, but if you want a PowerPoint presentation from me, it's gonna suck
I can add slides, text and pictures, but that's the extent of my PowerPoint skills
Same with Word formatting etc
I can use Excel reasonably well but still am no expert
Sometimes it feels like way too much
You can smell it almost all the time in Prague
I am still for legalization though
Though illegal, very popular among youth and polarizing among everyone else
I know a lot of people that smoke it
But I know WAAYYY more people that don't smoke
I'd say 2-4/10 smoke it
It's mainly that one starts to smoke it and then his friends do too as that's the case with my friends
(tho I don't smoke it) Like there's village nearby and it's easier to count the people who don't smoke it
EDIT: Oh, and it's illegal
very popular, I can choose probably any direction from our place and within 10 minutes I will reach some place where smoking whatever you want is allowed (and smoking inside itself is officially banned for over 3 years)
Not really, because it's not allowed to give kids names with "incorrect" spelling
Some of them have a few variations (for example Nikola, Nikol, Nicola, or Nicole), but they're not usually considered that strange or "quirky".
I remeber my first time in Finland, a friend of mine introduced his sister to me and I had no idea about Finnish spelling at the time, so I just did my best to remember how it sounds
I was pretty shocked that what sounds like Yennü is actually Jenny
And since then I've been confused about people who have an English sounding name, but are not English speaking natives
Wait
It’s not allowed
Could you get away with Džon or Džesika, though
I mean, that is the correct transliteration
Somebody from Vietnam I'm guessing
Well, you have to jump through hoops to get any non-standard names approved at *matriční úřad*, and "incorrect spelling" is specifically listed as something they're not okay with
However, the list of "existing names" they use allegedly has around 17 000 of them, so it's quite rare to pick something outside of that
No idea, you'd have to ask the experts at *Ústav pro jazyk český*.
I am planning to move to probably Ukraine
It is mostly dut to the fact that the Czech Government is extremely incompetent and corrupt
You don't understand the Incompetence of the Government
Also, "kolej" means both a rail and student dormitory, I don't know why
Nah, you're never more than a few kilometers away from villages, hiking trails, tourists etc
I don't really care about that TBH
I sure wish we had more space for wildlife and natural ecosystems somewhere, but I'm not an outdoorsy kinda person myself
yes, if you mean something like three or five miles
Wouldn't really bet on 8, 10 is probably impossible
These are mainly former and existing military areas where  almost no one lives, some small parts of nature parks and some border areas where population was moved away after ww2
so like the current PM
Our current prime minister is Slovak, he can’t even speak our language properly, so here’s your answer to that
Kinda controversial generally speaking, but a Slovak could be accepted (our prime minister is already Slovak)
I think it would mostly depend on their language fluency and perceived level of "integration" with the culture
I can imagine for example someone who grew up here since childhood (and - let's be real - who isn't black or brown), but just happened to be born elsewhere, getting elected in a few years, why not
I don't think it would be at all, unless that country was China
It IS quite controversial
Yep, Pfeffel was rolling in Upper East Side
Remember Schwarzenberg vs Zeman elections
Imagine he were born not in Prague, but somewhere in Germany or Austria
**things you know only because of watching The Crown*
Seznamzpravy leads some pretty interesting investigative journalism
Hospodarske Noviny have a quality journalism, but controversial owner
Reflex is vulgar right wing journal opposed to government
But these are only inconvenience for government, because prime minister OWNS largest media house and these I mentioned are just smaller players
Seznam zpravy
They're a newspapers owned by a site called [seznam
cz] \- some sort of czech google
They do a lot of investigating stuff and exposed some political scandals
Such as our prime minister kidnapping his son who was involved with him stealing 2 million euro from the EU to Crimea so he couldn't testify against him
Oh and he's still our prime minister, noone in this God forsaken country seems to care
Sadly, none
Our prime minister actually straight up owns like half of all mainstream newpapers, so that's where we're at
None, because our president owns them all
I would add Czech TV
They do pretty good job even though they are public service (payed by television licence fees)
I'd add "Deník N" and "neovlivni
cz" both of which do investigative journalism
Even though I wouldn't say the government is afraid of them
I think historically Slovakia is the only country we've ever considered our friend, others were just "neigbours" or outright rivals (Poland, Hungary, Austria) and sometimes even bullies (Germany, Austria)
And before modern Slovakia popped out, we had the most friendly relations with Slovaks and Sorbs
But our ancient nemesis
Liechtenstein
We've only formally established relations 10 years ago and there are still disputes
Slovakia or Russia (before 1917)
Basically any slavic country except Poland
I mean we sure do like your beaches
If only more of your tourists would also get lost in the Czech mountains we could be tourist buddies
:-)
>before modern Slovakia popped out, we had the most friendly relations with Slovaks and Sorbs
I'm not entirely sure about Sorbs, but we didn't really have any relations with the Slovaks before the early 20th century
The only real interactions between Czechs and Slovak before were limited attempts to spread religion, so much so that there was a push to make Czechs to be the cultural model for Slavs living in Northern Hungary
The next large-ish interaction between our nations was during the 1840s as Pan-Slavism gained its brief popularity, though that was an interaction in a much broader scale and not limited to just Czechs and Slovaks alone
I'd argue our oldest friend would be Poland, or even more specifically Silesia( + Klodzko, I'm not sure if they count as Silesia or not)
Not only that they were a Bohemian Crown Land up until the war of War of the Austrian Succession, but Bohemian and Silesian nobles were historically on good terms and Silesians were present in the Bohemian kingdom relatively abundantly, in slightly lesser amounts than Germans according to estimates
Yeah ontacts were made in the 19th century and Czech national revival had had notable impact on the Slovak one, but even in the middle ages Slovaks came to study in Prague for example
The border between Slovácko and Upper Hungary was actually fairly blurry and wasn't closed in a sense that we know from the 20th century
Another thing is Great Moravia, if you consider somewhat silly answers, but the point of this whole thread is to be kinda simplistic and silly, so hence my answer
I also didn't state that it was some kind of super long friendship
Sorbs were the same case
I'd argue that Poland was never our friend
It was our largest regional rival in the middle ages and there were hardly any serious links in the early modern period
Again, the only temporary sense of brotherhood stemmeed from panslavism and shared opposition of Slavic peoples against German dominance in the Austrian monarchy
I've avoided Silesia on purpose, as Silesian identity is kinda complicated, considering population transfers and language evolution since the middle ages
Being Silesian meant something entirely different 1000 years ago than 250 years ago
Sheit
It's resisting the [fundamental country force]
Come and take it, mountain boy
I'm currently wearing T-shirt saying "New York"
never been to US
So dark it could pick cotton
Really
Nothing is sacred, nobody is spared
There's a reason Czechs were nicknamed "Laughing Beasts" by Nazi occupants
I'd say nothing is taboo, from innocent to DOOM level of brutal, puns and wordplays, but we mostly make fun of others (nations, groups, people), but in great fun offensive, not hateful offensive
Our humour is so dark, it would be instantly beaten by USA cops
Czech
Gallows humour, very self aware
Nazis were really shocked when they occupied us and opressed and slaughtered people and they made jokes about it all the time
Heydrich called us "laughing beasts".
Our humour is one of the few reasons I’m proud to be Czech
I mean look at us - we are keeping Babis at a power
Our humour can’t get much darker than that
Top 10 practical jokes that went too far
Czeskie memy is my favorite thing from now on
Even low hanging fruit count
Ah yes, the buses from Brno
Sounds like what's going in a lot of countries, ours included
The PM completely clueless and the occasional competent person managing to push through with some actually competent measure
Brno is a joke itself
Underground (and other things big cities have) in Brno (the 2nd biggest city in the Czech Republic)
I agree with the last one
I actually used to care about the US politics way more than my country's. Now I mostly care about domestic politics, but I'm also interested in Poland's and Slovak politics and vaguely of most other countries, even those outside Europe or North America
I briefly follow Slovak's politics (neighbourhoodly feel + my boyfriend is Slovak) and I try to keep some general overview of politics in Hungary, Poland and Germany
I also follow Britain and US, they have good drama over the Channel / ocean :D plus EU studf
But well, I studied political science, so my interest is probably off average
Probably not to the same extent as Czech and US politics (which is like the best TV show ever) but yeah, I'm intersted
I try to follow EU countries closely enough that I have an updated view of what's roughly going on there and what the issues seem to be
Ofc mostly it's about France, UK, Germany and then our neighbors
Don't really know what's going on in Scandinavia or the Balkans
I try to check out the parties before foreign elections
However, since there are almost 50 countries in Europe, I mostly have a shallow understanding of what's going on there
I see you love to torture yourself my friend
Nor a political party I can pronounce haha
Well after we crown Bosnia, I can quite confidently give you the award for the second most what in the actual fuck political scene
It is sad, but it's understandable
after all you have many youtubers and prominent media constantly talking about US politics, which are much more entertaining than those of European countries (maybe except UK and Brexit) and USA is just so influential it's good to be interested in their politics aswell
Wait
that was the most "interesting" part
To be fair it doesn't really matter who's in the white house
It's all just a bunch of corrupt crooks in a very corrupt swampy mid-atlantic area
To the average American, what happens in their state, city, neighborhood and family is 10x more important than which crazy partisan joker sits in the white house
Well we may have our own Japanese nationalists, but we don't have korwin-mikke so it's nowhere near as hilarious to watch
Well let me rephrase that
A Japanese sushi salesman, who got into Czech politics to make more money and after analysing his niche, adopted anti-immigrant (of all the people) rhetoric, winning 10% of the vote in the general elections
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
To play the devil's advocate, Tomio Okamura is 1/2 Czech, 1/4 Japanese and 1/4 Korean
He also has a brother who is in the Christian democratic party and who is quite the opposite of him
You definitely should
Babiš came from Slovakia to Czechia, after he finishes with us he's obviously coming to Germany, continuing west until he destroys whole world
Definitely
I used to think Czech politics are boring af, but after Babis took office, it got much more interesting
Painful to watch, but still interesting
He's very entertaining to watch
Regardless of what comes out of his mouth hahah
I'm aware and should indeed be called on this for accuracy's sake
I wasn't indenting to question his nationality or origin in detail since then I would have to list what you did
It's mostly just a light hearted funny comparison when contrasted with his stance and wouldn't be as funny if I went to specifics
The sad truth is that every politician in our scenes will want to (or end up having to) fuck with you
May as well enjoy the satire while it happens
In my hometown of Brno we have extensive underground areas
In the 1970s, an unmapped ancient water pipe collapsed under two people waiting at a tram stop during a thunderstorm and the water took one of them, a woman, with it
Her body was never found, because nobody really knows where the pipe leads
Mind you, this is only one of many such unmapped places in Brno
The underground here is exciting and scary at the same time
I have been to many of those places, but concerning that particular claustrophobic old water system where the woman disappeared, there is no way I'm going in
There are abandoned tunnels all under my city
There is an entrance in most of my towns basements including mine
Our entrance has been barricaded with bricks a long time ago
Sometimes, you can hear some noises coming from the tunnels
It's usually footsteps or things falling
That means there must be someone using those abandoned tunnels for God knows what
The weird thing is that the tunnels are barricaded from all sides, meaning they can't be using them for city travel
There is one castle, that is built to defend things from going out, not inside
According to legend, there is a hole to the hell in the middle of the castle
Where the hole is supposed to be, there is now small church
That would be Houska castle,
I don't know the exact details, but legend says, that since Stone Age, some strange creatures climbed from strange hole in the rock
In middle ages (13th century) Houska Castle was built, but it was strange one
It didn't have any strategic location and it also didn't have kitchen and any well, only rain water collector
What it did have were defensive walls, that were aimed inward
After some time, a chapel was built above the hole
The strange thing is, that its walls are always a bit moist
In late middle ages, the way to avoid death penalty was, to be lowered in the hole in the rock, to tell them what's in there and most prisioners chose death over freedom, but those who chose to be lowered there went crazy according to the legend
Also Nazis settled there and there are some unconfirmed legends about an occult experiments
But this is just a legend
Brno is a weird place
Not surprised
It’s Brno, after all
I've been to Brno many times as I live pretty close but I've never heard of this
Is it throughout the whole city or just certain parts
Reminds me of those four geocachers getting swept away in the Prague canals two years back
Not as scary because they did go down there, but still
And all those tunnels supposedly leading into houses, oof
Is it Znojmo
I heard that the underground there is pretty interesting, with multiple stories and all
And no one's doing anything about it
I thought that would be Zeman lol
Was not dissappointed
Without looking it up, I vaguely remember reading somewhere that they were probably laid down in the early 19th century
So about 200 years old
Depends
Most places are in the historical center, some are in the wider center, but there is also a couple of places on the outskirts
The ones around the historical center are mostly old cellars, some of them are as old as the gothic period
The ones in the wider center are mostly infrastructure or wartime objects
For example, the river Ponávka is going under the city and parts of it are accessible on a boat
But they say that while a lot of places are known to exist, only a minority of them has been properly mapped and explored
I personally don't know many people who know about it, but some places I discover through the word of mouth, some are hinted at on the internet
The exact location is never published, because I suppose the people who know about them want to keep it free of the homeless, taggers, drug addicts etc
I won't publish the exact places here, either, but if you're interested, I can give you some info on where to start looking
Feel free to send me a DM
Oh yeah, cellars connecting buildings are my favorite
From what I heard, those are more common in Prague than here, but I've been to a handful
It's like a secret passageway that almost nobody knows about and makes me feel like I know something special, even though their practical usability as a shortcut is probably close to zero
Quite indeed
I remember someone has said that "Czechs are the dwarfs of Europe". Gunsmiths, beer, mountains and now . . . underground tunnels
Ah yes, It's all coming together
The country has a very rich history
Also a lot of activity throughout thousands of years as it is a meeting point of 3 major ethnic groups
Medieval Warfare, crafts
combine that with mining history, military bases under totalitarian regime and you have a lot of creepy shit
Especially regarding mines and tunnels
I unfortunately have no clue what they were used for
Perhaps as a way to travel in the event of apocalypse
I only know there is an entrance in almost every basement and there is also a barricaded surface entrance around 240 meters away from my home
I should study my city's history a bit more
I don't know about his city but in Brno there is a large underground created by connecting cellars of the houses and it were used for storage in middle ages
No, it's around 149 kilometers away from Znojmo
I unfortunately can't tell you where it is, because I still live there
Yup, been to Znojmo underground and it's pretty cool
I was only there as a tourist with a group a few years ago, so I don't remember that much but it was interesting
I think he's talking about the Houska castle
Yeah, good luck with that
We wanted to go there, but we couldn't find the right turn even after hour of searching
Either some dark forces didn't want us there or I just suck at navigation
Probably the dark forces
Well yes
Our country is also very small
But our people are really bloody tall
175 cm is our average height and I am 183 cm
Judging by your flair, you most likely already know, though
Also been there
Never been in Brno's tunnels, but you are completely right
Tábor's tunnels really do feel like a D&D dungeon
Tunnels in my city are also connected, although I doubt they were used for storage, since everyone has a basement
Yep, Houska
All I know is that Brno is pretty cursed
I am commenting to correct a mistake I made
I have studied some books about my city and found out the tunnels were made in the middle ages as an escape passage
I have no clue what they were to escape from, but my city is full of walls and castles used in war
So potentially, it was to escape if there came to be an invasion by the enemy
I looked at the blueprints for my house and it was built in 1806
Although, there is a strong potential there stood another house on the grounds, where mine stands
I have 0 blood and i never had a problem with mosquitoes (I get like one bite per summer) or ticks
Now I wonder if there is something wrong with my blood, because this is like the 100th time I hear 0 blood gets the worst of it :D
You got that right
Very common and quite accepted
I first got drunk when I was 13 and my mum laughed at me the next day
Pretty much all of my peers started drinking around that age
I actually stopped drinking when I turned 18, lol
Now I drink only handful of times a year
Buying can be a bit hard because it's illegal to sell alcohol to minors but it can be done
Really depends on the cashier
I never really had to buy any alcohol when I was a minor because if I went to a party/celebration and there were drinks, there was always someone older who was legal age or they looked 18 so I don't really have an exprerience with that
And if I needed alcohol to bring with me to party I just grabbed a bottle of moonshine that I could get for free from one of my neighbours, haha
Extremely popular, which is probably because there is no drinking age here
lol czechia is the country where most beer per capita is consumed, and basically everyone has at least tried beer before 18
Very
*sips beer*
>moonshine
*Moravák detected*
Yeah, I started around 14 with vodka, joined with beer at 16
Večerka always sells anyone :D I stopped drinking hard alcohol at 19, now I only drink beer
Guilty, haha
In the last legislative elections 2017  there were 31 parties on the ballot and 9 of them got into the Chamber of Deputies (which is the largest number in the history)
There used to be a big left-wing party (Social Democrats) and a big right-wing party (Civic Democrats) with several minor parties but corruption scandals and the rise of populism fractured the scene
Now is the dominant party populist ANO (support ~30%) followed by Civic Democrats and Pirates (both ~15%)
Then there are falling Socialists and Communists (both ~5-10%) whose voters got cannibalised by ANO
Finally there are five other parties struggling to cross the 5% treshold (Christian democrats, anti-immgiration party, liberal-conservatives, mayors and independents, and a new conservative party)
I'd say right now, there is quite a big variation amont the parliamentary parties
But I think the biggest divide right now is the populism/anti-populism instead of the traditional left/right division
I am basing the percentages on the election results not polls although there's been very little change anyway
I suppose you can group the parties into certain categories
This is completely subjective, some of these are hard to pinpoint
**Left-wing** - **Social Democrats** and the **Communists** are the most traditionally left wing parties
Social Democrats these days are fairly socially progressive, while the Communists are socially conservative
Together they got around 15% of the vote
These parties used to be much stronger but the populist parties syphoned off their support base
They have the most support among the elderly
**Liberal parties** - **Pirate Party** and **STAN**. These are liberal parties, Pirates being by far the most socially progressive party
They are rather new and have the biggest support among younger and more educated voters, together they got 15% of the vote
**Populist parties** - **ANO** and **SPD**. I am hesitant to put these together but they are both heavily populist and have similar voters
ANO is the ruling and biggest party, they are a catch-all populist party, very hard to pinpoint any kind of ideology, they just do whatever brings the most votes
SPD is the "far-right" populist party, leaning heavily into anti-immigrant and anti-EU rhetoric
Their appeal is to less educated and older voters
Together they got around 40% of the vote
**Right-wing** - **ODS** and **TOP 09
** ODS used to be the biggest one of the two major parties but they have also fallen off in recent elections
They are economically right-wing, socially semi-conservative party
TOP 09 is more liberal and is the most pro-EU party
Their voters tend to be highly educated and urban
Together they got around 15% as well
**Christian Democrats** - this leaves me with this party, which I struggle to put into one of the above categories
Their main thing is being socially conservative and appealing to their dedicated old christian voter base, which has been shrinking so they get around 5% of the vote these days
That's about it other parties are pretty much irrelevant
You have the Greens, which is your traditional Green party, then there is a Libertarian party both of which sit around 1-2%. And then there are usually about 20 different far-right/anti-EU parties on the ballot which combined get like 1% of the vote
Again, pretty subjective, I am sure many will disagree with me
Great summary
Library card
I love to buy books and I always have more than I can read
Because of that, I don't really have a reason to borrow books in the library, but I'm still paying fees and going to read my books there
(but because of covid I haven't been there for some time)
My girlfriend loves birds, so she's paying for my (and her parents' and sister's) membership in the Czech Ornitological Society
Needless to say I have never participated in anything that had anything to do with it, except for when I was once tricked to go for trip which turned out to be a bird watching camp
I send monthly donations to a nonprofit organization which lobbies alternative transport around Prague
They work to make the city better and safer for pedestrians, bikers and public transport commuters (at the expense of personal car transportation)
I guess I might get some benefit off it in the long run, but I hope the answer counts
Local craft breweries all the way
When the coronapanic hit, I started actively looking for smaller independent places to shop around, not only supporting the store but also the local producers
In Czech Republic you can often find great local farmer products in wine stores
Since now, I evade supermarkets when on vacation in favour of local bakeries and farmers
An international supermarket chain will find a way to overcome a crisis but the smaller need our support to do so
A tip on how to describe Discord to non gamers - it's basically Slack but not for business
(At least that's what I think in my very limited discord experience)
It may be "To beru" (literally I take that) which may be I accept this or also I can agree to that
Or "Jak myslíš" (As you think), which has the feel of I don't agree, but won't argue anymore - but also doesn't indicate that I at least accept
But I don't think we have something with exactly the same meaning and I'd probably just use "rozumím" (I understand) or "aha, dobře, fajn" (like "ok") to accept but not make statement about my opinion
Also "Budiž", although it's pretty uncommon
Maybe "a dost"? I guess we could use that too
I don't think ano - yes is in any way a possible equivalent here
"Ano" literally just means "yes". It's commonly used, but definitely is more formal and in no way synonym for "fair enough".
Ano sounds way too formal for ordinary people to use in a casual conversation
Nope, that's _enough [of this]
_ and it's foreboding
Normally, one given name and one family name, say "Jana Nováková". Some folks get a second given name when they are christened (as children or adults), say "Jana Marie Nováková", and some folks have a double family name after they get married, appending their spouse's name to theirs (but usually the wife adopts the husband's surname, abandoning her own), say "Jana Marie Nováková-Horáčková".
In Czechia we have just given name + surname most of the time
Surname is mostly inherited from father (if married)
However the feminine form of the surname is different from the masculine form
Example:
Male form: *Novák*, *Malinský*
Female form: *Nováková*, *Malinská*
Adjective surnames have masculine/feminine adjective ending and suffix *-ová* is added to nominative female surnames
The purpose is to be able to conjugate the word in a sentence
This happens to foreign surnames as well, so you may spot names like *Clintonová*, *Streisandová*, *Williamsová* in Czech newspapers
Only first name and surname
Middle names are not common
For Czech, it's
Given name, at least one, but not more than two
Name should be selected from an approved list, i.e. random names can't be given
Nor one can use altered version of a name
If a foreign child being born here, the list restriction doesn't apply
If a foreigner gains Czech citizenship, s/he can keep the current name(s) but the limit of 2 still applies
Surname
One, unless you inherit double one, or you decided to switch to double when marrying (unless one of you already have double, in this case it can't be tripled), or you're adopted and want to keep the original one along the adopter's one
Female surnames are mutated according to Czech grammar (ones that look like an adjective are declined as feminine adjective, ones looking like soft adjective declined accordingly, ones ending in -ů not declined, the rest gets -ová), this can be waived if you're foreigner, married to a foreigner, or have permanent residence abroad
Also, all limitations can be waived if you're EU citizen and decide to use naming convention of your state
I've also seen a few women who ended up both keeping their maiden name and accepting their husband's surname after getting married, while not inflecting the husband's surname (not adding the "-ova")
Example: *Jana Nováková* married *Michal Matějka* --> *Jana Matějka Nováková* (not *Jana Matějková Nováková*)
Another thing when marrying is that it's not mandatory to change surnames
The couple can both keep their original surnames
They do have to agree which surname will be their kids surname when marrying though
It also is possible to join the surnames so both of the adults have both of the surnames
They have to decide, which goes first and then the kid has only the first surname
As for the suffix, females don't have to add the suffix when marrying in some cases:The woman is a foreigner, or plans to live long term in foreign country, or the man has foreign surname and is a foreigner
There are some people who did actually get the offices not to add the suffixes to their surname
Most of them had lied or did actually marry a foreigner or planned to stay abroad
Some, however, did have so unusual names that they were told that the original form would be better
An example that comes to my mind is Kateřina Jacques (she's a politician and a publicly known figure)
Edit: also, the foreigner thing leads to the second most common surname being Nguyen because it has only one form
*This info might be unreliable as all the websites talking about surnames can't actually access up-to-date info from our government and they state that there are only two thousands of people with this surname while 7 years ago there were above twenty thousands
There was no genocide so perhaps the archives must be incomplete
Sure, I have described what is most common
There are many special cases (e.g. Petrů) but they are relatively rare
Apparently there has been a lawsuit about that in 2017
The court has ruled that the name has to be written in latin alphabet and in its full authenticity including nonstandart characters if it would in extend requiredy by  the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms and some other applied laws/texts
So yes, if it were important to the name, you wouldn't have it changed
&#x200B;
Fyi, our keyboards do support almost every special character that can be written in latin alphabet
We have right alt as a switch for special characters and Đ is written as rAlt+d and đ is written as rAlt+s. Instead of numbers, we have ěščřžýáíé and numbers are written with shift
The characters english keyboard has there are written with rAlt
Many programmers really love this about the Czech keyboard because it is really simple to write {}, <> etc
So Czech keyboard has two variants - the common one qwertz and programmer one qwerty
No surprise there either
You aren't writing koláčky every day so you don't need to have á and  č so easily accessible :D
Germany lost the war
Leopold's Congo was his personal property
That is why
From what I'm reading, many people mistake 19
century for middle Ages
Dead by something a bit of penicillin can sort today
Or watching grandsons digging in the mud
I guess I would be dead or wounded since my country fought against France 4 years ago
With my background of educated middle class, relatively good health and general inclinations preserved, I suppose I would turn into a naive romantic historian/archaeologist/folklore collector seeing remains of our glorious Slavic pagan ancestors everywhere
Future generations would make fun of my silly discoveries but also venerate me as an early founding father of this scientific field
I would also probably have already written several collections of poems forgotten by everyone else except for schoolkids who would hate me even in the 21st century for having this boring stuff in their curriculum
As for my job, I would probably become a private teacher for some noble family or a bit liberal (and thus not very successful) priest
Edit: Being born into a family of my ancestors, I would probably become a farmer, miner or mill owner, but the aforementioned career would still be possible as there was some vertical social mobility
Well, social mobility was, compared to middle Ages, higher
Kids were sent to schools and industrial revolution was kicking off
Not everyone was the typical dirty peasant without zero outlook
Yeah
Taiwan has 10x more investments in our country than China
So I'm in
I am from Czech republic
China uses our president like puppet
China made promises in investment but none came
One of our politicians went to Taiwan to discuss trade
China used their embassy and our president to not allow it but Vystrčil went anyway
Taiwan was pleased and already big investments were promised to become bigger
China was pissed and threatened entirity of my country, but when they tried to take away economical benefits from us, they discovered they could only cancel order on few hundred pianos
Taiwan was so pleased that they sent us few expensive life support units to save people in critical state due to covid-19
China sold us low quality masks and offered us vaccine with success percentage bellow 50%.
Funniest thing is that we export more into Taiwan or Russia than to China
I would like to trade with Taiwan just to hurt that fat bloated dictatorship calling itself peoples republic
I've heard that in Rovaniemi (Finland) or on the North Pole, but he was never bringing me presents
Baby Jesus always did
Saint Nicholas (svatý Mikuláš) visits kids on December 5th, accompanied by an angel and a devil
It's unclear where does he come from tho, the "living tradition" includes no mention of his origin
Historically he comes from Asia Minor of course
Exactly it's up to kid's imagination

"Don't threaten me with good time"
To be fair, when I went to Finland years ago, I kinda thought that some of the areas in the north are permanently covered in snow
So, since I was planning to travel pretty much all around the country, when I was packing, I was considering taking my winter clothes
It was August, by the way
See
This is why it's irresponsible to tell drunk tourists funny things like that
But what about Voldemort
Would they find hiding Voldemort
That's the most American thing a tourist can ask
Its the famous german humour
No bullshit
Well if a single small car Škoda Fabia eliminate FOUR APC Pandur II 8x8 with single hit and repair of APCs took 3 years
I think it is kinda  embarrassing for us
Also the story how Czech goverment bought these APCs which was amphibious but after our armor upgrades they are too heavy to float so now it is ground only vehicle is also funny because goverment paid 3 times bigger money than for example Pandurs exported to Portugal, because the want amphibious version
Regional embarrassement, though I think this is more places in the Republic
Regions of Hradec and Pardubice created a unified transit pricing system which made fare prices consistent across the two regions, together with introducing an RFID card that you could store your tickets or money on so that the transportation could be cash-free
Here's the fucking catch
The RFID card cannot be charged with money on tickets online
You have to take physical cash to the bus driver for him to charge the card for you and then sell you a ticket by deducting the money from the card
If you want a ticket for a whole week or a month the card is now the only way how to get them
The system made ticket selling literally 3× more time consuming and complicated
I fucking hate OREDO and everything their shitty transport agency stands for
It's also easier to bulletproof old system, that isn't getting plagued by new and new irrelevant updates
>Well if a single small car Škoda Fabia eliminate FOUR APC Pandur II 8x8 with single hit
That is the funny way to put this story, but let's get real: The APCs actually hit each other when the first one braked hard in order not to flatten the Škoda
The actual fuck-up was them not keeping a safe distance when traveling on a public road and of course the way the repairs were handled
verb: "hodit se"
To se bude hodit
= It will be useful sometimes
Hodí se ti ten čas
= Is that time suitable for you
Ten náhrdelník se hodí k šatům. = That necklace will look good with those dress
[kurvítko] — a component which assures the planned obsolescence of a given good
[^(Czech Wikipedia)]
[^(Necyklopedie — Czech Uncyclopedia)] ^(Even though it's uncyclopedia, this article is fairly informative, yeah, that's how bad kurvítka actually are
lucid — however, this rather belongs to academic texts instead of meetings
It's called studeňák (~a cold one) in Czech
For us, you can't have a debate like this without at least mentioning [the Dancing House] near the Prague historic center
A lot of people either love it or hate it, everyone here has an opinion on it
I don't mind it too much, personally
However, by far the ugliest in my opinion is [the New Stage of the National Theater] I hate it so much and the fact that I drive by it nearly every week doesn't help
Eugh
The honorary mention could also be the [Ministry of Interior building] looming over Prague
But that can be said about any concrete-box building from the 20th century
[Ubytovna Kupa] maybe
oh come on, it's not so bad (both of this buildings)
Might be weird but I actually like it
Atleast it's not boring
we have more bubble wrappers :
Wow, I didn't even know this building existed
Yikes
fun fact : the director of CIIRC made a tv document during construction of this building
In one scene, he was standing in unfinished building, and he was saying that he will have a good view on Prague castle from his office
A few scenes later, he complains that he can’t see anything because of that plastic wrap
It's on Jižní město
I know, I'm looking it up right now
Although it looks like it was renovated around 2017 and it [looks a bit better] doesn't hurt the eyes as much
It just looks like a regular old panelák.
Unpopular opinion here, but I actually think that it looks kinda cool
I like the little bridge between the buildings and I can't explain why
In history they teach \_about\_ religions (which is understandable, we went through a fair share of religious wars in the past)
Othen than that: fortunately no and I don't think that will change any time soon, as we are one of the most atheist countries in the world (which is understandable, we went through a fair share of religious wars in the past)
No, we don't have anything like that
It is possible to have it as out of school activity and there are few religious private schools, but it's not part of our public system
No, public schools generally don't. They may have it as an optional class if a certain number of parents request it (or if the whole school is run by a church, then they obviously can make it mandatory), but it's very rare
Only 49 out of more than 4000 elementary schools in this country are religious
We don't have "ethics" as a school subject either, only "citizen's education" in middle school (which includes a bit of everything from actual civics and an intro to world religions to health and sex ed to "don't be racist or bully people") and either more "citizen's education" or "social sciences" in high school
Hell no
We are the most atheist country in Europe, so
Nope
One of the few things we can be proud of - we're one of the most atheistic countries in the world
Fun fact: In the census you can put anything as your religion, in the last census we had 15 thousand Jedi Knights
In my school we were taught religion, but only because it was a Catholic high school
In the first couple of years, it was mostly about Christianity and when we were older, we were taught religionistics about other religions as well
We also had a subject called History of the Christian Church and let me tell you, that was probably the most boring thing I've studied ever
Some of our teachers were fervently religious and assumed we were, too, so they had as memorize lines from the Bible and tried to force their opinions on us (stuff like "Slayer denies God's creation and should be banned" - made me wear a Slayer t-shirt, even though I'm not a huge fan of theirs), but the good ones had interesting discussions with us
But if I've learned one thing, as an atheist, it is the very important realization that almost no Christians today believe in God as a supernatural being or take the Bible literally
It's more of a philosophy or a way to live
It makes me often side with religious people in discussions against ignorant atheists, who believe Christians are all crazed worshippers of a fairytale (although some of them surely are)
I've learned about main religions and some most famous cults -> basic info about them
So we at least had basic information about religions
I think it's needed for atheist because it can be useful info in some cases and people are less likely to believe in disinformations about religions
Brno
Praha vs Brno already is a thing, so let's add to the fire
Čáslav
It's right in the middle so no one can complain it's too remote
Also there is a nice air base nearby
Brno, our highest court is there and also to piss off everyone in Prague
I vote for a more central location
Which would be either Kutná Hora or Pardubice
And because the second option would make Hradec secede from the republic
Kutná Hora doesn't sound so bad
Historically already was the catholic capital a few times during the Hussite wars, and was the second royal town in the kingdom anyway
It's tiny now, but there are precedents for an insignificant town being named the capital and swelling in size
Like Bulgarian Sofia
No, it should be Olomouc
It has much more interesting history than Brno, and it used to be capital of Moravia
But the most important reason why Olomouc is that it would insult Šalina riders
Ostrava, just fuck with as many people as possible
We could still opt for České Budějovice and enjoy the show
Or just Hradubice
Good idea
No, fuck no, I live there, no more people
Quite important, if you ask me
We provide other Europeans with a great, cheap destination for partying
What happens in Prague, stays in Prague
We make tons of cars and other vehicles
Thanks to our EU membership, we make EU borders look nicer than if we weren't part of it (not like Switzerland making a hole in the middle of the EU)
Oh and we make some awesome videogames
Same here, which is, with Koruna in mind, about to be our downfall
Mhmm
Germany is the engine of EU and France is the driver
Nothing is for free, we just pay it with our taxes
The downside might be the way how doctors treat you
They often won't be particularly nice to you and you often wait for a long time in a waiting room
However, this might be because of generally worse customer service here
Nothing is for free, we just pay it with our taxes

However, this might be because of generally worse customer service here
Cost
It takes a huge chunk of your income
Also you are denied some service that you finance cause reasons
Waiting times are crazy
And the quality and attitude of staff can be rather harsh
Hospitals keeping tons of supposed covid patients that are in fact fine
They get paid the same amount of money per patient so it's more profitable to have someone who's fine than someone who you actually have to spent the money on treating
Or so I heard
Yeah, we have a similar system
State co-owned and regulated insurance companies and insurance is mandatory, paid mostly by your employeer
I think it depends
My GP is a pretty decent guy and I only had good experience with the specialists
Though I realize I might be in a minority
Yeah, nursing staff can be rather harsh and inexperienced, though that seems to be more of the fault of the system around it
It doesn't make you a human with an injury but more of a broken box with something rattling inside
I consider it bet that I win in any case
that's pretty shit ngl
Domina est oofora :-)
Sure, I'm not saying they should treat you like a king and personally I wouldn't say it's too bad, but I've been to some doctors who definitely could treat their patients a bit better
Plenty of people rather drive to a different town/city to get a medical treatment just because the service is better there
Atleast that was the case in my town
Well, they are only people after all
It depends on the person
If you don't like your doctor, you can always go to another
having to bribe your doctor for service while paying for it with taxes
:( im sorry
romania sounds like hell
I'm fairly certian that in Czech you can also say behind the computer,  but I never found it weird
Jů ken definitly help wid dét.
School starts at 8, periods of 45 minutes and 10 minute breaks between them, after the second period ther is a 20 minute break
If you have any afternoon classes (after 3:30 pm), you get a whole period break after the 4th, 5th or 6th lesson
In high school you can have up to 9 periods a day but not every day, the mean would probably be about 7 hours
Typically school starts around 7
50 - 8, except my high school didn't - some days started at 7
25 and some at 9
10, because the morning usually had some of our electives so everyone's schedule could be different
Lessons are 45 minutes (sometimes 90 in HS if the teacher decides to not do a break in the middle), breaks are 10 min and one 20-35 min "big break" around 10am
Elementary school starts by only having morning classes (approximately 8 - 12), in later grades you start having afternoon classes first once a week and then 2-3 days a week
There's a minimum and maximum number of mandatory classes prescribed for each grade, the maximum for HS was 35 (x 45 min)
The latest my school ever ended was around 16
40, most students had many after-school activities and would rather cut the lunch break short than stay even 10 minutes later than necessary in the afternoon, so teachers would sometimes make informal adjustments of the schedule in this direction
Friday was never longer than 2pm
Pretty much the same, except school usually started at 8:00, except for some special classes, and some years we had “lesson 0” which started at 7:10
We agreed to those so that we didn’t have to finish after 4 or 5 pm on a long day
I’d get up at 6:20 at latest, get ready, have breakfast, and go walk the dog at 7 or 7:10
We wanted to walk him for as long as possible but our latest bus left at 7:32 and it was a close call
Wait
can you explain more about how these shifts work
That's the first time I hear about this concept
How often do you switch between them
Or who decides which one you go to
Is this done because of capacity issues
Got it, thank you :) I would have loved having afternoon shift as a teenager, haha
It makes sense, it's just very unusual for me to imagine any school not start in the morning all the time
We threw a bunch of guys out of a window, because we didn't like the church and started the Hussite wars, in which we were able to defeat 5 crusades the pope sent against us
Then we did it again, because we didn't like the church and started a major european conflict known as the thirty years war
Some activits changed the president's flag for giant  red shorts, and the President burned them few years later
But his actions weren't reported beforehand, so the president's office got charged with a fee
We, a landlocked country, have attacked Soviet fleet on the lake Baikal and won
That means we have won 100% of naval battles in Czechoslovak history
In the 90's some artist painted an old tank pink, then the city painted it back to normal, than some representatives from parliament painted the tank back to pink (but they had immunity so nothing could be done about it)
It's a famous story in the Czech Republic although it's presented as a heroic decision:
>Far be it that the King of Bohemia should run away
I wonder whether he actually said what I quoted and if yes, then what language he spoke it in
I mean third time's the charm, isn't it
Also 30 years war started and ended in Prague
Started as Czech Protestants were fighting against Catholics and ended as Czech Protestants were defending Prague against Sweedish Protestants
Also [this happened on presidential election day]
Ah, that reminds me the time when we pillaged the polish capital so hard they had to move it
John didn't speak Czech
His son Wenceslas aka Charles IV did tho
Yes, know, it is the same in czech and we learn it in school
It's "defenestrovat".
It's about time
Just the shorts, for now
We use it quite often in Czechia
No, no, the word is actually used quite often in the current Czech political climate
So, I guess we're even
\*all Czech political climates
It's funny, because (at least we were taught that in school) it's not considered a murder, you are just throwing people out of a window and it's on God if he's gonna let them live or die
Welp, dunno how they logically deducted that it's not a murder considering during at least one of these defenestrations there were people below with spears pointing to the sky
Also, there's that saying: "If you throw them out of door, they'll return through window
", but nothing about the other direction
For me, it’s November 17th which marks the beginning of the Velvet Revolution of 1989 when the communist regime in former Czechoslovakia was peacefully overthrown
Usually, there are lots of concerts in the centre of Prague, processions, exhibitions, all in streets where normally cars ride
It’s a beautiful day
Pączki are the best
It’s the first thing I buy when I travel to Poland
And also the last one when I leave
Prague is like a different world haha
I live in a village in south Moravia and oh god this day might spart debate amongst its residents, especially the old people who still think communism is better
I hate this place lol
It is a specific city I guess, even different to other Czech cities in many ways
But this would be the general difference between countryside and cities where people tend to have more liberal views on life
But I understand that you might feel pretty frustrated by that
And it will still take very long to change
In czechia, it’s on evening 24th december
There is early dinner (4-5 PM), then the gifts are unpackaged, and everyone watches fairy tale ať 8 PM
Then there is midnight mass in church, one of few religious rituals that somehow survived
Today
24th of December
Next two days are for visits
The 24th December is called Štědrý den/večer "generous day/evening", so what you would call Christmas Day/Eve
This is the main event, people spend the entire day cooking to have a big dinner of fried carp, other fish or schnitzels with potato salad
Then we open the presents brought by Ježíšek (Baby Jesus) and spend the next two days digesting all the food, laying about, eating Christmas cookies, watching TV and eating more food
Fun fact: people sometimes keep live carp in their bathtubs to be killed, fried and eaten on Christmas Day
I personally don't know anyone who even goes to the church mass at midnight
People sometimes go to choir events before Christmas Eve, but that's usually it

Deffinetely Prague
More specifically historic centre one bridge and castle
Than there's also Český Krumlov with beautiful castle, and gorgeous centre, gorgeous Karlstein and magical Lednicko-Valtický Areál.
Prague's centre along with Charles Bridge is probably the most crowded area with all the infamous tourist traps
Then there's [Český Krumlov] which is a small town in Southern Bohemia but the centre is almost as crowded as Prague
I would add [Karlštejn] [Hluboká] and [Lednicko - Valtický areál ] which are pretty popular aswell though to a lesser degree
Prague, Prague 1 is so filled with tourists you basically have half of the shit for them and the other for the people living there
Worst of all are the gift shops that sell Russian memorabilia IN CZECH REPUBLIC
Before pandemic the centre of Český Krumlov used to be ridiculously overcrowded with mostly Asian tourists
I think if anyone would like to visit this town, now is good time
Then there are tourists in the SPA areas (rich ones in Karlovy Vary, the poorer ones in Poděbrady)
I mean, Karlovy Vary are now Russian territory on Czech soil and I don't know much about Poděbrady Spa
In Poděbrady, plurality of the tourists are Czech, with a lot of other tourists coming from Russia and Germany
Most of them belonging to the elderly
Nobody can name them all or find them on the map, but when we hear it, we just kinda know it's from somewhere in the US
Well, in Europe I mostly know where the cities are located (no clue about Kent, or all those -shire counties - I only know some names)
But in US it is somewhat different; I mostly know the location of the states but not many cities
Yea it's pretty known in my circles
Most people would get lost around finding Maryland, differentiating Missouri and Kansas and stuff like that, but overall knowing of their existence and location of the bigger ones is pretty normal
I can name and place all 50 with capitals and stuff
but I'm into maps and geography so it's not a good example
Most people will probably recognize the name of most them maybe with the exception of like New Hampshire, Rhode Island and some of the other less relevant states
Most people I think will be able to point out Alaska, Hawaii, Florida, Texas and maybe California and that's it
Maybe they'll guess New York
But I could be overestimating here
Personally I can do all of them on a map but I am an exception in that regard
I know only California, NY and Alabama, Texas would be a wild guess

I think I’m going insane
Thinking of renting a car for a higher good
Ohh, like a word stress
Actually English is known for separating meaning only by word stress
Great examples (beside the ones mentioned here already) are words rebel or record
For me it's definitely French, that's probably because it has no roots with czech- russian was much easier for me because of this
Arabic
Absolutely alien phonetics, strange writing system (vowels are there
But we won't write them
Or we will write some of them
Or write another ones, you should know what vowel we meant)
Czech is much more difficult than German
I wouldn't say German is hard
But don't worry my dude
I learn 6 years already and am absolutely horrible
I hate it so much
I know English and Czech
I have to learn German in school as well as English but I'm okay with English
German is kinda weird with pronunciation and grammar I think
Also I want to learn Swedish and Japanese
Czech
I can’t speak it flawlessly even after 17 years
Russian, simply because of the alphabet, and if someone speaks in Russian then it sounds like they are either drunk or on some sort of drugs, I can speak it alright (sort of) but I can't write jack shit in Russian
French has no roots to Czech true but, Russian alphabet looks like it's been written by a slightly drunk crackhead, we could debate about it but I'm not in the mood to debate RN
At we can agree on that brother
For me it wasn't really as hard to learn cyrillic as it is hard to learn anything french
Yes
But I meant just some words
Mostly the a,o,u and just the letters with the double dots on top (I don't have an German keyboard on mobile sorry)
I'm mostly okay with it but some specific letters/words are weird
Also the sch at the front of the word is sometimes pronounced as sch and stuff
I just don't know
Can't blame you but at least I know what letter am I writing because the letters don't repeat 3 times, French looks like a gibberish but after some time and practice you can make sense of it but in Russian two words/letters can look similar or even the same but with some small thing like a line there, one more dot there, it doesn't end that way it ends this way
Aye, that's true, my dislike for learning french was probably caused by my teacher who didn't bother to explain the things we didn't understand, when you're falling behind for 2 years, it's hard to catch up
They do but you have the little dip line at the top saying you it's pronounced sch and there are words where you don't pronounce it as sch at the beginning of a syllable for example Štvát (means irritate someone or be make someone angry) is pronounced schtvat with the a being kinda long
But there is also a word like spát (means sleep) which is pronounced sspat with the a being long again
Fuck teachers like that, I have a teacher like that, *in chemistry* that's even worse
Ah that must suck even more in chemistry as I don't actually have to focus on french
She told me once that if i said "i don't know" once more, she would give me mark 5 for every "i don't know" after that and 'deal with me' this way, so glad she isn't on the school anymore
Hey fellow Czechs
Been looking for you guys like for 5 minutes of scrolling geez
How much work
I am sick for like 2 weeks now so it's going to be even worse :-(
Ah man, that sucks, hope you get well soon and catch up
Thanks
Pretty much, thanks for asking
As a young kid, i alwyas thought how USA and Russia are amazing countries
Now i see how fucked up they really are and am happy to live where i live
I second that
Oh boy
* George Soros wants the population to be more docile and is importing vast ammount of muslim immigrants into europe to create more impresionable and docile population
Because they want our sovereignty
* Germany wants to control us so they dictate the EU what unfair laws they impose to us
Because they want our sovereignty
Also somehow they import immigrants to europe because they are on it with Soros, with more docile population and shit
* Austrians wants to controll us so yadda yadda
* US wants us to be their canon fodder in whatever cowboy powergrab they planning next month
Also importing muslim immigrants
NSA and CIA copying data from our datacentres, CCTV storages, listening to our phonecalls because of resons
* EU wants to turn us into a new soviet union, leftist paradise where we will have to eat white babies or some shit
Dunno, was too drunk to listen
* Russia good
But also
* Ezo and homeopathy and all that jazz is incredibly strong here
One of my familys friend is a very respected veterinarian and his wife, a medical nurse, does bioresonance for people and PETS and she firmly believes it
The general attitute of homeopathy users is something like "I know its sugar water, but what if ...?"
* Velvet revolution was not a peoples uprising but actually a planned power transfer
That one is actually interesting, since a lot of people that came to power after the revolution were on very prominent places of power or knowledge in the old regime while the "political" faces of the regime get deposited
But I just think that those are the type of morally flexible shitstains that would flourish in any regime
And yes
I mean our curent prime minister, our current president and our previous president
Many people believe that our prime minister is a good person and has only good intentions for everyone
But I don't blame people he has very good persuation, communication and manipulation skills
In this area he's an expert
Some supporters of our prime minister say that he isn't corrupt, rather that the whole political opposition, police, courts and also European parliament and commission are corrupted just to take him down
> Ezo and homeopathy and all that jazz is incredibly strong here
My son's pediatrician, she's a good doctor, she has almost 40 years of experience, but she is "pediatrician and homeopath". IDK
There goes my personal conspiracy - that communist regime did some really impressive stuff with education - while the system manage to raise well educated specialists it also manage to debilitate their ability to critically think and analyse written text
Both my parents have engineering degree, a lifetime of experiences and both struggled with high school level newspaper article analysis
In the way that they saw all the details but were unable to identify the general idea
Seeing that was ... disturbing yet impressive
Nope, not a conspiracy, dual product quality is definetely real thing
Usually big companies produce stuff in multiple factories so they create local variants with slightly different recipes (Coca-Cola US uses corn syrup, Coca-Cola Mex uses sugar) based on local prices of ingredients
But since "eastern" mindset calls for highest profit margins in shortest ammount of time locally produced big brands just cut corners where they can
In the end it looks like the Mars candybar bought in germany will be slightly larger, tastier and cheaper than one bought in Czechia
The ingredients on the wrap would be different too
The most infuriating thing about that is the fact that locally produced food for export is qualitatively better than the same brands sold locally, eg export sausages have more meat in them
And it says so on the ingredients section too
But the packing otherwise looks the same
Regarding detergents thats a whole new rabbithole but short story is that they really vary from area to area to comply with local laws, water quality and customs (so it is possible that detergents sold in the east are "weaker" than their western counterparts just because people there are accustomed to using smaller ammounts)
Not answering question
But I have one for others
Ive alway wondered
Even though Germans knew what crimes their SS and Nazi officials did after war ended
Do you think they were angry and sad for losing
Even after seeing the truth
After all, they lost friends and families
They were soldiers fighting war
You are not really interested in politics while bullets kill your friends
Not German and not my grandfather, but my grandmother was in the BDM but fell in love with a British soldier and came to the UK with him at the end of the war
I have english set as my system language so wikipedia defaults to english also
I only ever use the czech one if I can't find something on the english one or I'm looking for something czech, because it usually has more info on stuff that originated in the czech republic
I use almost every time the Czech wikipedia, but when I can't find the article I'm looking for in Czech version, I use the original
The Czech wikipedia is actually really good (not as big as the Swedish one, but still pretty big)
There are many good people working on the Czech wikipedia
However those good people cannot cover everything
I use English wikipedia the most
Czech wikipedia seems only good for stuff relating to Czech Republic and I do not look that up often
I think I even use French wikipedia more than Czech wikipedia
It's quite expansive but the quality varies **drastically** between topics
Some such as math and physics are actually quite good
But anything to do with history for example is just complete garbage
It's often *highly* biased and opinionated, very few or old sources and sometimes you see these sections which are obviously just copied from some dusty history book because they are written in an antiquated language
I usually go straight to English and maybe check the Czech version for terminology or something like that
And of course Czech related stuff
Worse than English in around ¾ of topics, but not bad
Completely normal, the quality of tap water here is more than OK
Yes it is normal, we unfortunately use drinking water for everything if I'm not mistaken
I certainly hope so, because I've been drinking it since ever
Although, some people joke about the taste of water in my hometown (which I don't mind): "You drink half the glass and the rest you eat
Yeah, our water is clean and good, but in restaurants, they'll usually give you bottled one
Our government is a bunch of incompetent meerkats
There are only 3 cities in the list I don't know
All of them in Romania (Iași, Craiova and Galați)
I should do something about that
Well, it's one of last 4 countries in Europe I've never visited
It's depressing to see how the "eastern half" of the EU is a huge white spot for the majority of westerners
Penultimate position, Craiova
I mean, I've heard the name but I have no idea what's this city is, apart from it being in Romania
The next (and last) is the same: heard the name, don't know anything
Iași. I really should visit Romania, because this "test" revelated that my knowledge of the country is shockingly lacking - I knew all the non-Romanian cities after Iași but not the Romanian ones
Zaragoza
North-east of Spain, mentioned in the first verse of "Chancon de Roland":
Charles the King, our Lord and Sovereign,
Full seven years hath sojourned in Spain,
Conquered the land, and won the western main,
Now no fortress against him doth remain,
No city walls are left for him to gain,
Save Sarraguce, that sits on high mountain
> Córdoba
was the capital of the Muslim Spain
Roman remains, magnificent mosque-cathedral

In Czech - Štětín, Bydhošť.
Thank you very much for the recommendations, I appreciate it
Serbia, Moldova and Iceland
You mean Vratislav
We call it "Kolín nad Rýnem" in Czech
I've been to Kosovo
I had just a few days
I visited Pristina and Prizren and enjoyed both
Next time it would be nice to see some monasteries and nature
Don’t... our tenses are easy, but you’ll die on the inflections and persons

Katakana writing is mostly used for foreign words, so after a bit of practice, i can read you signs like hotel (ホテル - hoteru), taxi, etc
Pretty useful and fun
We all tend to think our nation's beer is the best in the WORLD
German beer is highly regarded in the world as a whole, while the Dutch Heineken is one of the most common brands worldwide
Danish beer isn't bad at all
UK and Ireland have a drinking culture with their Stouts causing others' envy
Belgian beer is praised in Belgium but I've never heard of it in Czechia
We are the world's largest beer consumers per capita and we're extremely stubbornly persisting on that our brews are the most unique in the world
*Lithuanian breathing on my back*
We all love to drink heavily, complain and hate on imperial system
This is one of the things I like about the way Germans think about politics
I wish more countries adopted this mentality, because national pride hasn't done much good in the great scope of things
I thought you guys were really into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania part of your history
Which took place after Lithuanians had accepted christianity, no
We don't want it either
Crowns gang rise up
As it is in Canada (who switched in '65 I think
), they use the metric system for numbering the US quantities
Instead of the European 500 ml, you get 473 "mL" which is 16 american fl
They use kilometres for longer distances, but measure shorter ones with inches and feet
Since most household appliances are made for the North American market, where US customers prevail, you operate your oven and thermometers in °F, but use Celsius for weather
It's a weird mix, but using the metric system causes less confusion as it is universal and easily convertible
I consider myself a federalist for sure and I couldn't despise nationalism more
It does not
But nationalism means putting your country's interests above the interests of other countries
Which is a mentality I've never understood
Firstly, I am really not into the whole idea of nation states, because I think that the principles on which they are built hold much water and are overall more harmful than helpful
And secondly, putting your country's interests first, no matter what it means for others, is just overall harmful in the big picture
Besides, I don't believe a federation that consists of bickering nationalists is going to do very well
I mean, we already have enough problems with everyone putting their interests first in the EU now
And most countries are not even ruled by parties one would consider nationalist
The thing is, if you have a partner that is only on your side as long as it benefits them and not beyond that, then they're not going to be a very trustworthy one
If you're gonna have a federation that only holds together until the first major crisis, then it's pointless
The whole point of a federation is to be stronger together
Look at my country, for example
During the refugee crisis, it refused to help at all with taking some of the weight off the border countries like Greece and Italy
And yet, it still seeks money from the EU
It's horrible a shameful
There is always going to be some level of disagreement between countries
But in a federation, ideally, that disagreement should be about which solution benefits everyone the most, not about which solution benefits my country the most
That's exactly the short-sighted pre-WWI mentality that had been devastating the continent for centuries
In other words, you can't cherry pick the best of the federation without giving something in return
Because then everyone's gonna want to leave
If you tell your mom, I'm hungry:
"Are you hungry
Than rub it and call it small
It doesn't make sense, but that's because in Czech "hunger" and "rub" rhyme
Magical word
That sounds pretty universal
And if you don't close door, it's "Do you have a tree in your ass
" (Kind of outdated variant: Do you have a black servant behind you
- Which I'd be interested about the origin since servants here used to be white since there wasn't really so many black people around here and slavery was also (even loooonger ago) the question of different races and ethnicities than black here)
Czechs have the most offensive one
If you don't close door - Do we have a black guy here
It is ment to refer black people being slaves back in a day but 5 y.o. was nowhere neer knowing that
Our teacher used it constantly with the yawning (and it was often, first period and teenagers), so my classmate told her once: Acutally I was, but your shoes would hurt my stomach
She stopped to say that
Another I remember is when toddlers come to the age when they want to do everything on their own, they often shout: *"Já sám!"* which means "(I'll do it) On my own
" but it sounds the same as "*Jásám!"* ("I'm cheering") so the parents respond with: "So cheer then
Tree in your ass
Never heard that one
How do you translate that, "Máš za zadkem strom"?
The one with the black slave is true tho
It's hard for me to write this online, but I have ever only heard this expression when you don't close doors "Do you have blacks/negros at home
" Máš doma černý?
In Czechia, one of two variants (arguably not the one parents use with children) is "Do you have a pole(1) in your ass
(1) 'voj' is not any pole, but a pole that connects a cart with the yoke
Here, it's one of two variants
But we use the word "voj", it's a pole that connects a cart with the yoke of the animal towing the cart
Another one is "Do you have blacks (i.e. black servants) at home
Well there were slaves and "prosperous" slave trade, for example during the era of Přemyslovci
But black people weren't really the average people sold there obviously
"Máš v prdeli stromeček
Also "Máš v prdeli větvičky
"/"Have you got sticks up your arse
It’s regarding weed, the law says that a person can legally carry an amount that’s "smaller than small". No grams defined, nothing, just this
The promotion and incentivizing of class-based hatred is now illegal
You can guess why looking back at our history haha
We also have that no music past 22:00 law, and it's enforced, it's kinda annoying sometimes but understandable
> electoral college
It's not that weird, the EU also has weighted votes,
We flew a kite in a puuublic place

Perhaps i/y in some names because surnames don't have to nevessarily follow the grammar rules
Usually yes
There are few tricky cases like *z* and *s*; *ě* and *je*; *ú* and *ů*. The worst is *i* and *y*, they sound the same but there are very complex rules which you are allowed to use
Yeah definitely
Most of the times
Well, B-P H-Ch V-F K-G letters can soud the same, depending on letters next to them
Also i changes pronounciation n->ň, d-> ď etc
We are used to it, so we dont see it
The same as you I guess
Trůn and Kam i král/císař musí pěšky (Where even the king/emperor has to go on foot)
Back in the elementary school, we called it "Ministry of relieve"
Trůn (throne in translation)
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech sounds good because of ř, but I personally think there's better one:
Šel pštros s pštrosicí a pštrosáčaty pštrosí ulicí.
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných křepelek přeletělo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
It contains the dreaded "Ř", that most of foreigners have problem pronouncing
Tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
I would say “tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček stříkalo přes tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech” is pretty hard
The main obstacle is the letter ř [r̝̊]
If you’re really brave and would like to try to say it, this could help you: [ˈtr̝̊ɪsta ˈtr̝̊ɪt͡sɛt ˈtr̝̊ɪ ˈstr̝̊iːbr̩niːx ˈstr̝̊iːkat͡ʃɛk ˈstr̝̊iːkalo pr̝̊ɛs ˈtr̝̊ɪsta ˈtr̝̊ɪt͡sɛt ˈtr̝̊ɪ ˈstr̝̊iːbr̩niːx ˈstr̝̊ɛx]
The sentence says that “three hundred thirty three silver hoses squirted over three hundred thirty three silver roofs”
I see you took to the true masters of the craft for your own one hehehe
Yeah, those tongue twisters are cool, but řeřicha is nice example of our language
Maybe better in Slovak (one Slovak aunt taught my mum the soft l and she taught me, so perhaps I can say it :D), but it's not a thing in general Czech
"Vole" in Czech
It's a very, very mild form of cunt (literally "ox") and it's used by most, if not all generations
Some people use it as a filler  word when speaking, but it can be used as a genuine insult
The most iconic is certainly "vole" (=castrated bull)
You can either use it friendly or as an insult
If you use it friendly, I would translate it as "dude"
Then we have:
brácho - bro
bráško - bro (but a bit more emotionally colored or however you wanna say that - it's just more like "little bro" or something)
Kámo - mate
I personally also use
šéfe - boss
We can say that a looot
Most of guys also consider it weird when girls use it among themselves
Can confirm, girl from a class is using it as filler word and I always stop for a sec when I overhear her saying it
We have the same story
I've found out recently that we have the same legend of origins of our countries
Love it and it makes the story more believable
Czechoslovakia, a country in the middle of Europe, with no access to sea, has 100% naval battle winrate
When in 1618 a group of townspeople in Prague decided to show their displeasure with the newly appointed government by simply throwing the governors out of the windows of the city hall into a pile of dung below
This incident led to one of the bloodiest conflicts in the history of Europe
After WWI, a bunch of central European countries got independence
Countries like czechoslovakia, poland and hungary
And what is the most sensible thing a newborn country can do
Wage a war against half of neighbors to get some disputed land, without functioning state or organized army
After a quick diplomatic intervention of france and britain we stopped our petty conflict
There should be a statue of that man
Or at least a memorial
Yes, they were really extraordinary men
Their exploits in Russia have single-handedly won us our independance (not kidding)
A* defenestration
There were 3 in total
Uhm, never heard of a pile of hay
The catholic side did actually claim that there was nothing below, just stone pavement, and that it was the intercession of the Mother of God that saved them from death
AFAIK the Czechoslovaks didn't use any military vessel, but they just put some howitzers on a regular ship
Even more badass in my opinion
Are you sure
Wasn't his name Szarik
Everyone knows white is used in flags because it looks good
He was a  Bohemian German
Even though he had a Czechoslovak citizenship until 1934 he was still a German
Just like The Hussites - Always outnumbered, never outgunned
Can you give an example of such a meme
...it is about our president, isn't it
And slavic comes from "slova
" Slavs know words, germans are mutes
Haha
I believe Dachstein should become the capital of all three countries
>You're making this a notorious "Nikola Tesla" hassle
No u. I am not claiming him for a nation of which he very obviously didn't want to be part of
He was born to a German speaking family in a predominantly German area
He voluntarily exchanged Czechoslovak citizenship for German one, voluntarily joined NSDAP and SS and actively aided German war effort
Don't be delusional, he was Sudetengerman as fuck
The fact that he had Czechoslovak citizenship for some time is just a peculiarity of Central European history between the wars
You can call him Bohemian but not Czech
This distinction does not exist in Czech but it does in other languages
Thanks, nice
We also have "How do you say X in Polish
" jokes, for example:
\-"How do you say mother-in-law in Polish
" -"Baba przebyteczna" (from přebytečná = unnecessary/redundant)
chamois = "koza turystyczna"
twins = "parchanti duplowańi"
hedgehog = "kaktus pochodówy"
bra = "śprajc podpierowy kozactva ochablego"
etc
, there are many of those
On one hand it is not in Europe, on the other one, it is in the EU :P
In 1934 Hitler couldn't really force a Czechoslovak citizen to do anything
It was a condition to continue working on KdF-Wagen/Beetle which he accepted
At the time when people like Einstein, Mann or Feuchtwanger were leaving Germany, he went in
He could have easily got a job elsewhere
Him speaking Czech wasn't anything special, many Sudetengermans did, just like many Czechs spoke German
IDK, we should all learn from us and just say fuck it and round up all cents
We still have haleře, they add up normally but when you pay it just gets rounded up or down
Czechia +-10 years ago scrapped destníky, dvacetníky (0,1 and 0,2 CZK coins) Few year ago we cancelled even padesátníky (0,5 CZK coins) All price are rounded up or down in shop when paying with cash
If you pay by card or by bank transfer you pay exact amount like 1234,56 CZK
All prices in shop are using only 1 decimal place
Their existence Is the main reason we don't want euro, we're just lazy
No it isn’t?
We use the same system in Czechia since we got rid of our small coins (under 1 CZK, so a 199
50 total gets rounded up to 200 for cash payments, but 199
40 or less becomes 199)
I would have preferred getting rid of that subdivision entirely, but this seems like the only other logical option, always rounding up would be a little too unpopular
If retailers really want to do that, they can always list their prices in whole crowns instead of that X.90 bullshit
Thanks for the post
Czech scouting is definitely more like the Swiss one, we also have more scout-like organizations, but most of them are somewhat similar in how their activities look thanks to common heritage
The biggest scout organization is Junák founded in 1912, it also attempts to introduce more civic educational activities into its curriculum that promote being a good citizen, but more based on the scout moral code, conscience and sometimes (depends on the troop) faith that opinions of current governments
Some of the other organizations focus more on the "technical" aspects of scouting like camping skills or playing games and helping the kids to socialize with other kids, but still are a viable alternative
I was a member of one such group, but not the "proper" scouting, so maybe someone who was can elaborate further
We have scouts for all boys and girls (Junák)
It has a long history
And it was banned during the socialist era
They are awesome
They plan summer camps for children, educate people about woodcraft and they lead people to live a good life
They also meet up with scouts from other countries
They have this whole hierarchy going from the young children to adults
The higher "ranks" take care of the lower ones
It’s beautiful
I have lots of friends who are scouts
It’s a shame that I never was a scout (even when I really wanted to)
I was a Czech scout 15 years ago and has been in one summer camp
At that camp we would wake up at 7 am and after a swim in a pond there was a morning report and raising of the flag
Occasional punishments were also dealt and then we've had gone after our duties
Theme of the camp was Robinson Crusoe, so many games were inspired by the plot
We were almost self-sustainable in our needs
We built our own shelters, cooked our food and collected firewood and so on
We consisted of two units, the larger one was water-based so we also spent a lot of time practicing rowing
Apart from that we also went for tours around the area where we slept under the open sky, played many games, worked
Also we did hold night watch where you could be tested in your vigilance
Rest of the year we spend our time in our clubhouse at the sort of scouting/free time complex on the edge of the city
Playing games usually, or learning how to tie various knots and other things
Large majority of members were teenagers, especially younger ones
Some of the leaders were in their 20's and I remember one scout who was like 60
In Czech Republic there also [tramps] \- loosely connected to scouting - they were called wild scouts and I've read that they are scout punks
Not organized and adults (kids are children of tramps)
I’m a leader in one of the scout-like organizations here
We’re tied to a small protestant church, so there are some differences from the “proper” scouts
First is we are much much smaller organization, so everything we do in our local club is kinda punk, we have to do everything on our own, there aren’t much programme structures established
Second is not only we try to scout moral code, we try to introduce the God and stories from the bible too
About 2/3 of the kids come from the church, the rest are usually their parent’s friend’s kids
Like 90% of the things we do are the same as normal scouts would do and that is pretty much the same the Swiss scouts do
We have some larger events going on too, there are multiple weekend events, summer camps and even international Camporee
Some things I noticed about regular scouts here is they have lots of (although sometimes dated) infrastructure - bases in almost every town, many capmsites and so on
They often use them when club from one town wants to visit another town
Water scouts are quite popular here too, they do a lot of canoying and river tourism, which is very popular vacation in Czechia
Czech scout here
Have you attended the 2019 Intercamp in De Steeg
Scouting organizations used to be divided by political and religious lines in 1920s and 1930s, but currently they differ more by kind of activities
For example woodcrafters are inspired by E. T. Seton and American Indians, Pioneers used to be the main communist organization until 1989, but are politically neutral and sort of generic scout-like camping organization now and there is also a small organization of scouts more in line with original British Baden-Powell's scouting
The club I was member of was founded by former scouts in 1970s when scouting was banned, but we did not rejoin it after 1989 because we developed our own traditions meanwhile
There is an archaeological site if Mušov, a Roman fort from Marcomanic wars, in Southern Moravia
It was already beyond the Limes
Several other Roman military camps were found (for example Olomouc-Neředín) or are suspected, but there was no permanent Roman presence
There are few of them, usually rotundas (e.g. Old Pilsen or St
George on Říp), which are well preserved, but castles and fortresses were mostly rebuilt, but you can still recognise some parts
No, there was almost nothing here during roman empire era, some Germanic tribes etc
nothing was left if something was build, there were some roman military camps and that's pretty much all
(plus some rumors says romans created wineyards at south Moravia but this was debunked both by historians and wine experts)
Song about tracksuits
It's funny and catchy
Czech - Michal Tučný; Tam u nebeských bran
Basshunter what a legend, havent listened to him in ages let me go rectify that
Definitely ice hockey , its something what can put people together
Cold beer is better with group of people in pub, than alone from bottle or can, but even that is better than warm one from plastic bottle
I was at a café in Vienna and talked to the waitress in English
After a while of chatting we then found out she is Slovak, so we switched to our native languages, it was a funny little encounter
With my friends when we were drunk
Also, we had heated argument in Italian
None of us speak Italian
Almost always on the internet
once at Chicago airport
irl never, the accent is just a too obvious hint
in online games it usually depends on these factors:
*they have CZ or CZE in their username
*they cant speak english very well
*they speak czech with a heavy prague accent and slang
*they are 7-11 years old
No, they usually give it to someone who is home or take it back because nobody was there (only for example my parents living in small village and personally knowing the postwoman let her to leave smaller packages on our terrace - it was never stolen and you don't really see there from the road anyway)
The bigger problem here is the delivery itself, it's pretty common they don't even try to deliver it, leave notice you weren't home although you did wait specifically for the package and you have to go to the post office (meaning official post service, private comapnies usually call you before the delivery and you can arrange what to do)
No, this could not really happen where I live because they never ever left a package on the street
It was also reddit who taught me you could hate UPS/DHL/insert your least favourite courier not just because being late but also for damaging the package or leave it in a way someone could steal it
How can anyone support anything free
I would rather expect celebrations
It was proven times and again, that there is strong correlation between school successes and the food
Poor schoolchildren perform better when provided with free meals in school
Free food in schools is a relatively cheap investment with huge returns in form of better population
> I would rather expect celebrations
I am not surprised
Many Czech redditors are kinder-libertarians
Thank you
I don't even remember ever drinking milk so it was surprising for me to give everyone such unusual product
Hannover, there was just nothing to do
Afwully underwhelming when compared to other German cities
Also in the city centre there were more homeless beggars on 20 meters than I've ever seen in my life
Ever seen Pilsen on winter morning
Brno
It's just shit
If it wasn't specified with European, I would have quite a list, now I have to think, but I can't really think of any city without something to offer
Not even a letter
*páni - men* (alternatively can be used to express surprise, kinda like "wow")
*paní - woman/women*
First that came to my mind was smrt=death and zmrd=dickhead, it might not seem that close to you, unless you know that S and Z are pronounced almost the same in Czech
Politici BYLI demonstranty
- The politicians WERE protesters
Politici BILI demonstranty
- The politicians BEAT protesters
Byli and bili are pronounced the same way
Láska = love in Czech :) gotta love these false friends between our languages
This is funny to me that "Láska" means love in Czech
Just want to say that the line above vowel isn't accent like in others languages but it means that vowel should be pronounced longer
Maláka malákia malaká malakía.
But you changed two letters
>Politici BYLI demonstranty
demonstranti, not demostranty
Very easy actually, it's more like a different dialect rather than different language when it comes to difficulty
Czechs and Slovaks can usually hold a conversation while each speaking their own language
You can even use Slovak as official language in your government related communication
I also have Slovak teachers for some of my classes even though I technically study in Czech language only
> copíi = children, but cópii = copies
that's not a homonym, they're pronounced differently
These are just homographs (like read [ri:d] and read [re:d])
> masă = "mass" (in kilograms), but also "table"
> sare = "salt", but also "he/she jumps"
Neither are these
Since these word are spelled the same they are just words with different meanings (like English means both "referring to the English language" and "referring to England")
Homophones would be words that are spelled differently but pronounced the same, like kernel and colonel or martial and marshal
Vždyť sám moc dobře víš že to zní hodně podobné
You sure
Vím ale zadání znělo jedno písmeno
I'm dumb as hell, sorry
Czechs universities are mostly free, but living in university city Is kinda expensive
beer weed methamphetamine
I'd say beer lol
Train tickets, Brno-Prague (~200km) starts at 4€ for adults (low cost, most seats will be for 6-10€), plus there is 75% discount for students and pensioners
I don't know about food in general, but your beans (e.g. Heinz baked beans) are insanely cheap
It's like 3 times cheaper than here
Apparently because you eat twice as much of them as the rest of Europe combined or something like that
That's insane
I was thinking it was maybe 3-4 times more than the rest of Europe, but I didn't want to over-shoot it
But even in my wildest dreams, I wouldn't have thought it would be 10+ times as much
How often do you eat baked beans
A spoon full with every cup of tea
Since it hit our house directly and burned out our electricity and lot of appliances and about 2 or 3 years later another house and went into ours again so it damaged the electric net again (it was really "fun" to watch lightnings going from the outlet), not really
And my great grandma hated it and was terrified since it destroyed the fence and made crater as hell in the garden decades ago
They are scary but cool
I like them, because I live in a dry region of Czech Republic (South Moravia) and we don't get a lot of rain or water here, in summer most of our streams go dry and our crops die because of the dry summers
I am happy for every bit of rain
Computer- Počítač which means counter (as in one who counts)
Damn those Swedish words sounds similar to exact English translations
In Czech is Rhino- "Nosorožec" so same as in Dutch -> Nose horn
Medvídek mýval - -> little washer bear as well
moment - okamžik - blink of an eye
a lot of people mentioned sloth in their languages
In czech it’s lenochod, the lazywalker or slothwalker
ignite - podpálit - underburn
Junky - smažka - fried person
whale - velryba- bigfish
reptile - plaz- crawler
Many words sound strange, if you try to take them literally
* pocketer (kapesník) - handkerchef / tissue
* farseer (dalekohled) - telescope
* bouncething (odrážedlo) - push-bike
* devourer (žralok) - shark
* fatter (tučňák) - penguin
Ve této situaci moc ne
Literally translated it does
Ahoj, jmenuju se John, rád tě poznávám. Odkud jsi ?
Hello, I named John, like to you knowing
From where you ?
Gosh it is hard, when we have ,,words reffering to people" build in pronouns
Ahoj, mé jméno je John
Je potěšení tě poznat
Odkud jsi
Hi, my name is John
Is pleasure you meet
From-where you
The second sentence is like "(it) is pleasure (to) meet you"
I'd say
Hello, naming myself John, gladly you familiarize/acquaint
Where-from are
Full grammatical analysis:
* Ahoj: hello
* jmenuju: 1st person singular "to name, to appoint"
* se: reflexive pronoun
The verb thus takes the meaning "I name myself". As Czech is pro-drop, there's no pronoun "I" in the sentence
* John
* rád: adverb "gladly"
* tě: 2nd person singular informal "you" in accusative case, you-single-informal being an object
* poznávám: 1st person singular imperfective "to familiarize, to get acquainted with". Once again pro-drop reports in
* odkud: "where from". Czech has separate adverbs for "where", "where to", "where from"
* jsi: 2nd person singular "to be". Pro-drop all the way down
This is one hell of a good analysis
Your supply of words is much more suited for this than mine
Local human population counts more than 10 million
I'll just mention wild animals, 'cause dogs and cows and people probably are the most dangerous of all
Individually, probably the odd bear that wanders in from Slovakia, but I don't think there have been any deaths or injuries from bear attacks for decades
I'd guess bees could be among the most dangerous at about 4 deaths annually (within a 10 mio population)
Tick-borne diseases kill about 6 a year
There are vipers but they have not killed anyone in decades, they have a comparatively mild venom
Curiously, one guy was killed by a crocodile in 2010, but that was probably a pet, since we don't have any wild ones
Or I hope that's still the case :) No detailed info about this is available AFAIK
Swans are pretty scary, TBH
Otherwise yeah, I think people saying that ticks, bees and dogs are all more dangerous than the very few wild carnivores we have are spot on
And humans are the most dangerous of all, killing millions of animals and causing all this pollution and stuff
If you mean which animal does the most damage statistically, then ticks (encephalitis, Lyme disease) and bees and wasps (allergies, anaphylactic shocks)
If you mean "theoretically, if you are going to meet this animal in a ring", then probably wolves are
Humans, especially neonazi brainlets protesting face masks and government restrictions
Hornets, vipers, there are few bears in the mountains, but that's about it
I wanted to write "homo sapiens"  ut you were faster xD
We have had both species spontaneously reappearing in recent decades
Lynxes are extremely cautious and do no damage (unless you count a chicken there or a small deer elsewhere)
Wolves also do not attack humans, but are a bit more problematic because shepherds have to change their ways to protect sheep
And they are not used to it as wolves were basically extinct here for a century or more
Lol, Czechs think alike
I have a story from my grandfather
It happened during his mandatory service in czechoslovak army in 1968
He was in infantry, and he got assigned in night shift to guard gate to military base
It was a boring thing to do, until the middle of the night, when out of nowhere, few soviet tanks with white stripe arrived
They demanded his assault rifle and entry to the base
He refused at first, he tried to contact his commander, but as one soldier with rifle against tanks he had no chance but to surrender to them
He was kept captive in his guard booth until morning, and the whole time he had no idea what is going on
In morning, he was reunited with his disarmed unit, and told Czechoslovakia is receiving a “Brotherly help from soviets and other allied socialist countries to prevent coup”.
It was the night when soviet union and his vassals in warsaw pact occupied czechoslovakia for its reforms
Would you guys stop, lol
We already have it bad enough with the Danes that come to raid our capital every year
Apparently they don't come to take any land, though, they only want the beer and to fuck some shit up
Yeah, I feel like it's a conspiracy
Our  cheap bars are constantly under attack from all sides
Even Americans seem to be in on it
It's not that complicated
In a parliamentary republic (which is what most European republics are, as opposed to your presidential republic), the president is pretty much a ceremonial role
They're formally in charge of the army, sign laws after the parliament approves them, and some other stuff, but they can rarely actually do anything against the will of the parliament or the government and their main role is shaking hands with other heads of state and holding speeches on national holidays
The Prime Minister is the one with executive power, who chooses the ministers for their cabinet and actually governs the country
A Chancellor is basically the German term for PM, AFAIK
As for why the roles are divided like that, I think the main idea is that the president should be someone less controversial, who isn't an active member of a particular political party and gives the people a sense of unity and wisdom (at least in theory)
Whereas the prime minister is just the victor of elections, so they'll be a decisive, polarising figure that can get replaced much more frequently
That's why there's a higher age requirement for presidency (40 here in CZ) and their terms may be longer
Yeah
It's not working great for us since the introduction of direct presidential elections
Exactly the reason why that idea was criticized, it doesn't make sense in a parliamentary system
The Parliament and the Senate together
There were always behind-the-scenes plots and arguments about whether their vote should be secret or not, but eh, in retrospect it doesn't seem so bad
No, that would be super weird here
I didn't even know there's a Europe day tbh
People do fly Czech and American ones a lot on the 8th though
Excluding government offices
Nowhere
There were a lot of US flags on 8th of May though
We celebrate only the 8th of May as a Day of victory
Well liberation day is celebrated on this particular day
Definitely Pelíšky
btw, since you're Polish, let me compliment your nation's cinematography on movie Sexmisja
It's a masterpiece
[Jara Cimrman, Ležící Spící]
It’s ony Netflix btw
I really enjoyed:
Taxidermia (2006)
Son of Saul (2015)
Dealer (2004)
What about RRRrrrr
I am curious about hungary-romanian film *Dolina* (2007)
Movie is based on Adam Bodór novel *Az érsek látogatása
* I really enjoyed the reading and story of the book, the movie is still a mystery for me because it's unavailable on the net
This is good movie aswell:  **Lust och fägring stor**
"I just wonder, where did the comrades from GDR make mistake
Kdy byste dostali 2 naprosto stejné krabičky, jednu z NDR a jednu z USA, kterou byste si vybraly
I dunno 'bout this raiding thing
That is so 9th century
Let's defenestrate someone instead, that never gets old
Underrated comment
Don't worry, the budget may be a little constricted, but our boys will be home by Christmas
Slovak president Zuzana Caputova to replace our president [Milos Zeman
] Please bratia, send her here and take this spiteful old man
>I'd choose Zuzana Čaputová
As head of state
Definitely
She is professional, dignified and charming etc
But as head of goverment
I am not sure
She is a bit too liberal for me
I would go for Micheál Martin instead
Even ceremonial president can be very dangerous
It used to be mostly ceremonial position here, but current president proved that constitution can be bent, and that he can cause a lot of damage
For example:
He is the one that officially names the generals or professors into office
But constitution just states president do it, and he argues that there is no time limit and that there isn’t written he has to do it
He is blocking naming of secret service general, who often warns of Russian activities (president is Sino-Russian asslicker)
He decides who can try to build government coalition after elections - he already chosen his own minions’ government without parliament support once, and he let them rule for too long
He did it again after elections, he appointed winner of it as sole ruler without consent of parliament
This decision was meant to be formality based on agreement in parliament
He covers up for his band of criminals in presidents office
His chancellor failed to get security check from secret service, that is needed for his office
But the president keeps him there
The chancellor is shady guy, who is well known from his EU funds fraud, bribery and other
So DONT ELECT DANGEROUS PEOPLE even into ceremonial functions
It doesn't have to necessarily be someone I agree with politically
I just want someone who can walk and isn't an old drunk
Please help :(
>Well, the tile says head of government or president
You are right, I misread the title
Sorry about that
This "naming" was always considered some kind of ceremony: professors and generals receive their title from the hands of the president
Previous presidents never said "no, I am not going to do so".
Mind you, it is not the only thing the current president did
For example, the law says the president names prime minister, and prime minister asks the parliament for the confidence vote
But it doesn't say *whom* the president names, nor how quickly does he, nor how quickly the prime minister has to call for the confidence vote
So after the parliament rejected his *protégé*, he simply nominated him once again and made it known he will nominate him again and again, not giving the chance to anyone else
After the fall of Nečas cabinet in 2014, he directly named his guy a prime minister, a guy not even a member of parliament
The law says that the president names his chancellery, and that the chancellor should have security clearance
Zeman has named a person without security clearance
Why
Because the law doesn't include any provisions how to unname a chancellor
What can you do
President also spread lies and refuses to apologize
The law says that the president can only be prosecuted for the great treason, so defamation is ok
Basically, our law is based on the idea that the president won't break the law, or how he personally calls it, "creatively interpret the law".
Definitely the variety of swear words
You can mix any two existing swear words together and it sounds awesome
Icelandic is not Old Norse, you can find youtube videos with parallel fragments from sagas, there are both phonetic and grammatical changes
Disclaimer: I don't speak either
I read an interesting article on this a couple of days ago
Perhaps someone here could elaborate, because I don't know enough to judge, if it's completely true, but in the article it said that in the Nordic countries it's kind of a faux pas to stand out
Specifically, it was talking about Sweden's covid strategy and how it still had a lot of support despite the fact that it wasn't working
Allegedly, a lot of scientists (Swedish ones, as well as ones only residing in Sweden) demanded a change to it, but instead of their ideas being considered and there being some kind of national debate on the topic, they were told to shut up and in some cases the backlash was so strong, that they decided to leave the country
It could be exaggerated or flat out untrue, so I've been meaning to ask, if anyone from a Nordic country has anything to say about it
> Even the poorest and the workers are heavily taxed, despite our  'progressive' tax system
In the last 20 or so odd years, liberal and  social democratic governments alike, the tax-burden has been lightened  for the richest, and spread to the broader population,  dis-proportionally affecting those already weakest in society
Definitely agree with the taxation
I was really demoralised during my gap-year about this
It seriously disincenivises low-skilled workers from taking part in the economy
Very common
It is used in the same way as in English
“Well the world after first world war kinda went downhill
“What do you mean ‘first world war’?”
He will probably wonder what happened to Czechoslovakia, the state he currently loves, and I will try to explain to him why it was doomed to fail from the beginning and that Czechoslovak nation was bullshit idea only Czechs believed in
Also he might wonder where are his German and Jewish neighbors, story how germans killed the jews and czechs expelled them, won't be pleasant to tell
Given the Czech-German relationship status and high levels of nationalism in 1919 I wouldn't be surprised if he was happy about it
Well, the whole Czechoslovakia didn't really work out in the end and about 50 or 60 of those 100 years were kinda shit
But it's not so bad now
We lost the republic to german nazis for 7 years of absolute terror because our allies france and britain betrayed us
After the war we were betrayed by the US and the communists took over for 41 years of terror
But same as with the monarchy, we prevailed and became free once again, this time we set a new record and are still a democratic republic after 30 years, that's 10 more years than between 18-38
Also the commie hungarians and nationalistic poles got their heads kicked in but we didn't manage to get all the territory we wanted to 'reclaim'.
What happened
A lot awful stuff
*explains WW2, the Soviet bloc and then rise to the independence from it which we're celebrating this year*
... And yeah, few years after that, Czechoslovakia was no more
"Yeah, we're independent now, 3rd time's the charm right
It’s wasn’t common name tho
Thats thin ice for Germans
Accomplishments of Wermacht idk about that
But German patriotism for times before wars should be supported
For avhievements in various fields
I'd say when we look at European history as a whole, it's generally the Balkans region that gets shafted the most
Yeah, people sometimes remember it exists past the 19th century
But there's one period that doesn't get much attention, unlike other long periods of warfare (Dutch war of independence, Thirty-years-war etc
The Austro-Turkish wars, or Ottoman wars in Europe
Over two hundred years of drawn out warfare with little conclusion - and it only draws attention once you scream "winged hussars in Vienna".
And there's so much historical significance there - subjucation of multiple nations by the Turks, the attempts to dislodge them (ranging from almost-successful to holy-hell-how-did-you-survive-this), the slow struggle of the Austrians trying to recapture Hungary fortress by fortress, the legend of Eugene of Savoy and the Great Turkish War - you know what I'm shutting up, go google
You know what's even sadder
I don't remember a single thing about PLC being taught at school except for the Jagellons, who ruled our lands for a short period of time
It was mostly about our history, HRE, Habsburgs and modern age
Possibly [Pankrác?] Sadly Prague is the only city where anything like what you mentioned could be built, but each time someone wants to build a skyscraper they have to fight dozens of "landmark protectors" because It WoUlD rUiN pAnOrAmA oF pRaGuE
For example we could've had [this] (which looks extremely dope in my opinion, also it's quite unique) but everyone went nuts so we don't have anything
Oh well
Step: 1 Take the biggest current Prague number
Step: 2 google it
Step: 3 do the images look like a bunch of field with fuck all
if yes go to step 1 and subtract a number if not you have your answer
Meanwhile Žižkov tower has been built and people just got used to it
In czechia it’s probably Aš. It’s also the westernmost settlement in country
We have a town called Aš. It is the shortest name in the Czech Republic, I think
We also have Eš (between Tábor and Pelhřimov)
And Aš is the westernmost town, there are villages further west
Not a native speaker, but still:
Opened all of them, all are fine but Italian and Galician one
Italian was about some astrophysics, so it might be the issue
Galician surprisingly was harder than Portuguese, maybe because the portuguese one was about one Abba song, while Galician one was about some of Berliose's work
Re-clicked, got Israel, first paragraph is clear
Here and there some words are guesswork, but overall the number of unknown words is small
The grammar is real pain in the ass, complex sentences are hard to understand
He's translated as Pytlík (little bag) here and I think nobody complains
Some of the names in Harry Potter are translated too, but mostly in a really clever way that is helpful for younger readers and keeps with the meaning
But for example the really incompetent translator of Song of Ice and Fire made terrible job, because she not only screwed the translation as a whole, but chose terrible name translations (some of them), in the middle of the whole saga suddenly translated almost all of them, even though she first used mostly not translated and then, after a book or two, said sorry, I take it back, here we continue with not translated
How stupid do you have to be to do something like this
Here, Harry Potter translations are mostly praised for being very throughout and creative and yet undisruptive, memorable, and overally good
One example, the name Dumbledore comes from an archaic word for a bumblebee
In the translation, it's *Brumbál* which comes from an archaic Czech word for a bumblebee as well, yet it sounds as a bit quirk but still naturally sounding surname
However, this prompted many translators of different books to attempt to do the same and failing miserably
The worst example is likely A Song of the Ice and Fire when the translator decided in the middle of the series (A Feast for the Crows) that since the Medek brothers, the HP translators, were so successful with translating surnames of characters, she could do the same and decided to change a name of any house that had a slightly meaningful name, House Redwyne became *Rudovíni*, House Merryweather became *Dobrovětrovští* etc
What's worse is that she often didn't do any research about the origins of the name and simply translated her first impression of what she thought it meant and wasn't even consistent with it
For example, House Harlaw sounded like "Hard Law" to her so she translated it as *Drsnozákonští* but occassionally as *Drsnořádi* as well
Because of a very negative feedback, she returned to original English names in A Dance with Dragons so AFFC remained only as a bad memento
Baggins is "Pytlík" in Czech
It means "small bag" but also can mean "ballsack".
How come I have untranslated names in my books
Those still being published by Talpress, not the new translations
Is this where the name from Legolas and Laura comes from
In ASOIAF she just
didn't understand at all how Czech works it seems
Literal translations, phrases that didn't make any sense (for example if someone was described as "bear of man", she made him "medvěd muže" WTF
), terribly put sentences and the worst sin, for example lady Stokeworth in first two books, lady Stokořínská in another
and then after expectable backlash, lady Stokeworth once again - and every other name that means something ended up this way (except the main houses and names like Tarly etc that doesn't directly mean anything)
Especialy Ironborn were an absolute mess because of this
But I don't think it was hard for Medek to come up with Bradavice
Like
Hogwarts is literally switched warthog, there are hogs on the gate, so
I have found the Czech translations in Harry Potter extremely charming
Things have a more magical feel and feel way-less nerdy when translators make the effort to work the weird English terms into the other language
I think that the series struck a perfect balance between translated and non-translated terms
Even names like Lenka Láskorádová work really well
Talpress apparently published [two editions] the first in 2006 and the second in 2012
Maybe you've got the one from 2012 and they already changed it there
U těch bastardích jmen mi to zrovna moc nevadí, tam je podle mě důležitý si při čtení připomínat, že jim prostě říkají jinak a podle něčeho, čeho je v tom kraji příliš, aby se líp vnímalo to stigma kolem
Když čteš Rivers nebo Hill, tak ti to prostě přijde jako obyčejný anglický příjmení a neřešíš.
I'm gonna
pretend it doesn't exist
I bought English version, so
oooh Hera
Most likely
It's absolutely terrible and yes I feel it like a huge loss for all of us
So, as of now, I'm becoming acquainted with it via reddit
I was little surprised that reddit won the race with other media in this case (that someone didn't told me earlier for example)
And what concerns the event itself, I'm ... unmoved
Eh, not trying to sound like a douche, but they'll repair it, even if it takes a couple of years
I don't see a reason to get upset about one cathedral getting partially destroyed, Germany got hundreds of similar buildings bombed into the shadow realm and they built them back
It's a shame, but nothing catastrophic
I mean it sucks, as would any large fire, but I don't really … care
I guess it's just me but if you asked me yesterday to name 5 points of interest in Paris Notre-Dame would not be one of them
When I saw the news last night, I couldn't believe it at first
I've been to the cathedral twice already and I definitely thought I would see it again one day
My second visit was two years ago, so I still remember the peaceful atmosphere inside
It was hard to imagine that should be lost forever
Luckily the cathedral did not burn to the ground so I believe it will be restored, even though it might take a decade or two to do so
For me and my wife it's like 9-11, it symbolizes an end of an era and I'm sure it will be used in history books as such
Such a terrible loss
That kind of sucks, but it's nothing I won't see in my lifetime
Up until then, photos and a thousand of different cathedrals in Europe will suffice I believe
As long as it gets restored eventually, I won't mind, even if the current events might incite some bad emotions in me
Nope
Most Germans just come off as condescending and slightly arrogant but it's not by a lot and it's well within norms
So you're quite normal
Dutch are the actual ones who are very aggressive and arrogant
There's a massive difference there
I appear to myself more confident when speaking English And I am Czech native speaker
The capital city itself or its people
I myself don't hate Prague the city, it is too big for my taste, but parts of it are quite lovely
I don't hate the people there either, we just like making fun of them for their accent and sometimes uppity attitude, but it's not hatred by any means
Not on my part anyway
the same in Prague, one of the reasons why it is disliked is that the average wage in Prague is 30% higher than in the country
I feel like Bratislava is mostly ok with the rest of slovakia
What do you mean by “accent”? :D We are those without any xd
I mean the wage might be a factor, but in my experience it's mostly the annoying accent and the general feeling of superiority
Hell no
You have one, instead of normal speech you are "singing".
I mean atrocities such as *vepřejď* instead of *vpředu
* Hearing it for the first time sent shivers down my spine
>vepřejď
Hele čoveče, nemáš žvejku
Do they really say that
To my Southwestern Bohemian ears, it sounds like a Northeastern Bohemian word
how can you spot diference between bohemian accent
I am originaly from Liberec and now i am living in prague and the accent is same
yeah it means exactly what you write :)
The tendency of using the final -j (or in this case the penultimate -j-) sounds like that to me, it looks and sounds similar to e.g. _k dědoj_. The closest we have is -ojc as in Novákojc, but this suffix with j is an exception
The 2013 [Nagyová case] A managing director in the prime minister Nečas' cabinet (later revealed to be his lover, and is his current wife) was found to have abused her position for unauthorized use of intelligence services to spy on the prime minister's wife (now ex-wife)
Prime minister later resigned, still defends his (current) wife
Edit: fixed position in the cabinet
ever collapsed
hehe
1997,2004,2005,2009,2013  just pick one
Well, in 1989 there was Velvet Revolution, but after that, one falls every now and then, like when mistress of our former prime minister (Petr Nečas) was using millitary intelligence to spy on his wife and few others
She was in the cabinet
I thought she was something like PM’s personal assistant/secretary
I actually meant that she was a highly positioned employee *of* the Cabinet ("Managing Director of the Section of the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic's Cabinet" to be precise), not  a *member* of the cabinet (Minister)
My bad
They're Germans
They'll plan their infrastructure even as an asteroid is falling on the planet
English is kind of taken for granted these days, but not at a very good level (above B1 or so) until you prove it
I know a few people in their 30s who haven't retained much of any language from school, and they definitely see it as a loss they're trying to fix now
Mostly because of job requirements, but also because they know they're missing out on most of the internet, videogames, shows etc
Daily life in our country is mostly very monolingual, though
I feel like it is given that Czech is almost exclusively spoken in Czech
Yeah
A Scottish friend of mine said that Scandinavians can pretty much be considered native speakers, a lot of the time
The quality of English teachers is dogshit
I think at least you need to reach B1 to leave high school, but honestly I think lot of people barely reach that and even those who do usually never use it and quickly forget it
Half of my class in good grammar school was only B1
Smart people, but the teachers were just awful
English lessons are daily occurrence in many companies, but in my experience lot of people struggle, but make very slow progress
Lot of people still don't take it very seriously
That's my experience as well
Whenever I tried speaking French to French people in France, they would answer in English
My French is definitely not great, but I'd like to think it's not *that* bad
Yeah, it's pretty bad
High school should end at B2 in my opinion, but I don't know if we'll ever get there
My English teacher in high school was extremely old fashioned and boring, and the only thing that saved me was already being at B2 by then after I'd taken some adult courses outside of school (and you shouldn't HAVE TO pay to supplement basic education like that)
Otherwise I would've probably starting hating the entire language
My maturita was in the only year when you could choose "higher level" language exams (B2), and of course that didn't stick either because nobody else wanted them
Unless I'm told to bring something from the fridge or I'm expected to make my meals from what they have (I'm there for longer, I'm close family), I wouldn't do it, yes, I'd think it's very rude
I would say that even looking under the lid is rude
I do both as a joke when visiting good friends, but wouldn’t do that any other time
It would be ride to get some food or other stuff
But if you are drinking beer guests are free to get a new one how they wish
I really like what austrian Houses look like
You can always say excatly when you crossed the border because of them
Czech houses are usually Made out of concrete, but the ones in Austria are mostly wooden
They just look really nice :D
Uhh
I dunno, There's nothing special about them that I like or I know I guess
Halušky thanks, Slovakia
Hands down the best thing about Croatia is the people
And they have some of the best wine and sights
The biggest difference once you cross austrian borders are the roads
I’d say Andrej Babis, our prime minister
He’s originally Slovak so would be great if they just took him back haha
He wouldn’t have to go far
No one
I don't believe that a single person makes a difference, if you kick out some moron in politics, the morons voting him will find someone else in the same vein
Only total and systematic attention to politics and engagement will help
[Andrej Babiš]
He disgraces Czechia in the EU
He has a conflict of interest
He influences public opinion through his media
During communist Czechoslovakia, he belonged to the criminal police "ŠtB". His government relies on the support of the Communist Party
He is scrapping the state budget and state reserves, maybe for him I will never receive a pension from Czechia, because he needs money for his populist gestures for stupid uneducated people
When we received support from China during the coronavirus epidemic, he was waiting for it at the airport, and I'm surprised he didn't kiss those fucking boxes
When we received coronavirus support from Taiwan, he didn't even thank them
He steals opposition proposals, rejects them and then proposes them himself
([not just] On November 16, 2019, 300000 people [demonstrated] for his resignation, and he still did not resign
Make Andrej Babiš Slovak again
I came here just to write his name as well
I will trade you one Donald Trump for one Babiš.
Or Okamura
There is much more
For example, the abduction of his own son to the Crimea or making life uncomfortable for small business owners
But that would be material for a book
I was thinking most people would write Zeman, but he's going to dissolve by himself
He can be friend with Orban
I had flights to northern Italy, and I got my full refund PLUS 75€ from collibra
Thanks Babiš!
How very generous of you
But no, you keep them
We’re good with just ours
Can’t believe I’m actually saying this but
I’d take Babiš over Trump anyday
For sure
The list could go on
But if it comes to choosing just one person
Babis has the most power out of the bunch
Imo he’s just a successfull entrepreneur, making money of the political system here
Seems kinda harmless, people supporting his party tho
Oh no, what would Vladimir/ Donald/XiXi do without visiting our lovely dumpster-fire
Piers is OK guy
Sure, you don't have to agree with him but compare him with Hopkins or Farage
Andrej Babiš invites Slovaks to Czechia
Please invite Andrej Babiš to Slovakia (not just in court in Bratislava)
I look forward to it
Right
All of my Czech friends were talking about all the terrible things about Babiš, And in my head I was thinking, "I wish he was my president
" haha
But still, he sucks
He is a snake oils salesmen
He managed to carve himself a nice little corner in the Czech political spectrum where he woos gullible idiots into voting for him using fearmongering populist bullshit and he profits off of it
I genuinly believe he doesn't give a fuck about politics or EU or muslims or his voters, he is in it for himself only
So I guess good on him but yeah his voter base is insane
Mmmm, kobliha
Yeah Babis is bad for this country
No doubt
But you’re right that every time I start getting too
frustrated about our politics I just remember Trump and US and I suddenly feel much better about my tiny little country
I regret coming back to the states in May
But, I always come back to CZ
You can give your child any existing name, either Czech or foreign
If the name is very uncommon, you may need to prove that it's actually a real existing name and get an expert report that states that
You can't give your child a name that's a diminutive/nickname derived from a name, it has to be in the "default" version
A girl can't have a boys' name, a boy can't have a girls' name
There are some gender neutral names but there's not many of them
A child also can't have the same name as their living sibling (if the kids share both of the parents)
It's only allowed to give a child up to two first names
You can't use a last name as a first name
You also can't use names for objects or just random words in general, this includes words in foreign languages unless they're being used as names for people somewhere
> You can't use the name of a living parent or sibling
Gaius Julius Caesar after reading this: *Mē pudet, fīlī*
> You can give your child any existing name, either Czech or foreign
If the name is very uncommon, you may need to prove that it's actually a real existing name and get an expert report that states that
This is actually very tricky formulation
301/2000 Sb
§62 says "Vital record accepts any existing name in its correct form". It is solely their decision whether the name is "existing" and "is in correct form", any digression from their opinion does cause long legal battle
In reality, it's virtually impossible to give Czech baby a non-Czech name; foreigners are less affected by this tho
Because most people believe that it should be up to them to decide what their name will be
Národní museum (national museum) in Prague is the best and the biggest, but I really love Prácheňské museum in city Písek (Sand)
I really like National technology museum in Prague
My parents are both monolingual so there was no way they could do this
And even if they did remember some Russian from school, I doubt that they would do that
Not me but I know a kid and one his parents is Spanish and the other one is Czech and his parents use German when they talk to each other
He himself doesn’t speak German but he spokes both Czech and Spanish and his parents only speak their language and German
No, parents in my country take it as a competition who will scar the child psychologically the most
It does greatly
People will generally treat you 1000x better if you try to speak the local language and they will try to be pretty helpful
Even if you can only speak few words, go for it
Even if it sounds bad, we'll like it
It's the effort that counts
I think it's awesome but probably slower than just speaking English
I don’t really feel that way, if you aren’t Slav, there is no way you will pronounce our words right (as a tourist) and I think it’s much faster to just speak English, just say:”I’m sorry I don’t speak your language, do you speak English
” And everyone from the younger generation have to speak English, it doesn’t have to be B2 English, but if you graduate from high school, you should on B1 level, which is alright
I once saw a sign in polish saying „Czechów nie obsɫugujemy, p.s Krecik to cwel
I'm not sure why I'm mentioning it, but I understood it and found it funny
Grzegorz Brzeczyszczykiewicz
Zajebiscie, kurwa
I have to say I've never ever experienced any bad reaction from Spaniards, even when my Spanish was very basic
Ironically, the only time I had bad reaction to my Spanish was in Barcelona, where an old fellow demanded me to speak Catalan
Prague is a different beast, everyone is used to foreigners
Better trying it in some random village
Not sure about your redbull vodka, there's really not much to translate
We pronounce it almost exactly the same way as in English
But you are right, sometimes we have a syllable with no vowel, but r or l instead
That's true for the younger generation, I don't mind either, but older people appreciate it a lot
Similar with people who don't understand English in general
Very Spanish and much Spanish
> Damn, just realised what a douche I am
You are not
French, for example, react badly if they don't hear "Bonjour". You don't have to adjust to every local idiosyncrasy in every country
I went to Italy quite a few times and it always surprised me, that many of the people I spoke to had better german than english
Maybe try german next time
That’s maybe the best thing to do, or just say “dobrý den” “good day” at the start of the conversation or maybe the best would be “dobrý den, promiňte” and add the “sorry” at the end, because it typical for Czechs to say sorry at the start of the conversation when talking to a stranger
I don't think we dislike you, we just sometimes like to make fun of your language (But that goes both ways I believe)
It seems to be true at least where I live though, that out of all our neighbours, we hang out with you the least
But I don't think we would dislike you
Slovakia are obviously our homies, Austria is the country to which I feel most culturally connected and Germany is the "big responsible brother".
Oh, I know
This was one single case, usually no one bats an eye
I like the attitude, no one was pissed off because of my mistakes, no one was pissed off because I speak Spanish while my English is better
It really encouraged me
> Los españoles son muy españoles y mucho españoles
Mariano Rajoy
Everyone here is really poetic and I just came to say beer
I was born in Ukraine
The smell of dill always brings back my childhood memories
You can smell it in every kitchen and on every outdoor market
My grandma was putting it in canned food and she used to grow it on her garden also
We had so much dill plants there
Probably the smell of knedlo-vepřo-zelo, a czech meal
Lots of high quality booze, goose and sweaty socks
And also a hint of smog (looking at you, industrial cities)
Well I'd say that contemporary Paris has a different, slightly less appealing smell
>Maybe no smell at all is it most significant trait, just fresh mountain air
Why, juniper of course
That's lovely :) Just don't tell any Czechs you like trdelnik, they will try to smite you :D
It's actually Hungarian or Romanian and kind of a tourist trap, because they're popping up everywhere tourists are, claiming to be genuine Czech baked goods
I personally don't care, I like the smell and anything baked with cinnamon is top shit in my opinion, but a lot of people in Prague fucking hate trdelnik
That was exactly what I was getting at hahah
Why not
We allow tabaco and alcohol which are way worse
I'm cautiously pro-legalization
I understand keeping it illegal doesn't really help anyone (except the black market)
However, if we move to legalize it, it should be done in a way that doesn't normalize it
At the end of the day it's a drug and should be treated as such
Obviously, I have no issue with its medical use
I understand I'm in a minority, but I find the quite literal obsession with cannabis that some people have unhealthy and quite honestly pathetic (for the record, same goes for all drugs)
Yeah, I would legalize it but penalize driving high as a kite
It definitely should
It's so hypocritical when alcohol and tobacco are legal and very much socially acceptable, and still so many people (including politicians) act like it's something horrible
Weed is not physically addictive and has less harmful effects than alcohol and cigarettes, plus it can be used to treat some mental illnesses for example
In my opinion, the war on drugs only causes harm to society and isn't productive at all
A much better approach would be legalizing drugs like weed or psychedelics and decriminalizing harder drugs
Harm reduction is much better than putting someone in jail for a bit of weed
I absolutely hate the high
But just make it legal for gods sake
It's a fucking plant
1) Isn't nearly as harmful as alcohol or tobbaco
2) Has a huge medical potential
3) People call it a gateway drug
It's not because the high makes you want more drugs
It's because of its popularity and when one finds a way to buy it, they simulatenously find a way to buy other illegal drugs
4) The state will get huge profits from taxes and destroy source of income for crime organizations in one hit
True, there will be smugling, but most people will want to buy it legally
5) It's about damn time we stop this stupid war on drugs shenanigans
It's not helping anyone and i feel like this is the first logical step
Definitely legilize, I've met some people that are into it and they're way more chill people than people that are into alcohol
Yes, there are no negatives
E= I meant legalising it has no negatives, not that weed itself has no negatives
I agree with you, and I think that this is a big problem with alcohol in the Czech Republic, it has become so normalized (the same goes for tobacco I would say) and yet the majority of people act like weed is so much worse and say that legalisation would ruin our society
I find it so hypocritical, especially since weed doesn't have as serious effects as alcohol and isn't physically addictive
When I was working in Netherlands I lived in Den Bosch which is compared to Amsterdam small city  without much turist and everytime I went to coffeshop there was full
So I think dutch people also enjoy cannabis just  they don't want to admit it:D.
Could you elaborate on why I am being delusional
I meant legalising it has no negatives
Hows that gonna change by legalising it
Plenty of people smoke today, youth has easier access to other drugs thru their dealers etc
As a kid I thought that 'the Baltics' (Pobaltí-Pribaltika) were one country, since they were always referred to as a grouped up thing
When somebody mentioned one of them, I just thought they were speaking about regions
Then I heard of some meeting of their presidents and was [pretty baffled
Just the common ones come to my mind, I thought Malta speaks Italian and that Bosnia and Herzegovina make the two federative units of which the country consists
Also I remember having a heated argument with my friend about whether the capital of Ireland is Dublin or Baile Átha Cliath
When I was really small I remember watching Married with Children, dubbed obviously, and I still remember it was Peggy saying something and finishing it with wether he doesn't understand English or something like that (probably another of their fights)
Since that day, even though only for a short time, I believed English is the same as Czech, since they talked Czech (dubbing) and said if he understands "anglicky", so she obviously said it in English and it sounded exactly as Czech and I didn't really met English yet
And this is about USA, not Europe, but also from TV
Watching Grease as a small child, watching all the old actors and the completely different school system with different steps I believed people study about 10 years of highschool in USA (since they talked about 10th grade and such) and that's why they are way older than people from our regular highschool I saw
OP, it's understandable that you believed [that]
> I thought the Iron Curtain was a real, physical object, some sort of border fortifications system,
It was
right bad, left good
It was out of iron and the fence quite resembles curtain
It was real physical object made out of iron
they indeed do
that's why I refrain from generalizations like that
1) Amsterdam, Netherlands
The most stunning place I've been to
2) Prague, Czechia
A lot of historical buildings and very unique culture
3) Budapest, Hungary
A party town, lots of great night clubs
4) Brugges, Belgium
5) Paris, France
Goriffee from Bratislava has been my favourite lately
None of that big brand dark roasts like Lavazza Illy Segafredo etc, there are plenty of small coffee roasting places in cz and svk with wide range of tastes and feels
My partner is French
I'd never had a 'thing' for French culture, never learned French in school or anything like that, it was completely random that we met while we were both staying temporarily in Germany
Neither of us fits many stereotypes about our nations, but obviously there are some things, like we always have debates about 'proper' meal times (Czech dinner at 6pm vs
French dinner at 9 or something), missing proper croissants or eclairs in Czechia, light-hearted stuff like that
Our political views and values are thankfully quite similar
I feel like it would have been more difficult to find a similarly progressive and egalitarian-minded man among Czechs, there's a bit of a macho culture here
His parents have also been very chill with me, I expected to be judged for some things about myself, but not at all
I'm kinda glad that my family doesn't speak much of any foreign language, because otherwise they'd probably be way nosier and more unpleasant (although I don't really have a comparison, this is my first relationship serious enough to visit each other's families)
One cultural difference I didn't expect was him being so staunchly anti-religion (I'm atheist too, but in a more neutral/passive way), despite still being Catholic on paper, and that definitely has to do with French discourse around the laicity principle
Another one is the expectation for public services and such stuff to just work, I know French people complain about their bureaucracy a lot too, but he definitely wasn't ready for some of the messes here
My boyfriend is from Slovakia so we just trash our countries for fun all the time lol
Central Europe
Tons of people here live on a super early timezone, starting work around 7am and trying to get home as early as possible
So lunch is at 11 and dinner at 6
People say it has something to do with the Austro-Hungarian emperor Franz Joseph being an early bird, so people wanted to imitate him and they've kinda stuck with it since
It could be an urban legend, IDK
I think it's sort of changing with younger generations, but like my grandparents would still call anyone who gets up after 7am lazy, not noticing that they also fall asleep 6 hours earlier than us
I was always jealous as a kid, when I heard that school started at 9 in other countries
Everything is based on early birds being the norm here
We even adapted the "imbus" in Czech for the hex
Sounds strange to me with 'n'
> Doing small things 'here and there' and fucking, do not necessarily have to mutually exclusive for her
Czech verb "šukat" used to mean "do small things", but then evolved to "move back and fro" and later to "fuck". Now, imagine the class reading [this book] from mid-XIX century, where the grandmother was "fucking around the house".
It's our secret plan
Yes
Until "millenials" become thing on the internet, I had no idea generations are named or anything
It sure is
Here we think of generations only in a few dimensions
Like postcommunist and those "born in the previous regime". Of course the elderly, but that's pretty much the extent of it
Time will tell if there will be a bigger divide between my 'generation' (born in the late 90's) and these 'americanized youngsters'. Because I'm not sensing much of it
Yes, except we are not naming generations
Older people are still going to complain about younger generations, they just use "kids/young adults" instead of millenials
Im British originally, when I left ten years ago it just seemed to be young people, over forties and then pensioners
There is definitely some leakage of US politics into British though and there is talk, especially places like reddit or the media and FB groups of boomers and millenials but its too broad
With Czechs people above 50 are written off as the communist generation
For me there seems to be big differences between over 50s, then people 35-50 and then under 35s are different again
a (and), i (and, also), k (to, for), v (in), z (from), s (with), o (about), u (near, by)
Edit: I forgot Ó and Á as interjecton (surprise, aha moment, wonder or scream), it's counted among word class too
Czech has a couple:
a - and
i - and/too
k - to, towards, for
o - about (something)
s - with
u - next to, by
v - in, inside
z - from
a = and
i = "and also" or "and X as well"
o = about
u = next to
k = toward
s = with
v = in
z = from
For example parents don’t usually talk abt wages to kids, to raise them better and not make them spoiled, but adults do between each other pretty usually, same goes to working teens, to those it’s a normal thing
And if you mean about wages in general, people in Europe discuse it often
(Sorry for my spelling, and also this is just my view)
I mean, it might damage your relationship with that person, so for you personally it is generally wiser to not talk about it
But not talking about wages also heavily benefit employer and not employees, as he have to pay more only to people which ask for more
I'd say green ones
And I also prefer green olives over the black ones
Yeah green ones but I like black olives only
Satellites and probes
Lots of them
Half of the scientific and research satellite infrastructure
We're technically a parliamentary democracy, though power has seemingly been slipping more into the presidents hands
He can be overridden by the parliament, but since there are often weak coalitions or, right now, a minority cabinet, he plays one party against the other and comes out on top
For example, there was this minister that the socialists (cabinet minor party) wanted to resign, since he was nominated by them and didn't do a good job
Prime minister said ok, but the president said he won't sign his resignation, even though he's obligated to - prolonging the matter for months, eventually settling on a different successor than the socialists wanted - again, even though the president had no basis for such actions
Also, since the president has the presidential pardon in his hands, and our prime minister is being accused of economic crimes and is in a conflict of interest (he own a major business he's, allegedly, favoring in state subsidies and cracking down on his business rivals)
So the president has the prime minister in his pocket and PM won't go against him
TLDR: Right now, the system is unbalanced and the president is pushing its boundaries in the direction of presidential rule
Well, our president is an old drunk dude, with dementia, who hasn't been sober for 7 years of his presidency and our prime minister is megalomaniac/mafia boss, who owns most food, agriculture and media companies, over which he still has a control (unoficially), steals from EU and does shit for people, only if he wants to improve his public image, so things are great
To your question, prime minister has always more power than president (PM is head of government), but president can veto laws from parliment (who create laws), but parliment can overrule presidential veto by majority and get the law in lawbooks anyway
Also PM consults with president important decisions
Well, our president doesn’t really have a true power
He can veto laws
He’s supposed to be a representative figure
The PM has the true power
He (and the chamber of deputies) can make laws and stuff
So yeah, it’s kinda supposed to be a balance (and they teach us in schools about said balance), but the reality is different
And rn the president is kinda pushing our country towards more of a presidential country, rather than the parliamentary one
Which kinda makes sense to me, since we can vote our president directly (it wasn’t like that), but I’m more fond of the parliamentary democracy that we have rn
I think here our prime minister has a lot more power than our president
Like, I don't know much about politics (I'm a teenage boy), but because of TV and news on the internet I think he is well overpowered
I believe that only individual himself knows best how to operate on free market to benefit him the most
If you want to build the road, take a loan and pay it back using toll, if you want hospital get insurance, if you want police, just order this service the same way you hire your gas/water piping guy
I've read that most Finnish people nowadays are opposed to mandatory Swedish in schools, is that true
To me (from a monolingual country) it surely seems like a lot you're doing for a fairly small minority
Would it not be sufficient to protect Swedish as a regional language
Yes, there's school 1-9 grade on my way to work and pre-covid I was seeing tons of kids going in/out without adults every day
It's also common to send kids alone via train to school in another town since grade 1 here, because there is no school in our village anymore and when parents work in a place/time that it's not possible to take them to school, the kid simply has to go alone
It was no problem in tha past with us since we were also part of big group of kids going, there's fewer kids nowadays so it may not seem so "safe" but that's how it is
Yes, I walked to school without parents from 4th grade of elementary school, I would say it is normal here
Back in school, we were reading some samples from old texts
I understood what they were saying, but only from context and with the words being wtitten with today's letters (few of them changed sounds over the years), so I'd say it is intelligable, but more like slightly simmilar foreign language
[Podkoní a žák] has been written in 1300s. It is pretty much understandable, but the differences in pronunciation (ě sound, diphthongs not contracted into long vowels), vocabulary (what student wears means "skirt" in the modern Czech, but there it means "dress"; the word for the place they drink beer is present in modern Slovak, but not in modern Czech etc) and grammar (live dual number; more past tenses) are very noticeable
Modern Czech is usually harder than old Czech, except for some exceptions
Basically, the old language is mostly understandable by Czechs
Czech word "aktuálně" could be translated as currently in English
Many Czechs incorrectly say "actually" when they want to say aktuálně in English
Not according to [Cambridge dictionary]
>Actual is an adjective meaning ‘true’, ‘real’ and ‘the thing in itself’. It does not refer to time
>In some languages actual has the meaning of ‘current’ and ‘at the present time’. This is not correct in English
Found this on wiktionary
>In most Romance, Slavic and Germanic languages the cognate of actual means “current”. This meaning has also been used in English since the sixteenth century but is now rare due to a semantic shift
My best friend and I went to London couple of years back and and we wanted to take a picture in front of the TARDIS
While we were talking pictures, some guy about out age and his mum stopped to take a photo as well
They said couple of sentences in Czech about talking the photo before turning to us and asking us in English if we don't mind them joining us
So I replied in Czech that there is no need for English and the delight in their faces was the best
Nothing crazy but it made my day
Partly because I randomly met another Czech whovian in the middle of London
Not only Yugos
I remember ordering in Czech in Vienna, 'cause I've heard waiters to speak Slovak

meme town of "the highest quality of livivng" idk if living on the biggest crossroads in the country qualifies tho
someone from vnitro who is in charge of all these lives there, probably
Prague always
I don't think there was actually any bigger city anytime
Obviously Prague, but in other regions some cities were replaced as the regional capitals
Eg Olomouc used to be the "capital" of Moravia (got replaced by Brno) Litoměřice and Žatec were major cities in the north-west (now replaced by Ústí nad Labem and Liberec), Kutná Hora used to be the second most important city in the kingdom
And the "Czech Silesia" grew thanks to coal mining and heavy industry (the area around Ostrava)
Kutná Hora (Kuttenberg) used to be major Czech city until 19 century
It lost its importance because there were no industry, and it wasn’t connected well to railroad
Also Olomouc was the main center of Moravia for most of history, it is seat of second archbishop after all
It started to stagnate when it was heavily fortified, meanwhile the inhabited right turn before Vienna (Brno) was free to grow
Prague was always the biggest city in modern Czechia, ever since the beginning of the state
Any historical borders would include Wroclaw (much smaller, since in the 14th century Prague was the biggest in the Holy Roman Empire even, though with industrialisation in Silesia in the 18th centure it would probably come close, I don't have the exact numbers)
And yes, Vienna was inside the Bohemian Crown for a little while in the 13th century before the Habsburgs
I don't think Vienna was very big at the time though
Other Czech or Slovak cities don't come close
And Jáchymov used to be the second biggest city
Beautiful :D
I started english at 7 in 2nd grade
We had either 3 or 4 classes a week for the test of primary school
I started being able to understand movies in english round 12 pro 13 years old
I have still some trouble with the th, because I just don't even hear the difference between three and free
I also still strugle a little bitt with the r sound, because I just keep rolling my r's
I started in 2nd grade (age 7/8) and it took me until age 19 to be able to actually have conversations in real life and even longer to comfortably watch movies without subtitles
I saw "talking to real people" as the top skill level when I was in school, but it's actually much easier, because they can adapt to your level and re-phrase anything you didn't understand
I was pretty much fluent by age 15 or so, I just had a terrible amount of anxiety about mistakes
I think I learned most of my vocabulary simply by being immersed in the Internet since my early teens and looking up information about anything that interested me, trying to translate some song lyrics, playing games, stuff like that
For listening, Youtube has been more helpful to me than movies, because people speak more naturally
English subtitles are definitely a good choice for TV shows, you'll notice how you read them less and less over time :) It really mostly just takes time, don't get too stressed about it
I had some elementary English classes in kindergarden
Around 11, we got a PS3 and none of the games had subtitles in our language, se we used English subtitles
I don’t remember when have I stopped browsing the internet in my mother language
I’ve been reading books, watching the news, YouTube, films, series, and playing videogames since
At 14 we got a new English teacher who gave us a test to see our level
I scored best with like 98/100 points, which soon lead me to participate in language competitions
I’ve gotten into the national level twice
During this time, teachers would pull me out of classes to practise with me, which was frankly pointless even as a revision, and I missed on Math, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology (those I did need, hahah)
At 16, group of best English students got an offer to take CAE with a discount paid for my the school
I took mine and got C2
I am now in my third year of uni and am still known as the good-at-English kid (very practical title as you’re always expected to take the lead whenever English is involved)
I’d say languages are generally easy for me - I was tHe GoOd StUdEnT in French class (starting at 14 I think) and got to B2 with hardly studying
I’ve also started German two months ago and I find it easier than French
But I’d say the most important factor is using the language to do whatever you are passionate about, rather than revising grammar or being good at languages
I took first classes in kindergarten when I was 5
We have mandatory english classes from 3rd grade(when kids are 9 years old)
I've learnt mostly from playing videogames and watching series, school wasn't that ifluential even though I learnt a lot there
I got C2(native speaker) certificate when I was 17 and most of my classmates got at least C1 as well
What is the strangest destination where people go to spend their Erasmus
What is the place, where you'd think: "People do their Erasmus *here*?!" Maybe a university in a tiny unknown town, maybe a far off place, maybe a place take captures your interest in some other way
Oh god
I guess that if you don't care about traveling or the funny looks that they'd probably give you at the student department, it could be a fun way to game the system
Nothing like a little bit of money for free, eh
Imagine if he came back with bad grades
Oh yeah
When I was choosing my Erasmus program, I saw that there was a Slovakian university in Nitra on our list
That would be probably about the same for us
I'm sorry to say so, but it looks like it
It's a study exchange program funded by the EU
It allows you to spend 1-2 semesters abroad and for a lot of people who've tried it, it's a really good experience
In general, you mean
Most Erasmus exchanges are in English
Actually, my university has a contract with one university in Reykjavik
It was my first choice, until I found out about how much it costs to live there, lol
Noped out it very quickly
I have to admit that I did my Erasmus in Lithuania
in winter
Actually, their semester starts a little earlier, so I spent a part of summer and the warm part of autumn there, so it was not all bad, but yeah, I probably could've made a better choice
And it wasn't even *that* cheap
You definitely can
You'll just be wrong very often
Yes and no
If you know what to look for, you can spot the dominant facial/body features
But it doesn't always translate to nationality because people mix and move around Europe a lot
That is also a common way to distinguish Czech men
>Walking sticks and hiking boots for a trail which locals do on flip flops and Moretti
Ah yes, the reverse Czechs
Well, Czechs do that locally, too
The mountain rescue had to save some lady wearing sandals and socks in the mountains
There is 80cm of snow
But to be fair, many of us are capable in the outdoors
Some just think they are amazing outdoorsmen while they are just stupid
You can't really tell Czechs and Slovaks apart in any other way than language
We are really mixed, since we lived in one country
Don't buy new plastic bags, use the ones you already have
And recycle all plastic instead of putting it in rubbish (trash) bins
If you can, use public transport instead of going by car
If you need to go by car, don't leave the motor running when you aren't moving (for example at crossovers)
You could try not reproducing, cause having a child leaves a big carbon footprint and as others said, change of diet, limiting the use of transportation by car and going on foot, bike or public transportation, second hand clothes ect
You'll need a lot of masks, prepare, when you can
“Padají trakaře” translates to “It’s falling barrows”. We say that when it’s snowing heavily
> "Das ist mir Wurst/wurscht
" (It's sausage to me
) - Whatever
It's in Czech too: je mi to buřt.
> Everything has an end, only the sausage has two
This reminds of this riddle: how many ends does [jitrnice] have
>!Seven: the front one, the rear one, 4 ends on the sticks, and the last one when you bring an end to it
We have the same but with camel
While I really like it, being a non-native speaker I was really excited when I first heard *éramos pocos y nació la abuela*. Really tore me into pieces
Also *de Guatemala a Guatepeor* is a nice wordplay
In Czech it's making a camel out of a mosquito, and it doesn't rhyme
Great question but I have no idea
Although I found that “camel” - “velbloud”, came from a word “ulbandus” that came from greek word for elephant
So maybe it has to do something with that
Yeah, it's called Ústav pro jazyk český (Czech Language Institute) and falls under the national Academy of Sciences
Many people think that this institute "makes the rules" of the Czech language, but that's not really true anymore, it works in a descriptive way
They have an online dictionary and a website where people can send their questions, and we use their resources in academia all the time
There's technically no law forcing anyone to follow a particular book or version of the rules outside of schools, but the Institute's publications carry a lot of weight
Czech people love being grammar snobs, I don't think descriptivism is very accepted among the general public at this point
Being borderline musically illiterate, I was stunned to only recently learn about a cult pre-revolution band whose [music] sounds like it could very well be tweaked to fit into a Stranger Things soundtrack
the music is very well known here as this song is a quite "popular" remake of the original hungarian one
We just have people from Brno, who set their city as a legitimate rival of Prague
Prague citizens barely recognize Brno's existence
Average Prague fan
Average Brno enjoyer
We even have Prague institute for insulting Brno on Facebook
There also is Brno institute for insulting Prague but there are mostly people from Prague who are insulting an occasional vesničan cuz there is no internet in the oppidum
Similiar with Nymburk and Poděbrady
Similar to Pardubice and Hradec Králové
Úhonice And Průhonice
I'm just mad because people always corrected me thinking i lived in Průhonice when I lived in Úhonice
Avera Holomóc enthusiast
Do Dubliners also refer to Cork as "the village"?
I know about this, it's hilarious
I am from podebrady and i can only say its true
Those are much more even I'd say
I have heard that when the regions of CZ were decided on,  Pardubice and Hradec were deliberately put into different ones
vesnice means village, so this term literally means villager
The ultimate disrespect
Not even having a derogatory nickname
Interesting question
I can't think of any cartoon that does it from the top of my head, but I remember that in The Witcher video games, dwarves speak in a Scottish accent
In the Czech voiceover, they speak with a South Moravian accent (where I'm from), which is a bit mix of Czech and Slovak
I know that in Alvin and the Chipmunks series, the girls there have British accents, as opposed to the rest of the cast, which is American
In Czech dubbing, the girls didn't even speak Czech, but Slovak
And honestly, that's one of the best things they could have done
There might be one I remember but, I'd like you to ask you something in order to confirm
Anybody who saw the Planes movie in English, there are two commentators, does one of them has an accent
Yes, e.g. Hermes in Futurama has a strong Moravian (Walachian
) accent and it sounds very funny
Hermes in Futurama speak with some moravian accent, original should be Jamaica or something like this
I see, because one of the two comentators spoke Slovak in Czech dubbing
That may be a little long stretch from times of Czechoslovakia where TV had almost half Czech half Slovak hosts
Travel programme "Objektiv" still has some Slovak hosts
Oh, you reminded we
Us too with just with Slovak instead of Norwegian
We have proverb :"To drink like danish"
>should we push them south this time
That was not a good idea but what about north next time
We have classical dance lessons
It’s nice remnant from imperial times, these courses consist of learning classical and latin dances and etiquette
There is usually dress code, recommending wearing suits and dresses
Usually whole classes of high schoolers go to these courses when they are 14-16
It’s great way to socialize and to meet new people
In cities majority of people go to these courses sometime in their life
>For example, France doesn't have "Religious education" classes
So do you really think that we have religious education
During upper elementary school we had had "Family Education" which was a subject covering everything from family relationships to etiquette to racism to drugs to sects to sex ed
I think some schools have it as a choose able subject in the 7th grade
Let's see if you manage to keep it in the future :/
Barely
We're supposed to have some (very brief) sections on sex ed split between biology and social studies/civics classes, but most of my teachers straight up skipped it
In high school, they just invited an external speaker to give one single talk on how birth control is a thing that exists (when most of us were already 16 years old
) and hand out a promo package of tampons
We had "Technical Drawing" which was actually engineering drawing for a year in the second to last year of elementary school
We actually had that too, in grade 4
They made it look all official, with a local cop supervising the exam and all
It's pretty funny to me, because most Czech people barely ever bike in traffic, it's considered more of an outdoor sport done outside of cities here
We did have cooking classes
Not sure if kids do these days
We learn that in history and social education
Yeah, we just mention the religion in history classes or in social science classes and quite briefly
Yeah, I had a brief unit on formal logic in Math at the beginning of Czech *gymnasium*. It's a part of the standard Math curriculum
exact same here, but that's not a surprise
The year 1968 is definitely described differently in Russia than in the rest of the eastern europe
Well for example Munich treat was for us the biggest treason in our history and we will never forget that, but for France and Britain it probably means very little
Yes
For example Japan ppl don't like nuke bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima, but from our prespective US stopped Axis forces so it was right decision=difference of perspectives in the historic events
I don't have that opinion
It was such a tragedy
It was inhumane decision of reckless Americans that didn't value lives of innocent civilians
Similar case in Czech history is burnt down villages Lidice and Ležáky
That "the west" was organizing a revolution here to weaken the eastern bloc
And how they saved us from becoming vassals of US
The thing is, they really believe that and most of the soldiers who participated in that are firmly assured that they did a good thing
They killed over 150 people and occupied Czechoslovakia for 21 years
Stuff like that should never happen again
The worst thing about this is that there aren't exactly few people who agree with it here in Czechia
The communists - directly transformed from the Czechoslovak communist party - have 8 % in the parliament and many of them are mayors in small towns and villages due to old people being a large part of the electorate
Newer generations don't vote fot them, thank God
Yeah
Sweatpants, I never wear that outside (only when I'm in my parents village house), ugly, hole-y or just too worn t-shirts and old hoodies from the teenage era I wore hoodies (before I gathered enough confidence for more elegant, feminine clothes I actually liked more)
You mean sweatpants and worn-out t-shirt
Then yes
Yeah absolutely, It's such a good feeling to switch to new more comfortable clothes
Sweatpants are so much better than jeans
And I wear old t shirts and hoodies so they get some use and the newer ones don't wear out that quickly
Also, no shoes
>worn out
They are more comfy,  stretched  and softened
Only "Běž domů Ivane" (Go home Ivan) comes to my mind
We love it for obvious reasons
Thats great
Felt such patriotism for my own country
I need to look for some Czech ones
I'll be boring and say that I like to play CK2 as Great Moravia and go for the Slavic Church alternate history line
It's not that I'm such a patriot or whatever, it's just that I like the sense of familiarity in the alternate history scenario and have more of an idea what the places that I rule look like
Plus I have a lot of fun coming up with names for Slavic characters
In Crusader Kings I played often as Bohemia (and failed miserably), and then I tried to do the featured rulers that are in the menu (and failing as well, except for the time I played as Armenia)
In CK2 and EU4, Bohemia, for obvious reasons
But I also enjoy a good Mediterranean game - Byzantium for Rome, Italian minors for the challenge
Cyprus and the Knights of Rhodes for Jerusalem
I like the colonial game in EU4 very much, and I enjoyed the tactic of exodus into America for the Basque, or for Brittany and Granada
In Hoi4, Germany, since it's the full course
But also Austria-Hungary
And Britain bulldozing through Europe, since that's satisfying
Indeed
It connects to a lot of counties of different religion, so you can easily chip away at your neighbors, while they wage their wars - the Avars, Austria, parts of Germany
And with the other Slavs you can subjugate large swathes of land
It really leaves a lot of options for growth
Nová ves u Nového Města na Moravě [New village near the Moravian New Town]
Brandýs nad Labem/Stará Boleslav is a close second
V Novém Městě na Moravě se jezdí biatlon
It's not a joke, in Nové Město na Moravě is an international biatlon course
kuala lumpur is what I want but frankfurt will be what I will have to
Budapest
I visited north Hungary last summer and I loved it, so now I want to explore the capital
I also love train journeys, so I'm going to take direct train from Ústí nad Labem to Budapest
I kinda lost the drive to travel TBH, I'm not sure if I'll be in the mood to go abroad any time soon even with no restrictions
I wouldn't mind spending Christmas in France again and stopping in Paris along the way, but that would be just a side effect of visiting my "in-laws".
I studied in Oulu too, you'll not be disappointed
However, I'm a big fan of winters, hockey, metal and Finnish culture, so my opinion might be slightly biased
Last year I was surprised how beautiful, calm and welcoming Budapest is
It’s just like the cities I used to read about in Verne novels
Metro line 1 is a must
Compared to Prague, Wien and Munich, I liked it the best, so enjoy your stay
Been to Copenhagen and expected a bit more, there are more interesting places in Denmark
KL and Malaysia itself are awesome, definitely recommend it
1 is enough, it will be a business trip so I will see just airport and hotel anyway
I’d avoid Brno, it’s one of the better cities, but there are plenty of more exciting places in our country
Hanspaulka, Prague
That's historically where the wealthiest industrialists or movie stars of Czechia used to live (many still do)
When in Nice, you're happy to see Bentleys
Anything that's not a truc
ah shit too soon
I was there as a child, it was stop on the way to Barcelona  -  and yes, the public elevators were something else
That I don't understand
Ok, you're rich, you have Ferrari, but why blast music like some ghetto teenager
To be honest, Amsterdam city centre is not that far off
I mean
a pint of Heineken for €7
I'll keep that in mind
We've made a mistake by booking a hotel in the Amsterdam city centre
In Prague, you have a ridiculously expensive tourist trap place in the middle of a town square, but a perfectly affordable place just a street away
Not in Amsterdam
Arizona, Azerbaijan, Russian diplomatic plates (wouldn't be so foreign in center of Prague, but in my neighborhood it's pretty exotic sight)
Probably Russian on a personal vehicle, you can see trucks from the whole Europe here
But more interesting was one of my drive in October, when like every fifth car was from Switzerland - it was the last day when people could travel from Czechia to Switzerland without the quarantine, so I guess many people better went back to home
Once I saw a car with a Californian number plate
I live in a town with population about 50,000 people so I was very surprised
Chile
Some guys from Chile was doing their world wide trip and lived in hotel next doors during their Prague stay
Damn
Well, the car has been sitting in the parking lot for a week, then disappeared
If you wanna be aware, it's easy to recognize Russian diplomatic plates, it's white letters on red backround
Although I was more worried about matte black Mercedes G with tinted windows and AZE plates tailgating me once
"zavináč" - impossible to translate literally really, but the meaning is a "roll". There is also a dish named "zavináč", and it is a sour fish rolled with onions and sauerkraut
In Czech, it's called zavináč.
It's related to the word zavinutý, which means rolled up
"zavináč" is this:
Cute, I'm going to call it štrůdl from now
There's also the original meaning of "zavináč": [rollmops]
thanks
I knew it must exist outside as well, but had no idea how to find what it's call in english
Next time I would recommend to switch the Wikipedia page of the given term into English
Yes, mainly Slovakia
In hockey when we're knocked out, I usually cheer for US since I got friends there
And if Russia plays, I cheer for literally anynone playing against them
Well probably slovakia, but we never get knocked out before slovakia in hockey ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
I don't really follow a whole lot of sporting events, but when I catch a glimpse of one on the telly, I usually cheer for the exotic underdog
So for example Japan in football, whoever is the underdog in the ice hockey matches and so on
I actually cheer for them even if they play against us
not at all, I have some favourite foreign sportsman and that's all
I was surprised how tiny and old Dutch houses are
Everything is very small, tightly packed together and lacks open spaces
UK:
Sandwich and crisps is not an unusual lunch
People working in offices are wearing suit and tie just because they are working in an office
Fire drills everywhere, in hotels, in offices
Mainland Europe just parties harder
> supermarkets are more likely to accept debit cards than visa/mastercard
this sentence doesn't make sense at all
> I get up at 6
Why
Why
But how often do you discuss distances in thousands of kilometers so megameters will have some logical sense in such a case
I guess never
For earth it is way too big scale and for astronomical distances way to small
On the other side shopping is something people do daily and do you really ask your butcher for 783 grams of meat
Is there any drama if there isn't exact gram precision because it is hard or impossible to make
No one is ordering in grams here because such an accuracy is is impossible and demanding it would be a Karen thing
So no one really uses grams even it technically makes sense
> Putting aside how rarely people actually go to butchers here, no
wait what
where do you get your meat from
OK never mind, imagine buying salami or cheese, you do this thing up there
Same thing, often you can't cut slice up to gram
>It isn't about what's precise it's about what's usual
yes, this is what I found strange, because it is usual to use that scale which avoids unnecessary leading or trailing zeroes, exactly I would not order meat by hectograms, I bet you would not declare your weight in grams either  (last but not least, saying twenty five is shorter than two hundreds fifty, shop clerk is not a person for a quick chat, stop blocking queue :)
hm sliced cheese and salamis are not sold in Danish supermarkets, that's crazy
yes, I am surprise you don't have any deli counters in supermarkets at all
Lichtenstein - I find funny that their southern Moravian estates were bigger than Lichtenstein itself
Recently they were in news in here because they are trying to get some of their confiscated things back
Andorra: cool skiing
Monaco:  casino
Lichtenstein: no you can't have things back
Vatican: pope
Malta: some island, the word mean Mortar in Czech (as in masonry)
San Marino: always forgot you exists
sorry about that but without seeing your flag  I would not list you at all
More microstates= more Eurovision entries, (except for Luxembourg, saying they can't win anymore, so why should they try) /s
Monaco - basically just a casino
Andorra - tax heaven
For the record, there are cities that have 3 or 4 times the population of Finland :P
It will bring more chaos to Iraq
Also:
Let's kill Iran general in Iraq
What, outrage
Surprised Pikachu face
JUST IN: The State Department issued a security alert early Friday urging Americans in Iraq to leave the country immediately
STABLE GENIUS at work again
All these "WW3" memes are utter shit, of course, but the middle east will be de-stabilized even more
Anyone who tries this is called a terrorist and we invade that country and burn it to the groud
Oh its USA, its ok, nevermind
USA is terrorist country
Iraq and Iran are actually now pretty close
Both countries have a majority of Shia muslims
Under Saddam Hussain Sunnite minority oppressed Shias, after that it turned around and Shias started to oppress Sunnites
ISIS then started to recruit soldiers from now oppressed Sunni minority
This US action is likely to worsen the Iraqi government's relationship with the USA
If Iraq government asks USA to withdraw their soldiers from Iraq will USA obey
I would say it's more like Russian soldiers being in Syria
Iran is now Iraq's largest trading partner
Iran and Iraq are very close allies supporting each other against ISIS
Iran forces helped Iraq in fight with ISIS a lot
The relationship between the two countries is strong in part due to the fact that both governments operate on a Shi'ite system of governance
We have a bit of oil here so I guess your country
Russia
Russia
Could you not invade slavs
FOR FIVE MINUTES
Germany, once again
Oh, not again
Danish students
Chinese tourists
They will buy what they can to get know-how and then leave us here to rot
yearly production is around 2 millions barrels
Probably not enough for your government to run some black op here and then "liberate" us :)
Problem solved
Russia sold them the resources needed for war industry and allowed training of german officers on russian territory
> What language do you speak
Czech
>What are the most popular foods in Czechia
beer
>What generation are your jets
I think these grippens are 4
5 generation (we have 14 of them so don't worry)
>how how robust is your air defense
I am not sure about this but due to pretty good relations with Russia I don't think it will be hard to obtain S-400 from them
If I am correct our passive radars were used to shot down your stealth F177 during Serbia war
"Mléčný bar" was pretty popular during communist era here
Now all of them are gone, but my city has still one
I don't know any other existing "Mléčný bar" in Czechia
But we still have one
We have a long-standing (pun intended) tradition of Jídelna where you can buy traditional czech foods for low price but you have to eat it standing on a high table or on a window table
You are right "jídelna" is more similar to polish "bar mlieczny" at least from my experience
However, we have also "mléčný bar" which offer a little different meals
It's kinda hard to describe it
I can just invite you to my home town Pardubice and you can experience Czech Mléčný bar
Jožin z bažin
Perhaps:
* [Vítkovo kvarteto - Pražskej démon]
* [Jiří Schelinger - Holubí dům]
* [Zimní královna]
or probably something from Lucie
Like ungrammatical, "folk" speech we use in informal situations with some words or prhases  the previous generations used more than us now
I may be wrong, but I think he spoke some Moravian too (but only a few words)
Tahák, from word Tahat (pull) as it is going to pull you out of problems
as far as I know it is not used for anything else, but can't speak for all dialects
"tahák"
It probably derived from the word "tahat" which means "to pull" in English
Maybe a piece of paper with information for the test that you pull out of your pocket or sleeve or something like that maybe
It's really from going to pull you out of problems
I always thought it's from I'm going to secretly pull it out from under the desk/papers/pencilcase
but I guess the other meaning makes better sense
never thought about it this way but it also makes a perfect sense
Nah i think your meaning makes more sense
Yeah, depended on the creativity
I had this big calculator with cover you could turn over and slip the calculator into while you're using it so I always had tahák in it for math, physics and chemistry inside
It was this [scientific calculator Casio] with the cover you could slip the calculator into from both sides
Yes I do
In all the schools i ever went to had them
But my classmate says his previous school didn't have them
You always have to change your shoes when you Come to school so you have a place where to store your shoes, maybe clothing for PE
I stored even a long board in my previous school cuz I didn't have a mopedcar (I won't explain what it is, I am tired of it)
Nowadays I store my shoes, clothing for practical lessons, PE clothing and my heavist book (1000 pages) with a jacket or whatever I don’t want on me
Yes, in some schools
My elementary school had them (since the last year I went there lol), my high school didn’t even have a big enough cloak room (1,5 x 2,5 meters max for 30+ people), and my uni doesn’t even have anything (no cloak room or lockers)
We had tiny lockers in middle school - there were like 4 or 5 of them stacked vertically, so they could only fit books and art supplies and stuff
Coats and shoes (changing from your outdoor shoes into slippers is a huge deal in this country, including in school buildings) were kept in "changing rooms" [like this] in the basement, shared by each class
My high school had regular size lockers for everything
It was kind of a fancy thing, not that many Czech schools had lockers at the time, but I think they're quite common nowadays
On elementary school we had fenced [cages] on every hallway
One cage for whole class
You switch shoes there every morning and leave coat
The craziest part is that as time went on the amount of shit (such as books) in my backpack decreased instead of increasing as the difficulty grew
In primary school, every lesson needed a book, an exercise book a notebook and other shit like that
So I ended up with a bag packed full of garbage that weighed half my weight
Then in high school, only like half the lessons needed books that were actually useful and I started combining notebooks to fit more than one lesson
And now in uni, I carry one notebook where I occasionally write something but other than that, nothing since everything is online these days
10\^6 = milion
10\^9 = miliarda
10\^12 = bilion
10\^15 = biliarda
10\^18 = trilion
And this seems to be the same as in other European languages except English
So I looked into this and there seems to be a "long and short scale" for English
The long scale having the same prefixes as anywhere else and the short scale introducing chaos and existing for no reason
I don't know
There are both the systems side by side:  [ But I can't find why there are two systems in the first place
million = milion
billion = miliarda
trillion = bilion
quadrilion = biliarda
Pretty much the same as OP's.
Million- milion or milión (both are grammatically correct)
Billion- miliarda
Prague, Jihlava, Znojmo and several other cities have pretty big underground (tens of square kilometers)
These are usually some old sewers, silver mines, storage spaces and corridors connecting them, etc
Fun thing is, that you can access these areas from most cellars of older buildings
Also under National Museum, due to leaking water, there is small cave with stalactites and stalagmites
Time to take pickaxe, few friends and find out
Number one in beer consumption
Good question
Maybe consumption of beer and geography ? Dont really have anything too special
Cheers to that
Looks like Germany is [fourth]
Noobs
Luckily no, nothing against politeness but I think hearing people yelling through the bus Thank you every minute would be quite annoying
Noone Does that here
Absolutely not, at least in my city
Not really, you usually exit through one of the doors at the back tho, the front is for entrance only
It is impossible in Prague
Public transport here is quite efficient, it means
* Buses are big (12 or 18 meters)
* Entrance and exit are allowed through any doors
* Tickets are *very* rarely purchased from the driver (this is discouraged, you pay 25% more if you do), usually one has yearly ticket, or ticket from a wending machine, or from an app
Yup
But I say hello and thank you when buying a ticket, so that compensates for it
(Czechia) On my route of bus when I was in secondary school (I'm 20 now) we were saying 'Thank you' to the driver
It was so annoying like twenty people saying thank you again and again lol
this would be considered here probably as speaking to myself and people will look weird :) the default bus for Prague is over 18 meters long and there is no way driver could hear it, especially when exiting through last door
Driver itself sits behind glass door and there used to be sticker saying "do not talk to driver" or something like that anyway
Not so long ago Prague public transport rules said front doors are just for exiting the bus and boarding just in case you are elderly, disabled etc
Driver didn't even opened these doors if there wasn't anyone fitting this rule
Also if you wanted to exit through first door and not being from these groups you would got first some death stare from driver saying "you want to use THESE doors
ok but this is the last time"
I honestly have to wonder whether I could even do that in Prague
Elsewhere yes, it's normal to just buy it from the driver, but in Prague everyone either has a public transport card, ticket  from a ticket machine placed outside of the bus (these are usually in metro stations, but the ticket applies to all public transport) or with SMS ticket
I find it hugely hypocritical how so many defend the right of private companies to censor free speech on their websites (be it hate speech or not), but the second China is involved everyone is again such practice (and yes, they are the same people, lot of them straight up admitted it in various threads)
Anyway, it's absolutely despicable
However, China is such a huge market and has investments in just about everything that it doesn't surprise me in the slightest
Nevertheless, I hope something is done about this
Western countries shouldn't allow other countries to dictate what their citizens can say
Not entirely sure how much can governments do to help to be honest
I suppose it's down to consumer how they will react
It's just a tip of the iceberg
China evidently decided to use their economic power to force their politics to foreign countries
This is only start and we will see how specific countries will be able to defend themselves
In Prague they now threaten to Prague's magistrate with "[harm]
I think we should be far more aggressive against China
It's so obviously clear that their influence has gone waaaay too far and having western companies self-censor themselves on behalf of an oppressive authoritarian government is frankly disgusting
I wonder if maybe banning Chinese from investing in and buying up western companies could work because this can't and shouldn't continue
Get out of here with communist apologetism
It HaS nEveR BeEn AppLiED
Shit, I maybe should read whole comments, my bad
Lichtenstein, because noone else is gonna mention them
Russia, because
# B I G
Not again
Kick Turkey out of NATO, put EU talks on permanent hold, denounce through UN
Massive fiasco on the side of the US
Betraying an ally in this manner is really really shitty and terrible PR
And fuck Turkey, they are just a bunch of hypocrites
For all their speech about fighting terrorism they sure as hell didn't mind having ISIS on their border for a few years and having radical islamists fighting on their side
(And yes I recognize there are links between SDF/YPG and PKK and the history behind it)
It's probably too late to really do anything
From a realpolitik point of view, having Turkey in NATO is waaaay more important than supporting a minor player in the grand scheme of things
That's the sad truth
And I genuinly don't know what the "right" response should be at this point, kicking Turkey out of NATO
Perhaps if that's even possible
As for the Kurds, I fear that it's too late for them too
I don't know if allying themselves with Assad is possible or if it would even help at this point but they are running out of options
In an ideal world the war should not have escalated or even started to begin with
Of course the blame doesn't really fall on one party but in general I think US and the coallition should have stayed out of it
The way this has played out is pretty humiliating for the americans and devastating for the people living in the midst of the war
Complex topic which I would like my country to stay the f away from
Unless Turkey decides to do another ethnic cleansing, then both EU and NATO should step in
And their planned buffer zone contains almost all oil rich and fertile land from that part of Syria
What a coincidence
No at all, only when I can recognize mistakes
I can't identify native speaker of any language including Czech
Mostly
I could probably tell if someone is british but I might mistake for example germans for americans if they're really good
It probably depends on how similar their native tongue is to yours
I am always able to tell if someone's czech within 10 seconds of hearing them speak english, no matter how good they are
Yes, but only because I've been C2 since 16 and spent a lot of time polishing my accent, so my ears are tuned to it well
My French is much weaker than my English, and while I can tell when someone speaks with a weird accent, I can't say where are they from
Started German a little over a year ago and I can't tell at all
Afaik, we don't bite into anything, instead we've got *"prdět do hlíny"* "to fart into the dirt".
don't..?
At least I've never heard of a similar phrase in Czech
Who the fuck says that
“Natáhnout bačkory” I’d say is a lot more frequently used, meaning to “stretch slippers”
This or I heard "Žere hlínu".
I doubt you'll find many
Most European countries have a lot of similarities to their neighbours, or at least neighbouring areas of those neighbours
Each country or culture is then unique not through single traits but through combinations of overlapping traits
With exceptions, of course
(staring at Hungary)
Our contradictory nature, probably: we do a lot of sports, yet surfer from high obesity and have high alkohol consumption, our country is steeped in history yet few people care about it, we love to laugh at other people misery yet we made masks for our neighbores and hospitals while goverment was as ineffectual as ever
I would say the [Czech tramping culture] which also is kinda connected to the [Czech kutilství (DIY culture)] (which is not as unique as the tramping but the whole DIY mindset is more common here than in other countries I've been to)
Month's names, maybe
leden, únor, březen, duben, květen, červen, červenec, srpen, září, říjen, listopad, prosinec
because you have Central Europe time instead of +1:00 (or +2:00 not sure), which is because of tourists and trade etc
I thought you get used to weird time
I wouldn't survive long in those temperatures, it's crazy
Your bodies are just trying to keep at least their heads over sea level, just in case
Yeah, poor phrasing on my part
I really meant the Hungarian language as being one of the few truly unique traits
Most Slavic and Germanic and Romance languages have a continuum of dialects that makes them intertwined, but Hungarian stands out
That's how it startér, but then there were more than enough opportunities to make it 'normal' again
But there were/are many reasons to let it be
According to the latest official charts:
Radio Airplay chart: [Chinaski - Kapradí] (typically generic and boring Czech pop-rock that radios play over and over for 30 years)
Singles chart: [Yzomandias ft
Nik Tendo - Rolls] (the most successful and controversial rapper and perhaps artist overall in the country right now, the video is made for all songs on his latest EP, the #1 song starts at 3:25)
If we look at the official monthly charts for August, there is no change - both songs were #1 in their respective charts
Maybe it might be good to mention #2 on singles chart - [Viktor Sheen ft
Calin, Nik Tendo, Hasan - Až na měsíc] That song was already released in May 2019 and since then topped the chart 32 times,  and even now, 1 year and half since release is still in top 10, so we could say this is the ultimate Czech hit of the past 2 years
That's horrible
I've read the lyrics
That's so fucking cringe I'm not sure if I should laugh or cry lol
Moravskoslezký kraj — that one which is close to you
At first, I read: "What **religion** in your country is the odd one out
But I stopped myself
honestly misha man like, is that even considered music
Type to yt: pejskové se koušou
Oh gosh we have czech version of this
I never knew that other countries suffered with us
Well, yes, but actually
yes
I refuse to recognize this as music
I ALMOST forgot about it
He was kinda matipulated by his older brother to make shitty and provokative videos to get views
The parodies too:
OP said he wants the worst music, not the best
>and occasionally ALSO live at home while going to university
that's nothing ocassionally where I am from, no shame for living with parents during studies
Thick walls, sturdy doors, a different floor, possibly loud music -> even soft BDSM isn't a problem
Czech goverment
I like our anthem
It celebrates beauty of our nature
I don't expect anthem should have faster tempo or something it's not a pop rock neither metal song
I actually like ours
Unlike most national anthems It's not about wars and fights, but It's a song about loving our country
It's boring
At first I thought that the melody was beyond saving, but it's actually more like that the commonly used rendition is written in a way that it feels like the entire orchestra has woken up 5 minutes ago
Kde domov můj should be either modified to have a better tempo/stronger dynamics or replaced, because currently it is just the definition of sub-average mediocrity
Terrible, best Anthem have Russia
I don't really have a problem with the text but musically it's very boring and too slow
The melody is weirdly melancholic for a song that supposedly celebrates Czech lands
I suppose it sort of fits the peaceful nature of the text but still, it just makes me want to fall asleep
Just looking at our neighbors Slovak and Polish anthems have imo much nicer and more fitting melodies for an anthem
I think it's pretty slow and king of boring, like I get that it's sentimental and talks about how beautiful our land is but it's too slow
I feel like we could have a better anthem
Like, it is literally all about the nature
Nothing about us as a nation
I still kinda liked it when the slower and a bit sentimental Czech anthem was followed by the faster and triumphant Slovak one when Czechoslovakia was still a thing
I really like that we don't have a pompous military "march" like most other countries
We weren't historically a militaristic state, our current anthem represents our national character much better
I like the Finnish one for the same reason
Exactly it celebrates beauty of our nature
That's what I like too
More than fighting
Has to be brutal technical death metal at least though
Czech here, honestly, I'd rather a pompous militry march sometimes
Beuatiful nature is nice and all, but for someone who doesn´t know the lyrics, it's just yet another song some people in some country sing on occasions, and nothing's particularly interesting about it
Not really happy with it, but look at the anthem of the Soviet Union
That's a very proud song, even upon hearing for the first time and knowing no Russian
Ours
Not that much methinks
The only one that comes to my mind is Slovakia's "Nad Tatrou sa blýská"
It depends, usually there are 3 or 4 red and 1 or 2 green
3-6 usually green apples, golden delicious, Spartan, gala, jonagold
Edit: respective strain names may vary
Hmm, I've never really looked at that in detail bc I'm allergic to apples, but I'd guess around 5-10 at most supermarkets
I often shop at an online supermarket, and that one currently has 11 kinds
Or 8, if I don't count that some varieties are listed in 2 different sizes/packagings
The varieties are Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Idared, Red Chief, Pinova, Red Prince, and then some just labeled as "red" and "organic apples, mix".
3 usually, Red, green and knock off red Chinese apples that I am allergic to that cost twice the price both of the previous ones combined
[Půlitr] stolen from the pub
Multiple of them, not a single one is the same in one household
Pretty sure I can find this at my parents household or any aunt/grand but if you ask me when I was last time served hardboiled eggs cut by this we have to go to some new year celebration in mid nineties :)
That's so handy, I want one of those
I really want this
It's such a good idea, right next to a dryer
What's a flat toaster
[Like this
That’s so true
It sounds good, but I'm already fat, owning a deep fryer would probably kill me in a few weeks
Having to go outside to get fries is a self-preservation method, really
Be careful about that
You can buy one, but using it is strictly forbidden in most places if you're on the public sewerage system
"Ptakopysk" is literally "Birdsnout" in Czech and it means platypus
Aaaw thats sounds so cute
I remember that when I was learning German in school I refused to call phone "Handy" because it sounds ridiculous
Thanks my fellow neighbor
Here people call the mobile number "GSM" as well:
TEL 296 xxx xxx
GSM 733 xxx xxx
This is one of the things that bother me about English the most . In my language, there's a very elaborate set of rules of how and when to use commas between words or sentences and it takes a lot of efforts to master all of them
However, not only these rules are non-applicable in English but it sometimes seems like they're exact opposites
Poppy - how is it seen in your country
As source of opiates, or as a food
In Czech cuisine, black seeds of poppy are quite common - they are added to pies or sweet rolls for example
Used seeds contain minimal amount of active drug, they are safe to consume, and there is no way to get high with them
I’ve seen surprised people, who seen this for the first time, and they thought it’s like eating opium
How is it seen in your country
I once saw a very amusing Vice documentary, where they visited a bunch of junkies living in some bushes on the edge of Prague and watched them make "heroin" out of poppy seed, which they stole from a nearby field
At the end they took a sample of their product to a lab to find out how pure the heroin was and it turned out it was 0%.
I came here to say Czechia’s the world’s largest producer of poppy seed (despite its small size) and that I personally absolutely love it
You mean pure opium
Yummy
Der Hereitkuchen sind das beste

Well, they will understand "cucumber time" but probably slightly different
We have song ,,Holka modrooká" (Blue-eyed girl) which is first sang in original, then sang again but every vowel is A, then again but with E, then with I, O and U
It looks like this:
Holka modrooká nesedávej u potoka,
(Blue-eyed girl don't sit near brook(?),)
holka modrooká nesedávej tam
(blue-eyed girl don't sit there
V potoce se voda točí, podemele tvoje oči,
(The water spins in the brook, it'll grind your eyes,)
holka modrooká nesedávej tam
(blue-eyed girl don't sit there
Halka madraaká nasadávaj a pataka, ...
Helke medreeké nesedévej e peteke, ...
Hilki midriikí nisidívij i pitiki, ....
Holko modrookó nosodóvoj o potoko, ...
Hulku mudruuků nusudůvuj u putuku, ....
I fadely remember this
First elections in Czech republic after world war two
People felt betrayed be democracy and countries from west, so they voted communists
Well another Austrian or German guy would probably come and try to conquer half of Europe anyway, because of the situation Germamy found itself in
Gottwald got orders from Stalin to start civil war if necessary
I can’t decide between the liberation of Prague, February 1948, and 1968
Civil war would start anyway
And it would be more like Czechia vs Slovakia because KSČ had big support in Czechia but not in Slovakia
> Japan also has this archetypical character in the samurai
I think closer to the cowboy archetype for the Japanese would be rōnin
Anyway, we've got *zbojník* ("outlaw", "highwayman") who were often romanticised as someones who refused to live according the rules of the nobility, stole from the rich and gave to the poor, lived with the nature secluded from the society etc
[Here is one] on a period engraving from the 18th century
The best cultural example of this archetype would be Vilém the terrible lord of the woods from our most renown poem *Máj.* From historical persons, there are Slovak Jánošík or Ruthenian Nikola Šuhaj which are the most ingrained in our cultural awareness
Yesss Don Quixote
I remember that book from my literature class here in the Czech Republic
It was surprisingly pretty fun to read (:
Generally I am not aware of anything like that here in Czechia
There are some minor cases - I believe beer is not allowed to be the cheapest drink in restaurants, but maybe it"s not true
I believe increasing prices is extremely important especially in case of emergencies in order to prevent scarcity
For example our government capped the price of PCR tests
Inmediatelly many labs stopped testing
That's might be one of the reasons we have currently one of the lowest number of tests in Europe
The maximum price of COVID test is currently set by the government so no company can charge more
We have "Pricing Law". It has been applied recently due to human idiots that were selling respirator masks for huge amount of money in the beginning of pandemics
So they've applied this law and now these masks should cost maximum of 175 Kč (6,50 euro, made in EU) and 350 Kč (13 euro, made outside of EU)
Oh, they've introduced this law here as well, recently
Before that, beer was usually literally cheaper than a glass of (sparkling) water
You could have always asked for a glass of tap water, but the usual reaction of the waiter would be something like: "Sure, but why would you want water, if we have beer
Sounds like a bit of an overreaction
Those words actually come from a website, where they tried to map, where you can get tap water from the waiter without issues or something like that
I found that question funny more than anything else
Do you know the website
Would like to see that
I don't think it exists anymore (or at least not under the original name)
It was called Vodovoda, but I haven't able to google it anymore
Because of that conference, Prague had to wait for Russians to free us, even though Americans could arrive there several days earlier and spare countless civillian lives, that died, while fighting Germans
Also we were Soviet puppet for another 40 years or so, because of that conference, si there's also that
Luckily we were used to western allies selling our country to dictators, so it hurt only little
West sold us to USSR and thrown us into 40 years under Soviet communist dictatorship
Yeah, I know, most of the Germans were defeated by uprisings
In Prague, you can even find some plaques with names of fallen civilians, where they died
But there was also general Vlasov and Russian Liberation Army, who were fighting on German side (mostly they were captives or people, who disagreed with Stalin's regime), but after fall of Berlin, they also helped in fights against German soldiers
Of course they won ellections fair and square
I don't have problem with that, but after that, KSČ did what Mother Russia said
Things like political processes, refusal of Marshall plan and others
Thats all nice, except the fact that Gottwald pushed Beneš to the corner with threats of civil war and massive Soviet military intervention which would back the stalinized Communist party
Only Western help could have prevented the Soviet takeover
Beneš was too old and just gave up, but the Soviets would have taken control of Czechoslovakia anyway, just with force
By 1946 we were by all intents and purposes a vassal of the USSR, and unfortunately people knew nothing about it
They were mislead by the omnipresent communist propaganda and misinformation campaigns
*Almost* nobody voted for brutal Stalinism, purges and fake trials, class warfare, abolition of private property, censorship, violent collectivization etc
Well yes, but if they planned to liberate Prague, they would deffinetely take more troops
They initiated a coup backed by the red army to systematically dismantle democracy in the country
They won an election and then made all future elections invalid
They also murdered the prime minister so there's that
It was a militant power-grab backed by stalinist Soviet Union
If you replace KSČ with NSDAP, Czechia with Germany and 1946 with 133, you've described the Nazi takeover of Germany
Please do not attempt to spread this thinly veiled Communist propaganda
The KSČ, who had won only a plurality (around 1/3) in 1946, largely thanks to the optics of them having secured the official Liberation of Prague and therefore the country (and their propaganda machine which heavily tried to cover up and unload blame for all the very unpopular city aerial bombings they committed in the last days of the war to keep german soldiers for surrendering to the US instead of the USSR), occupied key ministerial and admin positions (ministry of justice, chief of police etc) and immediately (literally, work started in the summer of 1946, when the parliamentary elections were on May 26th) set out creating a new constitution, largely based on the Soviet one of 1936 that would dismantle democracy, enact widespread censorship, and remove judicial independence
The other parties in government, seeing what was going on, and informed of the Soviet support of popular militias int he Country, resigned en masse, hoping that this would force new elections as the government lost legitimacy
Instead, Gottwald occupied these now free positions, deployed the police to suppress revolts and arrest enemies based on Soviet orders and intelligence and pushed through the 1948 constitution, threatening Beneš with civil war if he refused
You are being wholly disingenuous by attempting to portray the KSČ as a sympathetic force, with the backing of a great many enthusiastic Czechs, only responding to attacks by hostile political opponents
Take this tankie bullshit and shove it where the sun doesn't shine
>grassroots worker militias
So grassroots now means with direct foreign government support, funding and intelligence
Don't make me laugh
KGB units were present during 1946-48 and they murdered or abducted multiple people opposing the communist party
>Where is the big difference
How about the fact that those were territories of an occupied enemy state that were under the administration of the US, whose laws applied there compared to an **ALLY** destabilizing, assassinating, and confiscating your country and resources explicitly for their gain
Though if you want to talk about more "big big crimes" lets exactly talk about why the 1949 West German constitution looks as it does and especially why the German coursts abolished the German Communist party: Lets talk about the other coups the Soviet Backed Communist party tried to enact in 1948 in Germany, or 1953 that let to its ban whose reasoning was exactly upheld by the Court of Human Rights on the basis of the Communist party's extreme hostility to freedom of speech, democracy through its support and propagation of totalitarianism
>Beneš tried to coup the government in 1948, the takeover by the KSČ was in some form a "counter-coup"
Excuse you
What coup attempt can you possibly be refering to, especially in 1948
Is it the parliamentary resolution concerning Security from Feb 13, that started the constitutional crisis
The one where the Communist party was purging the the StB to secure total control over it and the police forces
Or are you referring to the events in 1947, where the communists secured stripping Slovakia of its parliamentary representation, since they voted overwhelmingly democratic
Or was it the Krčmaň affair, where the Communist party in 1947 attempted to assassinate the non communist Minister of Justice, Deputy Prime Minister and, Foreign Minister
You know, where the Communist Minister of the Interior refused to investigate
Did this coup attempt happen before or after Moscow airlifted its NKVD agents in preparation for their coup into Prague on February 15th
>could turn into another Austria (which also had the Red Army on its soil and was not part of NATO but officially neutral
The exact reason why Austria had Soviet troop stationed there was because it was an occupied country, responsible for the 2nd World War
The whole reason why it is today neutral and not part of NATO was because they took advantage of the Soviet Union's instability after Stalin's death and negotiated the Soviet withdrawal for perpetual neutrality in 1955
Until then it had the same control structure as West and East Germany
Why would Czechoslovakia, the Soviet Union's **ALLY** need to negotiate that
Do you not know anything about 20th century history
>just like trying to erase widespread support for the communists amongst specifically Czech workers (less Slovak workers)
Here are the lies again
The whole reason why the KSČ chose February 1948 to enact their coup was because they were desperately afraid of losing their coalition majority in the May elections of 1948
Already in Slovakia in 1946 a near supermajority (over 60%) of voters voted for the Democratic party
Thats why they did their best to keep the Democrats from taking their posts in Slovakia, through any emans necessary (harassment, illegal arrests through the StB, trying to associate them with the L'udova strana that was active during WW2)
The Communists, through their incredibly unpopular campaign in 1947 to enact collectivization, completely alienated the farmers in the country
Along witht he above mentioned scandals, they knew they would lose their plurality, so they expedited their plans for a coup-d'etat
>Seriously trying to compare the ČSSR to the Nazi occupation
Check your reading comprehension
I wasn't comparing the 3rd republic tot he Protectorate, I was comparing your propagandist language used to describe the NSDAP's rise in Germany in 1933
Do you think you know more about our history than we do
Do you want historical book recommendations
Do you want me to call some people who had their relatives deported to concentration camps by the NKVD
We could maybe arrenge a meeting
>\citation needed
[Here
] [You
] [go
There was literally a [scandal in 1947] which uncovered a [Moscow driven spy ring] trying to assasinate 3 non-communist Czechoslovak ministers and further sow discontent
Literally one google search away
You either have to be very ignorant of history to believe the NKVD and KGB did not take part in Czechoslovak affairs or willfully deceptive to assert otherwise
I believe that your brain is capable of searching the relevant sources by yourself
>nothing to do with the coup
Don't try to be moving goal-posts now, OP clearly stated the period "*KGB units were present during 1946-48*"
As for the February coup, [Moscow directly airlifted NKVD agents to help with the coup on February 15th, 1948
23 stayed at the Hotel Flora while another 16 at the Hotel Steiner]
>work of the Czech communist party
Who the hell do you think gave them the support and tools to enact these intrigues
Your ignorance and stupidity makes my blood boil
Why are you even trying to discuss about something you know nothing about
First you said there were no soviet agents, once presented with abundance of contrary evidence, you start arguing random semantics
I was literally replying to your full comment of:
>"KGB units were present during 1946-48"\citation needed])
which you then tried to discredit why effacing even KGB/NKVD presence as just unrelated StB actions
Regardless, when it came down to the coup itself Soviet deputy foreign minister Valerian Zorin *did* offer the support of the Red army, which was stationed on the Borders of the country
Gottwald only declined because, aside from not wanting the risk of being made redundant by an army commanded directly from Moscow, he was certain the political pressure, combined with the threat of civil war would be sufficient to force Beneš to concede
He was of course right
In fact the primary reason Beneš took a neutral position was exactly because he was afraid the red army would use any hostile action against the communist organized demonstrations as a pretense to invade to "restore order".
>Obviously the Russian secret services were in Czechoslovakia
No shit man, they were also
The important difference here is that the spies in France, the UK or US did not actively partake in a coup d'etat that establish a 40 year long totalitarian regime
In fact, wouldn't the fact that these 400 or so agents were explicitly sent to secure the coup, rather than intelligence gathering like the other countries, characterize their presence at least a bit differently than your blasé *"so what"*?
>It's not like they were in control of
And how do you think they were able to set up this control from before the reestablishment of Czechoslovakia
Its not like the agents of the USSR actively gathered information or arrested for the direct benefit of the nascent reestablished KSČ, its not like they literally made it impossible for Czechoslovak administrators to reestablish themselves in the liberated Czechoslovak territories
oh wait
That's exactly what they did
>instigate a coup
You're moving goal posts again
I didn't say instigate, I said help
And that is certainly what they did
We're all fully aware the KSČ caused the coup
Noone is arguing otherwise
What also cannot be argued that the USSR helped secure the coup with their agents
> blame outsiders for something that was actually done by Czechs
Czech(oslovak)s with the backing and orders from Moscow
And after the fact, these same people immediately immediately showed where they lay in the hierarchy and who was in charge
Castro also succeeded in his coup, but no-one is under illusions of how he got there and what his relationship to the USSR was afterwards
Actually making progress towards switching fully to renewable energy (like Austria, Sweden, etc
) would be nice
Instead of continuing to poison our air with obsolete coal powerplants and even giving them fucking _exceptions_ from emission limits just to sell a surplus of electricity for profit

Thousands of people die from air pollution every year

I've heard that the education system of Finland is very nice, let's grab that one
I'm sure it also includes actually efficient foreign language classes
And, using subtitles more instead of dubbing movies would be a great idea to borrow from all of Northern Europe

*please*
I would say less of ,,trying-to-climb-up-eastern-ass" policy of Poland
We should have hung some of these communism loving idiots when we had chance but instead they are still in big numbers trying to please Russia and China when these countries brought only lies, demands and threats

Interesting
We've also this aspect
Sometimes we're too rebels, but usually it's very useful
We've one of the geratest eductions systems too
But the schools hard
Well I'm fine with using nuclear power too, that's already much better
Just no sacrificing our environment for the coal lobby
No, sorry but we don't... French protesting is on a whole different level
I meant the aspect that I would copy
I ment it for Czechs
But thanks
Maybe
We were always rebel nation
I know, French protest and revolution are the best, but I think, that our were great too
Question: How does it work
Here in Czech republic some people are planting trees "how they see it fit", but because they don't really understand this topic, they sometimes plant trees to  problematic areas
Because of  population density there is a lot's of gas and water pipes and power lines under ground and new planted trees roots can disrupt public utility networks if they aren't sanctioned by local authority
Im a part of a group partnered with the Charles University (biology) and we help saving and preserving our nature
I don't know if we have a single liquor that's the most typical, would that be Becherovka (a herbal bitter)
Fake "rum" made from potatoes
Slivovice (distilled plum spirit)
They all kinda taste just like ethanol to me
Here in Moravia, definitely slivovice (plum spirit)
If it's well made, it's not as hard as vodka, but fruity and smells wonderful, and you can drink it at room temperature without any strong "kick". Really hard to come by, though
You practically cannot buy the good ones in any store but have to "know a guy". Even then it's hit or miss, because everyone says theirs is great
Other notable variants include meruňkovice (from apricots) and the rare oskerušovice (from  [Sorbus\_domestica]
Slivovice is ours
It's basically a liquor made from plums (though it can be made from basically any other fruit) and tastes adequately
Is it like neighbouring countries do consider ouzo as their drink as well
I had ouzo in Bulgaria and thought its more like east Balkan drink
Zelená is a classic broke student choice
Licor 43 has very fond university memories attached to it
Great stuff
Is that similar to slivovice that we have
our is usually home made clear plum liquor around 50%.
Eeey hehe that sounds very familiar  what do they make it out of
For us traditionally it’s plum but pear, apple, and cherries are also popular
Ah, a man of culture
Yeah but that's probably not a Czech invention
Germans have Pfeffi, etc
good ol' fefrmincka
Cool, I didn't know it was that popular :D Maybe we should promote it more, tourists in Prague nowadays seem to be more into absinthe
I mostly associate Becherovka with being the drink of choice of our current president, TBH
Yeah, I know that one isn't *exclusive* to one country :)
Oh okay
Then I was cheated haha
You mean grass that European Bison use to eat I hope
That’s why there’s also hruškovice, etc
the slivo- part just denotes the fruit
I’m from the Walachia region and there plums are often referred to as slivky
I speak Czech (so basically all slavic languages), English (Pretty well I would say) And a bit of German And I have to say english is the easiest of them
Not really, but the prenounciation Is quite difficult to learn
It isn’t for people from Czech republic
But getting rid of the horrible Czech accent
That’s the hardest part
Easy to learn hard to master
Well i can speak it fluently, so i can't be that hard
But seriously
It's very easy, compared to the alternatives
The hardest part is spelling and even then
I can spell better in English than in Czech
And if you consider all the social media, films etc
, it's also very easy to practice
r/antiMLM would be pretty empty
Also stuff about army and being armywife would be probably nonexistent
"Can I get Czech citizenship if my great grandmother was born in Czechoslovakia
We won’t have questions like “what do you think of America/Americans” anymore
The ever-present Trump jokes
Nope, I'd use American spelling since I once came across `color` in CSS and I want to be consistent
Besides, from my point of view American spelling is less fucked up
And for example the change from _s_ to _z_ happened in Czech too
_Kolonizace_ is a modern word, while _kolonisace_ is archaic
In Austria
I wouldn't expect that
There isn't consensus that guns are bad
Where did you get that
Edit: Answer would be preferable
>they should just ban them
As far as I know there isn't single country where guns are banned
Japan and Romania come close, but it still isn't ban
In most of the European countries, the word used for "both continents" is just America (Amerika in German, Czech, etc
) and it is considered as one continent only
Which is quite different from "guns are bad".
I want to know where [kalliope\_k] got that there is consensus about guns being bad, which is nonsense
Edit: Apparently seeking information is offense
I am not obtuse, I am curious
I assume he meant exactly what he wrote and I ask where he got it
If it isn't what he meant, he can just tell me
Not anyone else
> I apologise
You have nothing to apologize for
Some other people do
> there are guns used and are (semi)legal in countries like Croatia (where I am from), Switzerland etc
Guns are legal in every country in Europe
As far as I know they are legal in every country in world
There are countries which have very strict regulation like Romania and Japan, but it still isn't ban
> I am pretty sure most of our countries would agree to ban/heavily restrict their usage
I know for certain that they wouldn't agree to ban their usage, because they didn't and aren't going to
These are the some names of GERMAN cities: Cáchy, Mohuč, Saská Kamenice, Chotěbuz, Drážďany, Cvikov, Budyšín, Brod nad Lesy, Svízel, Kouba, Ředvice, Řezno, Mnichov, Kostnice, Norimberk, Pasov
These are [Czech exonyms]
* Londýn
* Edinburk
Some Austrian cities too:
Štýrský Hradec, Vídeň, Solnohrad
This also extends generally to the HRE, even the old HRE cities outside of Germany are renamed
For example the Swiss city of St
Gallen become Svatý Havel, Zürich is Curych (though that is just a rewrite so i don't know if it counts), Genoa becomes Janov, or Saltzburg becomes Solnohrad (though I actually never heard anyone say it like that, but it still just means Salt castle)
Also (as was mentioned by the Slovaks in the thread already) Venice is Benátky and Copenhagen is also Kodaň in Czech
Also to disentangle some of the above names which I know:
Cáchy = Aachen
Mohuč = Mainz
Řezno = Regensburg
Kostnice = Constance/Konstanz
and Cáchy in Czech ['tsa:xi]
Yeah, these are easier ones
Kouba is Cham, not exactly the big city, and nowadays Czech people would name it Cham anyway, but the names look quite different
Yes
Not that different after all
Does your country have some kind of maps, that people use outside of Google maps/Bing maps
For instance, here in the Czech Republic people use [mapy
cz] which provides more detailed road infrastructure, outdoor map with hiking trails and winter map with ski routes; all of that available for other countries (mainly European)
Edit: Also, you might be familiar with mapy
cz layout if you use [windy
com] (both webs use the same map [made by the same guy/company])
Yes mapy
cz ;) Google maps look terrible, they are only good for driving or finding reviews on restaurants
Bonus fact: there are maps from 19
century if you want to see how Czech Republic looked like in the time of Franz Joseph
I love the fact topography is available for the whole world in [mapy
cz] one can use them for hiking in the middle of Africa or in Pamirs
Just anywhere
mapy
cz are the best online outdoor maps and that's a fact
I think they saved my life once, when I was lost in a fog on a mountan ridge in Iceland
Mapy
cz is great in CZ, for hiking and anything outdoor they can't be matched
mapy
cz provides all this data because it is based on the OpenStreetMap
Yeah, I also use them, but sometimes they have problems, mostly during car navigation
I like the fact that you have 60's aerial map
We have 19th century map made out of cartographic maps from that era, that's only historic map we have (if you'll not count all previous aerial maps form 2003 - 2018)
> this mapy
cz thing looks like it's based on OpenStreetMap
Because it is
As it takes the data from openstreetmap, it does work for the entire world
Alternatively, you can use any other OSM renderer, like osm
org
Because they are based on OSM, which is great outdoors
Google maps are so terrible for walking through Prague, I don't know how anybody can use it
You can check historical maps of Czech lands [here] or [here]
edit: [Here] as well
Oh, so you're from Gigabite
I thought England was a city
1 CZK  - a one or two screws or nuts or a shitty breadroll during sales
10 CZK - cheapest beer including bottle deposit
100 CZK - ten cheapest beers including bottle deposit, from this deposit you can buy additional three beers including deposit, and from deposit of these three you can buy one more beer but it is not enough for deposit so you have to drink it at the shop
so with good planning it could be 14 beers and some screws or nuts
1 crown
nothing
Not even a roll
5 rolls, some rip off candy bar or tatranka/horalka
100
few beers, 5 breads
I don't think you can buy anything with 1czk lol, 10 czk: maybe some small sweets, 100czk: probably like 2 bottles of beer, not sure tho
1 CZK could get you something cheap, like a lollipop, or something like that, but you would need to be lucky to find something which costs only 1
10 CZK can get you a croissant or 0,5 liters of juice
100 CZK would be for a wine or pizza

Probably not
In Czech the song is just translated without the letters
There are no meanings for the letters
It's a little disappointing
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
No, the letters aren't even mentioned
They're only in the background
It goes like: Fun is when friends are together, just like you and me
While in english: "F" is for friends who do stuff together, "U" is for you and me
Cursive, that is mandatory
Then if you want you can write printed-like but nobody will teach you that
You can choose now
well, sort of
Most Czech schools still teach the same cursive we were taught
For some years now, some of the schools teach [Comenia Script] \- printed like letters, basically the kind of handwritting most people came to on their own anyway
They still teach how to read cursive too
Source: have a daughter on one of those schools
1st Printed-like, then cursive . Many of my friends write only Printed-like, but I kept cursive, but I write letters Q and G Printed-like cuz I forgot how are They written
Cursive first
We learn cursive only, though many people learn printed-like by themselves
EDIT: I'm not sure, if you can see it, but I'm from Czech republic
> Then if you want you can write printed-like but nobody will teach you that
But in high school, every math and physics teacher will expect you to be able to write it
Man, that was a royal PITA
> basically the kind of handwritting most people came to on their own anyway
I never quite understood how that happened
I noticed majority of my classmates writing in this style in high school, but ... like how do you just come up with your own writing style
I still write in cursive
I was never taught anything else (I wasn't formally taught to write print in the first place)
It never crossed my mind to change my style of writing like this
Teachers learn them but not *how to write them
* It's quite easy for kids after they read good amount of books
For me it was simple - in cursive, I wasn't able to write fast enough
So I simplifed the letters to the point, that most of my handwriting is basically a print with some cursive influence
I can write much faster that way AND can understand my own notes later
taxi drivers, exchange offices, fake monks, fake deaf people, people changing money on the street and giving you expired russian rubles instead of czech crowns
Taxi/cab drivers charging you like 3 times as much  if they see you're a foreigner
Just use Uber
Yeah my schoolmate lost £40 there and was so pissed, but we all knew it was a scam
Avoid Euronet, Moneta and Česká spořitelna ATMs
The rest are fine and should let you withdraw without a fee
Just make sure you don't choose the DCC option, always get charged in Czech Crowns
The same applies to paying at POS terminals, also preferably pay contactlessly so that the terminal doesn't get chance to ask for DCC
I love octopuses and seafood in general
Too bad it's expensive and not common here
I think It's a shame we eat these super inteligent creatures
Most of them are smarter then the average user of Reddit :D
Since I have octopus phobia, not exactly appealing
Nah, I like Octopus
Anytime I go to some countries having fresh seafood, I get it, cause I live in landlocked country and good seafood here is expensive and rare :)
Sea food isn't my go-to but there are worse things to eat
I've had a fried tentacle once, wasn't bad
It's seafood so I'm fine with it
I don't know if I've ever had octopus that I loved but I have no problem eating it
Sounds gross to me
Maybe it's the landlockness of my country but the thought of eating most sea creatures sounds appalling to me
I can so-so tolerate shrimp but the idea of crabs, lobster, mussels etc and food makes my stomach turn
I hate that because I love food and this limits the things I can experience but I just can't get past it
yummy
Cephalopods are tasty, octopodes, calamares, cuttlefish
I had it in Spain multiple times
It's not something I would add to my menu for a regular meal but I liked it quite a bit and if I'm in the Mediterranean I always have it
I am the exact opposite
I hate almost everything seafood
I'm so glad it's not common here, at least one advantage of our landlocked country
I'm also affraid of heights but I don't chew on skyscrapers, do I.
I don't particularly seek out fish but I will eat it (especially on Christmas) no problems there
I can't tell you what the reasoning is, i guess fish are "normal" but the other animals just look creepy with their legs and tentacles and not having a skeleton
Skyscraper
Yes
Not a fan
People from Prague make fun of people from Brno because Prague is only city in Czechia with a subway
Moravstán, because no metro
Brno - a glorified village
Ostrava - jokes about pollution and how they speak polish-like gibberish
Vysočina - Alabama of Czech republic
Ostrava
They are swearing and don't speak proper czech
Basicaly Everything at anytime
But mostly Brno, Morava, Prague
Prague doesn't exist
Well I'm going to Creta in a few days
Wish me luck
Beer&porn, Czech biggest contributes to world
As a kid I idealized the US, but the more I learned about actual life of average Americans (not the filthy rich individuals shown in Hollywood movies/TV soaps), the less appealing it sounded
Right now I'd say there would have to be some kind of very serious pan-European crisis for me to consider moving over there
No, that would be quite downgrade
Most of my reasons are already written in this thread
Fried Cheese
Its pretty much on every menu of every pub,restaurant, even some shops sell it pre-fried
Depending on the region, in Bohemia mostly Beer and guláš, in Moravia mostly wine and anything that won't ruin the taste, and in Silesia mostly coal
I love Spanish cuisine more than most others
But for some reason churros with chocolate is something I find awful
It is so sweet it is like eating diabetes
Fried cheese is my choice when I dont know what to order in restaurant
Ah yes, fried cheese
I miss your cheeses and wines, counting the days with you
I think I only tried versions with sugar and Chocolate
But tbh other than that all Spanish food is comfort food
I especially liked the cuisine in the northwest of Spain
Germany: Německo ([land of] mutes)
Austria: Rakousko (after castle Ratgoz/Raabs that lied in that direction)
Hungary: Maďarsko (because of Magyars, but older name Uhry related to Hungary was also used
Btw, "uhry" also means "pimples" in Czech, but the etymology is unrelated)
Also, these two are often subject of mistakes when translating from English:
Latvia: Lotyšsko
Lithuania: Litva
Germany - Německo
Austria - Rakousko
Netherlands - Nizozemsko
Georgia - Gruzie
Denmark - Dánsko
Hungary - Maďarsko
Greece - Řecko
In the Czech language we use, for instance:
Austria - Rakousko,
Germany - Německo,
Greece - Řecko,
Lithuania - Litva,
Latvia - Lotyšsko
That's all, pretty much
Other countries' short names are more or less similar to their English/native language equivalent, despite of countries such as:
Suomi - Finsko,
Nippon - Japonsko,
Shqipëri - Albánie,
Hellas - Řecko
I would also add, even if it's not so different, but as interesting thing:
Iceland - Island in Czech
Which like that looks (with different pronunciation) like Czechs using English word (ostrov in Czech)  for Czech name of non-Czech and non-English country
Włochy -> Italy is a pretty big one too
Czechia
**Olaszország -** when you play Scrabble and you got a worst letters
Probably through Russian латышский (latyshskiy), except the "a" got switched for "o".

“Máj” (May) by Karel Hynek Mácha
It’s a romantic poem, but it’s also tragic
It is highly regarded and most students will learn at least the first stanza
I would say ,,Máj" (May) and ,,Kytice" (Bouquet)
Kytice is collection of poems collected by Karel Jaromír Erben
I think the most famous of these is ,,Polednice" (The Noon Lady)
Máj is lyric-epic composition written by Karel Hynek Mácha
Máj is a peak of czech romantism and Mácha uses the whole beauty of the Czech language
This is first part of the first song:
Byl pozdní večer – první máj – (It was late evening – first may)
večerní máj – byl lásky čas
(evening may – it was time of love)
Hrdliččin zval ku lásce hlas, (Doves voice invited to love)
kde borový zaváněl háj. (where pine grove smelled(?))
O lásce šeptal tichý mech; (Quite moss whispered about love)
kvetoucí strom lhal lásky žel, (tree in blossom lied sorrow of love)
svou lásku slavík růži pěl, (nightingale sang his love to rose)
růžinu jevil vonný vzdech
(rose's (love) was appeared by fragrant sigh)
Everyone here knows the poem Máj (May) by Karel Hynek Mácha, but it isn't as widely known outside the czech republic as the examples OP listed
I'm not sure but I don't think there's any in Czechia
Rabits, rabits everywhere
Also you can find a lot of smaller deers outside in the middle of the field, but they are shy
Closest you can get is to hit it with a car on a road
Now we have roddent apocalypse on the fields, so many small mices are running around
They are in hundreds of thousands
If you go along road, you can see in field, every 40cm there is a hole to nest
They are everywhere
They are not plowing deep enough because it cost diesel - better to get subisidies and throw poison around
I live in Karlovy Vary which is 60000 people large spa city and we have wild boars everywhere
They come in large packs, mainly at night and early morning to city and eat whatever they can find
You can see mouflons waiting for a green light or wander in parks nearby place I was grown, coypu colonies in close to downtown part of Prague, boars near fields and pretty much every small animal, beech martens, badgers, foxes, squirrels, ground squirrels
The thing is Prague natural environment is very diverse, it has bit of this and bit of that, actually it would be a perfect place for natural park if there would not be a city already
>a dutch friend told me the national dish was fucking smashed potatoes with vegetables in it and a bit of salt
Isn't that similar to a Spanish tortilla
And onion
Yeah, maybe
But honestly, tortilla is usually quite bland too
Yeah, I know it can be really tasteful, it was usually when it looked like this:
But many times I have had it really bland, it was dry and full of eggs, like this one
Svatá říše římská (Holy Roman Empire)
The emperors are sometimes called "římskoněmecký císař" (Roman-German Emperor) to distinguish them from the Roman and German (1871-1918) emperors
Sure
We were part of it for eight centuries
Our favorite King Charles IV was also a Roman Emperor and he was not the only one
There was movement like this in 19th century
In that time, Czechs were living together with Germans for 7-8 centuries in one country, and languages were getting mixed
but then nationalism appeared
Language purists were partially successful: official language was reverted to early 1600s form (this is why official form may sound unnatural today), and radical proposals were abandoned
It was in 19th century and some of the words replacing loanwords stuck, some of them definitely not
We, Czechs, love making fun of what you did to your word for car
Something like:
"Hey, do you know how do you say 'hedgehog' in Polish
"No
How
"Kaktus pochodówy"
"Hey, do you know how do you say 'mother-in-law' in Polish
"No
How
"Baba Przębytećna"
Those are just classics
I suppose "kurva" is the oldest of them, also most useful
[gumáky] in Czech
Huh, didn't know you were making these jokes too lol
We use the squirrel one as a joke about Slovakia
Except a bit differently - drevokocúr.
It was from a comedy show back in last century, I think
rasa psa
I... I can say I expected the Spanish inquisition more than this
I don't get them mixed up, but its strange
The word "host".
In English, it means something like "the one who's serving".
In Czech, it means "the one who's *being* served"
That's the exact opposite
If you wanna say it in the "the one who's serving" way, you've gotta say "hostitel" or something completely different
Host in Czech means guest, so i get that mixed up quite often
Not anymore but for a long time I used the word "eventually" wrong, in Czech we have a word derived from that, "eventuálně", which means "possibly" so I used eventually to mean possibly
And even nowadays I have to stop and think when encountering large numbers in English, like billion or trillion etc
, we use them slightly differently:
- million = milión (the same)
- billion = miliarda
- trillion = bilión
- quadrillion = biliarda
- quintillion = trilión
- etc
As we say: "je (to) výjimka tvořící pravidlo"
It's used when there's an exception for a rule
It means: "(it) is a rule-making exception
Yeah, it means the same here
You can translate it to different things, tho
Makes, confirms, you could probably think of another word with really similar meaning :D
What you wrote isn't the same, and the set phrase actually is "výjimka potvrzuje/potvrzující pravidlo" (an exception confirms/confirming the rule) which is the same
Fun fact: výjimka (exception) itself is an exception, if it would be regular i'd be written as vyjímka
Bro, there really is not only one way to say it
That's why I said what the set phrase is
Of course, you can alter it
Fair enough :D
Saint Wenceslaus in Czechia
He was murdered by his brother Boleslaus assassins
He is seen as patron of Czech people
In reality because of his murder, Boleslaus said no to Germans and defeated them and released Bohemia of paying tributes
Not really
I think not much
I know just one
Only in my house, unfortunately
Not really, we just laugh at dumb americans doing that
Yes really
Climate change denialism is widespread
Oh sorry, you’re right but it’s only the climate change
I’ve never met an antivaxer or a flat earther here XD
Indicrectly, yes, in terms of the legacy of WWII
The war taught us two things:
* Expect your allies to throw you under the bus
This is less visible because after all, we do have alliances with other countries, but the sentiment is the driving force behind us putting our eggs in as many baskets as possible in terms of security and the main reason why the calls for us to cut our alliance with USA most likely won't be heard
* Being occupied by a hostile power and made subservient in your own country honestly sucks
That was further re-inforced in 1968 when Russians arrived
As a result, it's kinda ingrained in the Czech national consciousness to be extremely wary about foreign powers meddling here
This kind of pre-emptively defensive nationalism unfortunately gets misapplied to things like the EU as the knee-jerk emotional response to EU politics isn't "hey, a group we voluntarily joined as an active member is doing something", rather "great, how are the foreigners trying to fuck us now
Czechs and Slovaks finally started working together after WWII, apart from that probably nothing
I think that the first lesson should be rewritten as "Don't make impossible to enforce alliances and then expect them to work when times get rough". There was absolutely no way the alliance with France (and the Soviets too) was gonna work out and I doubt the interwar government and general staff weren't aware of this, at least with a scenario of Germany being the aggressor
Czechoslovakia made its stance to the very last second until the real bloodshed would come, which in a way is very noble, considering all neighbouring countries slowly eroded away into authoritatian or totalitarian regimes; and it's also true that the Munich conference was a stab in the back, but being realistic, the writing on the wall that Czechoslovakia was utterly fucked was there since at least 1934 when the two leading proponent diplomats for the Little Entente (and therefore the entirety of French security in Central Europe) were assasinated
I cringe extremely hard when I see "white people" generalisations and US racial politics in general, the ever so prevalent American view on ancestry and nationality which is driven by their mindset to be unique - e.g. claiming German, Czech, Polish, Italian etc
nationality based on one of their relatives 3 generations back being  an immigrant and so on
Despite me being acclimatised to American culture (so references and vagueness doesn't throw me off), I still find many American philosophies, such as aggressive judging of others' views or being blinded by their status quo (measurement systems, political systems etc
), really baffling
Also 16 year olds owning cars and driving around weirds me out
For subs I visit abundance of Americans doesn't matter
Yeah, especially when I come across discussion between military wives
sort of, there isn't a week I can't see something like 'it's called aluminum you silly', 'its truck not a car you idiot' and shits like that
+ when I subscribed to /r/atheism I was expecting reading shit from complete different countries than US
+ and one more point, a picture or video clearly not from US but there is always some comment like 'there is a lawsuit waiting' or OSHA
Yes but mostly on subreddits which deal about university or employment advice
Those things are very different in the USA, so most of the post there aren't really relevant for me
> While here sometimes I can go weeks without seeing anyone that isn't a South Slav
Did you explain that to her
> The Hawaii comparison is poor
He is true
You have better ask him, when US will return Florida to  Seminole nation
The whole United States territory was inhabited by now fully or almost exterminated nations
Hawaii was and independent state up to 1898, it was annexed
Réunion was  uninhabited  when Europeans discovered it
French colonised it and  imported Africans, Chinese and Indians, That US traveller had look at least in Wikipedia
&#x200B;
His sentence
> Your last sentence is an attack
is really perfect in the context of his texts
>is their relation with religion
I subscribed to /r/atheism expecting to read some weird shit from Saudi Arabia and other fundamentalist countries where non believing can bring you serious issues but instead I have really weird shit from the US like 'family is no longer talk to me, I was kicked out of job etc'
What did you say that it was perceived as speaking on behalf of all other cultures
I am trying to understand what their fucking problem is
/r/carseu exists for that reason but it is pretty dead
And honestly, the "American-style" atheism seems to me a lot like just another church, when I look at the subreddit for example, I paradoxically get a very religious or cultist vibe from it
I'm atheist myself (which isn't much surprising here) but I just can't relate to all those posts about finding plotholes in the Bible, sharing quotes of famous atheists, advice about how to avoid religious rituals or which phrases of religious origins not to use, or the general need to bash and debunk religion and "evanglise" other people to be atheist
You could just leave the overall sentiment of the posts and only change a few words and it will be like an ordinary religious subreddit
Upvoted for bravery, of admiting doing such crimes
> I am trying to understand what their fucking problem is
To discuss with a non-white US feminist ( especially graduated or studying at a University ) is a special type of entertainment for people who incline to mental masochism and like to study mentality of people who devoured Salomon's shit and their mental capacity is reduced to an absurd ideology
A special sort of them are lesbian radical feminists
Find their subreddits, but they split in various sects who mutually fight  and it is really not easy not write something what would cause immediate ban
Yeah, I'll add that sub on list of those which I shouldn't visit
It does a lot
I am way more extroverted and confident in English and I also feel like my social skills are better
Plumbers, electricians, gasmen, bricklayers and other tradesmen who do house repairs and installations are usually very well off
Sweep
It is one of the best payed jobs you don’t need special school for
**Prague:** history and architecture, tons of tourists, arrogant, expensive
**Brno:** rivalry with Prague, funny dialect, student city, dragon, being joked about a lot
**Ostrava:** industrial, short-voweled dialect, swearing a lot, unemployment, pollution, lots of Poles
**Pilsen:** beer capital of the country, being freed by Americans during WW2 instead of the Soviets
**Karlovy Vary:** spa town, lots of Russian and Arab tourists
**Ústí nad Labem:** poor, polluted, lots of gypsies, port
**Pardubice:** horse racing, decorated gingerbread
**Olomouc:** stinky cheese
**Liberec:** Ještěd tower
**Zlín:** shoe making, being called Gottwaldov during communist times (after the first communist president)
**Tábor:** Hussites
**Třeboň:** fish farming
Pilsen: pils Pilsner Urquell
Praha: Expensive, Capital, Full of tourists
Ústí nad Labem: Poor, Dirty, Industrial, Weird People
Ostrava: Ustí nad Labem but worse
Mladá Boleslav: A lot of Škodas, Pretty rich, Pretty much just a big Škoda factory
Stará Boleslav: Stará-what
Lovosice: Very long town (there's even a saying "Long as a Lovosice")
>Olomouc:
> stinky cheese
I'd say it's also known for being a student city, even more than Brno
Also really pretty
E-gaming
What's that all about
Lmao
Oh that's cool I never knew that, I've moved from Prague to Ostrava where I'll be staying for the next 15 months or so and then I'll be moving back so I'll definitely use this time to go explore Poland for a bit
So far it's been a really good time there
Definitely not
Thanks, that's great I'll definitely go see it
I think it will end in 10 years
Hopefully it will be stripped down back to only economic union
Nothing more nothing less
Fuck federalisation, fuck onespeed europe, fuck multispeed europe even more
And fuck eu shit legislative interfiering national interests
Vast majority of Gaul spoke vulgar Latin
In this case invaders got assimilated
I don't understand
Romans were very good at assimilating
My name Viktora is common mostly in south Czechia/Bohemia and mostly around cities Czech Budweiser and city Písek, but most people in cz probably never heard this name, also polish names are really common in Silesia and city Ostrava
[here] also this website shows every last name in cz a shows you how many of those people are there and where they live
No, not at all
You can't tell anything apart
We have a lot of generic Czech, German and other names and they don't put you in any area
I have a Germanic surname and English first name yet I am generic Czech
It's a mess
I was born in Czechoslovakia, I don't think there's a way back :)
I have lived in Czechoslovakia for few months
Would be cool to get back there i guess :)
Hey, out of curiosity, would you say that Norwegian people are similar to Czechs (in terms of how they behave)
Das ganze tschechische Volk ist eine Simulantenbande
Not a sentence, but a word "krankenwagen"
*Non te la dó*
An italian friend of mine said this to me but refused to tell me what it means
Googling didn’t really help, so I had to ask another (female) italian friend of mine
She was not expecting a question like this
Orewa ochinchin ga daisuki nandayo - I like penis in Japanese
I wonder where does the second one is from, because it is known here in czechia as well
Maybe some movie or some long forgotten meme
On our high school, our class adored this sentence:
Ich koche meinen hund

Hundgoulash
Jaja sehr gut
> "Das mädchen essen die eier
Either isst or die Mädchen
The sound of wood cracking in fire
It reminds me of all those long summer evenings around bonfire, roasting sausages and singing
Damn, we still have one of those, in Prague in capital city, my classroom is among the last few in the school to have those
oh yes cabajka, that interesting hypnotising move of windscreen wipers, insane cold during winter, 30kmh uphill, holes in the rubber joint so you get water splash during rains, parties in night lines, I miss this piece of shit
I have the same memories about 700s series Karosa buses except the four part door
We have Kaufland aswell, but not Aldi for some reason
We have [HONEST GUIDE] It is mostly focused on Prague, but it is great
Honest Guide is the best channel for tourists about Czech Republic
Honest Guide
Very much recommend
It's more about the capital city, Prague but it's great
I love every part of these replies, thanks for asking u/Brainwheeze ! haha
[their channel]
> They really do a great job of promoting local commerce
Do you mean really great job promoting local commerce willing to pay and shitting on these don’t want to pay
All of them (with the exception of 2015-2019 they weren't that terrible), since nobody really cares about Eurovision (except me, but I'm weird AF)
First we need to find someone who knows what our country sent to Eurovision
This will not be easy
Post 2010 are from okay to suppa (except Kemama, papa bless cancelation of 2019
But pre 2010
Oof
No, we don't.
Maybe because majority of Czechs in WWI died fighting for "wrong" side
It's not common in the Czech Republic, but it started to be a thing few years back and now you can see sometimes someone with it
Really
Last time I saw a lot of people wearing it, at least in Prague
Edit: Or maybe because we celebrate the Veteran Day, not specifically related to WW1, but to all war victims
Well youre right but when you learn about this part of Czech history the schools will probably just tell you that Czechoslovakian legions were good and that they were "our" freedom fighters and that the Austrian Germans were terrible oppressors
Tbh the main difference I see that Austrians want to differentiate from Germans
Not that there is anything wrong with it, I just don’t see a huge difference
I’d compare it to US and Canada, Britain and Ireland or Czechia and Slovakia :)
Came here to share this, nice to see a fellow man of culture (or at least fan of Waltze's talks)
I also liked [this  video of him] where he talks also about Austrians (and death)
And less weird shit added to food in Austria
Schnitzel eaten with sauce like in Germany is scandalous
I like it, it just seems logical to me
Consistent with other country names (and our name in most other langauges - Tchéquie, Tschechien etc
), easier to remember
I didn't like when English speakers would shorten the name to just "Czech". And I kinda like annoying other Czechs by saying Czechia/Česko all the time, TBH
I prefer the name Czechia
It doesn't really make sense to always use the full name
Bohemia sounds nicer but then the Moravians and Silesians would be angry :/
I don't really mind
I also don't call Slovakia the Slovak Republic, so why not shorten it
We also call our country "Česko" in Czech most of the times
I know a lot of Czech people that absolutely hate it, but I like it personally
It goes well with Slovakia and it isn't so unnecessarily long
I think it makes no sense for English to not have a shortened version when it has one for almost any other country
Generally I don't really care what you call it
It was super fucking weird seeing all those Czechs being asspained about the "change", the most bizzare pearl-clutching I have seen, especially since in Czech we use the shortened Česko as much as Česká republika
Thankfully it seems like most have gotten over it
I like it, because it just makes writing quicker
However while speaking I use the long version more frequently
As a Czech I support "Czechia" 100%!
I have been using it for decades so yea, I am glad the government finally made it official
Too bad it took them 23 years to send a letter to the UN to do so
I don’t care
I use it all the time in English
Nobody cares irl outside of a few people on reddit
(“Political connotations”? Seriously
I personally don't mind it, but I found out that even people who know little to no English don't like it
A while ago, I was translating something for my parents' company as I'm the only person in the family who knows English
I remember that translating our country name was needed at some point
I wrote Czechia cause it's simpler
The moments my parents saw it, they got 'angry' (as in a joking, but actually offended deep down way) and told me to rewrite it
My dad knows no English and my mother only understands the basics, yet neother of them wanted to hear that word
Not a fan, got a little used to it so my eyes don't bleed as much but I still think that Czech republic sounds better
In czech we also to our country as 'the republic' most of the time
At least in my social circle
I don’t like using it because I’m worried someone (coughamericans) might confuse it with, say, Chechnya
Alas, there’s no better word encompassing all three regions of the country and Czech republic is a tad long
The best way to refer to the country is just "ČR" but that doesn't really work in English
Czechia is fine
Absolutely
There is no other alternative for a short name
Czech Republic is too long, too official, sounds sketchy, and is too tied to the current establishment (i.e. you cannot use it to refer to before 1918)
Czechia is short, has actually been used for centuries, and is politically neutral
I'm from Czech Republic an I prefer Czech because in Czech language we say Česko [tšesko]
or Česká republika [tšeska republika]
And I don't like how "Czechia" sounds It is like Slovakia
It's funny that we have the word "Česko", which we use in everyday conversations pretty much every time, but when we speak English, most of us prefers the "Czech Republic". Since pretty much no other country calls itself a republic explicitly (nobody says the Italian Republic, the French Republic, ...), it doesn't make any sense that we do, but I guess we are just used to the sound
In English I prefer saying Czech Republic, but I say Česko (Czechia) when speaking Czech
I personally dislike it
It is terrible, thanks for asking
For real, It was because the Czech Republic Sounded the same as Chechen Republic, or Chechnya
No, I don't like it
It just sounds weird
But maybe it's because of the language
In other languages, it may sound better
I just don’t like how English term sounds
“Czechia” sounds weird to me
It reminds me some banana republic (even though we are definitely one haha)
“Czechia” makes sense anyway, but just personally I like Czech term “Česko”.
When speaking English I usually just call it’s Czech, because in Czech (language) it is pronounced as Česko which and Česko sounds more like Czech then Czechia
I learned to accept the short version even though I don't particulary love it but what pisses me off is when people mispronounce it
It still sounds the same as Czech, you just ad - ia at the end
Some people decided the word changed though and pronounce it similar to Chechnya and that's just stupid
LOL
this made me laugh so hard my helmet almost fell off
I don't exactly like it as I find the sound of it somewhat *artificial* for lack of better words
Nevertheless, I've long moved past caring about it and use it regularly as it is more practical and at this point it's really pointless to oppose it
Thanks
Please don't forget to use the correct pronunciation "["Check-i-ea"] Some people read the "CH" part of the word as "ch", which is wrong
it should be pronounced as "k".
It totally is a matter of getting used to something "new" (this name is pretty old, actually)
You're comment is right on point
The short name is just logical, really
But we have to make sure to use the correct pronunciation: ["Check-i-ea"] Some English mates pronounce the "CH" part as "ch" although it should be "k"... such as in the word "architect".
Hopefully, it'll catch on
It's extremely tiring out having say "the Czech Republic" all the time, isn't it
By the way, the correct pronunciation is ["Check-i-ea"]
No offense to your parents, but they seem to be pretty Čecháček/SPD kind of people in this story
XD If I were you, I'd just stand my ground or tell them to learn English and do the whole translation themselves
Czechovia souds like Chechenia
In general, it's not an offense to use/don't use "Czechia" for us
But some people like myself actually don't fancy "the Czech Republic" a lot, so it puts a smile on my face whenever someone uses the short name, as long as they use the correct [pronunciation]
That's only a region of the country
Czechia is pronounced as ["Che-ki-ea"] roughly
Chechnya is pronounced as "Chech-ny-a".
I believe there's a noticeable difference
I think that would be unfair to Moravians and Silesians, since "Čechy" is our term for Bohemia
Well, "Čechy" means Bohemia
Bohemia "Čechy" is land in Czechia "Česko"
In Czech leanguage it sounds very simliar
In our leanguage it's "Česká repulika" (- means Czech republic) and "Česko" - (means Czechia)
Czechia is pronounced "Check-i-ea".
Chechnya is pronounced "Chech-ny-a".
I think there's a noticeable difference
I don't really know
Some people are very critical of the Czech term "Česko" because they feel like it erases the other historical regions of the country besides Bohemia (there are 3 - Čechy/Bohemia, Morava/Moravia, Slezsko/Czech-Silesia, and Česko sounds like it's derived only from Čechy), but some just really dislike the sound of the word
I think it's because we as a nation don't really like changes that much
We tend to be more conservative I guess
Also why most people want to keep CZK instead of EUR, even if they have no economical reasons
We're just used to it
Interesting
I study German and I was taught (by Czech and German professors alike) that Tschechien is a totally normal correct term, while Tschechei is the offensive one
Most Czechs with any knowledge of German make a really big difference between those words
Basically
A lot of people here just think it sounds bad in English as opposed to Czech
Nah, thank god, the universe or whatever they aren't that at all lol
My dad complains about the coalition daily,  they're on European market and some of their employees are from Ukraine and so on, they don't really care where are you from as long as you work
Most of the time they need German language tho, as they mainly export to three of our neighbors (the exception is Poland for some reason, dunno why) but sometimes Swedes order stuff, so that's where I come into play
Plus I get paid for doing occasional stuff for their company, so it's not like I do it for free
As for that, my mother attempted to learn, but there's only so much a course once a week can do
Dad is dyslexic and one language is apparently enough for him
> Čínská republika
That's ČLDR, my dude
That's not true
Czechia encompasses all the lands of the Czech nation
54% is Bohemia
Only in case you meet someone with the same opinion as mine, which may be not that common tbh
;-) In fact, most people here simply don't care about it
Ah, yes
Bohemia is very famous in games
But it still exist
But you do it when you say "Czech", why would that suddenly change
Isn't that Böhemen in German
Young people prefere "Česko", older say "Česká republika" and the oldest say Czechoslovakia
Both
But I prefere "Česko"
Well, say that K and after that I in english must be difficult for you
But we are used to it
Czech leanguage is hard to pronounciation, so when we say Czechia it's not too hard for us
I understand
Well, it's basically just putting -ia to Czech, so if everyone knows how to pronounce the adjective, the noun that is derived from it shouldn't be a problem, hopefully
:-) There're like 150 other English words where "ch" is pronounced as a "k" already
Yeah
As I said, I don't think it's super logical
The adjective Czech was just accepted as neutral long ago (the Czech republic, Czech langauge,...), but it is technically also identical with the adjective for "Bohemian".
Language can be wild
It kind of reminds me of the "Hyphen War" (a very serious debate over the spelling of Czechoslovakia vs
Czecho-Slovakia just before the separation)
But anyway, the anti-Czechia crowd was on the wrong side of history this time :D
Well, "Čechy" means Bohemia
Bohemia "Čechy" is land in Czechia "Česko"
In Czech leanguage it sounds very simliar
Ah, ok, that clears it up
And yeah, Czechs associate the word Tschechei strongly with Nazi occupation, but older people from West/South German-speaking areas sometimes just don't get what the problem is
I had a professor go on and on and on about how she much she argued about it with Austrians when she lived there in the 1990s, that was awkward
Sometimes I feel like Czechs are almost trying to foreigner-splain the German language to these people
I see
Well, there's like 150 other words in English where "ch" is pronounced as "K", so I guess people just have to add one more to their vocabulary
By the way, do you also read "Czech" with a "ch" sound
"Czechia" is basically nothing more than putting -ia to it
It's ok
There is a big confusion in that in our language
People sometimes say Bohemia, but they mean Czechia (sad Moravia and Silesia)
But the UK has the same problem
When someone says England, they mean all of the UK
Good points
I definitely think it's just a misunderstanding
This kind of constructed image of our past can be hard to get over
Czechs kind of love holding historical grudges and feeling victimized by others (Germans, Russians, Austrians, even the EU) even when a random person from that country has nothing to do with that
No, we say Česko (some people also say Čechy as for the whole republic, but it's just one of the historical countries (Bohemia) and it pisses Moravians and Silesians - pretty rightfully)
Only in written text and sometimes spoken we just use ČR.
Yeah, I know
Czechoslovakia is still way better known in the UK or US than the Czech Republic even though it doesn't exist for 27 years
Maybe if we just stuck with Czechia since 1993 already, more people would notice the change
I love the design of [Silesian] flag
Since we had only like 3 in our history if I know right
There's not much to choose from but I'd say I like the current one the most
[The one we copied from poland]
[The current one (we also had it before WW2)]
[The one we had when we were german protectorate during WW2 (now we have it as our tricolor)]
I just love the 1956 uprising flag
The hole in the middle is just such a strong symbol
The fleur de lys is such a nice symbol, why'd the state stop using it
> The one we copied from poland
I don't wanna go full patriot here, don't get me wrong, but the Bohemian flag wasn't copied from Poland
The Polish and the Bohemian flags are both derived from their Coats of Arms, a tradition that predates both countries
Poland: Yeah, you can copy my homework, just make it slightly different
Czechoslovakia: k, got u fam
\*slaps a blue triangle in the middle\*
Cool, thx for letting us know
I thought it's the flag of Teutonic Knights
In Czech, we use "žárlivost" for "jealousy" and "závist" for "envy". You could use the former when talking about something non-romantic, but not the other way around
Still, using "žárlivost" in a non-romantic context kind of gives the statement a bit of a subtle romantic undertone, in my opinion, so it can come out wrong in certain situations
But maybe that's just me
Crazy how we use almost the same words
How surprising
There’s us, who speak proper Czech, then there’re the other people in the other part of country, who don’t know how to speak Czech and then there’s Prague
I speak Russian for decades
I have Russian wife
I thought I have perfect command of the language
And then this guy comes
What the hell does he say
As a side note, in his speech vowel quantity and stress are *distinct properties*. But the only long vowel is /o/.
Hmm, I mean yes, but that union was called Austria-Hungary :P
I've launched the first video
Pure nonsense
In XXI century, Russians are still firmly in the prescriptivistic realm
IT seems to atract a lot of foreigners to work in Prague

We have kings on our money too
Our currency is literally named crown
Our currency literally means "crown".
Our head of state lives in a castle
Thousands of people stand in queue for hours to see our coronation jewels for few seconds
It was decided by few people in exile that Czechoslovakia would be a republic
Even after independent Czechoslovakia was declared, it was generally accepted that the new state would be a monarchy
We call them "Párky" (pairs), because, well, they come in pairs
Yeah, but unlike crown, the one the royals have, our crown has little to no value
Well we have more than kinds on our notes
Not all of them but we have Saint Wenceslas (who technically wasn’t a king) on the 20 Czech crown coin and on the 100 banknote is Charles’s the IV (or I) and in the past there were more of them
We had Přemysl Otakar I on 20 Czech crowns note but its no longer used
And also our money is called crowns so that's cool

Private Facebook groups are the shit you want to look into
I unsubscribed from virtually all default subreddits
Back when I browsed /r/all from time to time, I had filters setup
Good half of them are just sport team subreddits
I'm pretty sure almost all are American football too
And another third is Trump/Sanders subs
I know I had RES literally blocking every mention of Trump during the height of the elections, but I guess I got rid of it eventually
The rest are random games, porn and hobby subreddits I had no interest in
Some bigger American events creep in from my subscribed subs from time to time, but only to tolerable degree
Yeah once certain subs get too big, the mods lose control of it and that's good bye to relevant content
Prague field trip
1 hour + to my school, then 3 hours to Prague, then almost all the mayor sights and attractions, 2 dispersals and back home, all in 1 day
Needless to say that I had trouble getting up the second day
We had a subject called 'rodinná výchova' which in english would be something like family education, where we were sopussed to also have sexual education, but the teachers usually don't do it anyway because they feel too akward
Same  for biology
We didn't have sex ed, my parents told me nothing and tbh i did learn these things mostly from my gf
I think we did some basics in biology class (my guess would be it was between 6th and 8th year of elementary school)
But really, just the absolute basics
Otherwise same, we didn't really have any
I feel like most people figured it out themselves
I know that my sister had a talk with my mother about using tampons and basic protection and such, but I (a guy) never had either of the parents talk to me about it (and it wasn't really necessary)
Norodom Sihamoni, the current King of Cambodia, spent most of his childhood and youth in Prague, where he studied music and classical dance

We have a notable Vietnamese minority thanks to cooperation during communism
Many groceries are run by Vietnamese (a sort of "typical" Czech-Vietnamese job, but certainly not the only one) and foods like pho are beginning to be widely known
Having such an Asian minority might not appear unusual for European countries with former colonial empires, but Czech republic is a landlocked, non-colonial and ethnically mostly homogenous country
Thank you for this, I and my friends have wanted to go to Kotipizza for quite some time and one of them is Italian
They will love it
And soon, Austria will be no more
Only Bratislava
Before the WW1, Bratislava had tram line to Vienna:
In German it's called "Lokalbahn", but in Slovak it's "električka", ie "tram".
I wouldn't say Pho is beginning to be known, I think it's already an established staple in the food industry here, same like pizza
In Teplice, where I live, there are about 25 vietnamese restaurants, that's probably even more than Czech-cuisine restaurants we have here
We also have a great relations with Israel since their creation after ww2
We voted for their creation, gave them weapons, were amongst the first countries to recognise Israel
We have been called as their "closest ally in Europe" by their prime minister
Czech republic has repeatedly voted in favor of Israel in the UN on several topics (for example we voted against upgrading the status of Palestine to a non-member observer state)
We also have one of the lowest levels of anti semitism in Europe
Here are also some examples from wikipedia:
"In December 2015 the Czech Parliament refused to implement European Union guidelines to label Israeli products originating from the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights
Czech lawmakers described the rules as anti-Semitic, and discrimination against "the only democracy in the Middle East". Israel's ambassador Gary Koren thanked the parliament for its decision
In October 2016 Czech Parliament passed a motion condemning a UNESCO resolution on Palestine which omitted reference to the Jewish heritage of the Western Wall and other historical sites in Jerusalem, with deputies accusing UNESCO of antisemitism and describing the resolution as "hateful" during the parliamentary discussion
Ofir Akunis, Israeli Minister of Science, Technology and Space, thanked the Czech Parliament and the country, describing it as a "heroic act" and reaffirming the close relationship between the countries
"On 22 October 2019, the Chamber of Deputies passed a non-binding resolution condemn[ing] all activities and statements by groups calling for a boycott of the State of Israel, its goods, services or citizens
I feel like not many people know/talk about this amazing friendship
And their food is delicious
Not sure about that, but it certainly rings a bell
Slovaks buying property on the Austrian side: totally legal
Bratislava public transport going to the other side: totally legal, might need some cooperation with the Austrian authorities
Yes, we've got this thing called the Council for National Minorities that represents interests of currently fourteen national minorities, that were recognised to be culturally, demographically or historically significant for Czechia
The Vietnamese joined the council in 2013
This gives them among other things a right to communicate with the authorities in their native language (with translators and interpreters being provided)
Of course, Slovakia is not annexing Austrian territory; legally it remains Austria and Austrian laws and taxes apply
For all practical purposes, aglomeration might outgrow the national border
... badly, as it's "einen Apfel" (accusative here)
I'm half Czech, quarter Slovak and Romanian
I've been born and raised in Czechia so I identify as Czech but I acknowledge the Slovak and Romanian sides too as we have quite a big family in Slovakia and we used to visit them for many years
I don't really know about family from Romania except for my grandfathers brother who we found on Facebook
As for languages, I can understand Slovak and speak a bit and I tried to learn at least some basic phrases in Romanian when I was younger
My father is Russian but I don't feel any attachment to the country, especially given the current political situation
I understand Russian a bit but don't speak it
I am half Czech and half Greek
I consider myself a Czech citizen but ethnically Greek
I do speak both languages (although my Greek is getting a bit rusty)
Half of my family lives in Greece including my half-sister so yeah, I do feel a certain connection to it

Do you like names of cities or town in your country
(in your country's language and English)
I really like names of cities in Czechia
For example:
Prague ("Praha" in Czech)
Brno
Ostrava
Pilsen ("Plzeň" in Czech)
Budweis ("České Budějovice" in Czech)
Carlsbad ("Karlovy Vary" in Czech)
Liberec
(Especially the name "Liberec" sounds like liberty)
Do you like names of cities or towns in your country (in your country's language) and do you like it in English
I really like the german cities' names
Berlin, Leipzig, Hanover sounds cool
How could you forget the real prides of Czechia
Pičín, Řitka, Kozodírky, so beautiful names
They're interesting names
Irish names of places always sound for me like some names in the Lord of the Rings
And one interesting fact:
We have also some Celtic names of places
For example:
Elbe - (the biggest river in Czechia) was named by Celts (it sounds like "Alba")
Yeah, but I meant if you like the names or not, or if you would change their name (in your native language and English too)
LOL
If you like it
But I must say, they have its beauty
Jizera for example have Celtic origin too
I hope I won’t offend anyone but it has to be either Silesia or Vysočina
Probably somewhere along the german borded
I wonder whyyy
looking at you Germany
The entire country except Praha
Vysočina used to be our largest inner periphery before D1 was built and Jeseníky mountains in Silesia were one of the toughest regions to live in, but nowadays it's actually Manětínsko that has the lowest population density, little tourism and it also lacks any noteworthy economic/industrial centre around
That one is a proper hinterland nowadays
Edit: I think most of the Czech wouldn't even be able to point it on the map
And no, it's not even close to borders
Nah, Brno
You are right, I have no idea where some Manětínsko is
it's a shame Manětínsko gets so little tourist attention, it's a beautiful area
Oh, thanks for the info
Looked up Manětín and it's actually a nice looking little town
By all means, suit yourself
Younger people go to bigger cities to study or work, while older people either stay or get tired of the city hustle and move to a nicer house in the countryside
Young people move to the cities while families move out of the cities to the Czech version of “suburbs“ aka villages v close to the big cities
Most cities don’t grow at all nowadays
I noticed the same trend in the Czech Republic
People do move to cities
Real population of Prague is about 1
55 million and it's fast growing, although surpassing 1
4 was originally expected in 2030
I think you'll get there
More and more Lithuanians are now coming back from their work abroad and as Lithuania gets richer and people have more money to buy houses, this trend will appear in Lithuania, too, I think
Tbh, I'm not really sure what rugby is, so probably not a lot
It's only marginally popular, but in my district specifically it is a fairly common sport for children
I'm living in one of the smallest distrcits in Prague and we don't even have a football pitch, but for some reason we have one for rugby, so local kids tend to join the club
Some people are playing it, but it isn't popular or really known
Didn't even know it was a sport until I saw it on the internet
Apparently we have some 40 clubs, compared to like thousands of soccer clubs
Surprising to me it's more popular than lacrosse; we did lacrosse in school (heck, we did tchoukball) but we never did rugby
Hockey and football trade blows depending on national teams' performance, tennis is probably third
I don't remember any sudden surge of rugby popularity, but if we achieve some success, the media can easily elevate any sport from obscurity, so perhaps one day
Rugby is not some alien sport here though
Major events get some media coverage and we even played it in school, even if not often
It is possible
I've seen some rugby matches on sport channels, but only sometimes
We don't have to if the milk is tetra pack (of course we do once the milk is opened) and many people, if they have some, put it in the pantry with no special cooling
I don't have any place in my tiny apartment, so it's the fridge
But it's not necessary
Eggs yes, some can be sold unrefrigerated, but I don't know anyone who'd put them on the counter at home
My parents sometimes keep theirs in the basement, they buy them directly at a farm and sometimes they get too many at once to fit in the fridge
Otherwise the fridge just seems more convenient and keeps them fresh for longer
Fresh vs
UHT milk is up to personal preference, but I'd say that most people probably have it in the fridge too, unless they buy milk cartons in bulk or something
You're gonna put it in the fridge once it's open anyway, so why keep 2 different spots dedicated to it
ETA: safe storage temperatures should be listed on the packaging
"Unrefrigerated" eggs here say between 5 and 18 degrees, but recommend a steady cold temperature after purchasing
18 is on the low end of "room temperature", so probably not a good idea to leave them out if you don't have a chilly pantry or basement
Only during hot summer for eggs
(Or we got more eggs than we need but try to say no to relatives)
Rest of unused milk can go to fridge but that’s quite rare in our household
Both are better to use at room temperature anyway
Probably people who don't actually use it as a drink
I only ever bought milk for baking or porridge, before switching to "oat beverage". Plain "real" milk always tasted gross to me, especially full fat
It's not common practice
But it's almost never an issue if you ask
It's perfectly normal
Frankly I think anyone that "frowns upon this" is a wasteful fu***ss
I paid for the whole meal so I'm gonna take the whole meal
I hope they are not cooked bone, those could kill your dog like nothing
We use QWERTZ (I swear I read some piece about the elf Qwert Zuiop living around the keyboard but I can't find it anywhere, perhaps it was something for typing lessons in highschool) with +ěščřžýáíé on the 1-0 buttons, some other symbols including German umlaut are in the right part
QWERTZ with ě š č ř ž ý á í é instead of numbers (you need to presss Shift key for numbers)
I changed it to QWERTY on my computer, as it feels more natural
I don't know why somebody decided to switch Y and Z - Y is much more common in Czech, so it is better to have in the middle of keyboard
QWERTY + composite input, so I can write all the characters I need
Standard czech layout is seriously fucked, and even if it weren't I still need letters not present there from time to time
It's worth noting that a lot of people use QWERTY too, but QWERTZ is the "default" option
Oh, that's it
I had to confuse him with fornit
Yes, I use Czech QWERTY so I get to keep the special characters and don't have to switch my brain to QWERTZ and back all the time
There are AZERTY keyboards at my workplace in Brussels (stands to reason as it's Belgium) and I don't actually need to use them very often and typically use a different one every time
As it's pretty international, there are always at least five different layouts to switch to, presumably installed by angry Greeks/Romanians/Austrians/whoever who just couldn't deal with that stuff
Always gives me a little chuckle imagining that frustrated person saying fuck it, where's my normal keyboard
> Even night clubs had these insane queues where you sometimes had to wait between 15-90 (!) minutes to get in, even when it was -15° outside
but what is the purpose of this queue
I understand supermarket one or bus one as you have to wait till clerk or bus driver serve the customers in front of you but in a pub
I asked my Irish friend about this recently and he said they vacuumed the house every day back in Ireland
Here it's once a week and even then then floor is still much cleaner than what he had in Ireland
Apparently it's just something you don't notice unless you live in it for a while
>we can't really use ceramic or other hard material, as they would get frozen and crack in the winter
together with this
> is very rare to have a house stay uninhabited through winter
made me think you don't have any kind of heating in kitchens in Finland :)
The pub my grandpa frequents does this with smoking
When you enter, they give you a membership card and you can smoke
Same in Czechia -- they not only put the ribbons, but also blocked goods in the cash desk systems, so one can't buy them even at the automatic checkout machine
Someone on r/czech told he had to stole a pen, because stationeries are closed and supermarkets are not allowed to sell them either
It has been for us for decades haha
Tell me about it
I got existential despair from just reading that sentence

FTFY
Were you just lazy
Nah, it's just interchangeable in Germany, that's why they are a little bit confused
[Klement Gottwald] had executed [some of his good friends] But it didn't help him much

Just ignores the 500k people that want him gone
Isn't it more of a generation thing
Our boomers loved tanning
Now people finally got the memo that both the Sun and tanning beds give you cancer, or worse, make your skin age, so the only young people with a tan are gonna be Instagram models with a regular self-tanner regime
Making fun of pasty people's paperwhite legs is so early 2000s...
Even though we are a small country, there’s quite a lot of dialects
But the most distinctive ones are Moravian and Silesian
These are divided into other dialects (depending on area)
I personally love hearing different dialects and learning the different words they use
But yeah, people (especially the ones living in Bohemia) make fun of them
(I couldn’t find a map of dialects in English for the whole country, so here’s Moravia at least -
This
Omg :D
Nobody cares
Unless you seat yourself to a 6 chair table, while smaller tables are available, then you might get some looks
But it obviously depends on time and restaurant
I can't imagine a situation when the number of people would make difference
They offer food, you came to eat that food, what's wrong with it
I can imagine situations when your outfit may cause problems, or your behaviour, or level of your alcohol intoxication, but the number of people you're with
Then feed THEM two main meals and dessert
Now there are two of you
*Edit:* u/KahootGer3, you have commited crimes against r/AskEurope *and her people by completely rewriting your comment in this thread
What say you in your defence
Then I put on my sunglasses and slowly walk away as the basement explodes behind me
Something to the effect of adding them into one's collection in their basement
Nope
Very, very illegal
in Czechia we don't have
where are you from if you don't mind asking
Yo what the fuck
There's 14 in Czechia
Finish sites are kind of: Hey, we need something in Finland, do you have anything
I love Finland but in country where everything used to be made of wood, not much can withstand
For example Suomenlinna castle is beautiful but you can find dozens of similar castles in Czechia
But Finish nature is awsome and you can have some untouched places, unlike middle europe where you will find village every 5km
Yeah, I meant Savonlinna, sorry :) We dont have any naval fortress in Czechia
The only thing I can sort of think is how to serve [dill sauce]
There appears to be lot of differences how people make it
Or rather what they server it with
What I'm used to is [dumpling and hard boiled egg] But then there are weird people who server it [with meat] Not my cup of tea, but I can understand wanting meat
But even worse, there are monsters who server it [with potatoes] Absolute blasphemy
Good portion of the population doesn't partake in the discussion, because they think dill sauce is inedible
Christmas potato salad with or without mayo is probably the biggest one
Also ["knedlíky vs
noky"] but the movie's the first I've heard of it
There was also a controversy over calling potato/sugarbeet alcohol with rum aroma "rum", and a lower-fat spread "pomazánkové máslo", but both of these have been resolved, though some folks are still a bit butthurt over it
> Cheesecake with raisins
I'm sorry, what the fuck
o.O
My Russian wife is in team kvas, so there am I.
I’d say that a more popular discussion is whether it’s better to eat a schnitzel for Christmas or if it’s better to eat a carp
>  What I'm used to is dumpling and hard boiled egg
But then there are weird people who server it with meat
Let me be an arbiter
Both are shit
>  But even worse, there are monsters who server it with potatoes
Oh jeez
Potato salad without mayo is heresy
Who the fuck wouldn’t put mayo in their potato salad
Hmm, I guess
Never really had that argument as we always make both and I hate eating ~~mud~~ *carp*.
Salmon
It's a fish, so tradition stands, but unlike carp it's tasty
Traditionally, fish aren't very prevalent in our quisine, like in most landlocked nations
Except for (awful) carp we make for Christmas
Also the way we do dill sauce may be a bit different to how you make it
It's a bit hard to imagine with a fish, but it's interesting idea
At the very least it's not straight up off-putting to me like eating it with potatoes, haha
What sort of fish would you recommend
It's not really dilly
It's quite thick sauce because of the flour
I remember being served this abomination in Austria
No mayo, nothing but cold potatoes, vinegar and oil
WTF is this
[This] is the kind I'm talking about
No clue if it has any specific name
I feel like i’m the only person who actually likes carp
Come on I think that carp tastes really good
But hey everyone has a different taste
Vice versa
Taliban means "students", talib is a student in Farsi (EDIT: arabic loanword)
But Spaniards do use this word versatile
Grammar nazi in Spanish is "talibán ortográfico".
I think Bohemia is much cooler than Czechia
It is a denomination for one of the 3 traditional parts of today's Czechia (but actually accounting for ~ 60% of the total area) but historically we were known as the Kingdom of Bohemia anyway
The English word Czechia just looks wrong and weird - especially the "cz" part is unnatural, these two letters never occur next to each other in our language
I think the English spelling is borrowed from the Polish language, but still
If I had to, I'd change it back to Bohemia
It seems easier to spell than Czechia
Czechia to Checkia/Chekhia and the Czech Republic to the Check Republic/the Chekh Republic
Now it looks like Polish, not Czech or English
"Check" would look like English and "Chekh" would sound like Czech
To be honest, "Croatia" have always sound more like "Korea" to me for some reason
Definitely wouldn't connect it with our "Chorvatsko".
I love how the Slavic, English and German names sound nothing alike
I swear every other country is at least a bit similar, but not Germany for some reason
It's the old Czech spelling, not Polish
We couldn't quite decide whether to use "cz" or "č" until the 19th century when "č" finally prevailed
>traditional parts
You mean LANDS
And what about Moravia and Silesia
I know right
Hahaha, check this out, i see, very funny, never heard of it before
And what about Moravia and Silesia
We should rename to ,,Lands of the Czech Crown"
Hold up Czechia is the Beerland
Well, yes
Bohemia sounds more cool
But it's only one land in Czechia
It sounds cute
Wiki disagrees though: "The current English name comes from the Polish ethnonym associated with the area, which ultimately comes from the Czech word Čech
[22][23][24]"
What about United Republic of Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia
We could be the republic alternative to the UK - the UR
Although it doesn't have the same ring to it
If you're asking about why they shortened the name, probably because it's shorter
I tried to google the origin of the name, but didnt really find anything, but I assume it's after 'praotec (grandfader basically) čech'. He's the legendary founder of our lands basically
He probably never existed, but there's a period of around 150 years in Czech history of which we have no records, so there are famous legends (Staré pověsti české) set in that period, which includes this legend amongst others
In Czechia we call it Německo
Ahem
I'm here
While we're at it, let's get rid of the president and get a cool king
They've got it wrong but the sources claiming so are credible enough that they are unwilling to change it
Or so I've heard
We would be the URBuMS
Not sure I would want to be called that
Dunno about silesia but I'm Moravian and pretty sure people here would be lol
According to wiki, the word root of -Čech is the same as the root -čel meaning people (člověk in modern Czech)
So we're basically "the people"
*TV documentary*
The Bohemia is the only country in the world, where they vote freely for their own king
Great idea, but not the Habsburgs, I suggest someone from Poděbrady
There is much more then Pilsner fee example Radegast or Budvar are completely different
Well, yes
But don't forget to other lands in Czechia
It's like, we were Spain call Castile
Okay why didn't I find that lol
Kinda boring but makes sense
Well we don't want them to flee when things don't go as imagined really
They aren't only historical
They still exist
I know
But it makes that feeling
I mean Japanese names sound nice,but it would be very weird if a kid was called Takumi Novotný.
I really like the name Artyom, which is from Russia, so the kid would get weird looks here in Czech republic
Jason and Timothy
I like Robins but their names don't really fit :/ Richard is the only one that works (friend got dibs on that), Damian is OK but bit strange
Only got girl so far tho :D
Johannes, Wilhelm and Friedrich
Thats
stupid lol
I like those names tho
Agreed, also Johannes is really nice
And Hermann
For Misha: you dont have a "Michaela" in Russian
Female form of Michael, that can be called Misha
Laszlo is a very gypsy name
Funilly enough, i know a Baasha and she is Polish
Really
I know a lot of russians who live in Czech Republic, that have no problems
Also, when we were in poland with my school, one of my classmates - a russian, had no problems and even spoke russian to older people who didnt know english
To be honest, I have no problem pronoucning Zbigniew or Zdislaw, but Arkadisz is harder
And he would need to live in Prague, since metro is only there
Don't
I have a classmate who moved from Russia to Czech Republic, his name is Vitaliy, why the hell would you put "iy" at the end of the name
Cool
Thought most Polish names have Czech equivalents, this one doesnt
I see a lot of Levi's t-shirts And sweatshirts here
I have some too
*former eastern bloc here
Actually, after the revolution and throughout the 90s it was super popular to wear huge logos of western brands cause it had been forbidden fruit until then
>I try to avoid them since I'm not a billboard and don't see why I should even pay more to be one
I like this
I think I'm in danger of over-idealising Austria
To me it seems like Czechia but better in every way
I really hope to go to Vienna on Erasmus
Same here
Couldnt believe what I saw on TV
>tons of Swedes believe Sweden is the best country in the world and the Swedish way is the best, and they're not hesitant about pointing it out
Danes have the exact same
I love living here, but a hint of the slightest criticism instantly makes them super defensive
It's not uncommon to have people suddenly question you over whether it's better where you're from or why you live here in the first place
I think it's a Scandinavian thing
That sounds so awful
First of, you can look up [patronymics] \- these occur in many European languages
All of **O**'Neill, **Mac**Donald, Fergus**son**, Pér**ez**, Ivan**ov**, Ivan**ovic**, Kardash**ian**, Juga**shvili,** Papa**dópoulos,** Petr**escu,** Nikola**yevich**, and many others, refer to "sons (or children) of". This should cover a large part of European surnames
Not the nation you mentioned, maybe still worth a bit: thing to bear in mind in Czech surnames: they differ for men and for women
As a rule of thumb, women's surname will end with -ová; ie
Novák and Mrs
Nováková. If the man's surname ends with a vowel, it is usually omitted: Mr
Svoboda and Mrs
Svobodová.
It occurs both at birth (Mr
Novák's daughter will be Nováková) and at marriage (Mr
Novák's spouse will also become Nováková)
There are couple of exeptions like Janů or Petrů when the surname is the same for both genders, and if women marries a foreigner, she can keep his surname without -ová. Ie
Mrs
Smith will remain Smith and not Smithová.
For naming characters - it's as easy as pulling up a [list of Polish surnames] and picking one
It'd be a much safer method than trying to devise your own surname based on some rules you can only guess at
Not sure if Kowalski is proper Polish surname, but it definitely looks Polish to me
Same name could be possible in Czech, but it would be spelled differently, as "Kovalský". Czech uses "v" but Polish uses "w", and the rules for using i/y are different
We have male and female surnames here
We have for example: Novák (male) and Nováková (female)
The female surname is usually done by adding "ová", but it can have some exceptions like for example:
Novotný (male) and Novotná (female)
They all have some weird grammar rules here, but you begin to understand those rules some time around adulthood
We are tackling the language barrier a little bit here
Meaning of "Kowalski" could be translated as "the smith". Keeping in mind that smith is a profession it could be expanded as "of profession of smith". OPs idea behind "of" may be right
Yes and this good to bear in mind for most Slavic surnames
In the Balkans, they often end with -ić for both men and women, but for the rest of the Slavic (and Baltic, excluding Estonia) countries this applies
Thanks, I'll fix it
So Wodehouses's "Psmith" was not as random as it seems
That would be same in Czech: _Novákova_ and _Novákův_.
I only find it a bit sad that we often shift to English for convenience with related nations too quickly rather than putting in a bit more effort to understand each other
Especially when it comes to Polish which is not fully mutually intelligible with Czech as Slovak is but still relatively well understandable when both sides speak slowly in simpler sentences
For example my grandpa back in the days was a penpal with a Polish guy (they were both collectors)
They wrote to each other about their shared hobby, then they invited their families over to visit their respective countries, spent holidays together etc
, all while speaking or writing in their native tongues
Sometimes there were misunderstandings, sometimes they needed to repeat themselves slower or explain certain expressions but it was possible and it offered them a unique insight to each others' culture and their relatedness

Je to tak
Občas vidím na Internetu polštinu a je mi trochu divné odpovídat anglicky, když tomu rozumím.
**edit:** btw [dobrý kanál na Youtube] Polák mluví s jinými Slovany, aby se dověděli, jak si rozumí. (For others, a great Youtube channel where a Polish guy speaks with other Slavs to see how much they understand each other)
Večerníček
Hah, typical :D :D
You've served in Iraq
Respect to you
Hlavní problém s polštinou vidim její psanou formu
Nevím jak to číst  :D
ę,  *ą*,  ć  a tyhle podobný
Some of those we use in our Czechisied German words too
szczególnie to se čte jako - ščególnie
Basically we had similar writing as you until Jan Hus made a reform and introduced - ě,š,č,ř,ž. Little arrows above some letters
Czech reads as it writes
Thats nice and where are you from
I guess by nickname from Italy or Estonia(Talin)
Ah, nice, thanks for great explanation
Once in Germany on field hockey tournament there was one Polish guy in German team we were drinking with
After some beers we were speaking Czech-Polish with him :D
Trust me, me neither
I have no understanding of Polish language
(not kidding)
Oh, thats great
Some people learning Czech shares their experiences on the YouTube channels
For example TadyGavin and DreamPrague- both Americans
Im learning Deutsch on school, but Im not that good in it
No, not our neighbors, but Russia isn't far enough TBH
nah, we only hate our neighbours when they win in hockey
Probably Slovakia
I know nothing about this topic tbh, but this article came out on 1st april soo
yep same situation in Czech republic
Orban or even your Kotleba have many alt-right supporters here
"ej more gadžo co ten mocac kolik dás?"
Nah just kidding
Czech will understand what I am trying to prove here
I studied in Santiago and as a non-native speaker who only knew castellano I didn't have much trouble understanding spoken galego, but written galego was prety tough, because things that sound almost the same in both languages are written rather differently, since the grammar rules and pronunciation are much closer to Portuguese
It is still readable though
Some time ago I read someone concerned with the Irish survival, who claimed that the new generation of schoolchildren (gen
Y back then) has better command of the language that his generation
Has the trend been reversed or was it mere wishful thinking all over
The gypsy problem isn't just magically going to disappear
40% want communism back
Seriously what the fuck
Please don't gang up
That usually doesn't end well
For us, anyway
why are you booing me I'm right
I think they just miss their youth tbh
Not that much really, i definitely view it closer than any other region, but not particularly close
Without looking stuff up, I'd recall
Morocco - touristy, lots of exotic spices, bazaars
Algeria - colonised by France, lots of Algerians in France, biggest country in Africa, Atlas mountains
Tunis - Berbers, Carthage, Started the Arab spring and came out of really well off
Lybia - Gadaffi, civil war, ISIS strongholds, sub-Saharan migrant smugglers
Egypt - ancient times, Nile, Crocodiles, extremely densely populated, Suez canal and crisis
I've been to Tunisia once on an exchange program and have some Tunisian, Algerian, Morrocan and Egyptian friends
I dare say I know more about the region than your average European, but I would still love to explore the area a lot more
I love the beautiful historical centers, the sound of the Arabic language, the cuisine, the pottery, the lovely Mediterranean countryside, the atmosphere in the evenings, the blend of European and Berber culture etc
Certainly wish I would get to read some good literature from the region
I'm looking forward to visiting, once the corona situation blows over
EDIT: The only thing that I *don't* love about the region is that I am an obvious target for all the street peddlers, so in some places I can't walk five steps without someone trying to sell me something while trying to make smalltalk
It makes navigating some places really tiring :D.
How you can be closest non european neighbors when you are over sea
Almost nothing
Basic geography, dominant language and religion, and that's all for an average Joe
Plus some obligatory stuff like pyramids
We definitely know way less than it would be good to know
Okay, 30-Years War and the Hussites have both been mentioned, so I'll go for the less obvious choice - **the Protectorate**.
The country's occupied by Nazis, but there is resistance, not least of which are para-dropped **literal assassins** aiming to take down the Butcher of Prague, the Blond Beast, the Hangman, one of the darkest characters among Nazis, an architect of the Holocaust, Reichsprotektor Reinhard Heydrich
Now, I don't believe Ubi could do the story justice
Maybe back when they were sticking closer to history, but probably not even then
Most certainly not now
But in an ideal world, it would be a wonderful setting for an Assassin's Creed game
Easy, hold my beer (literally)
Background of the reign of the most successful ruler of the Bohemia - Charles the IV
The whole area of Prague's old town as the playground, wouldn't even need to "shrink it" like they do with the rest of the cities
1939-1945
Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia
Resistance, sabotage, maybe something to do with the Czechoslovak foreign legions in Russia or UK
And the assassination of Heydrich of course
There's also the Urban legend of "Pérák the Springman" which the game could present as either an assassin or an acrobatic villain
It could end with the Prague uprising
or go a little further and show how we only went from one totaliarian regime to another
For Czechia Hussite Wars or assassination of Heydrich
And they could also stick the urban legend about Pérák into it as well
I personally would like to see Assassin's Creed in Prague during the reign of Rudolf II
Prague was the capital of HRE at the time with a plenty of artists, scientists, and occultists at the court
You would have Edward Kelley, John Dee, Johannes Kepler, Tycho Brahe, the Devil's Bible and even the mysterious Voynich manuscript, not to mention Rabbi Löw and his Golem, at the same place at the same time which would certainly make a lot of content fitting to the AC universe
Ah, kurva, I wrote a comment about Protectorate and Pérák as well, without knowing it's already here
Oh, well, I'm too lazy to delete it now
Anyways, Pérák would fit really well into AC
What's interesting is that we don't really know if he was a hero or a criminal
since there are accounts of him attacking nazis as well as raping girls (i think
So you could either present him as an Assassin, a Templar, or just some acrobatic neutral villain
Could make an interesting sidequest line
We do not limit those to a single era :)
Pérák's modus operandi was also rather similar to those the Assassins: jumping from the height, killing a nazi officer with a razor, and vanishing
I can imagine a story arc where a main character wonders whether there's another assassin in the city only to discover it was Pérák all along
(Also there's [a cool animated short film] with Pérák for those who are not familiar with the urban legend)
One of advantage of hussites as AC’s protagonists is large amount of weird weapons they used
Did we
Didn't the chinese have something similiar before us
No that much, we mostly watch czech old fairytales and russian Mrazík.
Private televisions are trying to push it as Christmas movie, but it's not exactly popular and definitely isn't a symbol of Christmas, it's just a movie nobody asked for, which gets aired during Christmas
We have our own traditional movies, like russian [Mrazík] but more importantly two czech christmas classics, [Tři oříšky pro Popelku] and [Pelíšky]
Definitely
I would love it they would air Die Hard, at Christmas, actually, I'll look if they are
Love actually is a classic here too
EDIT: They're not airing it
Pelíšky, vole
Wel there’s just too many traditional movies
I can name these just from the top of my head - Pelíšky, Tři oříšky pro Popelku, Mrazík, Home alone 1 & 2, Die hard, Anděl páně 1 & 2, Tři veteráni, Sůl nad zlato
+ Basically all old fairy tales
For my family, Christmas movie is also S čerty nejsou žerty, I wonder if it's usual or only my family thing
Russians
burany
Not really sure if anything really fits the definition in here
The closest thing to chavs here are probably gypsies or the people in cities that stick around them
We don't really have a word for them
lidezbrna - totally uncivilized rednecks from a village
slušní Češi - "polite" czechs
General term „socky“ from something like socially disadvantaged - coincidentally also a slang term for public transportation
Also „agrometal“ gets thrown from time to time, villagers listening to local pub rock/metal scene, would coincide with „burani”
slušnočeši
Loud, obnoxious, rude, aggressive, very prone to crime (especially stealing and drugs), very prone to never work a day in their lives and instead have 10+ kids with their cousins and milk benefits
There are exceptions of course, every city usually has on average 2 gypsies who have a job and are reasonable
Propably stole some shit
Can't speak for other people or even other countries, but my family's experience with gypsies involves multiple burglaries
Europop/dancepop, similar to Abba style but from czech artists
That's actually interesting
I didn't live through those times, so correct me if i'm wrong, fellow czechs
Because of communist censorship, quite a lot of music from west was unavailable and got into czechoslovakia through smuggling and with long delay
To hear what's actually trending in the world, you could listen to radio stations from abroad (but that was illegal i believe)
Because the regime had to approve every piece of art (music, movies, books), the dominant genre was pop - not many heavy themes, sometimes just songs from west translated to czech
Karel Gott, Hana Zagorová, Michal David etc
There probably were some mainstream rock bands, but idk about any rn, because the whole rock scene was very much against the soviet ideas
All czech rock bands from that era (Blue Effect, Plastic People of the Universe) i can think about had problems with the regime at some point, so a lot of them vere pretty underground
**Slovak:** Basically everything
Grammar concepts are pretty much the same as in Czech
Much of the differences between Czech and Slovak come from historically different vowel shifts, so for example where Czech uses "ů", Slovak often uses "o" as in sůl (Czech) vs
sol (Slovak) - meaning salt
So often, the words have same consonants but sometimes different vowels
When the vocabulary is completely different (doesn't happen often), I usually know the meaning through exposure to the language or by context
With Slovak,  I am able to remember the meaning of unknown word after first hearing it, it doesn't feel like learning completely foreign language at all and don't need to put in much effort
Anyway, most of the unknown words are not words people use in daily casual conversations - often times it's more technical stuff, names of plants etc
**Polish:** I would say that I can understand about 80% when written and about 65% when spoken, speaking slowly definitely helps
I've checked some news websites in the past and I could understand most of the articles
Watching polish people speaking on TV I can also get the general meaning of what is said
When interacting with real people in Warsaw or Krakow I could also understand most of the times, although I had a feeling I can understand Poles better than they can understand me
That could be because I can understand Slovak and sometimes the words in Polish are more similar to Slovak
Poles don't have this advantage
Polish also uses lots of words which are already archaic in Czech and there are lots of false friends, which can be tricky sometimes
**Sorbian:** Very similar to Polish when written, especially Upper Sorbian
When spoken, it gets really harder - the influence of German is very noticeable - it's basically Slavic language spoken with very thick German accent and that makes it very hard to understand if you are not used to the way how some words sound with this accent
**Slovene/Serbo-Croatian-Montenegrin-whatever:** When written I can understand about half or little below that of what is written, so usually I can get the general meaning but the details might get lost on me or might be inaccurate
When spoken, the understanding gets lower
When hearing these languages it feels oddly familiar - as if they spoke Czech but in the end they use completely different words
Anyway, I've never had problem to have a basic conversation when on vacations in Croatia
**Other Slavic languages:** I can occasionally understand a word here and there or maybe even some short phrases, but that's about it
East Slavic languages are hard to understand when spoken due to their heavy use of palatalization
When written, the limiting factor is the Cyrillic
Anway, for Slavic languages mutual intelligibility I recommend youtube channel Ecolinguist
The creator holds conversations between different Slavic people, transcribing everything what is said including translation to English
[Here's one video comparing Czech, Polish and Silesian+Kashubian dialects of Polish
] This way I found out I can understand Silesian/Kashubian on similar level to Polish, with Silesian probably even more
Slovak - absolutely no problems, though the eastern dialects can get harder with muttering
Polish - 75 %, if they speak slowly enough; the meanings somewhat differ and archaic words switch places with the normal ones between the languages quite often, but I presume I could hold a conversation, if both me and a Pole speak slower and pronounce carefully (I heard a full lecture in a museum in Polish, with my teacher translating somewhat, and halfway in I needed the translation only with certain words)
Sorbian - 70 %, again, I need to hear it slow and carefully pronounced so I can pick the words apart, but usually I get the meaning of the sentence somewhat
southern Slavic - I have experience only with Croatian, and it gets somewhat tricky (maybe 45 % of the words I somewhat recognize, but the meanings can be jumbled), but the pronunciantion is pretty good and close to Slovak in a way, so one can get by
Ukrainian and Russian are different worlds to me - sometimes I catch a word (like 25 %?), but getting the meaning of a sentence is real hard for me, the pronunciation is really, really foreign and it gets difficult to recognize words
Czech and Slovak are like brothers
I can understand Slovak perfectly but sometimes the words are completely different and it feels uncomfortable to read the text
Other Slavic languages aren't so similar, but since I know my cyrillic and my diacritics I can usually understand the general meaning of the sentence
That is, if the language hasn't got a word that's identical to a word in Czech but means something completely different
(for example: Droga in Czech means "drug", while in polish it means "path")
It can sometimes creaty funny misunderstandings if you don’t know what certain words mean
For example the famous polish word "szukat" :)
In Czech otrok means slave
I Czech it’s kočka :)
Bulgarian for me is on the same level as east slavic languages - I can understand only isolated words, it's quite different from other south slavic languages - or from all slavic languages for that matter, Bulgarian is pretty unique - when it comes to grammar at least :)
Portuguese and German are also somewhat connected
They are both Indo-European languages
What the actual fuck guys
Ah, nothing brings about a constitution faster and safer than hanging ministers from a lamp post
Sometimes it is
If there aren't piles of manure under the windows
Personaly should be
It's fun
Yeah, just like nothing starts war faster than throwing political figure out of window
I don't think they threw people out of the windows so that they could get some fresh air
When you throw somebody out if window that is 20 meters above the ground I don't think that you expect the person to survive
Universities usually have Czech and English study, but other schools don't. Maybe some private
Here, rarely maybe some private schools
It's not common but it does exist
In the long run, weaker Georgia means higher chance to absorb Georgia back to some kind of Soviet Union (without Soviets this time)
> The only part I'm sure about is that it's purely Putin coz Yeltsin's administration supported Georgian territorial integrity
Ehm, no
The first round of wars happened in early 1990s, and Russia was heavily involved on the separatist side
I'm old enough to remember news
Not officially, but Russia was involved, including anti-air, air and naval support
Who knows which were the orders Yeltsin actually gave
EDIT: checked wikipedia
It documents direct battles between Georgian and Russian forces
Do you believe it is possible to "disobey order" and organize full-blown military operation with air support and naval landing of a regiment
Ridiculous
měsíc - both moon and month
Candle and spark plug = svíčka
Wheel and bicycle = kolo
Scratch ticket and elk = los
Feature and lynx = rys
Trail and college = kolej
Passport and waist = pas
Shine and Septemeber = září
Hooker And fuck (as a bad word) are translated as Kurva
In czech we have lidé for people in general and for humans as a species
Houba = mushroom,fungus/sponge
Safety and security are both bezpečnost
Yes, but in reverse
"Tvaroh" and "sýr" are both cheese in english but it's a completely different thing
> On the other hand, we have "buho" and "lechuza" where they only have "owl"
Interestingly, despite Czechia being landlocked, Czech language has different words for the true seals, *Phocoidea* (tuleň), and the eared seals, *Otariidae* (lachtan)
Same here
Czech kinda circumvented the problem using *velkoměsto* (bigcity) for, you know, big cities
same here, we call it jed
You don't do reflexive pronouns
But U-Boat is just the German word for submarine
In English, it's messed up as well
Biscuits are different across Atlantics, and I'm pretty sure cakes are too
Because pescado is a substantivated past particle, like "fished (stuff)"
Same here
Yeah, we have "učit/učit se" and "půjčit/půjčit si" (i.e. pożyczać sobie)
Czech langauge also has "luna" for moon, though its too poetic to be used in normal conversation
Surprised Slovak doesn't.
Damn that classico one sounds cool af not gonna lie
When talking to other Czechs I say I’m from region of city Písek and when talking to other people I say Czech/European
same plus playing on playground with other kids
Me too and I was really proud of myself because I don't know how but I won the campaign missions unlike my cousin
Jewelry - I just cant say it
Or any word with th sound - I just say d instead
The car - D car
It used to be “schedule” and “uncomfortable”, but recently I found out that I cannot say “Brazil” and pronounce it as “Brazzle”
Comfortable
No matter how hard I try my lips are not cooperating with me on this word
some words are hard to pronounce, because, there isn't one way to pronounce them
Like for example **Read** does and doesn't ryme with **Lead** and can read like **Red**, but also doesn't have to and only way to know how to read it is from context
Also some geographical locations (like **Worcestershire**) are pretty hard to pronounce too, but they don't come up in conversations that often
Generally it's words with the "th" sound, words with "rl" in them and words with more than one r in somewhat close proximity
So it's words like thorough, girlfriend, rural etc
-ough words are a mess
Every single one of them is pronounced differently
You can start with learning how to spell the word correctly ;)
Here in czechia, we pronounce things the way they are spelled (so basically any spelling competion would be useless with few exceptions)
In Czechia (and I would expect that in other slavic languages as well) we have the same problem
People try to pronounce it as if it was some sound they know, because "th" is just too hard
Instead of "The", many of us  say "D", instead of "with", many of us say "wif" and I have even heard "wis".
Can't speak for Germans, but given we drink the most beer per capita, we can trow Czechs into the mix
The beer culture is strange in a way that, up to certain amount, drinking beer is not considered "boozing", and I heard, and have the experience that Czechs generally tried to avoid conflicts, even under the influence (unless they had way, way too much) even more physicall ones
Ireland
There is the obvious: beer and pub culture
And then there is a surprisingly similar history and a mindset, to an extent
Both countries have experienced the underdog, almost "colony" status under a reign of another, stronger neighbor
Both suffered from being forced into adapting a different culture, almost letting their identity to be wiped out
Both have a certain "underdog" mindset, although we express it in a much different way due to the whole 20th century mess
I feel like whenever I talked to an Irish, they understand us much more than any other Western Europeans
From some perspective, Switzerland is kinda similar, Czechia and Austria are really close together, because of our history and when I was in Switzerland, I felt like being in Austria, so from one perspective, Switzerland and Czechia are kinda similar
We use discord for almost all subjects
I'm very surprised by it actually
I only had a few classes this semester and like half of them were complete bullcrap that I only took to get enough credits, most of those simply didn't happen anymore
There was only one class that used Teams for lectures and the internal school system for exercises on a regular basis, even the final exam was online
The other classes were kinda meh - a few online lectures, some excercises we had to do but that's about it
Overall, easiest semester ever
Right now I am just finishing up my bachelor's thesis, which I don't need the school for
So the quarantine didn't affect my studies that much
Yeah
5-7 30 minute long classes each Monday, Wednesday and Friday
Most of the teachers use Microsoft Teams and some Zoom, it depends on the teacher
In general, language teachers prefer Zoom because of the fact you can make groups there
"alright guys, we've finished the chapter
Can I get a pog in the chat
I don't think using a Microsoft product for "privacy" is a great idea
Security of the software you're using != privacy
Still kinda sad that the government doesn't do anything and it's really showing in statistics
You have the similar number of inhabitants and about 3300 people died in Sweden
Here, in Czechia only 300 people died
I was quite sad when I looked at the statistics 3000 people could live now if government took this crisis seriously
But I understand due to social and historical context why Sweden takes it easy
Still it's kinda sad for me even though I have no relation to Sweden
I guess at least you will less economical consequences
However, I prefer more health than money
Pičín is probably the most famous one amongst the czechs
I'd translate it as "pussy land" tho it could be probably translated better
We have Pičín, based from the word piča which is pretty much a cunt
Kuřim --> I smoke
Řiďka= Asstown
Pičín=Bitchtown
And many more
Pičín - Pussy town
Polipsy - Kiss my ass
Somebody already mentioned Pičín (cunt town), but I think that these also deserve a mention:
Řitka (small ass),
Šukačka (fucking),
Hroby (graves),
Onen Svět (basically a euphemism for death),
Vepřová (pork),
Hovězí (beef),
Telecí (veal),
Hlína (dirt),
Kámen (stone),
Hrochův Týnec (hippo's town - not sure how to translate Týnec),
Louka (meadow),
Sloup (pillar)
Pičín (Cuntsville)
Kozodirky (Goat-holes)
Peklo (Hell)
Mokrovousy (Wet-beards)
Hulín (Blaze-town
as in pot-smoking)
... and that's just a few of them
Sometimes I wonder what the fuck the founders were thinking (or smoking)
village called "Onen svět"
"The other side"
Cunttown, it sounds bettter
And our Little Anus where the old anus Helenka lives
Similarly, there's Horní Police in Czechia
Yeah Cunttown sounds better
Never ending cycle of train crashes
Most known are [Studénka\[2008\]] and [Studénka\[2015\]] \- yep, almost same place
First was a [bridge falling down] on the rail during it's reconstruction, second was [polish truck driver] not wanting to scratch  his truck
You have the winner, no doubt
If I recall correctly he also caused his employer to go bankrupt because the damage(cca 8 mil €) was way higher than the insurance limit
Every insurance has a limit
The absolute minimum in Czechia, required by law, is 1,4M€.
Usually it's more than enough
But when you wreck a hightech train and kill few people
People are usually asking for our BEER, CARS and MONUMENTS (mainly in Prague) or why are we so atheists
(And when you say, that you are from Bohemia, they usually ask what part of Germany is it)
"Oh I visited Prague once in 1995, it's so nice", or their cousin's been to Prague, etc
I personally find Prague overrated, but it's alright, people are just trying to relate to something
More people than I would expect know a bit about Czechia/Prague, at least those from other European countries
I don't remember any surprising questions
I know a guy from the Czech Republic
When i tell people that I’m from Czechia they usually say Where
Or are you communist
I have problem with distinguish Ukrainan and Russian
South Bohemia region
In the regional city I live - few days snowing, but it all melted the second it touched the ground
My home village in foothills little bit further - the same, only the thin layer of snow stayed for few hours, probably thrice this winter
Small town little bit further, deeper in the national park and mountains near the border where my grandma lives - little snow for several days twice
It's pretty cold this week, but otherwise around 5C and higher and I don't expect any snow
Now or the next winter
It's the same situation for several years now even though we used to have a looot of snow for majorty of winter some 15 years ago
We do have snow, but it's laughably small amount
Still enough to cause the ski-hungry Pragueners wreck their cars though
Yes
About two times for half an hour
In the city where I live (north-west Bohemia) it haven't snowed yet
Sometimes in the morning there Is ice on the ground from frozen water, but that's it
Nope
We got like 5 hours of snow in Prague on one afternoon, but it melted overnight
Nothing in sight as well
In the past, Vltava (the river flowing through the city) used to freeze and people played hockey on it
That sounds less real than seeing a live unicorn these days
It was snowing but didnt lasted more that Hour
So not funny, didn't laugh
Prague and North Bohemia, in Prague, it "snowed" for two days but it didn't even get to touch the ground
In Karlovy Vary (North), it didn't snow at all, only frozen dew in the morning
Climate change is real (imho btw acording to the Milankovitch cycles, which are usually the main excuse of denyers, we should be getting colder nowadays, really doesn't seem like it, maybe global warming is a thing after all
(LOL btw our former and present presidents still deny CC and GW))
EDIT: spelled the cycles name wrong
Where at
I don't trust it (there are still some channels doing it but not much and it looks even less trustworthy than before), but we loved to watch it as a funny show with my brother as kids
In times when Horst Fuchs was the star
I don't think it's much of a thing anymore
My grandparents were definitely into it 10 or 15 years ago, but it's been replaced by shady online stores that resell cheap Chinese stuff to people who haven't heard of Wish/AliExpress, MLMs, and stores selling products under the "As seen on TV" label that have kinda become their own thing now
We've had scandals involving "sales events" and lonely elderly people, in which scam companies take a bunch of old people on a "free" bus trip or lunch and then pressure them into buying overpriced appliances or mattresses while they're locked in a room with aggressive manipulative salespeople
It's quite bizarre and a little sad
IDK if this was a thing anywhere else
This shit kinda replaced the door-to-door salesmen my grandparents were buying vacuum cleaners from in the 90s. I feel like some people just never learn
Probably [this one] It's from the 1989 protests that were part of the Velvet revolution and fall of communism
For the recent years
[President of the Czech republic on holiday]
[New prime minister kissing his PR head-of-staff after election results were announced]
I'd nominate two 1968 photos, [this one] and [this one]
Or maybe some other with people arguing with Soviet soldiers, like [this one]
Gaelic
It sounds like something out of fantasy
Finnish
That sounds very melodic and there are a lot of vowel sounds and not many consonants
I really like Swedish, Croatian and maybe even Slovenian
To me they just sound really pleasant
As for someone from the Czech Republic the most pleasant sounding language is Slovak
For our similarities its sounds like Czech but mor cuter witch poetic charm to it
I've just compared them by listening to them on youtube, and I must say that Scottish gaelic sounds more pleasant to me, in fact
I don't know how to properly describe this in english, but I like that the R in scottish is harder than in irish
It's basically the same as we pronounce R in Czech
Aw, that's a shame
But I fear that is just the nature of school in the end
I'm sure there are plenty subjects in school I would normally really enjoy, but the environment and the fact that it's forced takes away the joy in it and makes it kind of annoying
Sadly, I think this is the only way to keep the language from dying out, which should not happen to such beautiful cultural heritage
Czech R is very similiar to the scottish "tapped R", if not entirely identical
EDIT: The irish "slender R" is in fact quite similiar to our infamous Ř :)
Yes, that might be it, Czech has probably the weakest palatalisation out of Slavic languages, so it sounds more natural to me
Maybe Russians or Poles would like the Irish gaelic more in comparison
And don't take this as me saying irish gaelic sounds bad or something, both dialects are very magical
Well our current PM is Slovak and is effectively the main person while our Czech president is just trying to drink in peace
It the complex politics and diplomacy of the medieval Europe it was quite common
For example John of Bohemia, father of our most respected ruler, was from Luxembourg
Our current PM is Slovak
Every country from Austro-Hungarian empire be like
Zeman and drinking in peace
It’s more like he drinks while thinking of how to provoke as many people as possible and how to make more room for his buddies
He may look and act like a senile zombie, but he can still do harm
Currently he is lobbing for Russian vaccine and bringing Prymula back again
And he already claimed he is going to be creative with interpreting the law after next parliament elections
Babiš, the CEO of Czech Republic
I still wanna know who killed Václav III
Trust me, every normal Czech thinks it's bizarre as well
He was born in Japan, too
But technically he's not a foreigner as he holds citizenship by birth
In reality he is just a political entrepreneur
He does not actually believe what he claims
(E.g. He used to be very much pro-migration some 10
years ago
Well, he claims to be a huge patriot, protector of traditional values and he's very anti-imigration, but at the same time he wasn't even born here
I mentioned it as an example of how politically active he still is
I personally believe that the vaccine is likely ok from medicinal point of view
Yes, Russians sometime cut corners, but they have been using this vaccine for their own people a lot, so I tend to trust it
Talks about it being unsafe sometime sounds like propaganda from our side
The issue is political aspect - what they might want in return
It would be fine if it was only  about money, but with countries like these it is often about influence
And after being part of eastern block for 40 years, I believe it’s reasonable to be cautious when dealing with them
If doctor asked me to choose between Russian vaccine and no vaccine, I would gladly accept available one
I wouldn’t trust the Chinese one tho
I think that they've started dating when he was 39 and she was 20
"It's about -1600 °C  high in the atmosphere as the molecules are too far away from each other" - my high-school geography teacher
He refused to believe that there was something like absolute zero (-273
16°C)
Once our history teacher let some student from university to teach us WW2
She said that Operation Barbarossa started 22nd May
When I corrected her she asked if I mean by Gregorian or Julian calendar
At the time I didn't know that difference is only about 2 weeks (if I remember right) so I've shut up
Well
My high school physics teacher thought the moon landing was fake and told us the Earth was 15 billion years old
Hey, I have a question about your religion classes
Are you taught oy about one religion like Christianity or about more big religions like Taoism, Budhism, Islam and other
> The American Civil War was not about slavery
It is not my field of interest, but I've heard people whos field of interest it is, and they insist that saying "US civil war was about slavery" is oversimplification
It is a popular misconception
I believe I was taught the same in my school days (1980s)
Oh, that's cool, on my school we have this class only bcs we are Christian high school, other high schools don't really have it and in my opinion it's really good to know about different religions even though 90% of us are non-believers or atheists
On our school its a little more about philosophy
Yeah, and we also talked about Taoism, Confucianism and natural religions
Look at the USA, they are bad in languages and geography
Look at the UK, they are too
I believe the English language is the problem
It definitely is celebrated the same as the German guy said but I'm not sure to what extent, because it's not celebrated in cities and big towns
I live in Prague and in my apartment building we used to celebrate it when here lived kids
I remember when they apparently told themselves "Gotta hit the winter where she doesn't expect it
" so they went on to salt the streets in September
Byl pozdní večer – první máj –
Večerní máj – byl lásky čas
Hrdliččin zval ku lásce hlas,
Kde borový zaváněl háj.
It's from the very famous poem Máj (May) from the 1800's. I'll try my best at a translation
It was late in the evening - the first of may
Evening may - the time of love
The turtledove's voice called to love
Where the pine forest's wind was blowing
It might seem from this snippet that the poem is about love
But it actually follows the story of Vilém, who has been sentenced to death for murdering his father for sleeping with his girlfriend
He is hanged and the girlfriend commits suicide by drowning herself
"Byl pozdní večer, první máj, večerní máj byl lásky čas"
The first two verses of Karel Hynek Mácha's poem Máj, translated as "May". It's an introduction of the first may being the time of love, though the rest of the poem is sad
This whole poem is linguistically interesting, because Czech language by default stresses the first sillable in every word, but reading this poem makes you always stress every other sillable (it's called jamb), very unnatural way of speaking in Czech, but at the same time it sounds good
That shows that Karel Hynek Mácha was indeed a genious linguist
Definitely the first or second line of "Máj" by Karel H. Mácha
"Byl pozdní večer – první máj –
Večerní máj – byl lásky čas
"It was late at night - the first of may
nightly may - the time of love
I'd say "Hynku
Viléme
Jarmilo
" is the more commonly known part, and sounds just ridiculous out of context
Wasn’t Vilém executed on the breaking wheel
I think they hanged him first
They used to do that if they wanted to show some mercy to the criminal
That, and also I had no idea what "lámání kolem" was in english
Don't make graffiti tags on cultural monuments
Stupid British and German tourists in Prague
Not to redder to us as Northern Europe
Another weekend plan ruined
But why
Well there go my plans for the weekend
I think I know my next vacation destination
*cough* One Plzeň please, this other stuff is disgusting
Sad we don't have that law
Is there someone for whome a clown isn't part of a nightmare
Lennon Wall is not cultural monument
it's not okay anywhere where it is not allowed
Hmm
Kölsch, sounds like Braník.
Also, it's hilarious how people from Brno and Ostrava defend their local beer just because it's theirs despite the fact it's absolutely disgusting
mostly cheap furniture which doesn't stay long with couple of good things
Why is the food there so popular I can't understand, probably because only competitor nearby is mcdonalds or so due to ikea stores locations
Its most basic and cheapest furniture you can buy NEW for that price
Its so generic and widespread today, people think you are "poor" if you dont have anything better
Its starting furniture for starting families you will replace in few years after moving in
Also there is another view, that for material used (sawdust, shives, glue
) its overpriced
Some people say it will not last long because of cheap materials, it will desintegrate in 5 years, but these are just abusing that furniture and handle with it like 20cm thick undestructible oak table
Yeah, people here really take it personally when you call Czechia  “Eastern Europe”, and the argument is: “Prague is more to the west than Vienna, so we are Central Europe
On one hand I understand that, since being considered Eastern European automatically means that you have to be poor and corrupt based on stupid stereotypes
On the other hand, though, aggressive arguing and trying real hard to convince others you are not Eastern European
feeds more into the stereotype that you are just an angry little Eastern European trying to shove ‘truth’ in other people’s faces
>  I don't get what's is bad about being in ''eastern Europe''
>People really like to get upset for anything
What people like you repeatedly fail to understand is that the "Eastern Europe" definiton most (ignorant) people use was defined by the Iron Curtain and extremely oppressive treatment from the Soviet Union
This is all without mentioning that this Eastern Bloc definition is extremely, extremely broad and lumps together countries which haven't had much in common before the Soviet occupation and have distance themselves from the Soviets/Russians from Day 1 they were allowed to
And let's not even pretend that "Eastern Europe" isn't a negative attribute in the English language
How would you feel if Italy was a part of "Axis Europe"? I bet that wouldn't be okay with you now, would it
Not with Czechia included in it
I never claimed we were a part of Western Europe, we've always been Central
we don't have any and I am fine with it
Far enough we're in NATO
I wish they were European military bases but I don't really mind them, certainly better than Soviet military bases
I don't think we have one anyway
I don't mind
It feels comforting to know that the world's most powerful military has a large operations base in a neighbouring country, makes it more convenient if we are attacked from the East
The more the merrier
Liquid bread
Beer I know its not food but best beers came from Europe and you can drink it with a lot of classic European food
You're limiting yourself too much
There are many excellent Spanish cheeses, some Greek and Cypriot ones (Kefalotyri for one, plus niche things like Feta and Halloumi), and I had good cheeses from Norway (this sweet brown cheese), Sweden, Lithuania (they follow the Swedish tradition, Džiugas is similar to Swedish ones), Austria (Bergkäse), UK (cheddar, stilton)
There are many more countries which I would put in the second tier, but still with some nice stuff
Germany, Poland, Slovakia, Czechia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova all have some cheeses worth tasting
I was looking for a guy like you haha
Same, I couldn't even find any bakery with an actual bread :(
I didn't know what to eat lol
I mean it is brined cheese, not your usual hard cheese, and it should not be compared with say Gouda
I can easily believe it, but I have never been to Portugal, so I've omitted it entirely
Sorry for that
No, Polish gastronomy is not exotic here
Never saw any
Maybe in regions near the border
Sadly
You won’t find many Polish products with good reputation here
In Czech Republic people from  Ostrava are going shopping to Poland
Not really, if you want Polish groceries you usually just go to Poland to buy some
Slovakia - Slovaks live in their lands probably since 7-8th century, but history of their independent state starts in 1939 with collaboration with Nazis
Hussite wars have great stories in general
For example, they used wagon fortresses in battle to counter heavy cavalry and infantry with great success
Late in Hussite wars they split up into several groups, and there was a battle where both sides built fortresses and waited for the other side to attack
Unsurprisingly the side that lost patience and attacked lost
Hussites are super badass from military perspective, but from religious side they have been extremely radical in 15th century
not that far from ISIS today in their actions
Not being Austrian, I'm still fine with calling it Austria
I have 2 answers so here they go
For vacation or just plain visit I would probably love to visit the Interwar period Czechoslovakia
Probably an obvious anwser
Then I would also love to visit either the reign of George of Poděbrady and even as far back as the time of Great Moravia under Svatopluk
I know the tune and some of the lyrics of the Slovak and our old Austro-Hungarian anthem
I recognise the tune of the Russian, Polish, Italian, French, British and German (also the old East German) anthem
What do you mean know
Like when I hear it, I can recognize it
Or you mean I know the lyrics
I know german one with lyrics (even few older ones), polish with lyrics, slovakian with lyrics, soviet with lyrics (russian without lyrics), british with lyrics and french with lyrics
Also the american one with lyrics
And also canadian with first 6 words
Just to mention, I don't know the whole lyrics in many cases, but I know most of it
I can recognise the old austro-hungarian too
I know British, German anthems well because we sang them at school due to learning English and German
Then I know Russian because meme culture of the internet and ofc Slovak
I know that French one is war march song and that's all
If they are "almost" rich (just wannabes) it's your tipical shit, expensive shoes, 2nd hand Audi And all that
But if they r truly rich, u won't even pretty much notice them y'know
But I guess it is the same everywhere
Depends on personality
They become prime minister
Ulice (Street), it's been airing since 2005 and there are currently 4025 episodes
It would take ~120 days to watch the whole thing
Ulice (translated The Street) has about 3150 episodes and new episodes are still coming
The Czech Republic is culturally divided into 3 main areas - Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia and there are so many different slangs
For example, I am from Moravia and usually, people from Bohemia would not understand what I am saying if I didn't want them to and definitely not if my grandma was speaking
It's not only the pronunciation but also the use of different words for different things, the endings of words, the verbs would be spelt differently if written down and so on
Not that many young people use the slangs today, but it can be still challenging even with basic words that we use
Czech Republic is divided into 3 areas, Czechia, Moravia and Silesia
The biggest difference is between Czech language and Moravian language, but you can still understand what that talk about
But my mom is from Ostrava, which is divided into Moravia and Silesia and my dad is from south Czechia, so my language is somewhat mixed, for example I speak normally Czech but in sentence “we are” “my jsme” I could pronounce jsme as jzme, but that’s just a small difference
I don't think there are is one unintelligable accent (I guess it depends from where the listener is) but every accent has several words than no one else understands
The further right you go the more polish it sounds so yeah, anything past essentially Brno is just unintelligible
Slovenian in general is somewhat harder to make out for us compared to Croatian for example
I don't think I could communicate with a special case of Slovenian effectively without English
And in the Czech language, there is nearly never a word that two people would read out loud differently if they saw it written down, but we use different forms of the words when we speak, which would then be spelt in a different way
You mean "jejichejma žufánek
I've only been to Devon when it comes to the British Isles and I have no problem understanding Scouse
Geordie is a bit trickier but I can still manage
Welsh accent in English is the most complicated one for me
I might just as well struggle anywhere because I'm not at all familiar with respective regional vocabulary
I went west and saw „ein zwei“ written on a billboard
I think „raz dva“ is more intelligible
This is actually not entirely correct
There's a phenomenon called 'Moravian assimilation' — all obstruents (p, b, t, d, ť, ď, k, g, f, v, ch, h, s, z, š, ž, c, dz, č, dž, ř) are voiced before sonorants (m, n, ň, l, r, j, vowels) across word boundaries
For example, „Jak je
“ is pronounced „Jagje
“ instead of the Bohemian „Jakje
“, or „nicméně“ and „buďme“ are pronounced „nidzméně“ and „buďme“ instead of „nicméně“ and „buťme“.
Some Moravian and Silesian dialects keep i/í and y/ý distinct from each other
For example, „holubi“, „holuby“ and „holube“ are all pronounced differently
Similarly the l-ł contrast (two l sounds) might be still retained
Minimal pairs such as „lež“ – „łež“ and „spal“ – „spał“ are found there (which are obviously both homographs and homophones in the standard language)
panický (paňický from panic vs panycký from panika) nebo proudit (pro-udit (about meat) vs prou-dit (about a river)) are one of the homographs in Czech
There are no many of them though
Does this mean "best time in history to invade Russia in winter"?
Small facial piercings are considered normal for women regardless of age, in their case they are seen simply as contemporary fashion elements
But in the case of men I'd say it's viewed more as a statement, not just fashion
People will think you belong to some kind of subculture and might treat you as such
Not in Czechia, I’ve seen very few and none on people in higher positions and respected professions
Germany, in the other hand, seems very different in accepting piercings, tattoos, amd smoking
it shouts "bad life choices" anybody doing serious business will shut doors in front of you (90% of the cases)
Its thrashy, if you want to do shitty job (hair dressing, waitress, helping hand in industry) Its how you choose it for life without possibility to go back
So I hope your piercings and tattoos were great choice
Exactly - if you are doing shitty job or servicing people, you can have it (few), If you want 1,5x or higher wage than is average, you just cant have it
There are unwritten standards
Everybody in higher tiers will look down on you
They dont want to be seen with these people
As a male with shaved head and pierced ears, I have never been rejected by a Czech employer
3 times average salary
This is very true, poeple in cz love to talk about the "live and let live" yet they obviously treat you differently when you dont conform to what they perceive as "normal". I guess it just makes them feel better about themselves when they say it, they dont live by the statement
It is 100% correct description of Czechs in general
Seems like a bullshit to me
Your posts in this thread indicate to me that you personally have some issue with this and you are projecting it onto the whole country
I am living proof that piercings are not a problem and I've never had any issues during job interviews (male engineer with a septum piercing and 10mm tunnels in both ears), neither did my university educated friends
And I work for a big international corporation outside of Prague
I've had no problems even when I travelled for business to our offices in the Germany, USA or anywhere else
There are managers in my company who also have piercings and tattoos
I can imagine piercings would be a problem only in banking/law sectors where the demands for business looks are high
Don't see why some programmers or even doctors should have problem - I personally know one doctor with piercings on face and sleeve tattoos (tatoos covering whole hand)
Generally, piercings and tattoos are so common nowadays, walking on the streets it's pretty common to see someone with piercing/tattoos/tunnels in the ears etc
I cannot imagine manager or engineer with these in the face
Never seen one
Only low income group have these
Because Czechs might have a negative opinion about some of your traits or looks, but it generally doesn't change the way they treat you
Not "live and let live", but "pretending to follow the 'live and let live'".
Body modification is generally more mainstream in Western Europe
I’ve met more tattooed, piercing-scarred or wearing people in Germany in three weeks than I have in my home country in my lifetime
Similar with the UK
And my cousin owns a tattoo salon
Because as other stereotypes it depends on individual people
From my experience it's rather true
We use 1 234,56 in Czechia
We don't put anything between thousands
We split decimal places with comas and we don't always split thousands but when we do, we do it with a simple space
So for example: 1 201,55€ or 1201,55€, we usually split thousands if the number is long
We use commas for decimal and space/dot for thousands
234,5 CZK
We use billion this way:
million = milion
billion = miliarda
trillion = bilion
quadrilion = biliarda
etc
My old calc did this
It's the default position
Really strongly identifying as "an Atheist", you know, like the kind of people who have to rant about how stupid religion is at every opportunity, that's cringy, but also not uncommon
Otherwise it depends on your area/social group to some extent, the South East part of the country and some rural areas are more religious (Catholic), in other regions (like in the North where I grew up), being a practicing believer of any kind makes you a very small minority
I would say people just dont care about that here
Comparing to US or Western Europe it simply do not even cross our minds that someone could be religious
And if someone is, then it is likely very personal and you will not even find out (people usually don't want to stand out)
Growing up i didn't know anyone who would practice some religion,it was just a thing from historical or foreign movies, literally nobody talked about that
Remember how weird it was to see those US movies where they they always prayed before food and visited church every Sunday
I think one of the reasons why so many people in this country do not want immigrants from distant religious cultures is exactly this, they dont want to disrupt the homogeneous culture of irreligiousness
People don't even want to bring discussions about religion back to everyday life
I know 2 religious people under the age of 60
Our country has around 90% of population non-believers, so that explains a lot
Totally normal
I mean I'm from Czech Republic the most atheist country in the world
>How are Atheists viewed as in your country
We are them
In my country there is almost everyone Atheist
I don't know anyone who has any religion
Being Atheist is like a normal thing and almost anyone gives a shit about some religion
Almost everyone is Atheist from late 1960s. And religion is now like a historical thing, i remember from my childhood, when i was watching some film or serial from US it was super weird when characters was praing before food and going to church on sundays
(Thanos voice) I am atheism
Around 70% of the population is atheist, so
Czech republic is full of atheists so it's kinda normal for us
Love this
From another historically Catholic country, well, opinions on church buildings vary
Some hardline atheists don't care for these monuments (or even see them as symbols of oppression) and think the church should only maintain them through member donations and never receive any public funding
However, most of us still recognize their cultural and artistic value and are fine with taking care of them on the same level as castles, museums etc
Not every church necessarily has historical value, it would be unrealistic to maintain churches in every single village if so few people ever go to them, but the major or unique ones are definitely treasured
It's kinda like how we don't have a monarchy anymore, but we still kept its crown jewels as one of our national symbols and didn't bulldoze former royal palaces
Famous cathedrals are definitely visited by many more tourists than actual churchgoers, that's true, but lots of the tourists also come there _because_ they're Catholics/Christians themselves
Some large churches here actually have services aimed at tourists, in various langauges
Any chinese people feel free to answer this one
That mf is drunk 24/7
He nearly threw up on our Crown Jewels, on the TV
He also said pussy in an interview
You don't even have to make up jokes
The man is a living meme
Here are some links, you should check out: [Crown Jewels] [i don't even know] [a videogame based on his interview]
He is THE JOKE, we don't need to tell jokes about him
Did you copy our prime minister
In Czech you pronounce things as they are written

the feeling when your keyboard doesn't physically have the key between Z and left Shift :(
yeah, and in most parts of the world the keyboards don't have the key for í xD, it goes like Shift, z, x, c, v, ...
French, Spanish, Russian - other languages don't seem very important or I already can speak them
Tough question
On one hand, it's tempting to ask for an upgrade of the languages I already speak to some extent, on the other hand getting 3 languages fully for free
OK, I'd say
* French, which I don't speak and not learning, but it is useful
* German, which I'm very shitty at and going nowhere
* Something non-IE, either Arabic or Turkish, just for fun
German, since it's a pretty useful language, same with Spanish and as a third choice I'd choose Japanese because why not
German, because I'm currently trying to learn it
Russian, because it's kind of an international language in its own sense
French, because omelette du fromage
German, French because those are the most useful
For third either Arabic or Chinese
Something a bit more exotic, that's hard to learn and is widely used
I think they should generally be removed, although there's some difference between statues of Lenin and such and more generic monuments to Red Army soldiers and WW2 liberation (even though those were also extensively used for propaganda purposes, for sure)
If any of them are of unique artistic value or really iconic/popular with the locals, they can stay
We can't erase that history either, that would be like getting rid of all the memorials to absolutist monarchs or the Catholic church because they were also oppressing our people
(We've also had debates about [some of those] I think municipalities should decide what to do based on consulting the citizens, but also independent historians and art scholars
Of course none of that is really as relevant as the fact that we have an un-reformed Communist party sitting in the parliament and many city councils, as well as Russia who still sees itself as a continuation of that "empire", so it's not easy to get rid of any of them
Too bad we didn't have more of that revolutionary energy to get it done in the 90s.
Most of them have been removed, and the rest should be torn down with haste
Exception should only be monuments dedicated to actual soldiers who died to defeat the German army
Yeah
Do we even have any statues of Stalin left
I thought those were removed already in the 60s or so
I was amused when Russian protesters swamped the Czech embassy and threw a few molotows (if I remember correctly), and when some Friends of Russia type group protested here
But the fact politicians had to go into hiding under police protection is absolutely outrageous if the intel is correct
If there's a table dedicated to the pub regulars and you're not one, you don't sit there even if it's empty
In some pubs, they bring you beers automatically when you're finishing your currend beer
Putting beer mat on top of your glass tells the waiter you don't want another
If you insult local favorite football team, you are a ded man
You don't switch the TV from ČT sport
You just don't
Ahh yes the "costumers", a dress up party is always nice
Sometimes there's a sign "Permanently reserved for regulars" or generally you just know
It's usually a table close to the bar, in older pubs, it's together with the bar in an entrance room called mázhaus, separated from the main room further inside called lokál. In smaller or newer pubs it's at least visually seperated from other tables
First you have to be acknowledged as a regular by both service and other regulars
And then you get gradually accepted by the regulars until one day you might get invited to the table
No, it's more of a gradual and subtle process
As I wrote in the other comment, first you have to be acknowledged as a regular by the staff as well as by other regulars, then the regulars slowly accept you more and more until one day you may get invited to the table
It starts with the bartender recognising you were there before, he may ask "As usual
" when taking your order or don't ask at all and simply bring you what you usually order or he may joke about being puzzled when you order something different or that you were missing when you don't visit the pub on your regular time
It goes both ways, you start using less formal language when talking to the staff, talk about various things and maybe joke around as well a bit too and being generally more comfortable around them
For the other regulars, when you start recognising their faces and they seemingly recognise yours, you may do a nod of acknowledgement when entering the pub, later even directly greet them
At this point, you could be already considered a regular and most likely you won't get past this stage
The guys with their own table are the top tier, a sort of local nobility, they have likely been frequenting the pub for twenty years or more and developed strong bonds between each other and between them and the staff so they don't let anyone easily among them just as you wouldn't really let anyone into your close group of friends
Anyway, even at this point, the status of a regular brings you certain priviledges
For example if the pub is full and you come, the bartender may sit different people together so there would be a room for you, or you may get things that are not on the menu
Plus you may socialise with other regulars who frequents the place and make use of this diverse social network
However, if you still desire to get to the štamtyš, you have to simply wait at this stage
Maybe one day, they tell you they need a third one for a game of mariáš (a card game for three players) if you wanna join or if you've got a skill to offer or an interesting story to share etc
If you prove yourself a jolly companion, you may get directly asked to join them at the table the next time
And after a few times, you start sitting at the table without asking
Waiter either keeps tabs at the bar, or each table/person has their own - it looks like this:

I applaud your knowledge of the term "hladinka". You made this Czech happy
Every police officer is armed with service pistol, in our case CZ 75 D compact, some police patrols have long firearms in the trunk of the car
Even municipal police are armed
Police is always armed with a handgun
And many civilians too
In the Czech republic, every police officer and every municipal police officer (and many private security guards) carry a handgun
In every major municipality (sometimes they cover 2 municipalities) at all times, there is at least 1 police car patroling around with heavy firepower and Kevlar equipment ready to respond to threats even before the swat team could
And in times of high emergency, tension or just important diplomatic event, police in vital checkpoints carry heavy firepower
Overall very well armed
In addition we have a lot of civilian conceal carry firearms all over the place
The same thing here, though I'm not sure about the assault rifle in the car
But yeah, every officer is armed with a handgun, but it's pretty rare to see them carry anything more than that
The only time I saw that, I think, was after the terrorist attacks in France and now that I think about it more, it may have actually been the army
Been to Vienna during Christmas holidays 4 years ago and seen plenty of police walking around with assault rifles
That was military, not police
Oh my bad, completely forgot about it
Same in Czechia
EDIT: sometimes it is called "Australia and Oceania"
Neat, we have the same thing
We call it „světadíl“ also means „world part“.
We're glad our roads are not destroyed enough for us to drive cars on them let alone a ride bike lol
They don’t. My first family gathering was my boyfriend’s family’s. My family is full of drama (caused mostly by my mother)
Not stupid but a lot of people have problems with this and it's purely grammar:
Řekli jsme
(We said
- Like we all without specification or we if there's at least one man or only we men and it's clear from the text
Řekly jsme
(We said
- Like only we women or only we children or we women and children
If there's one man in the group you are speaking of or if it's not specified at all, it's Řekli
And again if it's clear from the text)
But if it's not about people only, there are cases where -ly is even for masculinum
For example: Muži stáli
(Men stood
) But Stoly stály
(Tables stood
) Both masculinum, but it depends on whether animatum or inanimatum
Stvůra a nestvůra jsou v podstatě totéž.
A  creature  and non-creature (monster) are basicaly the same
Negative concord
It usually becomes a mess when there are 3 or more negatives and the context is logic itself on top of that
Don't forget that the neuter only group would be řekla jsme
I've seen native people totally confused by "dojela jsme" in a car advertising
Never in my life have I ever noticed that lol
Dead and undead are both dead, tho
More like "is forming dialectal continuum with the western Ukrainian dialects".
Even two can be confusing
Like "Nikdo nezraněn", literally "Nobody not injured" actually means "Nobody injured" in Czech, even though it said the opposite even in Czech
The same for example "Nobody didn't came" meaning "Nobody came".
Yes
But I'm ok with people in everyday informal speech use -ly
Written
there should be -la
Well one of them is moving
Not in all dialects
There are some extreme examples, like popular song from the 30s:
Nikdy nic  nikdo nemá  míti za definitivní
neb nikdy  nikdo ne-ví  co se může státi
Nobody never should not consider nothing to be definitive
cos nobody never doesn't know what could happen
That's exactly what negative concord is and once you know it's idempotent, it's not confusing, provided the context is casual
That's what I meant by my previous comment
However, yes, the confusion actually starts from two negatives onwards when the context is logic, although when there are only two negatives it's usually made clear by emphasis that the concord isn't used, that's why I initially wrote 3 or more
I usually find three negatives difficult as people can fuck with you, as you can't tell if they're all in concord, all negates each other or only two of them are in concord and the remaining one is negating that partial concord
(When the discussion is getting close to logic
Yes, then it breaks the concord, same in Czech
EDIT: To be more precise over here if the emphasis sounds like:
* I didn't do **NOTHING** — The concord remains; you're just angry
* I didn't do _n o t h i n g_ — The concord breaks; you're a cheeky bastard
"not against" or rather "not to be against" directly translates to "nebýt proti". Note that "against" isn't a negative
Charles IV, the holy roman emperor
T. G. Masaryk, our first president, played an instrumental role in the creation of independent czechoslovakia
And, of course, most important is Jára Cimrman, inventor and writer, who I highly recommend people that don't know him to research
* Svatý Václav (Saint Wencelsas)
* Jiří z Poděbrad
* Karel IV (Charles the 4th)
* Jan Hus
* Rudolf II (We were under Austria)
* Marie Terezie (Maria Theresa, under Austria)
* Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk
* Edvard Beneš
* Klement Gottwald
* Alexandr Dubček (He was Slovak)
* Václav Havel (I am not sure if he counts as historical because he was president until 2003)
Important authors:
* Karel Čapek
* Božena Němcová
* František Palacký
* Karel Hynek Mácha
* Karel Jaromír Erben
* Jan Ámos Komenský
Don't forget about Jan Žižka and, most importantly, Jára Cimrman
And Master Splinter
Ok, I wanted to add a category for musicians but decided not to
With him I would probably place there Dvořák a Tyl
Try asking young people outside Prague
OP didn't forget, the nation did
No, they wear "it's ok to charge me at least double" costumes
There are no pools in Prague which would be accessible from balconies
So instead, British people climb up on the top of water fountains and traffic or street lights
I like it because it's the only foreign language I can speak
It doesn't sound too bad but there are way more beautiful languages
Czech is definitely not one of those tho, I think vowel-heavy languages sound way cooler
The pronunciation is just a complete mess, so can be the tenses and sentence structures
Czech is more consistent and easier in that aspect, which I like
But there's no declension, whereas in Czech you decline, conjugate and inflex everything, which isn't very cool (although it has its advantages)
Overall I like that the beginner grammar is incredibly easy, which means the language is very easy to pick up and converse in
I think the best aspect of English is its absurdly large vocabulary
Just makes it more interesting to read and listen to
On the other hand Czech has more consistency with its prefixes and suffixes
I prefer to use English online in typing and writing a lot more than Czech
English has a very good autocorrect, so I don't have to watch each letter I type
No annoying declension and diacritics, forcing you to type everything manually and slower than in English
The written English grammar is also much simpler than the Czech one
I prefer spoken Czech more though
It feels more practical than English, often has shorter sentences, less (though longer) words and it's my native language afterall
Better than Czech for most stuff, at least for me
Even for emotional matters, my native language feels kinda “cringe-y”.
I enjoy it
I particularly like the nuance of some of the adjectives and descriptives
Sometimes I feel like the Czech word I want to describe something with is lacking in context whereas there is an English word that fits perfectly
I would have to use a phrase to describe something that has just one word in English
So it feels very versatile
Like irked and miffed both convey annoyance but in ever so slightly different ways
It's okay, I feel like it's not as rich as Czech language but that's probably why it's easier to learn for a non-native speaker
And in English it's nice that you can talk about someone without assuming their gender, that's not really possible in Czech
For example in English female and male students are all student but in Czech we use often masculine terms as neutral to refer to people even if it might be a woman, like when you say "go to the doctor" you don't know if the doctor is male or female but in Czech you say "jdi k doktorovi" for male doctor and "jdi k doktorce" for female doctor, so the problem is that if you just don't know the gender of the refered person or just don't wana assume people say just the masculine term, so people often imagine the male right
Or when you ask "do you have a partner" you don't assume what gender is their partner but in Czech you kinda have to assume to create the sentence cause we don't have a neutral term so that causes that everyone just assumes you're straight
And saying the options like "do you have a girlfriend or boyfriend" every time to be inclusive, that's something not many people do or maybe are not willing to do
Just because of the way our language works I think it's gonna be harder to change things like these
Most people don't see it as a problem I guess but I had a classmate who studied gender studies and I learned things like this from her a lot and now it's just stuck in my head haha
I hope my comment made sense lol
No, I don't, but I don't enjoy speaking languages
I love them, but not in the practical sense
In Czech you can do a similar thing
You can also make a swearword out of pretty much everything
Some Czech here said expressing empathy and emotions in Czech is cringy
Have you ever met someone with an opinion like that
It seems to me the other way around personally
The real plague is here in Czechia
With our shit education system teens can’t speak English very well, but they do adopt English phrases
It doesn’t seem that bad, but it’s really weird
The importance of English will again decrease in the future as the US loses its sole economical and military superpower status
English is currently just convenient for trade and science
In 200 years, it will be something different again
Latin, Greek, French, German, Russian, Spanish (Mandarin
Lingua Franca changes all the time
It's not gonna replace Finnish or any other language
It's just convenient for now
This is the first time I hear something like this
wtf
English is such a boring and barebones language
It is excessive
You can verb without any suffixes, google it
The first and last one are the same, it seems to me
Yes, like this
You just go without them, and it is perfectly fine
In case you really need to convey the idea of *this* object, you use a demonstrative pronoun
"I saw yellow bus
That bus had antenna".
Of course I have met one, he's me
Expressing myself in czech can feel too intimate to me for some reason
It’s probably because of all the TV shows, which are in comparison to real (slavic) life very emotional
V tom případě je to psychický problém, nikoliv lingvistický. Jakýkoliv jiný jazyk by pro tebe byl "příjemnější".
Asi jo
I am not afraid of the current situation, but I doubt my abilities will be the same as 6 months ago

Looks like your team advanced to [Division 1] this year, so congratulations
I'm from Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad) so we got most of our landmarks from the last 2-3 centuries (thus not very historical), we got lotta spas, some thermal springs, a watchtower, an old house (the eldest building in our city, from 16th century I think) and the Three Crosses, a beautiful lookout
Well, I am gonna anwser anyway
Prague Castle, Charles bridge and Vysehrad(older castle in prague)
Prague Castle
I've been to Bílá Cerkva
Not too far from Kyiv, so I've actually came two or three times
But I've only been to the park, not any cathedral
Lonja de la seda hands down
There are many other interesting places, but the lonja is magnificient
Kladivo
I don't know how badass it is but i think that kladivo and kovadlina (anvil) souds good for the clanking of forge
Also "palice" for those big ones
Kladivo is pretty badass tho
Very hard, no soft sounds
kovadlina, kovadlo here in cz
How is then normal hammer in your language
>Nakovalo is an Anvil
I don't know where you got his one, the Czech word for an anvil is kovadlina
That's more of a mallet than a hammer
Anvil, or "kovadlina" in Czech
depends on what region
some people would pronounce the D hard
It's okay mate, we all make mistakes
Isn't that just germanized Czech
Matka

Those are Czech words
If they're renting alone, probably nothing
Many single 25 year olds still live with the families, or on a property they inhereted or got from their family, and with how much rents are increasing in cities, we're only gonna go back towards less independence
If this hypothetical person shares an apartment with a whole bunch of people, then maybe they can save 200€ a month or so at most
Unless they work in an IT engineer/developer position, in that case they're getting paid twice as much as any other 25 year old, but in general the average "fresh out of college" salary isn't much more than 20k CZK after taxes and rents in Prague and Brno are climbing towards 20k a month for a one bedroom flat in decent areas, soo
You finish school when 20-25, you work 35 years, you retire and live next 35 years
It looks like you need to save 50% of your income or you just live above your means
Dont inflate your lifestyle
You spend 60e on lounas
I mean, realistically it would be absolutely total chaos in every country
But there is not realy south/north divide in our country
Prague would be at roughly the same place, people from sudeten border mountain areas would go into sudeten border mountain areas on the other side of the country
People in Central Bohemian region would still live in Central Bohemian region, Ostrava would be at roughly the same place too
The most impacted would be Brno which would move maybe like 100km more north
In this sense i thing we would be one of the least impacted countries in Europe
Well, the wine rednecks would live in the town of coal rednecks and vice versa
Nothing much
> a socialist system would Be perfect for Russia and other ex soviet countries
The central planing is in principle a bad system
The market and people participating in it are too complex system to be planned for years forward
You need to go deep into the forest, when you are in nature
Here, you just go few steps outside of path and nobody cares if they see your back
Toilets are of course preferred, but it's not a big deal when there isn't any around
It's considered rude not to turn your back to other people while doing it, but it's normal and noone cares
It really depends on where you are
If you find yourself in a built-up are you really shouldn't urinate anywhere outside toilets
In nature I agree with you
It's also not quite legal, aka you can get fined if you do it in front of a policeman, but generally, people don't care, thus they don't bother the police
It could be either public indecency, or polluting of a public place, depending on the specific
Of course, I forgot to mention that, but people do make that difference
Al dente is the only way to pasta
This makes me so irrationally angry
This shouldn't be the trick of the Italian, but the trick of FOLLOWING THE FUCKING INSTRUCTIONS ON THE PACKAGING
You mean it is not on the package
You mean people put pasta in the cold water
Holy shit, the last time I was here it was Czechoslovakia
Czechoslovakia doesn't exist
Parents take their small children to pee in a bush / occasionally also naked small kids around public pools
Why you have toilet if you can shit in bin directly
What about stop with drinking of beer
Then I will also add shocking fact about Czechia
Not everyone are alcoholics
The first time I encounter a spelling bee was during watching Southpark and was just thinking they are mocking some knowledge competition or whatever
So I was really surprised later when I found you really have national broadcasted competition how to spell words correctly
When I first learned of spelling contests as a little kid (from that Simpsons episode), I thought they are either made up, or that they are for mentally disabled contestants
Since, you know, why would you ever need to spell something, unless it is maybe a foreign name/place
Czech language has highly phonemic orthography, meaning almost everything is written as it sounds
So, spelling bees are irrelevant - most of the time if you can say it, you can spell it (sometimes with the exception of i/y)
I initially found concept of spelling bee utterly baffling because our language is very phonetic and you read the exact sounds you write
Only much later I realized it's because English is basically an abomination
No and I thought that americans must be really stupid, because they have spelling bees when I saw them in cartoon
There are some spelling things like I/Y D/T P/B but they could be told by overpronounicing or saying I in high tone and Y in low tone
Or you can use [rock and putty] in demonstration
is it really putty
What else it could be
He wouldn't dare
I found out such contests exist from your post
In Czech language they would be pointless as the words are mostly written as they are pronounced
I can imagine such contests for foreign languages like English, French, or Spanish - older kids usually have some knowledge of at least one foreign language, so they could compete in that
ETA: Well, I just remembered that Czech language competitions do exist and I even took part in one at about 14 (which was along time ago  )
But it was not about spelling at all, but mostly about correct use of language to express exactly what one wanted to express, recognizing nuances, finding different ways to say things, etc
I think one of the tasks was also a piece of writing
I’ve only heard of (and participated in) the national conversational competition
Every level had a list of topics and a listening exam
It doesn't make sense here, as basically everything is pronounced the way it is written
Only time I saw it was on Simpsons
I know what it is, but it doesn't make sense in Czech
We have the same in czech, except with i/y, s/z, mě/mně,  je/ě.
by quick google it is episode 12 from season 3  but I don't remember anything from that so I am going to watch it again now
Yeah, diktát. Many fond memories
Especially placement of interpunction and weird rules for capital letters were my favorite
Not
- Head of state is elected just like in Russia, if in the first round no one gets 50+% two candidates with the most votes ascend to the second round
- head of Government is chosen by the president, it's most likely the leader of the winning party
Very stupidly
Ok now to be serious, we vote for parties, and the party that won (biggest percent of votes) or the one that forms a coalition, almost always, the leader of winning party becomes the PM
In case of coalitions, it's usually leader of the party that got most votes out of the ones in the coalition (usually the biggest one
President is voted, from 2013, by "popular vote". President than elects prime minister
Yea, but we dont have one president for one lifetime like Russians have
I would like to add, that President is elected for 5 years and can only be elected twice in a row
It's more complicated
In the case of our president, we have ordinary "people vote and the most votes win"
In the case of PM, our president basically names PM and this named PM must form big enough coalition to survive the vote of confidence
I believe the president has 2 attempts and then someone like the Speaker of Chambers of Deputies or the Speaker of Senate has an attempt after the president
Only by the lower house
But could be elected for another 2 terms after 1 term  pause
I mean, kinda
I got married recently and we got many, many questions when are we gonna have kids
From people at work, randoms who found out, family, friends that aren't that close to us and don't know that we both hate children, etc
We aren't ever planning to have kids, though, and our families don't take this seriously/don't believe us
They have stopped pushing the issue mostly, so that's good
Except for my husband's sister, who had a kid few months before our wedding
I know it doesn't exactly answer your question, but we got married pretty young, so we didn't have any of that "settle down" pressure on us, but now that we are married people are expecting we will reproduce and that kinda pisses me off because it's not their business
So I would say that I feel that pressure sometimes
I guess the joke is on them, though
Czech republic (summarizing various stereotypical viewpoints):
* **Prague:** Arrogant, self-important pricks, who think that they are something special because of money they have, they also do not understand real life
* **Brno:** Somewhat silly city with mentality of a big village, has huge inferiority complex in relation to Prague
Also, everybody in Brno speaks "hantec" (a local slang with German roots, popularized by some actors and local partiots)
* **Ostrava:** A grimdark (post)industrial city full of unemployed miners, everybody speaks in a funny, short-voweled dialect and is half Polish
* **Sudety:** A general term used for regions inhabited by Germans until the end of WW2
Sort of a backwater wilderness with harsh weather conditions, lots of unemployed people and ruins, local pub brawls can be pretty brutal, everybody has a dead German buried under his cottage
The town of Bruntál is sometimes considered to be a prime example of this stereotype
Also, everybody votes for communists and neonazis
* **Southern Bohemia:** Somewhat poetic land of level-headed and hard-headed farmers
* **Southern Moravia:** Land of jolly wine drinkers
Nobody does anything else than growing and drinking wine or walking around in traditional folk garbs
* **Haná (central Moravia):** Sort of a nice-to-live-in breadbasket countryside inhabited by slow thinking farmers
Slow does not have to mean stupid, more like reconsidering everything in almost entish manner
* **Valašsko (westernmost Carpathians):** Wild mountains with wolves and bears and long tradition of shepherdry
Everyone lives in the country, has a "valaška" (a long axe often associated with brigandry) and waves it wildly when dancing
Even more hard-headed people with lots of common sense, but unable to change their opinions
Vaslui what the fuck
Wow, we jihočeši got out the best of this
No wonder, with all the Praha-Brno, Morava-Praha, Ústí, Hradubice and Asia starts in Vysočina, pyčo, etc "conflicts" I have the feeling like nobody cares for Southern Bohemia (which isn't so bad)
Prague is pretty diverse itself
Life of someone living in Holešovice or Vinohrady will different from someone living in Velká Ohrada and the rest of Prague 13
Idk about the Sudety mate
Mostly industrial area here on Ústecko with low unemployment
But I agree with those dead Germans
We even buried some Germans in river hehe
V Českých Budějovicích by chtěl žít každý!
Yes, here are some of the stereotypes I have heard combined:
* **Historic Centre:** An ancient, picturesque and mysterious empty shell of a city, full of tourists and tourist scammers
* **Žižkov:**  The Republic of Žižkov", a bit rough, formerly proletarian (and proud of it) quarter, best pubs, but you have to dance between piles of dog shit to reach them
* **Vinohrady:** A hipster nest where upper class people like to buy flats if the center proves to be too crowded
Press "G" to gentrify
* **Dejvice:** 1/3 old underground/dissident musicians and writers who spend their days in stylish pubs, 1/3 higher ranks of former communist army, 1/3 Russian spies
* **Letná:** You probably live here if you work in PR or marketing and want to live in a peaceful neighborhood, where not everybody works in PR or marketing
* **Jižní město (The Southern City):** A grey, graffitti and crime infested hellhole where pensioners slowly crawl around old communist high-rise high-capacity buildings and further into oblivion
* **Outskirts in general:** Urban sprawl of former villages consumed by series of ugly family houses built en masse in the 1990s. People just sleep here in their mortgaged homes, then drive to the centre where they work
* **Karlín:** Something like Žižkov, but without the charm and pubs
Well Ostrava or Most would be more like Forge world
so praise the Omnissiah
Well, I was talking about stereotypes in general, including the mountainous areas and towns that were reliant on industry that did not survive global competition or got tuneled by old owners
I'm moving there in two weeks
Any places to avoid at night
Byl jste někdy v Budějovicích
This is cool, thank you for this
Also, I think The Southern City stereotype is valid for most panel housing estates in Prague
Pilsen not mentioned
Yay
It is mostly alright, the reputation is partly historical, partly exagreggated
Very nice praise the machine spirit bro
Cheers
For example, there is a book "Z tajností žižkovského podsvětí" from the 1930s that extensively parodies gangster pulp stories and uses this reputation for various comedic effects
The book was/is quite popular and sometimes is still quoted/referenced in local context
Not bad, I live pretty close to Polish and Slovakian borders, so we can go shopping there and we can watch Polish and Slovak TVs
Outside of that, pretty normal
It's not very uncommon but depends on your financial status too
Generally, people go to neighbouring countries for weekends quite a lot
But I'm from Czechia and it's very easy for us to go to another country since you can reach the borders in three hours from nearly anywhere
It's also very good for hitchhiking as you can experience lot of different countries in short amount of time
Pretty cool i'd say (if there's open borders and no corona of course)
And even if you have no car, train system got you covered, especially if you're student with ISIC card - student prices can be ridiculously cheap
As an artsy person, i sometimes just go and have a nice weekend in museums in Vienna, Berlin or Munich
Sometimes me and my friends go by car to further locations like Hungary, France, Italy or Croatia, but then again, the "long" distance trips are still pretty short sompared to US
Very nice
Pre-COVID restrictions, I travelled to another country at least once a year
Usually for vacation, but sometimes for different reasons - shopping, concerts, music festivals
For example four years ago I took a trip to Katowice (Poland) to see a movie in IMAX theater, because I really wanted to see it in that format and Prague's IMAX theater (the only one in Czech Republic) wasn't playing it anymore
It used to be common here too, but it somehow died out with the generation of my grandparents
That's žínka, pretty normal to see it in households
In the Czech Republic, it's called *Tuplák*. Which means literally "double". Although it is not really common
Most used is 0,5l beer
These are extremely common all around SE Asia
I believe most of the world uses only water
Pretty much all Africa and most of the Asia
Arabs use usually only water now, in the past it was often just sand
Holy shit, you think other countries don't have tea bags
Tea bags, of all things
Mate, you're hilarious
We do have them too
It's terrible, it gets stuck all the time
I think moka pots are relatively common all over the place because they're quite cheap and basically indestructible
You buy one for a camping trip or just out of curiosity about new ways to make coffe and then it kinda stays in your home forever
I bough one in college and when I later went home and mentioned it my mom fished out one we had at home even though no one there is a coffe drinker
It was probably older than me and just kinda existed there
That's [umami synergy]
They are absolutely common
I use cans handful of times a year, and at least half of them have pull tabs anyway
So yeah I also have only this kind of opener, although with a larger handle to be more comfortable to hold
If I used cans more regularly I would probably get a more modern one, but this takes minimal space and is good enough for the few times a year it's used
Germans have really good Minecraft servers
GommeHD
Rewinside
In Czechia se have QPlay and Survival Games but these are all country blocked for cz and sk only
**Cycling infrastructure
** It is almost non-existent
There is a lot of paths for recreational purposes but very little "useful" ones
When I look at bigger cities around the border of Czechia many of them have at least some sort of infrastructure
Public transport is alright but it doesn't go everywhere
edit: grammar
25€ deposits on cans and plastic bottles like they have in germany
I was about to write exactly this
I live in a relatively flat city yet there is absolutely no cycling infrastructure here and it drives me crazy
I would love to cycle to work but it's just not possible - I work at the other end of the city and cycling would mean I would have to cycle on very busy roads, alongside big trucks etc
To avoid busy roads I would have to use a different path that goes up a very steep hill (like one of the few in the city) and showering at work is not possible
Lot of the cities/areas with a good cycling infrastructure are flat, though
Czech cities can be relatively hilly, so unless you have the opportunity to shower at work/school, it's not that practical
I think that's the main reason why there's not much push for cycling paths
Cyclopaths in Brno and Jihlava are good
I can't imagine living without it
I mean if you just wipe, it's never a 100 % job
>the option to buy one pizza slice instead of an entire pizza, as in Denmark and - I imagine - many, many other places
What
You cannot buy just a single slice
I'm so jealous
If you don't try to beat the record, you can drive relatively effortlessly
If you would cycle for only 10-15 minutes, it would not be that exhausting
I would really like to see at least some change because the current network is just disappointing
Maybe I'm naive but I hope the party that wins the next parliamentary election could bring some change to this
Can't imagine using it either, i'd say this is not exactly a country specific thing
Once you go clean butt you never go back
You would have to revamp social dynamics to be like this
Most jobs in the Nordics are union protected, while in here unions are almost a swear word
Some retail workers would gladly get more money from weekend shifts however a lot of retail employers would often bully employees into taking weekends and late nights while forcing contractor agreements on them so they wouldn’t have to pay weekend and night shift bonuses
Work ethics, employee expectations and overall work-life balance of certain unsilled labour positions here is from the western point of view quite nightmarish
Makes sense now, you usually cannot buy just one slice of pizza from proper pizzerias here too
But you can get single slices in pizza stands (like [this] or [this] they look similar to kebab shops or there are combination of these that sell both pizza and kebab
I would prefer shops/stands that would sell more nutritious food though
Then this seems to be more of a problem of Romanian public healthcare rather than "free" healthcare in general being bad
Which is actually super against MasterCard’s and visa’s TOS
Yes
It makes construction and renovation very difficult cause you have to consult with a "bureau of conservating 12th century cobblestone imprints under 12 degree sunlight" kind of regulations when you want to paint your bathroom
The term old building has quite a different meaning in Europe
Old buildings were built centuries before the asbestos invention
It's a problem of rather newish buildings
I think it's still pretty common here
We have some asbestos at home and at our garden too, I think people don't really care much
That can afflict new construction in Europe as well
You are digging basement for you new family house and boom, bronze-age graveyard
True, but I guess u/mathess1 meant its application in construction
That's correct
I don't have any asbestos mine in my garden though
This argument is always going to be there when you only have a binary choice
Lot of Easter and Christmas traditions are disappearing
For example during the week before Easter Monday, children in villages used to go around village 3 times a day with noise making wooden things (řehtačky), and they used to sing religious song at several locations in the village (usually where cross or chapel is located)
During that week church bells are silent, there is saying ‘bells flew to Vatican’.
In Easter Sunday, children went to all houses in village, and they received treats and little cash for their ‘service’ in previous days
This is still alive in some villages, I’ve encountered it once in middle of nowhere village, and it felt alien
Religion
I don't know if it's a tradition to be religious, but Czech Republic is a country which has the greatest percentage of atheistic people in a country in the world
Honestly, fuck the Easter traditions
I used to dread Easter so much
Like, I'm supposed to get beaten with a switch AND drenched with water just because I'm a girl
Hell no
You Finns are hardcore
So are traditions relating to Masopust and Máje
This still happens every year in my Moravian village, I had no idea it was disappearing
I think it's lot more common in villages and small communities (not satelitní městečka) than we think, just because most people live in bigger towns and cities
But I will not miss pomlázka at all
I used to dread Easter because of it
So you have chosen death
Mysterious "diarrhea" every easter monday locking me on the toilet until noon for several years until my parents gave up forcing me to open the door just because boys and men from our village were dickheads
Oh childhood
I tend to be careful and slow on those roads, but I usually am more careful than the average joe here
There usually aren't that many people taking these kinds of roads, they tend to be more like shortcuts or paths to someone's garden you cannot access with a car from the front
Since mostly locals use them, the drivers are way nicer than on normal roads
When two cars meet and can't fit on the roads, you'll have to drive back or find a place to pull over
Then you usually get thanked by the driver
How is 80kmh even physically possible on that without rattling your brains out
As for a song everyone knows I would say something from Karel Gott
as for the second anthem I am not sure
I would choose symphonic poem Vltava (Moldau) by Bedřich Smetana
"In this piece, Smetana uses tone painting to evoke the sounds of the longest river in Czechia
My guess would be that he exists within some very leftist/activist circles
Normal people don't care about that kind of thing that much
Dejvice from dej více - give more
You will never find bigger cheapskates elsewhere
We would lose ourselves to the big countries again
That fear of being ordered around once again will always be there and it will always be the biggest argument against it
We would have sandpeople like germany, britain, france and sweden
Also we would not have ability to change monetary policy and end like greece and italy with unpayable debts
We would be minority under votes of france and germany
And that's why it's crazy and I treat federalists like extremists
I do honestly believe that, my fellow european
While the citizens of the big countries are afraid that they'd have to help the smaller countries, they so happen to be, mostly, the citizens of countries that received outside help in the form of the Marshall plan during their post-war reconstruction, something that most of the "smaller countries", which also so happen to mostly be from the ex-socialist bloc, had no actual possibility of using those funds for their own reconstruction at the time due to political reasons
I simply have a problem with the fact that our existence would be watered down from an independent country where it's citizens can rule themselves into some backwater province that would get ordered around ybt eh big countries whose citizens believe us to be nothing more than just second grade citizens
Jeez, would this meme about us being some gun-loving nation just go away
Just because we have relatively lenient gun laws does not mean that it's completely normal to carry weapons, the vast majority of people don't carry any guns, people who do carry guns are like 3% of the overall population
Quick googling tells you that it's some 1
8 % in Germany, it's not really such a huge difference
My issue is that here on reddit, there are several Czech redditors who are gun enthusiasts, which is fine, but please don't pretend like it's totally the norm here
The vast majority of people don't give a crap about guns, this is a safe country afterall, so you don't really need to have a gun
It's not about whether the state protects you or who protects you, it's that most people don't exactly feel the need for protection
Germany's National Gun Registry, introduced at the end of 2012, counted 5
5 million firearms in use, which are legally owned by 1
4 million people in the country
And German population is some 82 milion people
It's only matter of time management and self organization imo (and maybe bit of just how much your work sucks)
Although, I think I'm not exactly *average case*, I manage to work regular full time (8h/day), commute (40min/day), enjoy my many hobbies (if anything, my number one first world problem is managing all of my hobbies), eat 3 meals a day (although breakfast is usually something quick lice cereal), cook regularly (prepare a proper meal for at lest 3-4 days of the work week on Sunday; if I don't it's mostly just matter of laziness) and sleep somewhat ok (usually around 6-7 hours)
But as I said, probably not a norm, since I don't have a family, nor a girlfriend to pay attention to
I mean there diffinetelly is
I'm just not respecting it
I guess breakfast is between 6:30 and 8:00, lunch is between 12:00 and 13:00 and dinner is between 17:00 and 18:00
I'd say it depends on the job/school we're talking about
Employees in warehouses and industry will have different day schedule than office workers or students
For lunch 30 minute break is mandatory, but many people will take more time, often over an hour, if their employer allows it
People will either bring their own food from home or will go to a canteen or restaurant
Most restaurants offer "menu" a choice of three or four meals available at lunch time
This is prepared in advance so you get it very quickly and it is cheaper than regular meals
With sleeping it is very individual and depends on how much of your free time are you willing to spend sleeping and when do you need to get up
I usually sleep like 8-9 hours even when I have to wake up at 6AM
I’m not sure if it’s just local or if other countries have it as well, but we have this “last ringing” tradition
When kids are in the year before high school graduation - so the last year at the school for them
They announce one day where the last ringing takes place
That day from early morning they go berserk on the rest of the school and wreak havoc
They usually paint all over other students and the school building (which they must clean up afterwards tho), wet them and interrupt classes to draw more
Anything that doesn’t harm anyone or is permanent is allowed
This is connected with another tradition which is more of a ceremony where the last year students initiate the penultimate year students
They usually make them promise something and put up a great act (I’ve seen one year where they acted as if they are a judge and jury) and when they promise, they have to eat something gross
Sometimes it’s stuff like olives, but sometimes it can be a health hazard - like cube of yeast
So it's free-for-all
Yeah it's basically a costume party where the graduating students make the entire school smell like vinegar and then walk around their town, making a lot of noise and asking people for money
I've seen something similar in Poland
However, I didn't ask them so I am not sure if it's the same thing
Oh yea
I completely forgot the asking for money thing
Most foreign is Karlovy Vary (Carlsbad), it looks like most of Eastern Europe countries and there are even orthodox churches
And most typical
maybe Olomouc/Brno or some other big city
I dunno if i'm the only one, but the most foreign one to me is probably Český Krumlov, one of the most touristy places in ČR aside Prague
About 2 million (at least according to some website i've found) tourists visit it every year, especially Koreans and Chinese for some reason and the town centre is basically made for tourists [and out of tourists
Honorable mention: Karlovy vary - so many Russians live here, [half of any text you can read in the city is in алфавит.] It's weird, but in a differrent way than Český Krumlov
For typical one
Prague and Brno, and even tho especially Prague has some problems with tourism, it still has it's own character only known for locals
Is it a North Limburg thing or also a North Brabant thing
Would somewhere like Breda also be quite Belgian-feeling
Just realised corona exists, so the over-tourism is not really an issue right now, haha
I meant the architecture, most of it was built by Russians for Russians in 19
century
Yeah, it doesn't look Eastern European in my experience, either
There is a bunch of orthodox churches, but that's it
Otherwise it has a very Central European look
But since there is a pretty strong Russian community there, you'll see a lot of writing in Cyrillic in many places and in the touristy part you'll hear Russian more often than Czech
Even German seemed more common than Czech, actually
Because sometimes you just want to inflict pain on your European neighbours and luckily for you, Czech allows you to do just that:
Blb vlk pln žbrnd zdrhl hrd z mlh Brd skrz vrch Smrk v čtvrť srn Krč.
A perfectly valid sentence
Well the answer is obviously Czech
Why
Because it's a language for every budget
If you'd like to save money, you can buy only consonants for your typing machine and get by with sentences such as "[Strč prst skrz krk
] On the other hand if you'd like to have a lavish lifestyle you can have all 42 letters of [Czech Alphabet] including the luxurious *ě š ř ž ý á í ů*!
On the more serious note - Czech is quite complicated (7 cases, you have to memorise rules for correctly writing i/y, other rules for writing capital letters,...) - I think that if people would know more how complicated Czech language is, they would be even happier with the fact that we are using way more easier English to get by
:-)
Honestly I would objectively vote for Bulgarian
If it wasn't for the Cyrillic, it's the easiest language to follow as both grammar and writing is quite easy
Make it happen
I can't wait to finally insult someone's mother's uncle's birth village bakery after they cut me on a corner road
Seriously, you put so much beauty and thought to insults
I dig it
I too, curse your bloodline
And everybody say with me: "ZMRZLINA"!
Hahaha mate
Check my flag and then do know
Delicious example of  a wovel-impaired word
:) I commend you for your choices, but the best ice cream I have ever had was a strawbery one in Hungary
That sounds like a very suspicious context hahaha
Communism
I wouldn't say entering the war a mistake
It's the launching of 11 identical offensives and fail every time that sounds like a mistake
cold 0 and less
chilly 0-15
nice 15-20
warm 20-30
hot 30+
cold - up to 13
chilly - 14-20
perfect - 21-24
hot - 25+
I would just change
<-8/-5c freezing
-4/5c cold
5/15 chilly
and my hot extends to 35, after that it's too hot
I lived in northern Finland for some time and it didn't feel as dark as you might expect, because the snow reflects a lot of light, so even during full polar night you could see during the day
People just carry on like normal, towns are safe, outdoor sport facilities have sufficient light sources or you use headlights
Many people add extra light sources on their cars too
Overall lights are everywhere and the nighttime feels kinda romantic
But I'd probably view it differently if I lived there all my life, to be fair
50,39°. Existence is a fucking pain, the Sun sets at 15:52
I guess that time, when group of peasants led by a one eyed and later blind guy defeated several crussades and attacking knights and soldiers were even afraid of their singing
Also, probably not a plot hole, but 30 year war started in Prague, with Battle of White Mountain, where protestant armies (and bunch of mercenaries) were fighting against Austrian emperor and ended again in Prague, where those same protestants were fighting for Austrian emperor against Protestant Swedes
8th century
Close to zero written evidence, only some archaeological records
Battle of the White Mountain definitely did not start the Thirty Years War since it happened 2 years into the conflict (1620, war started in 1618)
I remember reading somewhere that the name is considered to be very ancient and probably of non-Slavic origin
Yeah, you're right, defenestration was in 1618
The average life expectancy is that low because children's death were very common
Once you make it into adulthood you could live a long life
No history we are aware of
There's a written evidence of the [battle of Wogastisburg] in 631 and then about the Charlemagne's campaign against Bohemia in 805 ([siege of Canburg]
I got the experience from the other side - once I was in U-Bahn in Germany talking to friends in Czech and a German came by and said "Strč prst skrz krk" - which is the most famous and super hard Czech tongue twister
:-D
Warms ma heart
Lovely, do you find the ř sound difficult
:-)
Cool, I appreciate that you are trying
I am sure it is going you well :) Do you have a Czech heritage or are you just interested in Czech culture
Personally I really like Valencia’s and the Barca logo too
For our country, that would be [Gutalax] [for] [sure]
I'm giving non religiousness
Let's not actually, that is that counterbalance, right there
It is, but never saw someone enforcing it
But one of my friends was fined for jaywalking in Austria
It's if there's no crossing within 50m
We actually got stopped once for crossing a on a red
Police stopped us, but it was like 2am so we talked them out of the fine and a friend who crossed first had to buy us mcdonalds
I don't know if there's a direct translation, to be honest I don't even know how I would  say "entitled" in the sense of a personal charasteristics in Czech
The closest words we've got which we would probably use in this situation is *fakan* or *spratek* which mean a bratty child in general
Though in my family, much to my friends' amusement, we use the word "fakan" neutrally to mean just "child".
Mamánek maybe
Museums related to things I completely don't care about and almost any "modern" private museum of any nonsense like museum of Lego which makes no sense in Prague downtown and not in Denmark
There's the Black tower, dominant of the city with nice view
I lived two streets from it, now 10 minutes by foot but I've never been there, simply never cared to go there
Or I go around the regional history and culture museum every day (before covid) and still don't know what is inside
To be honest, I visited a lot of tourist sites but only as a prt of trip with the goal to go to touritst sites, and none was in this city
I like to go around the buildings, look at them but don't really wish to go inside outside of vacations
I live in the western Czech Republic
There are like 5 castles less than an hour away (be it car or train)
Only been to one of them
We also have catacombs, one of what, 4
in the entire country
Black Tower
Is it České Budějovice
There is also one in Klatovy
Now that I think about it, the centers of those two towns are very similar, just Budějovice is much, much larger
Yes
The only tourist site here I visited is probably Budvar many years ago (and I don't even like beer)
Lol, most countries around Germany seem to have an identical system, just translated
We do, but we were germanised for a long time, so normally we say Dvacet jedna (twenty one) but you can say jedna dvacet as well
We did count as Germans, but in 19
century when we had our Czech revival, we changed it back to the classic counting, but people (mostly old people) still use it while talking
It is similiar to German though, “jednadvacet” is pretty much directly translated from German: “einundzwanzig,” where, if you are describing a double digit number, you first write the number, that you would write second if you wrote numerally
It is also written as one word, same as German and with bigger numbers like: “dvaadvacet,” you also write the word for “and” -> “a” in Czech
This is not the common way to write numbers in Czech, though, some people still say that way and on some occasions you may use it
So yeah, it is pretty germanised
Excuse me for any inconsistencies or missclick, I am writing this on the phone
Yeah
It is the same thing, just translated word for word
We are closer to Germans than Russia lol
I meant more by culture, but yeah
Though we do have a *lot* of words we took from German
Damn you Swiss people, you always need to have everything
Mountains, money, cheese, sense of humor
Meanwhile we cling on to our beer for dear life, because that's all we have going on :(.
Isn't that the case everywhere
AFAIK, employers simply want capable people, who can learn and solve problems
Whether or not you have a degree doesn't matter a lot, that's something important only for you
Hey, out of curiosity, do you think that a high number of graduates from the arts and such is a factor in the relatively high unemployment of young people in Spain
I have no statistics at hand, but I feel like I know quite a lot of Spaniards, but none of them are in the STEM fields
I wouldn't worry about it
I did my studies in Biochemistry and Computer Science
The first one on a good university, the second one on an okay university
And yet, I am a much better software developer than I ever was a biochemist, because I had a lot more passion and interest for CS, did an internship during my studies and spent time learning things on my own
It's all about how much you take from it
I find that the university is only there to give you a basic idea about a lot of things, but to be good at them, you have to use your own initiative
[Mushroom picking
] Though I'm sure it's not unheard of in Western Europe, going out into the forests and picking up shrooms for hours with the whole family is something that's often seen as a curiosity by outsiders
Little children drill the kinds you can pick and the kinds you can't even touch
Even those people who don't eat mushrooms will go out and scavenge
You have regular news reports in summer and autumn about the state of forests and humidity, record finds, favourite spots
To be honest the smell of the mushrooms drying is something that disgusts me for a whole month after one stops collecting, because in a normal apartment, there's nowhere you can leave them
People even start gifting them out when there's far too much to eat or bear the smell, and then it becomes another persons problem
But you don't just throw them out, [never
] (pic's not mine, I was just lazy to go into the cupboard)
Burning the witches on April 30th
Also visiting girls with a willow stick (pomlázka) on Easter Monday
Beating girls with sticks and getting sweets seems unique
We mostly don't do that either
At least I learned about all them with -us and -os as such
On the other hand, it's worth it when a few months later you open the jar and throw a handful into bramboračka
TF less than 10 cents
Lucky
If I want decent rohlík and not the rubbery trash from the supermarket, it's at least 10 cents in conversion
No rohlík for 50 halířů anymore
Are saunas popular in Russia
In a aquapark here, there is a Russian Sauna World, is it just a tourist ploy
Or you really have saunas in wooden cabins outside
I think it is popular in the former Soviet world, because of the lack of food
The west could just buy mushrooms
I do have the need and I am sad it is so expensive to have a sauna
We have it too at home
I never new why, it was just one of the things that just are
somehow knowing what is the day doesn't make my shit anyhow better
Not because Hitler said so
There were % of nazis in Austria than Germany
In fact the anschluss was peaceful because 99
8% of austrians voted for joining the Reich
Well yeah, it wasn’t 100% fair, but sadly vast majority of czechoslovaks still wanted communists in charge
Actually no, in 1946 KSČ only got around 40%, so it was only a plurality and not a majority
Still, it was enough for a coup
>including female animals
How do they enforce that
Does it include wild animals
Northern Hungary joke didn't disappoint
Depends, if only the empire was reunited, it would not directly affect us, since we weren't a part of it
Apart from the fact that it would mean that there is a big and probably very unstable country in the Western Europe that we would have to somehow deal with
If the rest of Europe was restored to the 1812 conditions as well, then we would be back under the rule of the Habsburg monarchy, so I guess we would have our own issues to worry about
The Habsburg monarchy would probably be allied with the French empire for the time being while waiting to stab in the back at a convenient moment
I'd be on the frontlines with a bohemian regiment of the imperial army
Are you afraid to find out, at this point
Oooh yeah, with plums (the most classic here), strawberries, blueberries
but our cuisines are very similar and we took a lot of the dishes
But while we also make this topping, more used is butter, curd, sometimes poppy and sugar
I love fruit dumplings and other sweet main dishes, such a comfort food
I mean, Czech and Austrian cuisine are probably very similar
my French partner is always kinda horrified when I go on about my love of fruit dumplings :D
We don't usually serve them with breadcrumbs, although some people do
My toppings of choice are always some combination of melted butter, sugar, cacao, and/or grated high-fat quark
Our fruit dumplings come in 2 types of dough, either quark or yeasted dough
Potato-based ones go only with poppyseed filling or topping (*šišky s mákem*)
Now I need blueberry ones :(
Come on blueberries,grow
You small
Sure they are, though we mostly use quark or yeast dough
Our fruit dumplings could be also filled with blueberries, strawberries, or plums (my grandma made plum dumplings using potato dough)
My other grandma sometimes made apple dumplings (using quark dough)
Also had a huge dumpling filled with poppy and vanilla sauce, it was called an Alpine Dumpling
I don't know why but I hate sweet pierogi
I've seen varenyky with fruit fillings (cherries I think
) advertised as Ukrainian food here, are those not traditional
I've never heard of them
Found a few recipes online, but they all mention that it's a Slovak dish
The ingredients look basically the same as our yeast dumplings (*ovocné kynuté knedlíky*), except that they're steamed instead of boiled in water
yep, we call them "pěry" in south moravia
My grandma did it commonly both ways, boiled and steamed, I think steamed are also pretty common
Those are quite confusing terms to me, I thought that varenyky was the Ukrainian term and pelmeni Russian for a very similar dish
I hope I didn't just offend anyone :D (Also my grandma comes from Ukraine and calls them pelmeni, so IDK
You're giving me dangerous ideas
Combining fruit dumplings with the vanilla sauce from *buchtičky s krémem*? Sounds like a winner to me
Here's a recipe that sounds pretty classic to me -  (replacing the pits with sugar cubes is one part of the recipe I've never seen in Czechia, my grandma just leaves the pits in, but this sounds like a better idea)
This is a potato version -  but potato dough goes better with savory stuff, IMO, which can also mean stuffed dumplings -
But that's like potato mash from a box
Making either kind of dough from scratch is worth it, I promise
Make a big batch and freeze them
Although I do pity people who can't get any fruit dumplings in restaurants
Ah, OK, that wasn't so complicated after all
Thanks
Yeah we do, but not with sour cream, that's an interesting combo
Döner is the safe late night choice here as well and I'm not complaining
Or, if there is the option, a rotisserie chicken or a klobása  though most of these places close rather early so you gotta know where to go
Always bramborák/kartoffelpuffer
[Prague Castle] comes to mind first
I don't know if it counts because it is a complex of multiple buildings
It is a defining part of Prague's panorama and instantly recognizable all around the world
The Prague Castle
The Charles Bridge
Prague Astronomical Clock
These are the most well known and instantly recognizable monuments of Prague
There are many more outside of Prague but these ones I named are just unmistakable
I'd say the Prague Castle, but that's not a single building
Then probably the St
Vitus Cathedral in Prague - a part of the Prague Castle
not technically a building but the "brněnský čurák"
If that photo included Charles Bridge, I would agree 100%
brněnský čurák?
Yes, I was also considering the clock, but the castle's history is over half of millennia longer
most people I can see are using some kind of trek/mountain bike
Makes a perfect sense to me
Prague is not just nice asphalt paths, especially if you need to cross downtown areas, these "dutch" style heavy city bicycles, with couple of gears if ever are not really handy too considering the difference between highest and lowest point in Prague is more than in whole Denmark and about whole Netherlands
In general commuting in Prague is not really a thing  unless you have it close and flat, you don't mind taking 3x longer route due to terrain, you are fit enough to handle terrain,  you don't mind weather will be often against you and you don't shit yourself cycling in traffic
One of our most famous hockey players (Jaromír Jágr) got booee by the public for staring in an electric bike ad
I am more a cat person, but certainly can enjoy raw steak tartare or something similar
But eating raw meat is certainly not just an European trait, what differs is the kind of meat that is culturally considered edible uncooked, for example consider the popularity of raw fish in Japan or beef in some countries of Southeastern Asia
Who the fuck eats raw meat
Except sushi/salmon I strongly agree
Example of this ignorance
Hej hej tatarák je chutná božsky
I think I could make that from head
But normal everyday people dont know this
Why should they
Well you dont use it in everyday life
You tend to forget
I read about a lot of stuff but memorizing African countries, which some hardly contribute to world economics or events, isnt that high on my importance list
I think history and how things work (physics, biology and chemistry) to be more valuable
Sure geography too but you dont really have to know much about Kazakhstan or west/central Africa
I guess you have different view on it
After all Senegal and other countries were your colonies, etc
nope but been in abandoned and unfinished nuclear power plant at Kazantyp
Well, let’s see:
5th Century - 1526
1918 - 1939
1945 - present
( I count Czechoslovakia as our country being free)
1918 - 1939 ( thanks Allies )
1945 - 1949 ( communists took over )
1989 ( Democrats take over ) - 1993 ( the divide of Czechoslovakia )
1993 - onwards as the Czech republic
London
It's an amazing city in terms of things to see and do, but I found the spatial planning horrendous
It feels extremely cramped and there's nowhere to move
More of it should be pedestrianised
In Czechia the barkeep wouldnt care, and he would likely ask if you want Griotka (Cherry  flavour liquor),  Egg nog or Zelená ('The Green', liquor with appearance and taste of mint mouthwash)
These are the cheapest options, all very sweet and not much strong
When starting grammar school the teacher mentioned
- Sumer
- Assyria, Babylon
- Persia (not much)
- Celtic and Germanic people (living in the areas of our country)
- various ancient civilisations in Anatolia (Phrygia, the Hittites, Lydia)
- Egypt
- Greece
- Rome
- ancient India and China (in about 2 lessons so)
We were teaching a bit about Mesopotamia, Hittites, more about Egypt, even more about Greece and Rome and also something about Germans and Celts, because they lived here
Like in the English word huh
And it's easy to differentiate because "a" is a vowel and "h" is not
(And they sound different)
it's like if you said huh but without the uh, or like a minecraft villager noise but shorter
It's exactly the same in Czech
Vatican, because I am too fat to fit in there
Never consider
None
However, UK is the least appealing to me
Monaco, though the F1 GP is extremely tempting
More like, why yes
What's there to see
Also world's top source of disappointed tourists
Be specific
Just because it's popular does not mean it's worth it
Tourists are just a herd
"*Tramtárie*". It's either a corruption of the word "*Tatárie"*/ "*Tartárie*" ("the land of Tatars") or just a meanigless onomatopoetic word, possibly connected with a sound of a fanfare ("*tramtarará*")
Imaginary-Tramtárie-Tramtaria
Also "prdel světa" meaning "ass of the world"
can't remember exact words as it is years ago but it was something like Imagine how this place would look if we didn't jumped into war
(probably WW2), from American, in Prague
we have same thing, usually these two weeks when there is a final exam for oldest ones
Some schools like restaurant&hotel industry related have this as a part of regular schedule for whole year
As far as guns go, Czech republic is the second most liberalised gun country in the world after (certain States of) the US
Here you can own semi automatic (and under very strict conditions even automatic) firearms for self defence purposes and you can conceal carry up to 2 semi automatic handguns provided you stay away from places that don't allow them (malls, schools etc)
There are about 300 000 such permits and under some estimates, even up to 7% of households have a self defence gun permit
Lately, the right to defend one's life and health with a firearm has been added to charter of fundamental human rights
And we're I believe the only country in Europe with a shall-issue gun permit
Meaning if you don't get it, the burden of proof why not is on the administration and they are not free to deny you without grounds
As far as laws for actual self defence (and use of aforementioned firearms in our case), it is similar to other countries in Europe
You have instances of necessity and immediate self-defence
It's definetely not a castle doctrine and in all instances must be strictly proportionate to the danger and it must be a last resort
I wouldn’t say Czech law is similar as American one
The proportionality of attack is crucial
I would mention the case when a man caught robbers in his barn
They started to run, and he fired with crossbow, killed one of them, and got to jail
Also numbers of guns aren’t comparable
Isn’t it like 5% of people owning the gun
The right to own you talk about, it is a new thing, that populists added few years back to make very small and very loud minority happy
It was response to paneuropean law banning extended ammunition clips and other stuff, that has no reason to be owned by civilians
Well, it has a lot to do with how many people actually own a gun
In US (where a gun violence has always been crazy high), it's probably pretty common for most households to have at least one
On the other hand, most Czech people don't want to own a gun, even though we can
(And personally I'm really grateful it's that way
We have *Městská policie* (City/town police) and *Státní policie* (Country police)
Town police operates in their own town, or sometimes, when asked, can help a neighbouring town
The country police can and does operate everywhere
Country police has much more rights and is the "important" one, they handle more important/bigger crimes, while the town police does a small things for the town (patrols, helping children to cross the street infront of the school etc)
We also have military police, but it has entirely different meaning
It is a police force inside the army (although still part of the police force)
It protects property operated by the Ministry of Defence
No, military police is rarely involved in civil issues
Such a thing would raise a lot of eyebrows why is military budget used to supply police work
State police might be a better translation
Czechoslovakia used to have *četnictvo* rural military police similar to the gendarmerie but it got integrated after WW2
> "important" one
I think měšťáci would disagree with this classification :D
I originally wanted to write state police, but then I changed it, because it might get someone confused, states sometimes mean a region of a country, not a country itself (in USA or Germany for example)
I knew *četnictvo* existed, but I wasn't sure what was its job, because I wasn't born yet, when it existed
Yeah, that's why I put it in inverted commas, just in case :D
The word “robot” was first used in the 1920 play “R.U.R.” by Karel Čapek (though the word was invented by his brother Josef Čapek)
It was basically a play about automatons talking over society
He needed a name for them and his brother delivered
At first it didn’t really seen like it, but when I think about, the word “robot” is totally a czech word
It comes from the term “robota” which means forced labour (or just labour), but it’s hardly ever used today
Nowadays, the word is used worldwide, but I think that not enough people know of it’s origins
> which means forced labour
I believe the English (or rather French, but used in English) term is corvée.
In czech ,,kolo" means wheel and circle is ,,kruh" but dimunitive for ,,kolo" (kolečko) can also mean circle
okruzhnist (geometry) is kružnice in Czech
also, neděle means both Sunday and week in Czech (but the „week“ meaning is much less used, it's more like oldfashioned but the meaning is preserved)
You do not learn any world history before USA came to be
:-)
We did, although not very in-depth, but there was some prehistory, Greece, Rome, then focus shifted to early local history (Great Moravia), then to medieval Czech rulers and their shenanigans, a quick look at world events when America was discovered, Renaissance, 30 yrs war, Habsburgs, French revolution, Napoleon, WW1 and then there was usually not enough time to finish the plan, so we got some lessons on WW2 and that was it, more or less
However, there were also separate lessons on history of literature that complemented the history lessons, especially in culturally important periods
I was in an elementary school at the turn of 1980s/1990s, high school until 1999, so there was some shift from pro-communist version of history towards a more balanced approach during my curriculum, but the old communist (or even Austro-Hungarian) approach to history as a sequence of important rulers and events that leads to social progress was still lingering around in the 1990
In a retrospect, when I remember school history lessons, medieval ages mostly come to mind, with all the easily examinable but memory-heavy stuff like who was whose son, when did a war take a place and so on
It's 9+4 years of having history lessons, both world history and national
Somehow the last 70 years get as much attention as fucking 30 Years War
We oversimplify the most important bits
yes, if two monarchs marry each other, and the produce an heir
The heir will inherit both countries
So the our system is:
Compulsory education is now 9 years (was 10 when I was in school) and is usually completely covered by primary education with elementary schools for 9 years
Complete secondary education which is necessary for universities takes at least 4 years so people starting with universities at age 19-20
I started at 18, but that's only because I started elementary school at 5, born in November
19 is usual
But if I studied "učiliště" (for practical teaching of trades, only 3 years, you don't do maturita and don't get highschool diploma, only "výuční list" and you can't go to uni with that), I'd end it at 17
Or even sooner, there are some programs for only 2 years but that's mostly for people who really can't manage more education
Some generation ago it was even common because they had only 8 years of "základní škola" (elementary + middle school), but we have 9 for some time now
And the ending of uni is different, depends on the program
Bc is 3 years, magister is either bc + 2 years or 5 years in a row, medics have 6 years instead and you can also study bit longer, I had 6 years instead of 5 because of half a year pause
You probably know but anyway
I would add that the the standard age for entering school is 6, but 7 is common too
5 is allowed in special cases, but rare
The children must pass a specialist examination if the parents want them to enter school earlier or later
My town, called Trutnov, has been named after a knight, called Trut, who has defeated a dragon, living in a nearby cave
The story goes something like this:
Two lumberjacks have heard a raven going crazy, when they decided to investigate they found a dragon sleeping in a cave
The lumberjacks ran in to the town to alert a knight Trut (full name: Albrecht from Trautenberg)
He, with help of the towns folk, set up a trap and killed the dragon
The dragon was skinned and its skin filled with wooden chips
Later gifted to the city of Brno (second largest city in Czechia)
Where he is still to this day
Every year there's a small festival celebrating this story
Towns coat of arms:
The "dragon" (in Brno)
Most common theory is that it comes from word describing forest removal with fire, that happened here during early middle age
Modern word for roasting have the same origin
Its called Protivín, adjective “protivný” means something like hateful, but the name originated from a Duke Protiva, who was the first mayor of the city
My birth town is named after smoke, because when my country was founded
A friend of the founder lit up a fire to form a smoke signal, that alerted the founder of him finding a better place in my country than the founder found
You mean Czechia
I feel like correcting it because it looks like Chechnya
And I've never heard of the legend that they met again
That's interesting
I never heard this version of the legend
In Brno the legend says it lived by Svratka river and was killed by butcher aprentice
Man learns something new every day
Yes
When I visited Brno, I remmeber being like: „What the hell
“ there was no mention of our towns generous gift
Guess stories change through time
Maybe you could remember that Czechia is called Czechy in Polish (according to Wikipedia at least) so you only change the "y" into "ia".
But to be honest, it seems to me that Czechs still prefer Czech Republic to Czechia
My grandma always said it like *vrrrrba, vrrrrba* (which means "willow") so I do it this way too but she was a Slovak so I don't know if it's the Czech way or the Slovak way or whether she made it up
Otherwise I have never heard anyone making the sound, maybe it's the same way as we express growling: *vrrrrr*?
I think we just imitate the sound and don't use a word for it
The act itself is called předení (spinning a string)
Mňau same pronunciation as English
Yeah
I think that we use it with "v" like in growling, but truth is that I have never heard it to
we usualy say that the cat "přede".
I don't think we have a word for it the sound itself, though if I had to make it, I would also say "vrrrrr". The act of purring is called "vrnět" after all
Charles University
Charles University in Prague and Masaryk University in Brno as a whole, but there are also very high quality specialist schools like engineering ČVUT and VUT or chemical VŠCHT
Charles University
Founded in 1348
Čvut & MatFyz
Can confirm, I had classes when I was the only Czech in the room
Ehm, I mean yeah you’re not wrong
\+ Czech technical university (ČVUT)  in Prague
In Slavic mythology, vodyanoy, vodyanoi, vodník, wodnik, hastrman or Wassermann is a male water spirit often depicted as a frog man or a little green man in green suit
He was lurking in sweet water waiting to drown people and steal their soul
He would keep them in small porcelain cup
Do you have something similar in southern Europe
Maybe living in salt water on the coast
Beside mermaids
Vodníks in Čtvrtek's tales didn't drown anyone and help heroes and punish villains
And Čochtan in Werich's Fimfarum was against drowning at general, because it is pollution
There are some stories like this too, the most known is Vodník in the Kytice compilation from K. J. Erben
It's horror poem about a girl not being careful enough, being kidnapped by vodník into the lake, him marrying her and having child with her
Then she pleaded to visit her mother, so he let her, but the mother didn't want to let her go back - and when the vodník came for her, saying she needs to go back "home", the baby needs to eat and what not and the mother kept sending him away, he left and let the decapitated baby by their door
But the man luring people into the water, drowning them and storing their souls is more known
So no tales or fables or anything like that is common anymore
Because in Czech Republic we have lots of books and movies about that kind of creatures
Mostly for children and is a really big part of our culture
Fresh or spring water
Water which is not salty
Its direct translation from my language and I didnt even realize it
this guy plays EU4
Yes, that checks out
Both are thumbs but the toe is called feet thumb
Or better, thumb beside feet
Anything involving high speed chases
There is no way the cars would survive Czech highways at such speeds
Cops in car cautiously stopping another car
In US police procedurals tracking down a suspect often hinges on having their social security number
We have a citizen registry - the government knows where you live (or where you say you do)
Shockingly its still the case in many rural areas of Sjælland not far from Copenhagen
Act causually and switch to garlic diet
On YouTube, there are a plenty of real-life chases posted by Czech police forces
In lots of them the car crashes in the end though
Because you're not as different as you think you are
If one person said the food is bad, it might be anything; if one hundred people said the food is bad, you'd better believe it's bad
We've got Literary Czech (*spisovná čeština*) which is meant to be used *when writing* and ideally when speaking in a formal setting but I wouldn't call it a typical dialect because it doesn't really naturally occur anywhere, it's a variant of Czech based on the 16th century Western Moravian dialects and then polished by national revivalists in the 19th century into the current form
There are regions in Western Moravia which speak closely to it but they still sometimes differ in regional expressions and pronunciation
Typically reporters in public television or radio speak Standard Czech (those in private ones not so much), teachers are sorta supposed to speak it and correct children to use it, and if you want to be polite, you'll use it when contacting authorities, being at a job interview or other formal situations, for example when I consult something with a teacher at university I speak normally in my rather thick Prague accent but when I am examined by the very same teacher I try to speak in Standard Czech though I'm not always successful
It's also the variant of language foreigners will likely learn so if you want to make yourself more comprehensible, you'll speak slowly and switch to Standard Czech
Then there's Colloquial Czech (*hovorová čeština*) which is a spoken variant of Literary Czech meant to be used in conversations, and is a bit less formal, with words altered for easier pronunciation and more open to influence of vernacular dialects
These two are however still standardised
The most widespread dialect on the other hand is Common Czech (*obecná čeština*), an interdialect based on Central Bohemian dialects which evolved more or less separatedly and which gradually replaces regional dialects
You may most commonly encounter it when speaking with others in a normal setting or in media (films, series, etc
People living in Prague and other big cities, even when coming from areas where other dialects are spoken, often eventually adopt this one, same us foreigners who live among Czechs
Totally, even the people from the capital have their dialect and others cannot stand it
Honestly as I am person from east-mid Moravia the thing u call Common Czech (obecná čeština) is something that tears my ears every time I hear it even on TV, radios etc
It is something really disgusting
>hen speaking with others in a normal setting or in media (films, series, etc
People living in Prag
Sure thing
What i dislike about Common Czech is it simplification of inflection, lets take an adjective "malý (small/little)" with a various substantives for example
It is also important to say that Czech Language distinguishes 3 genders (masculine, feminine and neutral)
Let's start with expresion "little dog". Word dog has a masculine gender in czech and in correct form we can traslate it as "mal(ý) pes", in common czech people would say something like "mal(ej) pes" the ending "ej" just doesn't sound right
Another problem is with endings in the plural form of adjectives
Usually correct endings for plural adjectives are "í/é" for masculine, "é" for feminine and "á" for neutral, but in common czech people would use ending "ý" for every plural adjective
Masculine: mal(í) hadi (little snakes) - > mal(ý) hadi
Feminine: mal(é) kočky (little cats) -> mal(ý) kočky
Neutral: mal(á) auta (little cars) -> mal(ý) auta
I can go on with another examples but i can't procrastinate any longer :D if you wish to know more than you can go to wiki: [ where is way more info and better described than what i can give you here
What should be the same in the whole EU but is not yet
For example, I think there shoul be one policy for daytime running lights
I think every country has it's own rules now
Gay marriage should be **legal** across the EU
Disability card
Currently, the pan-EU disability card has been only implemented in 8 countries
Even sadder is that it's countries' decision
Czech Republic decided not to join, so Czech citizens don't get benefits abroad -- but foreign citizens don't get benefits in Czech Republic
Maybe a little bit of money has been saved, in expense of disabled people
When you are driving in CZ your lights have to be on all the time (during the day, during the summer, etc)
In Germany you only have lights on during night /dark
Yes, but only on dividends
I love the way Estonia handles corporate taxes and such a system should be completely valid
No, I don't think we will
In EU for 15 years and EU don't really care, because there were written like "eventually" so we didn't do anything wrong yet
Minimum wage is just ban of work and you have to be on welfare if you want to live
Disgusting leeches
Why Switzerland doesnt have minimum wage
Modern cars with small LED lights are not consuming so much electricity
But I hate when I look at my rear mirror and can't tell if that car is parked or driving
When you are driving in CZ your lights have to be on all the time (during the day, during the summer, etc)
In Germany you only have lights on during night /dark
I feel like it's better this way
Cars are more visible in traffic mirrors and there's a clear distinction between which car is moving/operating and which isn't. I live in an area with a lot of unclear intersections, some of which use multiple mirrors, and cars with unlit headlights are basically invisible in them up until the last moment due to the terrain etc
, that law is a blessing
Except it will not
Lev is pegged to euro (strictly pegged to the currency board)
We are obligated to eventually adopt euro once we meet those conditions, but are we gonna
Nope
That's the point of eventually, we have all the time in the world to do it and by the time, EU just won't exist anymore
You can tell which car is driving and which is parked
We've got "plněné knedlíky", different doughs with different savory and sweet fillings
Potato-based, [quark] and leavened dough, can be filled with smoked meat, sauerkraut, plums, strawberries, pears, or apricots
But those aren't filled
OP was specifically asking about dumplings with fillings
If you don't need fillings to qualify, oh boy
Bramborové knedlíky (potato d.)
Kynuté knedlíky (leavened d.)
Houskové knedlíky (bread-enhanced leavened d.)
Karlovarské knedlíky (bread-and-herbs-enhanced d.)
Chlupaté knedlíky (lit
hairy dumplings, made with grated potatoes)
Noky (gnocchi) Halušky (smaller gnocchi)
Kapání (drops - miniature gnocchi)
Šulánky (different kind of gnocchi), typically served with poppy and plum jam
Játrové knedlíčky (liver dumplings, excellent in soups)
I'm sure I'm missing some :)
Four letters for one sound
Horrible
More like roasted boar
- Opening beer bottles just with the things you have
- random card games
- trying to save as much money in different ways
- figuring out, how to get through a city, while there's a roadwork
- [Pebble hunt] basically, everytime you go on a trip you can find little pebbles, the pebbles are decorated like a painting
On the vack side, there is a post code by the painter
You can either keep them, or you can leave them on a different place, or post on facebook
Thank you
Also don’t worry about language
We don’t expect visitors to speak Czech
For me Its the Netherlands I went there when I was 19 when I finished high school even tho the job Ive done was quite shitty I really enjoyed my time there, I was blown Away by the public transport and the way how the country was organised, I lived in the small town called Vught and people were very nice to me, this experience was definitelly valuable for me
Dankjewel Nederland
Romania, absolutely
Poland is really nice too
Visited both already and hope I'll come again soon
Also I wish I'll visit Ukraine one day, met many nice people from there here in Czechia
Estonia and Slovenia
Cute little underrated countries
Also Slovenia is like our small forgotten twin
Italy
One of the most beautiful countrysides in the world, plus the culture and people just feel very refreshing
I would recommend Prague if you ever go there
It’s a really beautiful city
Very historic
Edit: also Karlovy Vary is very beautiful too
I was planning to visit Prague but corona virus and we had to close of individual states
For me, it is France
I love the language and I would like to visit the Eiffel Tower
Aw, glad to hear
I’ve been learning German for over a year and traveled through a small part with my German boyfriend
I’m planning to travel all over Germany during my Erasmus next spring
It feels like Czech republic spanning over a greater area and with generational wealth, meaning a larger number of gorgeous castles and fancy governmental buildings
Just before covid, I made a three-day trip to Krakow and Birkenau with a friend, and I want to go back so bad, then continue to more cities
And finally, Austria
Shared history still makes me feel like we are estranged cousins
I grew up not far from Vienna, went to Laa an der Thaya as a kid, and I was skiing in the Apls every winter pre-covid
I like the language, and the cars they used to make
Here are some of my favorite Czech songs
Also could you please send me a link for the list, once you’re done
:-D
I miss you to Guys, nearest Austrian city(Retz) is like 15min by car from my home and It really frustrate me that I cant visit
Wow
It’s close to perfect
Two small typos not changing any meaning
I know plenty foreigners living here for years not even close to this level
You just abused periods quite a lot
Yeah, I thought the same thing and it was great that Den Bosch was very close I enjoyed this city aswell, great architecture and amazing Nightlife
But FIAT made a killing on the first Panda
Well, yes
But I meant cars where there is at least 0
00000001% chance I could ever get to have
Ight, I’ll send you a dm
Only if it's from the Carroze region
I'm going to show you the very few very small mistakes you have made since you asked for them, but please, don't take it badly, you have done amazing job and I'm amazed, how well you know czech
Instead of těžčí, the correct form would be těžší, but the pronounciation would be basically the same
I have seen even some czech people make similar mistakes
Čeština is feminine, so you should say "čeština je jiná" (not jiný)
You could say "čeština je jiný jazyk", then it would be correct
And at last the commas
"Také je pro mě zajímavé", here there is no need for a comma
"...je jiná, a každá věc..." - generally speaking, you shouldn't use comma before "a". There are some situation, when you should, but those are in minority so it is safer to not put a comma there
Again, you have done amazing job, keep it up and good luck
our language love these complex sentences, basically mastering a writing skill is just mastering these complex sentences
But there is nothing wrong with using just some narrow simple sentences, it's an easy way out how to avoid dealing with this
The rule where to apply period and where not is insanely complex, expecting you fully understand the grammatical role of every word in the sentence
In a short almost every conjunction like "a" "ale"  etc have version both with and without period depending the whole context
But there are many exceptions and also whole context came to play and might change the rule
Don't worry about it, it is a clusterfuck for us too
For example, when "a" conjunction is used for merging information period is not used
for example
"Šli jsme k horským jezerům a potom lovili ryby
we went to mountain lakes and then fishing
so the period before a is wrong in this case "že čeština je úplně jiný, a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost"     (and for the same reason there should not have to be peridod before mi)
but when "a" conjunction is used to graduating the information or negating or some other meaning then there is usually period
Here is an example:
Slíbil mi návštěvu, a vůbec se tu neukázal
(he promised a visit but he doesn't show up at all)
Svalil se na zem, a protihráč se ho přitom ani nedotkl
(he fall down but the player didn't even touch him)
Sounds like when you can also use anything else than "and" in english version, or or just single "and" would sound very odd is the case where you probably should use period, where the simple "and" do the job you don't.
Not OP, but: Čeština je těžší než další jazyky, které jsem se naučil, ale mám cizí jazyky velmi rád. Také je pro mě zajímavé, že čeština je úplně jiná a každá věc, kterou se dozvím, mi dělá radost
I would have still probably written some things differently, but this definitely sounds more natural
That thing was a shoebox with a mouse on meth under the hood
I found myself looking at a few older Fiats I could possibly buy in the future, like Regatta or Uno
And yeah, Alfas and especially Lancias are legendary, I think Delta Integrale is one of the best looking cars ever made
Grandpa had 1st gen Panda, drove it on a field few times, funny thing
I couldn't really care less
If I had to choose, I would probably go for Czech one, seems like the less boring option
looks like Czech version is the literal translation of English one, same body parts in exact same order
Same words (just translated), but different melody
Hlava, ramena, kolena, palce, kolena, palce
Hlava, ramena, kolena, palce

Can't decide between President and Prime Minister
Both equally shit
Currently Miroslav Kalousek
He was the secretary of finances during the 2009+ economic depression
He’s hated because everyone thinks he causes the crisis by stealing the tax money
Of course, all of it is just a slander and he’s actually one of the best politicians we’ve ever had
Is Cromwell really hated
He always seemed like a Great leader that was just trying his best to make a more democratic system work while failing miserably
Too many idiots think that the economy is somehow supposed to grow (and pensions along with it) during a global recession
And here I was in another thread, complaining that Tesco stores are inconveniently large, because it takes like 2 minutes to walk from one side to the other
I can't imagine how large your stores have to be to contain all this *variety*.
We use rock paper scissors as well but in different order, rock scissors paper (kámen nůžky papír)
Yeah same here
I've never heard about it
I live with my girlfriend and our 4 month old son, we almost exclusively cook at home, so we only spend about 120€/month
However, I know people who spend about the same amount a week, so I guess it's pretty subjective
No idea about the whole country, but my household of 3 spends ~550 € per month on groceries (i.e. not counting eating out, that's another ~250 €)
Wait, that would be 100 Kč/day for 3 people
How on the earth 3 people can eat for that amount
Turkish president’s advisor claimed on public tv interview that there is no such country as Czechia, all the real men left the country and set up Slovakia
"How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far away country between people of whom we know nothing"

Neville Chamberlain, 28 September 1938
This isn’t exactly a long term problem, rather a short episode - diplomatic incident
Our police arrested Kurdish politician on Interpol warrant issued by Turkey, but he was released and Turkey doesn’t like that at all and accused us from supporting terrorism
Ahh yes, Netherlands the place of death, grim and fire
No, if they aren't citisens, they shouldn't vote, but if they will become citisens (dual citisenship or just regullar citisens) then I don't see problem
For the majority including me, it doesn't "feel" right
But so far I haven't found any *logical* argument why should it be like this
EU nationals with permanent residence can vote in the local elections and EP elections, why shouldn't they be allowed to vote in the national elections
The usual argument "because they can move away and thus don't have the interests of the country at heart" doesn't stand the criticism: any citizen can easily move to other region at any moment, yet local elections being held
Any citizen can move to another EU country (or even non-EU country) at any moment
The "commitment proven by time" could be established, and it's called permanent residence permit
Isn't your father eligible for Spanish citizenship after 30 years
Or in general, what would be the difference between permanent residence and citizenship if you allow permanent residents to vote
Born 1971, Czechoslovakia
This question is often asked in this subredit, so I compiled some of my answers together:
There were no real election between 1948 and 1990
There was always only one candidate you can vote for
In theory, you could choose to vote or not, but if you chose to not vote, you could be punished
Before 1990 there were no private companies or schools or hospitals under communist regime
Everything was under party's control
Justice was controlled by state too, so there was no real possibility to defend yourself in court against the state
Media too - under communist rule, a lot of things was censored
My favorite example is year 1973 in Czechoslovakia, when a lot of catastrophic things happened, but a lot of them was censored or just partially reported
The state decided what movies will be allowed in cinemas or tv, what music will be released etc
The same with books - even content of some books was modified - for example in The Day of the Triffids it was China, where Triffids were created, not USSR
Lot's of propaganda in elementary school - we read stories about heroic Soviet soldiers protecting us against imperialists
Russian language was mandatory
Limited range of products in shops - there was always at least basic food to buy, but if you wanted some better - let's say better meat cut, you had to have "friend" in the shop and he hid it for you "under the counter" - at various times there were various scarce products - sometimes nails, or car parts or plumbing seals or hammers etc
There were a few weeks where there was a shortage of toilet paper and menstrual pads - that was tough :) Basic food was relatively cheap, because it was subsidized
My friend camped whole night before shop to get socialist clone of ZX spectrum 8bit computer - they had only 3
Everyone had job, because working was mandatory
Who didn't work was "parasite" and was sent to prison
We had saying: "We pretend we work, they pretend they pay us
" In lot's of factories there was a lot of obsolete machines - like lathes from 50s.
Criticism wasn't welcome - Yes-men were promoted and critics punished
This principle was however also system's undoing
Problems were ignored, warning voices were silenced, but in the end, reality always win
We had saying: "If everything belongs to everyone, then nobody has anything
People could not travel freely outside the country - it was easier if you wanted travel do "friendly socialist country", it was much harder for the West
&#x200B;
In the eighties:
If you wanted to have "amateur garage" music band, you had to get permission from ideological commission
One time somebody at night placed an empty bottle into hand of Lenin's statue
There was an extensive police investigation, the offender was never found
One time they found something like small neo-nazi group at one of the local school
As a result, in our high school, everything with English phrases was banned (like t-shirts, pen cases, bags etc)
A daily schedule of planed economics was clearly defined, so if you was outside during working/school hours - let's say between 9AM and 2PM, cop could ask you what are you doing there and he could ask you to show him your ID - it happened to me a twice - when I was out to my doctor appointment
Before the communist regime fell, street names were like: Missile street, Artillery street, Gunner street , Army street
After that they were renamed to American street, French street, Danish street etc
Ruling communist party scratched their heads because Soviet Union now wanted them to implement the same reforms they sent tanks to stop 17 year ago
Big communist propaganda billboards everywhere
You could get jeans, digital watch or pirated videotapes on black market
Jammers were disabled so you could tune in to Polish TV and see some boobs or Hi-men cartoon
If you slightly rebelled against the regime it was kind of lottery (in the 80s) - you could end in jail or you could be left alone with warning
Comrade (soudruh in Czech) was common official address in formal situations, for example, in elementary school, students addressed teachers as comrade teacher, even if he or she wasn't member of the party
You could be called comrade by someone in the position of authority, like policeman, boss etc
In movies and TV shows everyone addressed each other comrade, but in normal life and in normal situations it wasn't common, at least in 80s.
Dont ask, you will see it under the command of Angela Merkel and other western leftist
Czechia was 8th economy in the world before socialism and communism influence
At 1989 we had 1/3 of wage of germany
Enjoy 60+% economic decline
Or you can buy bitcoin
My dad told me in the 80s there were actually some American films playing in cinemas
Notably, he saw E.T and Rambo
Apparently if a film was deemed to be critical of the US, it would get a pass
There's was also a reasonable amount of French and Italian media content because those countries were considered friendly (big commie presence)
Listening to Austrian radio was illegal, but lots of people still did it because it had music in English
I think Ö3 was the main one
E.T. was in cinemas, but [Rambo wasn't] \- I'm sure of it, because half of my family worked in the cinema and i had free access to all screenings
Rambo (and many other movies and porn) was available on black market VHS tapes, dubbed (horribly) by a one guy
About E.T. - Eliot in the movie had [this speaking toy] \- until the fall of communism I was sure it's just sci-fi prop, because digital children toy which is able to speak what is typed on keyboard was something so advanced to me that it never occurred to me that it was something that could be bought in a normal shop
Alien was in cinemas in mid 80ies
Can't recall if it was from 15 or 18 years because parents didn't let me in
>Listening to Austrian radio was illegal,
was not
Even in the the 80s it was clear that the future is in CNC machines, at least on industrial level
Yeah
people in the Ukraine were starving for change during the communist era
I remember seeing a documentary about Romanian orphanages when I was a kid
I didn't sleep for a week
Hmm, maybe it wasn't Rambo
I'll ask again but I'm sure it was some relatively well known American action movie
Any ideas what was screened back then
I remember Raiders of the Lost Ark (I've seen it at least ten times), Alien, Beverly Hills Cop, Jaws,  Grease, Papillon, Fort Apache the Bronx
I've seen starwars (IV) in 84 here, it was on betamax with shitty voiceover dubbing all done by one person
There are a lot, here are some from the top of my head
Nejsem ve sví kůži (i'm not in my own skin) - you are sucking at something you are usually very good at
Pověsim tě za uši do průvanu (i'm gonna hang you by the ears in the draft) - said as a warning to kids when they don't want to behave
Nosit dříví do lesa (take wood into the forest) - do something that is completely unnecessary
Máš za zadkem černocha
(Do you have a black man behind your butt
) - said when you don't close the door
Natáhnout bačkory (to stretch the slippers) - to die
Hrát na nervy (play on someones nerves) - be very annoying
Hodit šavli (to throw a saber) - to vomit
Vyspat se do růžova (sleep to the pink) - have a good sleep
And some more
Prodal by plešatýmu hřeben (he can sell comb to a bald guy) He is so convincing that he can make everyone like thing he talks about
"Spadl z višně" - fell from a cherry tree, aka has stupid ideas
"Malovat čerta na zeď" - to paint a demon on the wall, meaning being too pessimistic
"Dělá vlny" - he's making waves, as in doesn't want to cooperate, agree, or reach a concensus
"Dělat mrtvého brouka" - to play a dead beetle; pretending you're not there
"Hodit ručník do ringu" - to throw a towel in the (boxing) ring, meaning to give up
"Chytit vlka/housera" - to catch a wolf/male goose
Wolf = getting a skin rash from wearing wet trousers/pants
Goose = lumbago
"Mít ostré lokty" - having sharp elbows
To play hard
Not just in sports
Edit: forgot my favourites,
"Mít v malíku" - to have in one's littlefinger, same as in Polish
To be skilled or knowledgeable about something
"Vycucat si z prstu" - to suck (something) out of one's littlefinger - as in where am I supposed to get that
"Zpít se pod obraz" - to get drunk under the painting, derived from "obraz boží" = god's image
Geting so drunk you resemble an animal more than a man
We have "We (speak) about shit and shit is on our shoes"
Good ones, just to add:
>Nejsem ve sví kůži (i'm not in my own skin) - you are sucking at something you are usually very good at
I percieve it more as "I don't feel comfortable/I feel weird" in a sense that it's just not my day, I didn't slept well etc
Maybe regional difference, I guess
&#x200B;
>Máš za zadkem černocha
(Do you have a black man behind your butt
) - said when you don't close the door
I know "Tady má někdo v zadku oje
" - Somebody has a pole in their ass
More specifically, "oj" is the pole that connects cart with a cargo
The image is that you cannot really turn yourself and close the door if you are the "cart" in this situation
&#x200B;
And some others:
"To je mi platné jak mrtvému zimník" = "That is useful (lit
valid) to me as a winter coat to a corpse" = It's useless to me
"Sbalit si svých pět švestek" = "Pack up your five plums" = Prepare to leave
"Mít v hlavě piliny" = "To have a sawdust in the head" = To be dumb as a rock
"Být o hlavu kratší" = "To be shorter by a head" = To be decapitated
"Přijít <něčemu> na kloub" = "To come up to <something's> joint (like in a knee, not the one with weed)" = Figure something out
From my experience, I am completely able to talk to someone who speaks slovak, unless they start to talk fast, because then I have a little issue to understand everything , but It's still okay
In Poland, Slovenia, Croatia and Bulgaria I got okay with Not knowing their language, but it really needed both sides to be interested in having a conversation together
Polish is the most understandable out of those, then slovenian then croatia and then bulgarian
I haven't been to any other countries where they speak a slavic language, but I imagine in other south slavic countries it would Beiing pretty similliar, but east slavic would be probably a problem
In Czech Republic everybody will understand you in Slovakia, almost everybody will understand you in Croatia and some people will slightly understand you at the borders with Poland, Germany and Austria
German is common second foreign language option (after mandatory English), but reality is that most people just never learn it to a sufficient level and then also never use it
Maybe in border areas, but otherwise your chances would be fairly slim
It's like this:
The only way I can tell I'm in Germany is disappearing of speed limit on my navigation
traffic signs starts to be a bit different and that's it
and there is usually German police car parket at the place where D8 highway turns into A17 but never seen them doing anything else than stopping trucks from time to time
Only way I can notice i am crossing a border are signs warning you that you are and maybe a difference in road quality
You get on a road that leads to your desired destination, and you drive
That's it

How many screws
I have about five in my fibula head + some other piece of metal
(stupid while drunk, obviously)

Well that's new
But I have to agree, he is cute
Boyfriend lol, it would have to be a big bed for the 109
Oh thats what I have in smaller version just on the other side

Chocolate and the fact that they think that they have better beer than us
Chocolate, your flag, EU headquarters

I mean they are basically just northern Hungary
Well
almost everybody
All
But hot spot is Slovakia, Germany, Russia, Czech Republic and Probably UK and USA
Slovakia
Anything under 25° is heresy
It's currently 23° and I am pissed
23C which is fine
I can deal with 18C, but everything lower is not acceptable, not even for sleeping, since my nose and/or feet get cold and I cannot fall asleep
Fuck that, anything over 24,5 Inside and I sweat like a mf
22,5°C is where home is
My grandmas place is always 26,5, it’s hell
In Prague you can walk everywhere at night (but not now due to the covid lockdown)
If you get really drunk and pass out on the street or in the bus, your wallet or phone can get "lost".
I walk almost everyday through my town (from work, walking my dog etc
) a lot at night and never felt actually unsafe
The worst thing that can happen is coming across drunken groups screaming in the streets, especially during hockey championship
I tend to avoid these just because it's uncomfortable to me and you never know what they're gonna do
Zero risk
You can go anywhere anytime
I guess the same applies to almost any place in this country
I've never felt any kind of threat
You can get hurt by underestimating our (rather tiny) mountains though
No offense, but people often get terrified once they see a car on a road that has "PL" on its license plate, especially when it comes to truck drivers
I hate when this happens, but I know they do even more
I once had to run back home across the street because I forgot my keys and some unfortunate woman happened to be in front of me
What happened next was both of us running
Poor woman
Oh so it goes both ways
It's just an observation from other people that Polish truck drivers are the most dangerous ones
It's a pretty set stereotype at this point
Czech drivers are similar though
They just see themselves as being in the right all the time
Especially when they have "A" as a second letter on their license plate :)
There was a lot incidents with trains
Polish drivers (usualy near Ostrava) are crossing rail even on red lights and causing quite a few problems
Even with multiple people dead (for example well known Studenka 2015 - Pendolino & polish truck - 3 dead and 17 injured)
Also unexplainable will to overtake anywhere
But this stereotype (dangerous drivers) is mostly directed to polish trucks, not cars
Yeah  we've got a type of [Bagpipes ]
A [vozembouch] (literally ground smasher, it's a rod with a bunch of jingle bells, tambourines and such),
and we use [washboards] as a musical instrument too (you take a stick and run it against the corrigations)
I'd say probably that one time the future king of Bohemia (Joan of Luxembourg) and his wife (Elise Přemyslid) hid inside the city in the 14th century
And the neighbouring city is in the dynasty name of our only elected, non dynastic, hussite king (often visible in the dynasty map mode of EU4)
Wonder if anyone would want to guess those cities
A Czech writer, philologist, historian and Bohemian revivalist, Vaclav Hanka, falsified medieval manuscripts to support the idea of independent Bohemia (by enriching our literary history)
We have a theatre named after the guy in town, lol
Hard to pick one with capitals, depends on perspective
but I guess that one event which sparkled 30y War was fairly significant
It was the capital of HRE for 9 months, whenthe emperor Rudolph II moved there because of plague
[Battle of Czajánek's barracks]
Esztergom (spelling
) we know it as Ostřihom, the one on the Danube across the bridge to Štúrovo, Slovakia
Szczecin right
To clarify for others, the names are Jan Lucemburský and Eliška Přemyslovna in Czech
I'm not sure where you got those name translations, but they seem pretty incorrect
In English they would be John of Bohemia (or the Blind) and Elizabeth of Bohemia (Přemyslid)
Joan is a female name
Linda&Hanka
The OGs of „It’s not true but it could be”
Also Dvůr Králové?
Poděbrady is right, good job, the other one is very close to Pdy but more to the north
Sorry about that, probably messed it up with the french translation
Yep :D
Hope I didn't sound too harsh :)
Vůbec ne
we have word host, that means guest
It causes a lot confusion in english lessons
also there is plot, it means fence
"Panic" means virgin (male) :)
Should we mention the whole dick situation
mince (coin)
We have a sentence enhancer "fakt" meaning "really" that is overused a lot
The "t" is often silent in a fast speach
Now imagine how it sounds to an English ear when every other word in a sentence they don't understand sounds exactly like "fuck" :)
Both are available here
Difference being that sweet popcorn always comes pre-made, while salty you generally make yourself in a microwave
Sweet is however definitely less popular, mostly available at fairs and cinemas
I don't mind sweet, but I vastly prefer salty, or even better cheese flavoured
Progressive Shangri-La of cultured betters who've long known that racism, sexism, and homophobia are bad, m'okay, and are living in the atmosphere of enthusiastic acceptance

Just ask a Roma person from pretty much anywhere

Seriously one American asked me this
That EU = Europe
It's just so weird when peole say it
EU is an institution and has almost nothing to do with our culture and heritage
You can dislike EU and like Europe, it's not such an outlandish idea
Some stereotypes are stupid alone
But stereotypes based on
uhm
let's call it "One Europe" are total bullshit
That Europe=EU
EU is marxist construct organized by Germany and France to control other nations
"Private gun ownership is not allowed in Europe"
*\*laughs in Czech\**
The UK is so true
Is it not
Does other people's self-identification often enrage you
Nothing odd about it
If the general stereotype of Central/Eastern Europe is a bunch of patriarchal homogenous nationalist manly he-menz who are staunchly anti-women's rights, anti-minority rights, pro-traditional family in the most oppressive sense of the word and wouldn't know a modern value if it slapped them in the face, there's bound to be a group of idiots who'll start claiming that the fantastical concoction is actually desirable
I suspect that this stereotype, as the majority of the other ones, used to be correct at some point of time
Maybe sexual revolution of the 60's?
As a Czech I have to remind you that there's a Central Europe
> I find it a bit annoying when I see women with shaved armpits in films about any time before the 70s though
Recently I saw one supposed to play in 1920s Berlin and the woman was smooth as a baby seal
That's just done so modern audiences don't feel uncomfortable but it gives off a wrong image of 'normal'.
Nope, this is historically accurate
The period after the WW1 seen the return of the "antiquity ideal" of the body
Google videos and photos from 1920, dance parties, sport performances, and you'll see that the armpits are shaved
*To be fair though, China's constitution claims to protect human rights so
Bet it doesn't say which humans
Nice
I guess
Is it actually legal in Norway to own guns like hangun
Or did I mistaken it for Sweden, where it's illegal
Well, firstly and most importantly, your culture's opinion on what my culture self-identifies as, i.e. Central, is of no relevance whatsoever and I don't understand why it should be taken into account in any way
It's also rather interesting that you claim this is a matter of geography while dragging political history and culture into it and preventing "technicalities" (?) from having a role, despite Central Europe being an officially recognized concept, historically, politically, and culturally
And finally, the distinction of good West vs
bad East is anything but an "Eastern" invention, and the Western European insistence that it be used, a generation after the end of the Cold War, does indeed raise some eyebrows over here
It's almost like there's a need among certain WE circles to have a handy term to designate a place "the Other Europe".
My guess is the period of the sexual revolution in late 60s-early 70s.
I hate to tell you, but Czech Republic is closer to German way of life than the Russian or eastern European
Yeah, 40 years under communist regime erase those 600 years being literally Germany or Austria
I like this comment and yes people are more affected by recent events and turns, also Cold War and communism destroyed a little part of hope, but the way people act is much more similar to Germans than actually to other Slavs
We have so much different way of solving and going through things
Yes, we are close to other "German Slavs" like Poland or Slovakia but I think that is point of need to stay together after what happened after WW2 (including)
After being betrayed like 4 times
It kinda suck to not have friends
Also it is not like whole Czechia is more german, Bohemia (with Prague) is more Germanic, but still Moravia is closer to other Slavic countries
Largest I found is 148 m² with garage on the outskirts of Brno
In Prague (capital city) in the historical most expensive district about 50 sqm; close to 90 sqm in other good districts
About 20km from the city centre a family house on the smaller side
In my area decent size apartment in the centrum or big apartment/house on the outskirst
And since there is a lot of villages around, pretty big house in one of them, there are offers for half the price for multi floor house with land
Although my house is closer to half a million, as are most places in the area, 400k can still get you a very nice suburban house with a garden
At least in most areas, maybe with the exception of very lucrative Prague suburbs where the price may climb to 700k+ or so
In less attractive cities, you could push it down a lot more
Otherwise you can get 2-3 smaller appartments in big cities for that
Depending on location
Three bedrooms, two bathrooms, total of 120 square meters apartment in dead center of Pilsen, fourth biggest city in Czech republic (where I live)
And I would still have about 15k eur left
Or with no money left:
Similar apartment in outskirts of Prague
100 square meters houses just outside the city (both Pilsen and Prague, with Prague ones being a bit smaller and having significantly smaller ground around
Or (relatively) small 2 room (around 40 meters) apartment in historical center of Prague
EDIT: above is the 'best' you could get in cities
Personally if I had that kind of money available I would get house in some small village near a big city
There is a bunch of those small villages in 5 minut ride by car/ 15 minutes by train kind of distance around Pilsen, where this kind of money would easily get you 350-400 square meters of house, plus another 1500 meters of land around it
Geez with that much money you can get a big modern family house if you don't require it to be near or in Prague (there the prices are almost double)
Looks like some very nice houses in Malmö.
Is the city really that bad
These places seem like an absolute steal
Prague is one giant tourist trap but I think it is pretty easy to avoid them with a little research
There is so much information online so if you are willing to spend a few minutes to look stuff up you should be fine
You can buy a great, tasty beer in a Prague pub for 1-1
50 USD, but also for 6 USD
The "problem" is that 6 USD for one beer is somewhat normal for tourists from Scandinavia, USA etc
, so they don't care
Same goes for food
same as everywhere, do not eat at restaurants with photo menus, someone trying to show you the menu or "please wait to be seated" or similar signs
don't exchange money from random people unless you want to buy overpriced money from some former soviet state
Exchange offices rates can be unclear or shitty
In Czech republic, we have a dedicated youtube channel just for that, its called Honest Guide, if you ever find yourself in Prague, i advise you to watch some of their videos, really helpful
See honest guide for more info if visiting Czech
This
And  stay clear of the ATM machines with massive ATM letters on them
The exchange rate and fees are terrible
You can use basically any other ATM machine, there are tons of them around with logos of different banks and "Bankomat" written on them, and those are OK, just stay clear of the ATM ones
(blue and yellow IIRC)
Don’t use cab from airport these guys prices are well above legal range
Use bus instead
Don’t exchange money here, most places have ridiculous fees while acting free - use card or honest guide map to find good exchanges
Don’t buy trdelnik
It is shit and not even czech
Watch Prague honest guide, they’ll inform you the best
It’s tourist trap if it is local or European cuisine
Asian restaurants have photos almost always here too, and they are usually are rather cheap or normal priced
I’d say menus only in English, Chinese or Russian, with no Czech version is even bigger indicator of tourist trap
This can be simply narrowed down to "do not recklessly press YES on everything that appears on ATM screen"
Euronet, to be precise
taxi is ok but you HAVE to use the app unless you are not local
this is simple not a part of our restaurant culture and only traps targeting to foreigners have this
the exception can be if the michelin guide brings you to the place but then it is not a trap (and even then it is not the norm)
If a nice place here have a feeling you need to be guided around they will have some staff around to catch you and not some post office like sign "make a queue here"
I mean if you see this in Prague downtown at burger place (and you can) it will just tell you go for burger somewhere else unless you need to pay a double
most of our dishes doesn't have any exotic names so from the English menu you could figure out what are you getting, listing main ingredients so there isn't really any trap here (unless you are vegan or   muslim or similar dietary needs, and picture is not going to help you either)
Other networks and companies are no better when it goes to DCC rates
Technically, OP didn't say it is
exactly, and this is not just ATM issue but shop terminals as well
Cats's heads in Czech
In Czech, grasshopper is little mare, kobylka
English is a lingua franca of this era
If we want to communicate on European level here we have no other choice
This is an American website with majority of users being English native speakers
What would be the point of posting in our native language in English speaking forum
We "choose" to speak English
Considering the level of English we see here, I think it's second nature to a lot of us anyway
However, you see lot of our native languages in our national subs

Iz drugoj strany, umětne języky sųt råbota jednogo ili vęče anonimnyh ili neanonimnyh avtorov
Ta razlika jest baza drugoj značnoj razliky: umětne języky iz definicije sųt iztvorjene s specifičnom cěljem pred očami
Toj cělj može byti različny: na priklad, medžunarodna komunikacija, tajna komunikacija s inymi, prijemnosť samogo avtora, ilustracija někojej fiktivnoj kultury ili realizacija někakogo lingvističnogo pomysla
Besides the point that there’s not “auto translation” on Reddit and you’d had to go back and forth between google and reddit
or /r/JuropijanSpeling/
Yep
That sweet vocative case though
We haven't decided yet
Some buildings have numeration starting from 0 (sometimes called 0, sometimes P as *přízemí* or literally "earthfloor"), some from 1
I've already told this, but in my previous job we have office building split between two companies, and tenants were responsible for everything including the floor number markers
So we have numbers 0-5 in the elevator, but on the stairs we had 0, 1, 2, 4, 4, 5
We have it that the one at street level is called "přízemí", which would be translated to something like "near ground". The next floors are called 1st, 2nd, etc
We "haven't decided" because there is a difference between "patro" and "podlaží". When using patro, it should be 0/P 1 2 3 4 5
, podlaží numbering should be 1 2 3 4 5 6
I dont want to discredit any inventor, but most modern inventions is not a job of a single person but rather improving, combining and expanding already known knowledge simultaneously
You can dispute almost everything as there was always someone before with something very similar
* contact lenses
* Semtex (the explosive)
* sugar cubes
* lighting rod
* meth
* nanofibres
* arc lamp
* propeller
* blood types
* polarography
Contact lenses, sugar cubes, propeller
Screw-propeler, contact lenses, cube shaped sugar and most famously in eastern region, semtex
Tangentially I recently came across an awesome [youtube channel] which features some really early street videos remastered with speed correction and some ambient sound to make them more immersive
Examples being [Paris in 1896-1900] [Jerusalem in 1897] [New York in 1911] and [Stockholm in 1913] a lot of them are from the Lumiere bros
It's kinda crazy to see all those people, now dead, living out their lives over a 100 years ago
Makes me think about what their lives were like, what they were thinking when the footage was taken, where were they going, what their hobbies were etc
Also, reminds me that they weren't that different from us
Especially the kids being so interested in the camera and just goofing around, just like today
Beer was known to Sumerians in 4000 BC
Paper was known to Chinese long before Europeans
The same goes for the printing press
Meth - japan
Nanofibres - usa - first patent
Blood types - something you cant invent, we discovered their existence

We've got a village that's called "New Village near New Town in Moravia" (*Nová Ves u Nového Města na Moravě*)
The oldest synagogue in Prague is called [Old New Synagogue]
You all are too panicking on this new directive - and media certainly don’t help in this case
I skimmed through it and I don’t feel it’s that bad
On the contrary, it brings some very nice exceptions to universities, research organizations and libraries, who often operated in a grey legal area
I feel there’s a lot of misinformation spread about this new legal framework - articles quoting old versions of it, Google spreading panic so they don’t have to be more transparent, Reddit users quoting other Reddit users without an indication of clear source and then relying on what they said as a fact (sorry) etc…
(banning memes, no free speech, link tax blabblahblah - what a load of bollocks)
I would like to point out this:
(70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with
rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to
copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users
Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users for the
specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche
[…]
As a sidenote, this is a nice hammer to force YouTube to stop taking down people’s videos thanks to copyright trolls and non working algorithms
[…] Online content-sharing service providers should also put in place effective and expeditious
complaint and redress mechanisms allowing users to complain about the steps taken with regard
to their uploads, in particular where they could benefit from an exception or limitation to
copyright in relation to an upload to which access has been disabled or that has been removed .
Any complaint filed under such mechanisms should be processed without undue delay and be
subject to human review
[…]
Yes, I admit, there are some parts that aren’t that great
However, I don’t think they’re that unreasonable - e.g. Yes, **large** content providers shall do filtering - but of the kind that is appropriate and reasonable to their technical and organizational means
If you have time, it's not that bad of a reading:[
I don't care
Expecting our parliament will use some stupid version of implementation and will blame EU for it
It might stop shit services like ulozto,hellshare and others
I am pretty fine with it
Joj mamo
VPN should solve this right
Personally, I think not much will change, because it's unfeasible to implement such a thing on such a large scale as the directive is suggesting
Yes, Youtube does it, badly
For one it barely works, and secondly it's stupidly easy to abuse (both by people trying to get copyrighted content trough the filter and by people impersonating IP holders)
And let's not forget, Youtube is not even profitable
How is anyone else supposed to pay for this is beyond me
Really, the extend of the damage cannot be gauged until someone actually sues someone over it
I'm pissed, but I'm glad that most of my countries represantatives voted no
In fact, they're specifically excluded
To quote:
(70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users
Users should be allowed to upload and make available content generated by users for the specific purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody or pastiche
\[…\]
I though about this and I see two issues with this
Yes, parody of something is protected
But *technically*, memes are not parodying
They are using (copyrighted) image to parody something else
So, in my opinion, this wouldn't hold up in court
And secondly, as the other poster said, automated filters won't care
> but it looks like many people (also here on Reddit) allowed themselves to become useful idiots of the megacorps
Imo it just so happens that common Joe benefits from the same *lack of copyright laws* as some Internet corporations
But sure, they took advantage of it to rally us
They're specifically excluded
(70) The steps taken by online content-sharing service providers in cooperation with rightholders should be without prejudice to the application of exceptions or limitations to copyright, including, in particular, those which guarantee the freedom of expression of users

we are really good in this sport
It should block only if you are from EU, so if you connect through VPN it should think you are from US (or some other country outside the EU) a let you upload and download
(not an expert in VPN, just thought it might work that way)
The other side of the coin didn't actually put up much of an argument, has she
What is said in the article boils down to "But there have to be rules
" and "Without intellectual copyright, they don’t get paid
It was just declining, with fewer and fewer people who could actually make a living out of creating
" (which I would love to see some numbers on)
In reality, this is going to save money for established media corporations, because they won't have to track as much IP infringements, but won't matter for the little guys
And it's not going to affect large tech companies, because they can afford to either setup filters or fight the law in court, but will hinder small companies who can't do either of that
And that is putting the possible danger to freedom of expression aside
This new directive also deals with this - which is why Google/YouTube was spreading their propaganda so hard
They need to ensure that it's possible to dispute those automatic claims and they have to reviewed in a timely manner by a human
No, but there is one Pizza stand where I live that specifically labels itself "American Pizza" and there you always get some garlic sauce
I don't like it together with the pizza, but I find some other use for it so I don't have to feel bad for wasting food
I like Tobasco, Sriracha or Mayo-Garlic dip
But I'm generally for thin slice originals like a very fresh Margharita 'za
Is it good pizza
I'm looking for a good American pizza
Can confirm that it is not a thing here
Personally, I like the idea though
Not a fan of eating dry crust, but if I had something to dip it in, I would
I like it and google reviews are also very favourable
Check for Pizza Comeback, they are at two places in Prague

It seems these words will have similar origin in central European countries (or maybe originally catholic countries), because in Czech the word is "andělíčkářka", which could also be translated as "someone who makes angels" (which by itself is strange, because these fetuses would not be baptized and as such should not be able to get to heaven)
Thais is a question for historians, there probably was some
oh I almost forgot that this word even exists
Andělíčkářka
An "angelist", angel maker as in neighboring countries
Yes, but probably only in "Četnické humoresky" :D
I didn't know that abortion laws are stricter in Austria and Germany
I only know about Poland very strict abortion laws
Interesting but sad
The Ottoman [Mecidiye Marşı]
The Polish [National anthem]
The Ukrainian [National Anthem]
Red Army Choir songs
And probably many others
Tons of them
Some from Britain, some from Ireland, some from the US, some Italian, some spanish, I found very interesting argentinian kids song about Falkland war
I also know some from Russia, but best ones are from Germany (Panzerlied, die letzte Kompanie, was ist des deutschen Vaterland, wo alle Straßen enden, unterwegs, der offene Aufmarsch and many many more)
Natural: The 2002 floods;;
Manmade: Coal mining in the Ústecký region (viz Starý Most)
Well, there was silver mine Marie, where, during fire in 1892, died 319 miners
Oh, I've heard about the Palomares nuclear incident
Is it true that not all of the bombs have been found and retrieved
Came here to say this, it definitely has to be the 2002 floods for us
We don't get a whole lot of natural disasters here, pretty much only floods, and these ones were particularily devastating
Yeah, but few people mentioned it already
Look up "Czech desserts" and one of the first things to come up will probably be [this]
No, locals don't normally eat these and it's not even Czech, but Hungarian
It's just being sold in touristy places and tourists love to make photos with it and upload it on Instagram
In the Czech Republic, definitely Trdlo/Trdelník. It’s just a trap for naive tourists, you can find it in literally every food stand in Prague for hilarious prices
Definitely not traditional food as it’s presented
Ah, trdelník, traditional bohemian dessert
Jan Hus liked his with ice cream and sprinkles, as is tradition
Yea, I've never had one in my life
tbh I eat it like a few times a a year in the winter, cause there's a stand near my house that's selling them for like 40Kč for a big one
They're not traditional, but they are delicious (if you're not buying them for 100Kč lol)
I think I had it only once in my life and I don't even remember when
I never see them outside Prague but Prague seems to be FULL of them
> but it's not really a thing we get that often
your loss
Dutch herring is super-good
Sauerkraut is indeed very popular here, both red and white cabbage, both mild and strong one
Yeah, we eat a *lot* of sauerkraut here, absolutely adore it (especially the red kind)
Bigos looks a lot like some types of *Zelňačka* (sauerkraut so up) and that's reasonably common here, same with Koblížky (pac,zky)
As a tourist, i found it to be gross
Give me a bratwurst or something else
oh my god yes, *Bramboračka in bread* just seems so impractical to me for anything but touristy stuff
Like what on earth would you do with the
bread part of the bread
Yeah, it's mostly tourists
I am Czech and it's nice to have once a year, but it's not like we make them at home
It is an american dish, not an italian dish
Carbonara is American then, as it was invented by American soldiers
That's the story I always hear when I look it up
I don't want it to be true, really
If the dish was created with military rations, there's no way it was a refined dish
But what is the most expensive part of carbonara
Pecorino romano
Guanciale is either expensive or unavailable in the USA, but it doesn't seem like it should be expensive
When I went to school we didn't have folders like that as we had to just write our notes to notebooks (exercise books)
The only colour difference I can think of is that:
red notebook - lined paper
green notebook - squared paper
blue notebook - blank pages (without lines or squares)
Maybe it's different nowadays when laptops are more prevalent in schools
I wasn't organized enough to have color-coded folders or notebooks, but I colored in my timetable with somewhat stable colors
Humanities always tended to be warm colors and sciences cool
Usually I would use yellow for Czech, red for English, pink/orange for History and Art, brown or grey for PE, blue for Math, shades of green for Biology and Chemistry, and the rest was kinda random based on which colors I had on hand
Ah that memories
"For this year, buy 6x523 2x 520 and 1x524"
In elementary school
We had to buy books in high school too, and some teachers insisted on the newest edition (especially for fairly expensive foreign langauge books - very annoying), but elementary/middle school books definitely should be provided
That's harsh
I always thought it was dumb enough how much we had to spend on very specific art class supplies in elementary that ended up being used like twice a year
Same in Prague and bigger cities in Czech republic
We have the second highest rising housing prices after you
But we don't make nearly as much as you
\**cries in Czech*\*
Whats the cause
What
That doesnt make sense
You are the only country that as state makes profit
If you had your own currency it would be 62 CZK which is almost double the value of €.
And someone told you its because Chinese and Eastern Europe competion
Thats bullshit mate
German companies produce high tech things which Chinese cant replacate with proper know-how yet
you suffer
Look up how much money Germany gives to EU to "keep it running" you could use that money in other way
They can easily be (or become) misanthropic from their loneliness
Nice to hear that
Sadly most people dont want to think about these problems
What people in r/de think so far
I see
Well good luck in your fight
I am student myself but I look closely on economic situations and politics in world
Mainly Europe
I think Pilsen gets the least hate from the bigger cities
Well, thanks to you I have a new city on my bucket list
Sounds pretty dope
Could you tell me something about Krakow
I'm planning to visit in a few weeks
Cologne
I just love the city, people are so friendly there
I go over there every year for a vacation
Would like to live there
Thanks
Smog doesn't bother me much, but I guess I'll see myself

I study CS and English is mandatory even though my study programme is in Czech
Is Lidl in your country considered a good market
Here in Czechia it’s one of the better one, while when I was in England everybody made jokes about how bad it is
Why is that
The same is true for Czechia
Perhaps OP doesn't remember it, but 10 years ago Lidl was utter shit, and their slogan was, literally, "Lidl is cheap". A few years ago they rebranded to "Lidl is the right choice" and "The best from Czechia and Europe" and rebuilt shops, quite often starting from scratch (bulldozing the existing one)
Yeah i agree 100%, a lot of people seem to not like LIDL in this thread but in Denmark its one of the better stores to go to
And its a little bit cheaper then Netto i think
Not offending, you are actually right
It’s pain in the ass when I think about the stuff they got in Scandinavia etc
I don't mean to offend but even Czechs know that eating polish meat is kind of like a russian rulette
You will most likely live but there is a chance you catch salmonella
Maybe you keep the good meat in your country and export all the leftovers, who knows, but then you can't be surprised stereotype like this exists
The fact is that many companies take one product, make it two different ways and then they send the worse and cheaper one to central and eastern europe while they keep the good stuff in Germany and the rest of the western europe
It's kind of a big topic in Czech Republic
Mate, if it were Slovaks instead of you, it would be way worse
People would be extremely offeded by it while when it's Poland people are mostly annoyed and simply distrustful
Unless this stops happening people won't change their mind about it, it's simple as that
I looked it up and there were around 22 cases of bad meat from Poland in the last 6 years
That's a lot
It doesn't matter if it's done by private or by public companies, it's happening and that's the problem
I have no superiority or inferiority complex towards Poles and honestly can't say I know many people who do (Slovakia or Germany and even partially Austria on the other hand
Well, that's a whole another level of complicated feelings)
I think there are some things I disagree with on the government or social level but I am sure you are the same with Czech Republic
I always liked Poland, I always looked at Poland as part of our central european family, I root for Poles in the Eurovision even if I don't particulary love the song, I always defend you from morons attempting the blame you for WW2 and I hope your economy will only flourish but I won't pretend that the meat situation is alright on any level
Also, personally, I think no central european country has a good food
It's all meaty, soupy, fatty and heavy and I am just not into it
Nothing against it, it just dispeases my tastebuds
So I judge all our neighbours with the same amount of bias
Oh, that's surprising, we have Billas and Pennys
Yes
One of my best friends is a guy
We meet for a coffee basically on weekly bases
We go to cinema together
And we definitely aren't romantically involved with each other
Maybe it's a bit different in older generations
My parents for example found it weird at first and constantly asked me whether my friend's girlfriend isn't jealous that he is meeting me
Because they assumed, she would assume that there is something between us, because surely when a young woman meet a young man, there must be some hidden romantical interest (or that's what they thought)
For unknown number on my mobile phone only simple "Prosím." (which is literally "please" but it has more meaning, one of it is common response on the phone)
At work: "Prosím, (my family name)
" For friends and family the response is actually similar when I see them in person
Well Sámova říše was established around 624 and that is probably the first time we existed as a separate country
My country is 27 years old and it was founded in 1993
1993 when Czechoslovakia split
Same applies for you
By your logic your country was "founded" somewhere mif 90s when you finally had a constitution
It's not that easy, nobody in their right mind would argue that Czechia has existed only for 27 years
As far as I'm aware, all the countries/entities all the way up to the year 1198 (founding of the Kingdom of Bohemia, not sure how is it with the preceeding duchy) are considered Czechia's legal predecessors
If we're going for a more relevant answer, the year 1918, you could say that it was the proclamation of independent Czechoslovakia, which would be later ratified in 1920 and 1921
If we're going conpletely by contemporary administration, then the year would be 1969, the year in which the Czech Socialist Republic was established as Czechoslovakia was federalised
While 1993 is the birthyear of the current Republic, it is very far from representing how old the country is, which is at the very least  822 years
You wouldn't argue that Canada as a country was only born in 1982 (as it was given complete sovereignty by the Constitution Act), or that Russia has only existed since 1991, would you
No it didn't and Great Moravia didn't have any connections too
Most accepted date IMHO is 28
september 935 when Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia was murdered
is also a national holiday
With a ["big Škoda"] filled with everything, if there is still stuff, we return with the same Škoda and pick up the rest (when moving)
Honestly if you own a house or anything besides a simple city appartment, buying a small trailer is a massive investment that will pay off hundredfold
I have used mine for almost anything in the times I built two houses
If you live in a city then you have to either use a rental company, fit it in your car or ask a friend with a van/trailer
I don't think so I am going to buy sheets of drywall anytime in my life for the rest there is a delivery service or friend with van
Can also attach a trailer to our car or there is a friend with pickup car but some friend with van is always available so most comfortable way always win
You fold the back seats in your family wagon, and pray to good which we don't believe in, or keep the back door slightly open, make sure it ain't going nowhere, put a red flag on it if its long enough (red flag=any red old rag) and hit the road
Or you have a friend with a van
From a cost perspective, buying a small trailer is the best
It is relatively cheap, lasts forever and you can use it for anything
But then again, new shiny trucks are beautiful and who doesn't love a bit of fiscally stupid amortization rush
2 HTP engine Fabia, I can’t think of anything more Czech
If the load is so big so even 2 Fabias or Octavia can’t haul it, renting a van is always great cheap option
Rusty blue Ford van, with visible place where used to be post logo, can cost few hundred of crowns pre day (less than €40)
unless you are a lumberjack or rebuilding gardens a van do better job than hilux
Plot twist: You have an absolute monster king kong dong and she didn't because it could never fit
Hmm exact same thing from our hornbach is with free delivery, but looks to me they do free delivery of everything over 1500 CZK (around 55 EUR) if it fits into boxes
once in German class and only because our teacher saw a recipe in our textbook and thought that it could be fun
In few schools there's a option to learn to cook
But it isn't very common
Actually, yes, but only for one school year
Both girls and boys had to take it and each week we would cook a different type of food (fish, desserts, and so on)
But I later learned that this isn't the norm in public schooling, my school was just an exception
We had
afaik it is not really possible here
you need to pass language test, both written and spoken + test from Czech things, all the shit is for whole day
Czechs speak Czech
If you don't speak Czech, you are not a citizen and idgaf what any paper says
No way
You want to be the citizen, you need to speak the language, period
A gigantic, overwhelming portion of the Czech national identity is being able to speak the language on at least a fluent-ish level, generally not giving a fuck about any "heritage" or other crap
I feel like if you want to double-down and become a citizen, you should learn the language at the very least
You can ask your mum to practice a bit with you
No, I am not aware of any tradition connected to this day
I greet them when I meet them, have some friendly chat frkm time to time

Yeah, sounds like it
25 minutes by tram/bus or about the same time on a bike
Bike is a bit slower but I do not have to wait for connection
2-3 minutes by car, depending on traffic, weather and direction
15 min walk
Cca 20 min
3 min walk, 10 min metro, 7 min walk
Prague, CZ, 20 minutes by subway
Few minutes to and from subway on foot
5 minute walk to bus, 5 minute bus ride, 15 to 20 minute tram ride
20min walk OR 15 min bus+walk OR 10min bike ride
5 minutes drive with my car to the train staion, 25 minute long train ride, few minutes to walk to the bus stop, 10 minutes long bus ride, 5 minutes walk to school and you are done or just take the car and be there after 25 minutes
So I drive to school like 2-3 times a day (not because I want to cut the time in almost half, but because I enjoy driving a lot)
> put on sweat pants
You're more disciplined than I am
You know: Ordnung muss sein
I'm just lazy
And it saves 20-25 minutes of time every day
Of course, the fuel costs something
But if I actually cared about it, I wouldn't use a V8 Jeep for it
The bastard is 20 years old, and refuses to die
I love the name Dimitri, it just sounds badass
I think it's mostly around 25-30
Seems to be decreasing with the good economy lately
I plan on moving out once I go to uni, but one of my friends, who is 18, is planning on moving out in about a month
I'd say between like 18-27 is the standart
We have the oldest university in the Eastern and Central Europe
Now it barely ranks in top 500 universities
We owned half of Europe once and we had some very powerfull rulers (Charles IV

More like the metrics are skewed towards anglo-sphere schools
During ski race somewhere in Norway there was an aerial shot of the first group and in the snow you could see a GIANT "Babiš je zlo" in the snow

My logic says pretty common, considering how many other ethnic groups have Russians assimilated over the centuries
I feel like that's not a stereotype, that's just the truth
We have the biggest beer consumption per person in the whole world, even though you won't usually see drunk people if you're not out really late
:-D
Not at all
I haven't seen it in a very long time
Little late, but my parents watched it full, I watched a part of it
We have thrown people out of a window as a political statement
And not just once
Czechoslovakia, as a part of WW1 allied war reparations, received a certain part of the Hamburg harbor in a form of a lease for 1 Czechoslovak crown with the duration of lease of 100 years
It used to house the Czechoslovak trading fleet
The lease expired several years ago and was renewed
Also, Czechoslovakia won a naval battle known as the Battle of Lake Baikal, the only known naval battle by Czechoslovakia
We had naval battle on Baikal and WON
Awww
Beer is the cause, beer is the solution, we are saying it all the time
French did it
Germans introduced potatoes by german way, they gave an order
AFAIK no, or maybe it wasn't as notable
After all Prague has always been the capital city
Kifli
In Czechia it's as common as bread and I naturally thought it's as common everywhere
Rohlíky
Other countries don't have rohlíky, therefore other countries shouldn't exist
Yeah we have that,Mattoni produces it
TIL the English name for rohlík.
I miss Danish hot dogs
So it looks like that we,Slovakia and Hungary have rohlík.What about Poland
I only passed through Hungary, sadly
Nope, but that's what I found on English Wikipedia, we call it rohlík.
In Czechia, I’d say that [marlenka] It was made in Czechia based on Armenian recipe tough
Sacher is my very favourite
What I found surprising tho was when my Austrian friend had it as a birthday cake on his birthday
Really shows how popular it is in Austria
That we could've 1v1 Germany in 1938
That we hate church because of communist regime
We hated church hundred years before that
Why do you delete your posts
We were (again) in the middle of a conflict with Poland
I think that had we actually ignored Těšínsko for a while and allied with them instead we could definitely have a chance
Someone actualy thought that
We were winning against against motherfucking Crusaders with just farmers, some nazi punks are nothin'! /s
German military was biggest in Europe, we might have had good fortification on German borders and decent industry, but we would get our cheeks clapped, war would be over in matter of days once they got through mountains, not to mention they could flank us through Austrian border wich was nowhere near as fortified as north
This is my "favorite" tidbit: [ (1933)
Your numbers are wrong
Battle for france was almost 7 weeks, not 5
The number of dead germans was 27k, not 90k.
It wasn't 1000 pilots, but 1000 air crews
Yes, kind of
He said: "look for the truth, hear the truth, learn the truth, love the truth, speak the truth, hold to the truth, fight for the truth to your own death"

Destroying Rechkanzlei is probably the only thing 14 aircrafts can do
Neither USSR/Czechoslovakia or USSR/Germany shared common border
Even if it was true, they had no way to help
It was postwar propaganda, in line with the rest of anti-west communists focus
Also USSR and Germany were allied at the moment
\> did Stalin poison Europeans
Did he conduct cruel, crazy experiments on people
No, he was doing this to his own people
Ironically, nation who suffered the most under Stalin is full of his apologists
Molotov-Ribbentrop pact was a final piece of years-long cooperation
For example USSR allowed the training of German tank and air forces on it's territory, because Versailles Treaty prohibited such things in Germany
No sane person would allow Red Army to enter his territory
Especially not Poland, which was attacked by USSR just 19 years ago
The problem with missing is, you don't a have reliable way to differentiate between unidentified(both dead and wounded), lost, deserted and captured
The POW's especially are inflating the casulties numbers
It's still only 14 planes
They might a be lot in todays minimalistic warfare
But in 1938, Germany had probably more planes than we have anti-air missiles at the moment
Do you even know what was Molotov-Ribbentrop about
It was about creating spheres of influence, similar to the Portugal-Spain Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494
The Soviets didn't support Republican Spain during the civil war, because the other side was fascist, but because majority of Republicans were communists
That's why Western powers didn't get involved, there wasn't anyone allied to them
In my household my dad would always buy crate of Pilsner Urquell because it’s considered premium beer and he never bought it to drink at home, if he drank it it was from tap in a pub or restaurant
However that is some years ago and lots changed, now it’s usually a combined crate of different premium beers to try or Christmas edition of our favourite beers
Always have Pilsner for Christmas dinner though
Are there trees in Iceland
Our most imperial moment (apart from being the pivotal part of the  Habsburg Empire which we usually pretend to be a victim of) was Czechoslovakia and the subjugation of unsuspecting/s Slovaks and Ruthenians (sorry Hungary)
Most of us still believe it was a good deed after all
Hell, I wouldnt mind if we joined together again
Having monarch as representative person and person who unites us is great
Austro-Hungary is portraid rather nicely in Good Soldier Svejk
Also some rulers in our history were good
Rudolph II, Joseph II, Maria Theresa
Also fun fact I have Habsburg genes
Except it was tolerant only in the Austria-Hungary phase and only in the Austrian part of empire
Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama
That's kinda all
Tokio, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Nagano, Sapporo

Tokio, Yokohama, Osaka, Kioto, Hiroshima, Nagasaki
So 6 in total
EDIT: fuck me, Nagano
Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Kyoto, Sapporo, Kawasaki, Nagoya, Fukushima and Kokura if that counts
Can't think of more
Osaka, Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki and

If documentary doesn't have voiceover of Pavel Soukup then it is not documentary
(the same guy do also dubbing of Arnold Schwarzenegger but no, they are no "I'll be back" in documentaries, what a waste of meme)
And for journalism, Martin Řezníček, no discussion
Among educated people, it is Andrej Babiš. On November 16, 2019, around 300,000 people demonstrated against him in Prague
Among other people, it is Miroslav Kalousek
He was a good finance minister, but unfortunately it was during the Great Recession, and uneducated people like to blame it on him
And among communist-minded seniors and boomers, it is Václav Havel, because he was a symbol of the Velvet Revolution in 1989
Everything is Kalousek's fault
It seems it's something between toasts (commonly made with toaster linked many times here) and [topinky] wtih nothing or anything you like on the top
We have the same toasts here, but we make them in "toasters" which are not toasters but rather have the appearance of a small contact grill (contact as in the toast touches the iron grille of the toaster on both sides), the regular toasters we call "topinkovače" but translates as toaster to english, so I guess I can't really explain a czech toaster without showing you a picture (which I can't, because all search results for toaster show
well, a toaster)
I don't want to nitpick here but isn't "fried" supposed to be on oil or fat ? Toaster will just compress it and heat up
and why do you call them grilled cheese when they are not grilled cheese
Ok and how do you call grilled cheese then
Yes
Seen that but how do you call grilled cheese which is actually grilled   cheese
Not sandwich with cheese
of course you can, that's the source of my confusion
Here a grilled cheese is a grilled cheese and having some sandwich instead would cause some "excuse me
I guess [this] [this] [that] and a whole lot of [this] And also the **good** mafia game
Your meth production is behind tho

After personal experience of miltiple times, I'm not sure I would regard Brussels as a contribution hehe
Maybe to the annual red tape bullshit competition
And you won the first Eurovision
To be fair France is trying to use common defence and military for their own political gain in Africa
I wish we all passed on that
Wasting military lives trying to do some french bidding in Mali or whatever colony is not really useful for anyone other than France
I mean, on the other hand, holding us hostage like that is not that nice
It's ok mate
We picked up the German demand needs for you
I'm not saying you're the bad guys, far from it
I'm just saying you have to distinguish between specific missions
Helping Greece with defence is a big difference from interfering with internal conflict in Mali
And I said that France can do that if they so please since they have history there, but that other countries may have 0 things to do with Mali or other countries in Africa and may be reluctant to waste lives on it
Also unlike the US or France, other countries have limited military funds and lives just to play world police
Which is also a big reason for opposition to it
Well I'm mostly talking about the fact that France has the most important European military and it has a lot of geopolitical interests in Africa and elsewhere
Therefore they have a tendency to assume world police role with America
And if there were shared army projects, it's likely France would influence the missions to suit their needs in Africa and use others to help them do it
Like US does with NATO often (or rather did in the past)
Sure, that's a necessary condition
But in such case, it would be rather unnecessary, since NATO already has many EU members in it and it has a common defence clause which is (externally) more valuable than EU alone since it has American military weight behind it
I get that
But I'm just not confident you can effectively deter Russia, Turkey, Iran and others threats without the US
Especially in cyberspace and unconventional warfare
However faulty the Americans can be, their military is still a massive deterrent
Nowadays NATO is built around specific member states doing parts of work
So for example CZ has a great biological warfare regimens, good specialists and some decent techs, but we have comparatively very small raw manpower and infrastructure
That's just not there without the Americans
It would also mean that France would have to pick a lot of the responsibility as the strongest military
And as you can imagine from historical reasons, the trust in French military and diplomacy is very very low in a lot of countries
Especially in CZ after we were given away to Nazis at Munich '38 just because the French and British didn't want a war
Just saying the factors that I see as to why I'm not huge on this idea of EU army without the US
[France]
If it's a person, for me it's definitely Karel Čurda
He exploited Heydrich's assasins, who then fought bravely against dozens of nazis in a fight they could not possibly win
I don't know, this seems pretty reasonable
Taking the revolution further would hurt Germany quite a lot
Yes, he killed some commies, but rather have them dead than a German civil war
Munich Conference probably
Yeah it wasn't betrayal per se, it was total incompetence of French third republic in general
If anyone outside Germany should get blame for WW2, it's France
"Hey, it wasn't us, it was the guy in charge" is the world's oldest way to get rid of responsibility
Besides, wasn't it Chamberlain who was mainly for the appeasement policy
Japan is complicated
They were in war since 1937(1932) and their alliance with Germany was only symbolic
WW2 is actually two separate wars at the same time
France arrogance during the Versailles peace conference on the other caused the rise of Fascism in both Germany and Italy
And they also alienated the Japan
And then, when Germany officially broke the Versailles treaty, the France did nothing, although they were legally bound to act
The Munich conference was the last nail to the coffin
Wait, no, the Phoney War was the last nail
Most French accepted the guilt already
Just few individuals like you feel personally attacked anytime something unfavorable from history of his nation is said
That's true for every nation, not just France

I don't really like beer very much
I don't hate it either, but out of all alcohol options that you can get, beer occupies a low spot on my preference list
I don't like *vepřo knedlo zelo* (our national dish) and I'm not an Atheist
As Czech I hate bread dumplings (except with  sirloin beef in cream sauce )
I don't drink beer, or any alcoholic drinks for that matter
Why the fuck would anyone choose the bitter rotten piss that is beer when cider, wine, and all these other low-alcoholic drinks exist
It's not the medieval ages anymore, people
I drink a lot of wine from Moravia and eat lots of smažák to make up for it, so yeah, I think I pass
Basically, in Czechia we call whole Germany "Německo" which refers to that we can't understand them
You know, different language families
It's funny since the Slav name for germans and germany (Německo, Němci) comes from the word  mute'
We also have the village saying, but they are Spanish
My personal favourite is The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians
Someone is even killed with cello, which I play
Oh, classics
But recent events should turn the meaning completely around
Age gap relationships with 15 year olds
Reddit keeps going on about predators but I don't get it
It's not like they are children
Socks in sandals
pretty normal here as well
isn't going into sauna nude expected everywhere
I thought that was Balthazar
nah here as well
Yeah, I remember when I was around 15, it was a kind of status thing among girls to have a 20+ boyfriend
And a friend of mine for example has been dating a guy 15 years older than her since she was 16 and they're still happily together
At the time it was considered weird but more in the sense that we wondered what they could talk about with each other rather than it would be considered "predatory" from the guy
Fuck yeah it isnt
everyone with brain should hate it
Also that dark humour should be mentioned in brochures about our country
I think most foreigners arent ready for it
Hell Gott died today and Ive already heard jokes about it
Nah, we literally built our national identity around pub culture, so we count as well
We eat horse meat, usually in the form of [koňský salám] but it's more rare and occassional product
There are no farms that would specifically breed horses for meat but simply when a horse gets injured or is too old to work (and it's not like a beloved companion of the owner), it's put down and its meat processed
Yes, you can have towel around if you are shy
Going into sauna in some clothing is really unhygienic
True
But I would not consider someone who is interested in a chick with a rack like Alps a pedophile
I'm suffering from Stockholm syndrome 12 years later
We even got a kid
where and what they wear
from my experience with sauna all over Europe staff will kick you out if not naked
(these places I visit in asia have sauna outside and apparently all saunas around during my US stay were some undercover gay club by reviews)
so not finding a real sauna during my US stay was in fact a benefit as they will kick me out in no time :)
have to try :) for distance reason we usually visit "something around Gastein area" and due to near border with Germany you will never encounter this in sauna
Yes
The small numbers of good gypsies only confirm that majority are thieves and leeches with shitton of kids
that's correct
Thus by definition not a pedo
However this is misguided
It is Ephebophilia when the sexual interest preference is mainly towards adolescents
Simply happening to fall in love with (or being attracted to) adolescent while still being into "adults" is not Ephebophilia
It's too late
I'm trapped under a pile of diapers
Send help
all over Europe was apparently exaggerated
(but my brain still can't cope with how is anyone comfortable in sauna wearing anything)
I feel like this is nothing new by now but on Easter Monday guys go around and whip girls with whips made out of willow branches
Burning witches
We've got a lot of them
We throw this doll during spring (I think) into the river, we used to do it in kindergarten so pretty old tradition
We burn a witch doll and it's basically this big event that usually the city itself makes and there's a lot of beer and alcohol around it and it's cool
During spring we also celebrate easter, by basically "whipping" women with a willow stick (The whipping is just going back and forth behind the woman's behind) and then we get either sweets or alcohol (The women actually want to be "whipped" because the tradition is they will stay young for longer)
On Easter men spank women with wooden whips
I’m not kidding nor exaggerating
Burning witches is better
Yeah we do that too
It's a tradition over here too
I've never seen it though
It's a thing, but it's dwindling
It still a thing
I grew up in a small village in Moravia and I still technically live there so I get whipped every single year
Not my favourite tradition
More and more people are abandoning it though, especially in the city
Jan Žižka, Czech general from the 15th century
Even though right now the biggest statue in Czech Republic belongs to him and even one district of the Czech capital is named after him, he did pretty nasty stuff
He was a leader of religious movement called Hussites that fought against Roman Emperor, who was catholic
Even though it could be called the first reformation in Europe (almost 100 years before Martin Luther), they were really radical and killed anyone who didn’t agree with them
They were also iconoclastic (destroyed religious icons- statues, paintings, churches
The only reason they are now celebrated is because communist regime glorified them a lot (because they fought against catholics) and used them for propaganda
Bohemian nobility electing Ferdinand I. of the Habsburgs to be the king of Bohemia (1526)
Granted, he was a very competent candidate at a very young age
Nevertheless, through him we have lost independence for centuries
I like the Liechtenstein one, looks like a plate from 50s.
Helsinki development is insane
I wish we could make a Kalasatama in Prague but building here takes so fucking long
Well of course it takes long, when everybody and their mum can delay the process through bureaucratic machinations to squeeze some bribes from the state
A village nearby has been waiting for a highway for 20 years
They are still dealing with complaints of eco-activists who live on the other side of the country
Doritos
I love them
The only way to get Doritos here is to go to a special shop like Iceland, because they sell stuff from the UK
Google Store
Our wikipedia is pretty huge but the quality varies a lot
There are certain areas where the articles are generally pretty high quality with reasonable depth
Astronomy articles for example tend to be surprisingly good
But in other areas it's not so hot
Almost all articles about history are pretty garbage from my experience
Haha, i feel this
Was in a bar at dresden
There was a sign on the doors that thay accept card payments
I was like: finally, hello germans welcome to 21st century
So we had couple of drinks with friends
We were about the pay and asked for a card payment
They told us they dont acxept standard visa/mastercard and only accept some weird german shit cards
Deutsche post or something like that
After some talks lady came and covered for us lel
Exactly the same here
They have warehouses here and we get a "Czech" website that is just the german one ran through google translate
And you still usually have to come pick the parcel up at the post office because česká pošta is a fucking joke
> A normal republic with a good legal system, no corruption and people making a descent income
This is far from being available "almost everywhere".
Ah, good old GSV paranoia
Czech Post
Pretty sure all my Amazon packages were delivered by PPL or PDP or someone like that
Not I would care, Czech Post works fine where I'm from
Everything I've ever ordered from Amazon was delivered by česká pošta, but I guess that may vary
Also, I've never received a single parcel from them at our house, they always just leave a card saying nobody was home and that I have to come pick it up
I guess since I don't live in a large town, stopping by the post office is really not a huge issue
If I had to park somewhere in a city, I would be way more annoyed about it
It's just transliteration to the English Latin alphabet and as such it's a little bit clumsy
Yeah, I live in Prague and even though the post office is not very far from our house, it's always busy and you usually have to wait there anywhere from 30 min to 2 hours
Modern office building will have AC
Older ones, may sometimes be retrofitted with it, but it's not terribly common
But regular houses or flats
Basically unheard of
It's pretty expensive for something that you will use for 2 months per year at most
And the little stand-alone units are just shit and still expensive
With that said, I will be fitting an AC in the attic I'm reconstructing
I don't see summer getting cooler any time soon and the attic would be unliveable otherwise
No, I think window fans are not common in most of Europe either
As far as I know, your windows usually just slide up
In Europe, [tilting windows] are the norm
Meaning we would have to have the window fully open all the time which is just hugely impractical
I put a line  in the middle otherwise it looks like a 2
Not a huge problem in a text, huge problem in math stuff where z and 2 are very common
Unless you are from house of Kinsky or similar noble family (and then it is usually more than 2)
I do have two first names, never met anyone else with a second name here in my life so its probably very rare
Legally you can have second name
It's very rare, I don't think I know a single person who has one
Not at all, at least in my area
No, they are not anymore, but we gave our daughter middle name anyway
Bringing that "Národní obrozeni" mood back, all them writers had two names XD
No, which is sad, I honestly like middle names
Or if you were baptized, still pretty rare
200 years ago it used to be different, but XX century broke this tradition
Do we even have that option
My nephew's name is Jonáš Jan (surname) but I don't think that there will be 2 names in his OP
Rarest of the spiciest spices
I don't even know how this works for these religious nuts here
but was it really second name or just that baptism name
yes we have (been there last week) two names are possible, can't be same and if there is a dash (anna-marie) it is considered as single one
Two are maximum and it has to be existing name in correct grammar form
(and correct gender except these two or three multigenders)
But in overal it is quite strict, for example any girl is born with -ova (unless you are foreing, etc
just default case) and has to be changed later if wanted
If you have two names you have an obligation to use both when communicating with authorities
(don't know what punishment is if you don't)
You just kinda have it but it's not on official documents
I'd guess second name, because of Magdalen Dobromila Rittigová. I have feeling (not being a religious person myself) that for baptism you have to take one of the saints' name, and I haven't head of saint Dobromila
I might be completely wrong in this tho
Yes I guess so it is somehow this way, remembering filling naming papers for our daughter and they were quite strict what you can fill in (but lot of things can be changed later, like father form of surname etc)
I have no clue about these religious things as well but it makes a sense
But on other hand, she was German and didn't speak a single Czech word till her 20 or something like that so it might be an influence from there and not really our thing
Comparing with "real" Czechs from that national revival era like Hanka, Palacky, Celakovsky, these are always just with one name or sometimes with the religious one
So not sure she is good benchmark for this
How restrictive society is
Even some European nations, like Spanish people, do that
If they meet with a bigger group, they say like "hi, how are you
" and then they greet with another person
To me, this feels so rude
When you ask a question, you should always wait for the answer
They were thinking of dumdum bullets
that was part of my young years as well, probably any summer camp had some game like this one
We were usually not alone but together with some adult or someone in 15-18 age but not giving us any help just stopping us doing something really stupid
Pretty much the only thing I can think of is [Polárka] It's a multipurpose hall used as a [shooting range] [ice hockey rink] etc
But the best thing about it is that it [lights up differently every time] for example when it's closed it lights up in orange, when there is a concert it lights up in yellow, on the New Years eve it lights up in the colors of Czech tricolour, etc
Prague - Czech national library of technology is beautiful building located in technical university campus in Dejvice
Its main hall is amazing sight
Sadly the building has one fatal flaw - the glass panels on the outside are miserably designed, and they keep falling down
Luckily they didn’t kill anyone, but the temporary fence around the library became kind of permanent
In Poděbrady (eastern part of the Central Bohemian region) there are many historical buildings, but because Poděbrady is a spa town, you can fing modern architecture as well ( like the [train station] [art nouveau villas] [Libenského Kolonáda] and many others)
Dang, wish I knew that sooner, when I was visiting

Pretty briefly but yeah
Never encountered one in my life probably
The Dancing House
Such a beautiful piece of architecture
I'm a huge fanboy of [Jan Santini-Eichel] an ingenious architect living at the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries
He invented his own style, baroque gothic, [mixing up] an old gothic architecture with then-modern baroque elements and construction techniques, about 150 years before historicism in art became a widely popular thing
On top of that, he was obssessed with [insane] geometrical patterns and symmetries so all his buildings are filled with them
Here's probably his most famous works, [St Barbara Church] in Kutná hora and [Pilgrimage Church of St John of Nepomuk]
Flaktürme are absolutely breathtaking constructions
I've seen bigger buildings, but in from of a Flakturm a man is merely an ant, so titanic it is
What is that
WTH is TV licence inspector
In 2008 Czech researcher found memo that Czech-born writter Milan Kundera in 1950 could report a person he thought was a Western agent to communist regime authorities
(Kundera was devout communist at that time)
His foreign fans started defend him immediately and eleven internationally recognized writers came to Kundera's defence: these included four Nobel laureates
Although I'm pretty sure they really didn't know much about 1950's Czechoslovakia
> If Russia wanted to influence Germany by shutting down the Gas supply they could already do that with the other supply lines
They don't want to shut off gas to **Germany**. It has been discussed million times, and here we go again
Eastern flank of the EU and non-EU countries like Ukraine
Currently, in case of an all-out military conflict, gas supply to Germany might be affected; with the Nord Stream, it won't be, what almost guarantees German passivity in case of further Russian aggression
On a question: where are you going for vacation I answered: Yugoslavia
I got drunk by drinking beer while wearing socks in sandals
I've never climbed a mountain in flip-flops though
How did you feign to be Mafia members
We have a phrase: "to be drunk as a Dane"...
To be honest, this phrase is at least one hundred years old
Probably much older
as a person with dual citizenship im happy that it's allowed :)
Italian all the way
Well slovak, it sounds way more fluent than czech
Slovak feels like a german autobahn opposed to a field road czech
Norwegian and Japanese are probably my favourite languages sound-wise
Yes, if it is mean-spirited or just plainly some ignorant incorrect criticism, I have the tendency to get defensive basically about any CEE country
V4, Baltics, Romania, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine, Slovenia, Croatia
not so much the Balkan countries as I am not that familiar with them and so don't feel quite as confident defending them
In some particular circumstances, I can get defensive about countries West of us too
It all depends on what the topic is and what the insults are
But in general, it's usually CEE countries that I defend because I feel like they just need it more, in the sense that they are more often a target of retarded misconceptions and prejudices
Stupid jokes about our bros in Slovakia, mostly based on movies like Hostel or Eurotrip

I kinda-learned Spanish because I spend more than a month there yearly for the last 10 years
But I never learned it properly, so I decided to take Duolingo course
It is fun experience
The pronunciation, the words, the way they construct phrases -- all this is so weird to my ear
Not only they speak with funny mexican accent, they believe that "coger un coche por la mañana" is wrong, and one should "tomar un carro en la mañana".
I'd say zoophilia
In Czechia, and other European and non European countries, zoophilia is legal as long as the animal isn't abused, the person doesn't record the act and distribute it which is still really fucked up
Jóžin z bážin
We have even song about him:
Apparently the most common folkloric being in Czechia is the vodník / wasserman / vodyanoy
Czech folklore has a combination of Slavic and Germanic beings, possibly even some early Celtic influences (especially with the vodník and how it sometimes appears as a horse)
I'd say it's mostly in fairy-tales now, I can't say that I recall a current "cryptid" when it comes to our lands
So it's the classic chorts/devils, dragons (crocodiles), víly/rusalky, noonwraiths, ghosts of White Ladies, hejkal, dwarves in mines, vampires/werewolves (the Slavic vampire is not distinct from a werewolf, unlike the more "western" kind), witches, bludičky/will o' the wisp, fexts
Seems like Austrians brought this legend to the US, they have Goat man cryptids there
Surprisingly legends about White Ladies (especially foretelling death) are really, really old
It seems they just moved from castles to roads, though
Slavic countries have vodník / vodyanoi that do the same things, except for the naked part :D
Almost every country has some kind of a legend about household deities, so far I'd say it's an Indo-European legend or even something very intrinsic to our species as a whole
Off the top of my head, Slavic people have domovoy, Egyptian Bes, Anglo-Saxon hob, French lutin, German kobold, etc
I think we call them skřítek domovník or domácí skřítek
They're afraid to put their weight on the flashing
I was in a restaurant in Switzerland that served Hawaii pizza with cherries on top
No articles, no problems :) Czech language is hard to learn in many different ways but at least we don't have these
Yeah, it's mot that hard
We have On, Ona, Ono for singular and Oni, Ony, Ona for plural, but the declination is different for male, female and neutral "gender", so I can mostly tell
You mean if we know if a new word is masculine of the feminine
Yes we do, until it is in an official dictionary it is based on previous experiences and what people decide
Meme is masculine in Czech
It’s die ‘cause it’s feminine in Czech
Regardless, we do have gendered words and the gender just naturally comes to me (us)
It’s not that we feel the language’s soul or something, unlike in German, there are noun declinations, every word falling into one of them, depending on the combination of forms in different cases
It’s a bit of a loop logic, but through declension is how we find the category the noun falls in
Since OP wrote as examples _der, die, das_ in German and _le, la_ in French, I suppose that they meant articles connected with gendered nouns so _ten, ta, to_ in Czech
However, these are not articles in the same way as in English, German etc
(even though it serves similar purpose of stressing out that you're talking about a particular thing)
Also, we don't put anything in front of general nouns (*a* cat etc
Yes, but this is usually connected to determining the correct form of adjective to be used with each noun
It has nothing to do with articles
So, what are articles
Not sure if it's eqully common, but one can find them here in popular hiking areas
Yup
They are mostly from Germany, the UK and Sweden
They are romantic/soap opera (Rosamunde Pilcher, Danielle Steel)
The german films were mostly shot in the mountains and I watch then purely because I like the scenery
I watch them with my grandma
There is also a lot of detective films (Rex and Alarm für Kobra 11 are VERY popular)
There are also some turkish soap operas
I love the Magnificent Century, because of the history aspect of it
These films are my guilty pleasure lol
Fun fact: My friend wrote a fan fiction about Kobra 11, because she likes Tom Beck
Do you mean if our TV participated in Eurovision Film Week and similar things
then yes
We have few of them
Some children animations (I don't remember the names, but they were from Spain, France, Italy,...), some soap operas/romances (like Inga Lindström, 1001 Nights) Action (Cobra 11), Sci-fi (Doctor Who) etc

Right on brother
Usually from around 15° C and more, doesn't need to be sunny
I despise anything above 22° C as it is too hot for me and I wear shorts even when it snows outside (so anywhere from -5° to 15°), granted, only for short amount of time when I walk my dog but still, I'd rather freeze than burn and sweat lol
If I'm working or walking around lets say 15C, if it's not windy
But for sitting down for longer time  - 23C at least
around 10°C as long as the wind isn't too bad
I know this isn't the norm and a lot of people call me dumb cause of it but I don't see much of a problem walking short sleeves outside in that
Depends how long I am outside
Under 5 minutes it can be in negatives (but above -10 degrees), over 10 minutes above +10 degrees and over 30 minutes above 15 degrees
The God died
I feel like Charles IV
is considered the real "hero" here in Czechia, often called "Father of the country". (Pater patriae)
Gabčík and Kubiš, operation anthropoid
Tomáš Garrique Masaryk
1st president and of the what we can call founding Fathers (They called themselves Maffia)
Milan Rastislav Štefánik
Part of the mentioned Maffia
Jaromir Jagr & Karel Gott
Radetzky was Czech
I get that we were all part of Austria empire, but yk I think he is not austrian 'national here'. Sadly he is not national hero of Czech Republic either
Basically everybody connected with monarchy was forgoten
I believe his father, Jan Lucemburský (Johann von Luxemburg), was of the Luxembourg dynasty
We see him as a Czech (also because his mother was Přemyslid)
Charles himself was a very cosmopolitan person, and spoke French, German, Latin ad Czech
And no, his dynasty was not German, but French speaking, and he himself spent his childhood in the French court, so I don't see much reason to regard him as a German
Czechs see him as Czech
Sorry
You cant call Prague 'german town'. In that time over 70% inhabitans in Prag were Czech
Yes, due to Josef II action, the most spoken language there was German
But that doesn't say anything about nationality
Do you call  Kenyan who speaks english English
Of course he studied in Viena
Vieana was center of empire, the most  prestigious school was there
And as you said, he was noble
Of course he spoke mostly german
He was noble
Everybody in Austrian army spoke German
And about his nobility
He was actually from Czech low nobility, with mostly czech ancestors
&#x200B;
I can list you a lot of more arguments, but I don't thing it would convince you
So I will tell you what he wrote
It was to inhibitans of Berounský region and he refered to Bohemia as his ' beloved Czech homeland'. I can link you his letter, but it was written in Czech
And if you call  Radetzky  Austrian, because Bohemia was part of Austrian Empire, you should call Mozard German, because independent city of Salburg was part of HRE
But I get your with nobility
I just don't think it include low mobility like  laird
Yes every czech, moravian etc would be german then
I consider it it faulse logic tho
That was my point .
I disagree with your opinion on nationality in 19th century
If I am not wrong you refered to that   Groß/kleindeutsche Lösung thing
In that consil in 1848 Czech deputies protested againts Großdeutsche Lösung
And in same year Hungarians tryed a little independece revolution
That is a direct evidence that something like nationality like existed in Austrian empire
And about Radeszkys nationality
He clamied to be Czech, he talked to with his children in Czech
He was hero of Austrian empire for sure, of Austria of that day
But he is no hero for nowayas Austria
My dad as a 11-year-old helped distributing anti-Soviet leaflets during the Warsaw Pact Occupation of 1968 and my mum was the first to return the Communist Party membership card at her workplace in 1989
My parents participate in demonstrations in November of 1989 (first in Teplice, then in Prague)
Many ancestors fought in various wars (earliest one I definititely know about being Seven Years War)
Two of my great-grandfathers fought in WW2 - on opposing sides
One of them rode through home village of other one
My great-grandmother was a field medic during WW2
My great-grandfather made his apartment a safehouse for the resistance troops during the occupation by Germans and he got a medal for honor
Every member of my family who was alive at the time took some part in the velvet revolution in 1989
Yes, with the Velvet Revolution to be specific
First thing needed to mention is that the Party had a massive membership base, something above 10% of the population were members
People who wanted a higher education or applied for a leading position at work were often pressured to become members of the Party, this practice allowed the Party to have these people under control and also it discredited them in the eyes of political opponents
As many things, it wasn't offically mandatory and you could refuse if you wanted but there was always this phantom of possible retributions for your refusal so people who didn't care much and didn't want to be bothered just signed it
During the events of the November of 1989, many members publicly broke their ties with the Party by returning their membership cards which was seen as showing support to the revolution
My mum and her friend returned their cards right on Monday after the events of the 17th November
Everybody was like, "don't be stupid, things may still turn out bad and you'll be super fucked" and she said she no longer cared but after a few days when it looked better, most of other employees began returning their cards as well
We used to be a part of the HRE, but it would just sound silly otherwise
Exactly 0,000000000000000000 times periodical
Prague became the capital of the HRE during the reign of Charles IV
, in fact
You kind of forgot about like a dozen of Czech kings that were also Roman emperors
However you are right, we only joined one such entity and been in it for 800 years
McCoffee
In Europe we have that small isolated part of McDonald's where we can get coffee, smoothie or some dessert/cake/snack
There are cheesecakes, macaroons and some other stuff
Just like normal cafeterias
I was actually surprised when I didn't see that in US and some Americans I asked never heard of it
So I guess we have rather different approach in regard of food
Probably more civilized if u ask me
Proper (dark) [bread
Sensible gun laws
Metric system
I saw Polish school where kids around 16 learned how to shoot and repair Beryl, learned tactics and teamwork
In the meantime it was normal school/ gymnasium
Idk if Poland has gymnasium as one the school types
What else
Talking about Starbucks I bought few across countries
One in France, one in Spain and one in America oh yeah and also few ones in Czech Republic
Everywhere I ordered the same Caramel Macchiato and personally the worst was in Spain
A little better was in US
Best ones were my country and France and thinking about it
Best was really in Czechia
But I usually buy coffee in McDonald's or Czech version of Starbucks because it's much cheaper
What I heard no
I got into talk with some Americans that visited Europe and were actually sad it isn't thing in America
Our way is "na random"
In Czech it's sometimes 'soráč' (*so-raach*)
Both sorry and soráč are very informal tho
Used cars
Fixed price, mileage negotiable
Don't take the taxis from Prague airport to city center
Don't sign the petitions for disabled people when approached, especially if they are of the darker shade
Don't buy water at the Prague Castle, "cannabis/weed" anything from minimarkets, Absinth-anything anywhere
Don't buy anything off the kind black nigerian dudes in the city center, it's either bullshit, stolen or it's drugs
Don't eat out at the city center, it's all extremely overpriced
The whole city of Prague
Pořádný black Friday ne
It happens in Czechia as well
Same here in Prague
It's usually soms foreign gypsies
Oktoberfest is extremely expensive as it is, I can't image wiener wiesn being even more expensive than that
Jedině v AAAauto
I looked into Ukrainian car market when looking for classic car of certain model that's not common here
Germans buy new cars
Some get stolen and transported to Poland through Czechia
The totaled cars are sold to Poland and repaired
The crashed(but not totaled) cars are sold to Czechia
While in Czechia, they are either totaled and sold to Poland, where they are used to legalize cars stolen from Germany, or stolen to Poland for spare parts used to repair totaled cars
The cycle of cars
Bullshit
Škoda as a company and as a carmaker was a hot mess before the VW purchase
As of present, the cars and the company are at its peak and growing
Or do you seriously think that the Favorit, Felicia and 1st gen Fabias and Octavias were the pinnacle of Czech automaking
Scandinavian school systems are used as examples of successful non-discriminatory school systems here, exactly because there is no way to separate the smarter kids from the rest
>I wouldn’t visit it unless you’re going somewhere like Kruger National Park and nowhere else
I didn't know it was that bad
I've never been to an especially dangerous country, but most stories that I hear or read about tourists getting robbed and killed are about people who were clearly rich (in comparison with the standard of the given country) and looked like it
I wonder, if there's anything you can do to blend in and reduce the risk of getting mugged
After all, the average South African has to survive somehow, no
Which food in particular
Svíčková is love, svíčková is life
It’ll most likely be really hearty food, so use your preferred method of preparation for that
I’d suggest česnečka to start with, then svíčková if you like creamy sauces, or, my favourite, roast duck and fruit knedlíky for dessert
Hungarian and Czech goulash are so different I don’t think it’s fair to call it a copy
More like a inspiration
Theyre both good, but both so different
I'm the youngest sibling and youngest of all my cousins, so the most common game was "Ignore the little boy" where they were doing their own stuff and running away from me
Zvonkohra
It's when you ring on random people's doorbell and then you immediately run away, so they don't see who rang it
We played this exactly once
Mine doesn't anymore, because I'm now the tallest one
“Tři tisíce tři sta třicet tři stříbrných stříkaček přestříkalo přes tři tisíce tři sta třicet tři stříbrných střech
That’s a czech tongue twister, where “Ř” is a letter in czech alphabet that no foreigner can ever pronounce
Probalby "'žiš a co jako
" - Jeez, and like what
Nice, almost perfect translation :D now try pronouncing it xd
Almost :)
Same here
Liechtenstein
Yes, Liechtenstein
After WW2, Czechoslovak government stole some property in Czechoslovakia which belonged to the house of Liechtenstein based on the fact that "they were germans" (which is debatable) and "they collaborated with Nazis" (which is not true)
The property was not given back and in 1993, after the Dissolution of the Czechoslovakia, Liechtenstein refused to recognize Czech Republic as an independent state
Czech Republic acted in the same way and refused to recognize Liechtenstein
It took until 2009 for the countries to exchange diplomatic notes
The property of Liechtensteins is still not returned though
Most people in Czech Republic have no idea about this
What
This plot keeps getting crazier and crazier
Yeah, I would also be pissed off, if 80% of my country was occupied and actually somewhere completely different than the remaining 20%.
Yeah, yeah, I wasn't really serious
Pre-1989, we did not have Monopoly here due to its capitalistic nature which the USSR did not approve of, so we had another similar board game, still played today, called Dostihy a Sázky (something like Horseraces and Bets), where instead of buying businesses, you are buying horses, etc
It took Monopoly, simplified it a bit (not that much diversity in horse racing) and made it acceptable for a population living in a planned economy
Also, it looks much better than Monopoly, imo, which means a lot to me if I have to stare at a board for 5 hours in order to finish a game
As many said before : Dont be upset, man
But we have like five different games played with poker cards
I think most wildly spread is Prší. (raining)
Člověče nezlob se (Don't be angry man) and Prší (Raining) which is a card game
We have a game called dostihy a sázky (horse races And bets) And its like monopoly But with horses
I have such fond memories of hookah and backgammon in Turkey :)
We have the same game here, it's just called "don't be upset, man" (člověče nezlob se), this really brings back memories
If no big football club is important, then it's definitely Brno
I would say České Budějovice in English Czech Budweiser
The city where the beer brand Budweiser originated from
It’s the capital of the south Czech region
In Czech *linecké těsto* (Linzer Mürbeteig
) makes Linz (actually traditionally called ''Linec'' in Czech) quite known, probably even better known than Insbruck and Salzburg
It also helps Linz is closer to our borders
And [these] Christmas cookies
I always wonder if Linz has a museum or if you can buy Linzer Mürbeteig in every bakery
If so, I know where I’m headed after covid
Budějovice  are 8
Yeah, i wanna know too
of course it's a thing
Rakousko-Uhersko
Rakousko Uhersko
Rakousko-Uhersko
Rakousko Uhersko
Rakousko-Uhersko
Rakousko-Uhersko
Ma man
Osobně by mi nevadilo mít monarchu jako reprezentativní osobu
Mít formu nezávislosti jako Maďarsko, ale být součást císařství. Nezní to špatně.
Ale zas na druhou stranu Národní obrození mělo svůj důvod
Mít vlastní zemičku je krásné.
Full of austrian ogres
Sice je, ale nezávislé Československo vedlo k znásilnění nacisty a poté sověty
A rozhodně radši Karla Habsburského (vnuk posledního císaře) než-li Zemana
Kuk is czech onomatopoeia for 'look' (here/there)
It gets pretty funny, reading about 'look' army or 'look' ministry of finance
To jsem si neuvědomil :D to je podstatně horší.
To je pravda, i jako monarchista musím uznat, že se Slováci neměli nejlépe
There's no other way around it
We are cunts
If we don't know you, fuck you
Fuck you for being black, for being gay, for being rich or poor, for being different or too same as the rest
Fuck you for having power, fuck you for not wanting any responsibilit, fuck you for working for the government, for beeing employed, for beeing an employer or for not having a job at all
If we don't like a law/rule, fuck that, we will find a loophole or a way how go around it
However if you manage to get to us and befriend us, we really don't care about anything mentioned above and we will gladly drink beer with you
Fuck you if you don't drink beer
We overaly don't like foriegners, and we complain but don't do shit about it
> That we are lazy
Who is not lazy
Relaxation is more, ehm, relaxing than work
Haha replace cup of tea with coffee and ciggaret and you have a Czech version
There have been many smaller changes, but I'll go over the major ones
There has been a total of 5 constitution of both Czechoslovakia and Czechia - I include both, because technically, Czechia existed under the Federation since 1969, and both states are continuous
After the post-WW1 Temporary Constitution, 1920 was the year the first "full" Czechoslovak Constitution got adopted
It stayed during WW2 (the events of 1938 and after had been declared unconstitutional and the legitimate government continued in exile) and was replaced in 1948 by the communist May Constitution, that codified the hold over the country by the Communist party
It got repealed in 1960 by the so-called Socialist Constitution, that basically just added the word "socialist" to the name of the state
This one got greatly alterated in 1968 after the Warsaw Pact invasion, when the Federation laws were established
They were implemented as a sort of divide-and-conquer tactic of the new hardline communist regime, and national autonomy was practically just on paper, since only communist subservient to the party committee sat in both national parliaments
The Czech and Slovak republics under the federal one had been created, and were supposed to be given their own constitutions - it never happened though
After the Velvet Revolution, many changes were made, like stripping away the glaring communist relics, but a new constitution never was made, since by then talks of dissolving the federation had been underway
New national Constitution got created in 1992 and is in place today
Its most important changes up to now were the 1997 establishment of higher territorial units (provinces), the Euro-amendment of 2001, and the direct election of the president in 2011
As for changing the constitution, 3/5 majority of all deputies and then 3/5 of all present senators have to agree on it
There is currently no constitutional law on a referendum - the only one that took place was on the entry to the EU, and it was written as a one time constitutional amendment
about 8 times since fall of AH empire
What do you count as change/edit
If you count only complete changes then this number is too high
If you count all edits then this number is way too low
that's why I wrote about 8 and not exactly 8
basically just major events from this
But to add some of them and not all doesn't make sense if you talk about all changes
In czech its veverka
... and in slovak drevo kocúr :)))
Veverka
Well
there's no Ř in it
Veverka
But hamster (křeček) is much more [interesting]
I've heard you call them *drevokocúr* (woodcat) as a joke here, is there any truth to it
In czech translation scoia'tael are "veverky".. guess translator did not miss this connection
I’ve fooled many people by this
It's indeed a cognate with Latin viverra, both coming from PIE *wewer "small forest rodent"
The Crusade against Atom doesnt really make sense to me
And your minister of health attacking Czechs for their use of nuclear power
While I am as anti-commie and anti-PRC as one can be, it needs to be said that recognizing RoC as the legitimate Chinese government would be a big economic hit to any country
Despite all the hate they get, I really like Poland's current government
The country, at least for a tourist, looks awesome, clean
There is no trash on the streets of Warsaw, no homeless people, great schools with modern technology
Like I said - from what have I seen, it was awesome
And if that is the impression your country leaves on someone, i d say the government is doing something very good
Quite sure, I have spent a week in Warsaw and a day in Gdansk and Gdyna
I never saw someone here not keep them in a fridge
Maybe only if have their own eggs, but that's all
Fridge
Unless it's cold outside
Then we put them on the balcony to save space in the fridge
I store them in the fridge just as anyone I know
They are sold on refrigerated shelves in shops and fridges usually have got a dedicated shelf for eggs as well
Whether Czechia is a legitimate name or not, at least on the internet
How's there a discussion
Are there neuter nouns that end with an "a"?
I usually shop in Aldi because it's the cheapest
This
Also if EU is good or not
I mean, to make it worse, people say "Česko" overwhelmingly more than "Česká republika" in Czech, it's just English where they start having boundaries
It's more of an "sh" sound, isn't it
There's no "t" in there
I'd assume it being a foreign word is an argument for a feminine noun, since -a is sort of an "international" feminine ending
Although now I'm looking and you have "der Gorilla", "der Mozarella", and "das Straciatella". Dear god
Tbh our official short name should literally just be the flag emoji
Yeah, that's not "ch".
There kinda is though, the "ch" sound is like pronouncing "t" + "sh" at the same time
Czech doesn't sound the same as tjek
Compare the Czech words [šel \(shel\)] and [čel \(chel\)] Granted the "sh" is not the same as "tj" but it's closer to it than "ch".
So many people will think its Phillipines
So let's make it "řř"
I traveled Prague to Copenhagen by night train it was fine
But I was uni student at that point
I would definitely fly as I have family now
Prague Porto we flew
That's quite a distance
Lots of it depends on the train availability
I wouldn't mind traveling to Hungary from Czechia even with a child
It's a single quite comfy train ride
Anything over 12h with no sleeper is a plane
19h from Rome to Prague killed me (broke down twice) and I assumed there would be a cafe on board so was starving, I settled for a can of coke and a bag of crisps from a stop in Vienna (this is not good food at 7am
I've never traveled by train abroad (mostly because there wasn't any reason), but I'd like to
To the bus or plane, if the travel by bus is more than 12 hours I'd rather take the plane
Price is an important factor for me
Trains tend to be the most expensive option in many countries
Even the train ride from the airport can be more expensive than the flight itself
This issue can be avoided by buying the ticket well in advance
When traveling in buses, I prefer 8 to 12 night rides
It saves time and money, I don't like to waste time at the airports
Overally I often choose flying as I can't afford any other option
Comparing just comfort, trains would be the best
I hardly travel by train domestically and will unlikely use train internationally
All my previous experience with international train travel was just uncomfortable waste of time and money
Ye, I noticed it ended about a year after my Erasmus in Denmark
Quite a shame
True, but that lasts only for a time
If I remember correctly the train ride to Denmark was 13 hours
Which compared to 1,5 hour by plane is too much for a younger child
You can put a movie on and they'll be okay
But with the far longer train ride not even double Frozen marathon will save you
They'll be tired and insufferable
The true is there is really no socialist country in Europe
Definitely not the countries in the north nor the countries in the East are socialist
Not even Belarus is socialist - it's just plain authoritarian
Some people would say that Transinistria (which is an autonomous republic in Moldova) is *the last bastion of socialism* in Europe, but under the layer of its flag with hammer and sickle lies a corporativist state
It is interesting how USA forgot what was cold war about and who was  their enemy back then
And it is just 30 years ago
In one episode of the latest seasons of the Simpsons, the Simpsons flew to Denmark and Lisa said Denmark is a socialist country lol
>  in every communist country in history
was there any in recent history
One example is from Spiderman:homecoming, where they were in Prague and there was this weird south-american festival thing going on
I have no idea what that was suposed to mean, also the opera is about 300meters from the square the monster was on :D
According to foreign movies and TV shows, there is a big shootout between CIA and FSB (aka KGB) agents every night in Prague
From time to time, other intelligence services join the battle
It usually starts in secret underground dance club, when hacker meeting went wrong
Then there is a long car chase through the city with use of automatic weapons
Usually it ends with a big explosion
I guess you didn't have a dinner on the roof
Not a movie, but they nailed it in The IT Crowd
Or stupid people who refuse leave Midsomer despite it is full of murderers
>  tradition of fookdancing
They dance and fook
Love Actually
The monster was on square 100 km away in Liberec :D
Otherwise festival imho should be atempt of portraing Signal festival
But it looks completely different in reality
Well Karluv is mostly empty from around 2am, but yeah the russian wheel maybe on naplavka
shiit, didn't play
Putting on wishlist
Except the insanely bad google translate level translations
It was a bit embarassing honestly
It's against the popular belief, but most of the victims of the witch trials happened (1) not in medieval times, but in late renaissance and even in relatively modern times (1600s, some even in early 1700s) and (2) not in Catholic regions, but Protestant ones, like in Germany, Switzerland, and even England, Sweden and the US
I am Czech and dont really like beer
I feel you
Yep
It should be festival of light
so probably
WTF, do they still use commie addressing in the army
The only one I know about, that's why I wrote "and even in".
I learned it between 3 and 4
Most Czech kids learn cycling before elementary school, typically using auxiliary side wheels
I learned pretty young, probably around 5 y/o, with support wheels
However, I haven't ridden a bike in ages
Or rather, I've rode it once in last like 12 years
It was last year, my parents got those electing bicycles and I wanted to try it
I had trouble even getting on it and getting going
But once I got on, the muscle memory kicked in and I was going somewhat fine
Though I completely forgot how to shift
And I hated it
My ass hurt for next few days
I'm never getting on a bicycle ever again
Some wars in Middle ages or early modern age wars
For example: Bohemian wars and 30-year war
That would be a really great video game
The 30-years war would be best if it took place in Bohemia
I really hope KC:D will have a sequel some 15years later
WHEN THE CRUSADES COME
Damn Swedes, invading us all
We probably need Denmark and Finland in this group, probably more :D
Germans-skopčáci
The Germans our ancestors met came from mountains, s kopce=from the hill, can be offensive
Also Slovaks, Bratři, or Bratia
We have a slur for Germans, the word
“skopčák”.
A bit of etymology-
Z kopců - from the mountains (since a lot of Germans lived in the mountainous area of Sudetenland)
I often hear Germany being called “Říše” - reich/empire
We also call germans Skopčáci as mentioned before and french žabožrouti - frogeaters
I heard it in Czech dubbed movies
Last time in Taxi Taxi
We call you "pšonci"
Also žabožrouti (frog eaters) for the French,  although that is quite offensive
Bratia = Bros
Or Maďaři (Hungarians)
>'Tschechei'
It's also percieved as mildly offensive here and often connected with Nazism and the way they called us during the Protectorate era, ["Rest-Tschechei"] (after they conquered the borderlands)
The word also accidentally resembles our word *čekej* ("Wait
") as in a command you give to a dog which doesn't add much to its popularity
Yeah, forgot that
Looks that way
Well
Rise of NSDAP and Hitler
Münich fucking betrayal and then 1939 and Poland
We mostly went away from battles and operations
There was D-Day, Stalingrad and Kursk but not much else
Also assassination of Heydrich followed revenge of Germans by burning villages like Lidice
Our teacher was women so she pushed more emotional point of view on war
Holocaust was her main topic for most of the time
I had to do presentations myself on tanks, planes, equipment and notorious battles
Sadly the after war history is kinda
well blurry
we dont really learn about what happened after war
About the commies I mean
1948, 1968 and 1989
I think thats a bad thing
The Hussite Rebelion and the Hussite Wars
Romanticized both by nationalists and communists .
The husitte revolution
It was a religious uprising that happened after Jan Hus was executed
Its celebrated because the peasent destroyed like 3 crusades but people tend to make them into some egalitarian heroes or even communist which are also idealized a lot
1st republic
But that era was highly prosperous for Romania
Plus reigns of Přemysl Otakar II
, who became a Duke of Austria for a while (but that's more of an interwar thing), and obviously emperor Charles IV
I'd say that the First Republic is far more often used as the "goold old days".
Why
What happened thats to be celebreated
The thing is, Slovakia was sorta kinda promised federalisation back when Czechoslovakia was being formed
But once it had been a thing, federalising was a dangerous precedent
There was more Germans in Bohemia than Slovaks in Slovakia - so as far as the state was concerned, there was a langer 'Czechoslovak identity', for the sake of being bigger and better than Germans
An organised German substate was something fiercely fought against during Austria-Hungary, and by extension, federation was not on the list
Slovakia of course had a strong desire for federation anyway, and strong catholic presence in politics (that was against the secular nature and separation of church from the state)
So when they did become satellited by Germany, many viewed it as a win, considering catholics got into power, and you know, the first independent state kinda drives people
But the reigns for Charles IV and Přemysl Otakar II
were actually succsesful and good for their people
The Hussites really werenn't.
Ducks: quite common, readily available in bigger supermarkets
Geese: much more expensive
Usually available during the Christmas season only or in the biggest supermarkets
Quails: eggs are readily available, the bird itself is quite rare, but you can find it in biggest supermarkets
Pigeons: not a thing
EDIT:
Turkey: never sold whole, but parts are available in bigger supermarkets
Pheasants: only frozen ones and quite rarely
Available at wholesale retailers
Duck is a staple of Czech cuisine and is very common at home and in restaurants
It's usually slow roasted and served with cabbage and dumplings
It's one of my favorite foods
Since it's such a heavy dish, it's more commonly eaten during and around the winter months
Goose is traditionally eaten on St
Martin's day (11th of November here) as part of a feast
It's usually cooked and served in the same ways as a duck, it's just bigger
Quails and pigeons aren't that common these days, I've never had either, but I think they used to be eaten more commonly
There's also pheasants which are eaten during hunting season - they're pretty good although they tend to be pretty dry
Turkeys have also made their way into Czech cuisine as well but nowhere near as common as chicken or duck
Same in Czechia, goose with wine is the best thing about my nameday
Most (can be translated as Bridge) is one of the ugliest, typical communist architecture and poverty
Chomutov and Jirkov most likely
Now listen, these cities are both good looking in certain parts of the city, but there are so many ugly parts in those cities, that it almost outbalances the good parts
Mainly the "sídliště" (flat region) in both these places
I have family in Most, I've been there a handful of times in my life and I have always thought it was the ugliest city in the country
That was until I visited Karviná for the first time last year
Eugh
Honorable mentions: Ústí nad Labem, Trmice, Ostrava, Nový Bor, Česká Lípa
Most also has a Romani ghetto/hood called Chánov, which
isn't the nicest looking place by a long shot
Most cities in Sudetland, like Ústí nad Labem, Nový borl, or Jablonec nad Nisou have a kind of run-down feel about them
Another honorable mentions: Strakonice, Břeclav, Moravský Krumlov
I’m from trmice and actually trmice look great (i’m not saying great like great but it looks way better than for example ústí nad labem) but most people when they think of trmice actually think about a part of ústí nad labem called předlice but if you look at trmice i don’t know of any part that actually looks bad
Břeclav was honestly pretty nice, at least the center
Although I've been there during the summer, that might've helped the appearance a bit
Uff, sorry, I confused you guys with Předlice
That was the one suburb of Ústí I was thinking of
It’s allright many people do that (about half of ústí does it) so i don’t take it badly
When you speak Moravian Czech, people think that you're some peasant
Moravians may chuckle at it occasionally, but in general our accents aren't all that strong
And in cities, you're used to meeting people from all over the country
We have that same with Moravian accent
When you speak like that, people think that you're some peasant
Economy says that climate change is the biggest business opportunity, dont worry, everyone want´s to have their piece of pie
Cause politicians don´t know shit about anything, they can´t even repair roads, I have no idea why someone would expect them to know or even do something intelligent about climate
I mean at least in our parliament, majority of those dudes never really had a real job, and they have no real field of expertise
i/y is common as there is no difference in spoken language, similarly "mě" and "mně" is pronounced exactly the same
Also some people try to follow English rules for ordinal numbers, writing "1ní" ("první") like the English "1st" (first) but that is really crazy and the only way to write correctly is "1
", "2
" etc
Byste × by jste
*mě* vs *mně*
There is one that boils my blood
It’s not technically grammatical, but here it goes:
There are signs in public places that remind people to “watch their belongings”:
„Hlídejte si vaše osobní věci“
It’s **SVÉ** osobní věci, you fucking illiterate imbeciles
Try to put it into singular
„Hlídej si tvoje věci"? I think not
It really bothers me way more than it should
> Le instead of lo/la and vice versa
First make up your own mind
I gave up totally, it appears that no one is using the schoolbook "le for dative, lo/la for accusative". Some always use le with people, in some cases I failed to find any logic behing the usage at all
Also S and Z
I thought  the rule is easy: if it's "что делатЬ", then -тЬся, for "что делает, что делают" it's -тся
Wouldn't that be correct in the case of a group of people mutually watching their belongings
Thus that imperative sentence would be more general, but I'm not sure, it's late
(non-native here)
* por qué? == why
* porque == because
* (el) porqué == (the) reason
* por que =~ something between 2nd and 3rd, as far as I understand
Ordinal numerals are also declined in Czech, but in the written form you put a period behind the digits, that's the grammar
If the numeral can be read both ways (either ordinal or cardinal), i.e. behind a name (e.g. _volume 2_, _page 17_, etc
) it's without a period
If you make adjectives which contain numerals, you don't make a space between digits and the rest of the word (if you want to use digits), e.g. _80% alcohol_ vs _20 % accrued_ (yes, you can substitute the particular words for the percentage symbols)
byste is Conditional mood which is often misplaced with by jste which is plural would be
[čtvrthrst]
The latter is simply a hypercorrect form (i.e. incorrect) of the former
It shouldn't be used ever
> "одеть Надежду, надеть одежду"
questionable mnemonics
Not better than одеть одежду, надеть Надежду, maybe even worse because the first letters don't match
Yes
Sorry for your experience, I know very well from mine that starting from some point people don't correct you, what makes progress quite problematic
Well it's written down there (č is _**ch**ase_; and if you can say the trilled r, you'll just say all the letters in succession and that's it), basically if you have a lazy and/or untrained tongue and you make schwa vowels around some consonants, ~~you done fucked up~~we'll be able to tell
However, you could try [scvrnkls] it's one consonant shorter
Yes they are legal if they are a part of the school plan
In my final year one semester will be intership 4 days, school 1 day
They can be unpaid as long as we don't do any productive work (aka do actual work for the company)
Manhattan is definitely something else, it's enchanting to be completely surrounded by massive buildings and skyscrapers, and the city feels so bustling and alive
I definitely need to visit again some time after this craziness is over
It's definitely a vibe
When I was in New York I was expecting a dingy rugged rattling metro and that's exactly what I got
Wouldn't like to commute by it though
Richie Rich - Sám doma a bohatý - Home alone and rich
In Czech it’s smrtonosná past
Lethal trap
Wouldn't it be lethal trap
Because of lethal weapon - smrtonosná zbraň.
I got hit by a car and the guy drove away without providing any aid
They never caught him
I think I lost the last debit card, no clue what happened with that, but I think I lost it rather than somebody stole it
The more when no money were missing and nobody tried to pay with that
Other than that, no
The less of violent crime
A bycicle was stolen from my friend once, but that's all
Gypsi kids from my town stole my bike when I was a kid
A prostitute snatched a phone from my neck when I was in elementary in exchange for used Sparta prague tickets
Thats about it
Our baby stroller has been stolen from the lobby of the apartment building where I live
somebody stole my scooter when I was 10
I'm not the biggest rap fan, but I love [Galantní Jelen by Vojtaano]
[Please don't kill me it's catchy
*Promovaní inženýři*, especially because at one point the lyrics go "*I'm bright, my sister's not*" and as the younger, less bright sister, I identify with the statement
My brother's got an Ing while I'm working towards mine, but even once we both have the title, it's going to be clear who the brighter sibling is
Oh and pretty much anything from Čokovoko, especially *Sebevražda* and *Etapy v životě ženy*. The music is so bad but the lyrics are so smartly crafted and so hilariously Brnoesque
Záviš is also a big guilty pleasure since his lyrics are so obscene, but the classical instruments he uses to convey them are really nice
As for Germany, my go-to is *Moskau*. I may regret confessing this but I know the lyrics to *Dicke Lippen*. I read the lyrics shortly after I started learning German and was encouraged by understanding them (because they are do fucking stupid)
It's 6 years old
I'm old
How could I forget *Mám v p... na lehátku* (perfect OST to housework) and  *A já sprostá*.
We have word for it too
Same like Fatherland or Vaterland
In Czech its called Otčina - Otec means father
Deux, Rex, Patria
Czech word for vaterland/rodina is "vlast" as in vlastenectví=patriotism
Just for non-czech redditors
To make it a bit more clear, here are direct/literal translations:
* fatherland — otčina
* motherland — matčina
* homeland — domovina
* ~eigenland, the land proper — vlast
In sense of country it is vlast but direct translation is otčina
Although it is rarely used
Nice one
Also Honor makes more sense now because Rex is king
Both Vaterland and Rodina translate to Vlast
I know
lmao that's just a normal ass window bruh
i haven't really seen any other type here
i'm originally from Toronto so yeah when I first saw em I was buggin too
That's a normal window
The only difference is that nowadays there is one handle for everything; 30 years ago the windows had a handle for opening and a lever in the bottom corner to switch between horizontal/vertical
100% For new buildings these days
Only if you live in city center and look of the building is protected by historians, you have to have regular wooden ones
Windows in usa are not plastic, we have to conserve energy, because energy is more expensive in europe
Same is with door knobs
I dont know why every american have the ball ones
we have these everywhere
I don't think I have ever encountered a window in Europe that couldn't do that, up until now I thought that was the norm
> faux wood finishing
Why do you think it's faux wood
This mechanism is used in modern wooden windows as well
Yeah, they are definitely more expensive, which is probably why few houses have them (my parents have them, because they consider the plastic ones ugly)

Kovy makes some of the finest content in Czech Republic
I think
I can't think of someone more rational on the small Czech YouTube scene
PLASMO, a very talented model maker, with very down to earth approach
McGamerCZ, a Warframe Youtuber
I only watch his stuff when I return to Warframe, but he's friendly, informative, to the point and doesn't scream
Coincidentally, they both make content in English (though Plasmo used to make them in Czech)
Stejk
Probably the most down to Earth and cool one
I enjoy Tartarus Cast
Love that guy
As usual as for women
Usually more formal meeting, or meeting of two families, meeting for the first time
In casual setting, usually no
Friends definitely don't. Distant relatives who you don't see often
Yeah, you can shake hands
If it's in any way a bit more formal or business context, always shake hands
In Czech rep I feel like it depends how well do you know the person - if it is a formal situation then you would most likely go for a handshake, but if it is your friend you would use some kind of other greeting - it might be a hug, just saying "hello" or holding hands "in reverse" and bumping into each others shoulder
We used to shake hands as first thing at work everyday
Definitely a cat person
It is more common to own a dog than a cat in the Czech Republic
The entire continent
Probably cats
I prefer cats
Dogs are fine, but I like cats more
I'm a cat person
Czechia is absolutely a dog people country, we have one of the highest dog ownership rates in the world IIRC
Dogs are allowed on public transportation, in pubs, basically everywhere
I would guess that the whole continent leans a bit more towards dogs, but not as much as most Czechs
How much is the dog tax, just out of curiosity
We have fees for owning dogs too (60-80€/year in my district, plus chipping became mandatory this year), but that doesn't seem to affect their popularity at all
I feel like it doesn't even really compare to all the other costs of owning a pet
My mom is really afraid of dogs, so we can't have any
She can tolerate cats, but she is terribly afraid of dogs

[Sencor] \- not B2B but a lot of people doesn't know it's Czech
Doppelmayr is pretty well know imo since there's no spot on the ski lift where you wouldn't find their giant logo
And Glock is not doing just B2B business
not reliant but it makes things comfortable
Idk if it counts because this is more of a bizzare situation rather than law, but one Czech family got robbed
Theyve put up cameras to get some evidence in case robbers return
I think one or more robbers returned and their face/s got captured on camera
Quick trial and off to jail, right
Wrong
The camera had evidence of robbers face but it also had partial view on square which is public space
And having private camera overlooking public space is illegal
in the end the robber attacked their evidence
The family ended up fined
I dont know where the robber ended up
EDIT: typo
Balkans end with Slovenia, Hungary and Romania
The question is whether you include these three countries as well
Does anyone consider Istanbul to be a part of the Balkans
If you do, I choose Athens as my pick as well
Even though personally I like Sarajevo the best
Over my dead body
Prague is the most important city of the Balkans and also its center
Digging in our backyard will not reveal some fascinating artifacts (unless you are superlucky, but in general these areas are elsewhere) but just some abandoned cemetery or some abandoned stuff dated up  to 15th -16th century (or older if you are lucky)
A building from 1880 would be just a default building where I live, whole area was rebuilded during 1880-1910
Well, digging down in your garden will probably give you nothing
But in almost every village you'll find a landmark of some sort - a calvary, birthhouse of a famous person, a memorial to the fallen of World Wars
And every 15 km at least you'll pass by a castle or a chateau - I walk by two every morning when going to town square alone - Old and New (because why settle for your old folks home when there's enough place to build a mega-mansion in their backyard eh
And yes - every once in a while something happens related to earlier history in my tiny town of 8
000 people
A hotel fell through the ground in the town square a few decades back because everyone forgot about some medieval cellar for storing beer barrels it was built on
An escape tunnel going down to the town river was uncovered a few years back going from the Old Castle
Every once in a while construction has to be halted in nearby villages because they uncover a few medival coins and pottery shards - in the ground or in old walls
Depends how much you look for details, but I don't think, that we have many blindspots
There are chronicles, some official documents from inside and outside (mostly HRE), there are holes, but we moreless know what happened
At least as far as I know
We have Lítačka card here, which with you use Prague public transport in PID P zone, if going beyond P zone, you have to buy aditional ticket for small charge (like 50 cents
) You don't have to put the card against the chip when entering, you can be controled by controler, if you don't have coupon on your card, or a marked ticket, you'll get a fine (about 70 euros
) The controls are pretty much random, so lot of people get away with riding withnout a ticket
In my city I have an annual ticket that I buy online
Outside of that I'd probably use cash or mobile apps
It's same in czech (obviously) - sýr, which means cheese in english
"Do you have /insert any regular equipment everybody has the last 30 years/ since you are some central Russia village or something
Don't do any Czech word puns (unless you are 10 years old or younger)
And then there's those horrible "czech" puns
"Oh, you're from the Czechia
I visited Prague three years ago
I am not one of those Czechs who hate on Prague, but if it's literally the only thing anyone knows, it becomes a bit irritating to hear about it
Happened to me with Pavel Nedvěd in Rome
I laughed embarassingly lot at "Don't touch my spaghet
Oh I remember this one time I got invited to a "Russia-themed" party by a girl from Scotland
Of course everyone came dressed as fucking Stalin
Don't worry, at least we know you well, because you are the pun of another annoying "cliché" I very much hated
- "Where are you going on vacation this summer
" "We are for  Malta
" Because malta - mortar in Czech, usually meaning you are going to work on the house (or "Malta and Písek", Písek being one town and also sand)
But I hated it so much because of the personal meaning "our dad made up some stupidity he won't finish again and we end up home the whole summer working on something unnecessary he wants while he proudly and openly proclaims buying material for his idea is so much better than trip over the border, since he as truck driver was already there anyway".
The absolute peak of comedy: *Czech yourself before you wreck yourself/have you Czeched/do your stores take Czechs/Czech it out*...

Interesting how Americans talk about their wages a year and by a month
That was actually amusing
We got a lot of hatred from some Americans a couple of years ago because of a bombing that took place in Boston
It was done by Chechens
Haha, got me
I guess you're right
It just gets kinda tiring, if it's always the one thing, that's all
Whoa, I'm all for some fun pokes at each other, but I don't wanna get murdered by a drunk would-be Soviet at a party
Obviously is Luxembourgeoisie
Ehhhh, I literally don't know what you're talking about
>you're jealous of the sea
because we are (and all these plans to make a tunnel to the sea says so, including Croatia where 8 or 10 % of our population goes every year because of their sea, and they have to compete with charter flights to Turkey/Morroco/Tunisia/Egypt/insert anything you know from TUI catalog)
It is just not the Baltic sea we are jealous of (and yours North sea doesn't really makes any difference, Rügen island wasn't a dream destination not even during socialistic times) So the question "how is our acces to the sea doing" from Poland have only answer "yeah, it is better than yours because we have it closer" :)
Should used "beer mug broken over his head"
Luckily not the company I'm longing for
Gotta invent a new drink, Trockij on ice

He was drunk of course, he decided he wants to sing Deutschland by Rammstein
But I dunno if he got the lyrics right, since he started yelling "Deutschland, Deutschland über alles"
The fact he could be described as, what I would describe as very tanned, made the sight ever weirder
>in Dresden chances aren't slim that people would sing along
My English isn't the best, does that mean that they would or wouldn't?
Luckily he didn't know about Auferstanden aus Ruinen

We're crazy about anything we're good at (mainly Ice hockey)
That's when Czechia plays against Russia
It's basically national holiday everytime we win
Hasn't really happened for the past few years I think tho
We are very touchy when it comes to anything with Russia
Or Russia
We’d drink the most beer yet we’e be the least drunk ones
We would bring our own food, neatly packed from home, to be on the safe side, then drink beer all the evening and return home with food from the table messily dumped in our bag because, hey, it would be a waste to leave it there
We'll be fighting over every piece of pizza with Slovakia, then complaining about everything, pointing at Germany and Russia, gossiping about others, went over to table where Great Britain is sitting, scream at them they betrayed us, get's back, get's blackout drunk with Slovakia, went home, calling them "my brother" singing various traditional songs and state anthems
It would go south pretty quickly and we would end up with Ireland, Germany and Russia
Each country trying to outdrink the other 3
No doubt
Dunno why but Jára Cimrman was completely removed from our history
For example when Alexander G. Bell invented telephone
Bell had already 3 missed calls from Cimrman

Breaking bad can work well in Czech setting
Meth is produced and consumed here (it was even mentioned in original show), and Mexican cartel can be replaced with Vietnamese gang
Instead of dessert, it can take place in border mountain regions
Let's make a movie about independence war or civil war and ruin it completely
That we "changed" our name to Czechia
Every time someone mentions the Czech Republic, you can see someone else commenting "I heard they're called Czechia now". The fact is nothing was changed, only a short name was officially codified  and added into the UN list of country names
"The Czech Republic" is still a correct long name just as "the French Republic" is as correct as "France".
Every UN member is supposed to state its long name and the short name in the country's language and in the official UN languages
Back in 1993, a Czech short name "Česko" and an English short name "Czechia" (respectively French "Tchéquie", Spanish "Chequia" etc
) were proposed but government couldn't agree on it so a compromise was made and we stated only the Czech name and left the rest blank until we would come with better alternatives
Twenty years passed and we didn't come with anything better so we filled in the original proposals
/r/Prague is "shit expat says" from time to time, it is quite interesting to see in how big bubble they are living
They never heard of all those ships, airplanes, the whole quisling thing

Dear Americans, if you want to take inspiration of European health system, please get inspired by Norway, Germany, Italy, Romania, Albania
All are much better
Seriously
Yeah lol listening to Austrian radio wasn't exactly something rare in commie CZSK
Communism was pretty shit but like come on haha
hard to say, it is English speaking sub so you have no idea where are these people from
There is one british person I can say he is totally living here not just expating
On the other hand it is couple days ago I've read total nonsense about how health insurance is paid here from fellow Czech
Do you think they are just stupid or is it misinterpretation of permittenttrafik by some tour guide

Yes, that's a big problem everywhere

Does your country have a tradition of sending children to summer camps
Yes, almost everyone is send away for 2 weeks in summer
You usually live in tents and do a lot of fun actvity stuff while there
You usually go to the same camp with with the same people every year until you are ~18
You make good friends there which are usually scattered across the republic so you meet people from different towns etc
Some people keep going there as workers once the turn 18, so you can keep in contact
Very fun tradition :)
some of them was "international", was somewhere in GDR together with Hungarian and Poles back then and  Germans, poles and Hungarians were going here as well
Parents worked for same organization, just in different countries
What is SVC
Best subreddit, hands down
Twice a year for a check up as you are supposed to
My mum is a dental nurse so she makes sure I never skip
A lot of people I know however seem to visit a dentist only when they have got a problem and often haven't even got their own dentist which then causes troubles because there's a scarcity of them and many don't accept new patients
Twice a year for checkup and clean as that is payed from the public health insurance
Most people I know goes that often
Some only once a year
In Czechia- Twice per year to the dentist for check (its included in your insurance) and twice per year to dental hygienist (paying this from my pocket)
My motivation is actually my dentist being angry if i don't go twice a year
And you don't want an angry person sticking steel instruments into your mouth
The assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, the Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia
He was the highest German official to be successfully assassinated during ww2
In the protectorate the only higher ranked nazi was Hitler, so it was a big deal
He as killed by Czech and Slovak paratroopers who were flown over the Protectorate by a plane in 1942
Well because we were part of your empire learn it well
It indeed took a Herculean effort to read all those reviews of 2016's Anthropoid without getting a hernia, what with half of them starting by calling the operation "obscure" and "unknown" and ending by concluding that "the movie reminds us that Auschwitz and the beaches of Normandy weren't the only places affected by WWII".
Yeah
So nice you dont need to calculate how big extortion you have to pay
So you dont even see this money
Its stolen directly from employer hand before it reaches you
So basically they steal 33% and you dont know about it
And after that you pay VAT and other "consumption taxes)" on gas, so you get ripped off twice or three times
How nice of them

In the general Western European consciousness, an entire half of the continent just somehow sprung into existence in the 1930s, completely out of the blue
Though moving the date to 1990s isn't rare either
Guess that explains the permanent desire to teach random Easterners how to use a washing machine
It was abolished easily in 1990 as a part of major changes after the Velvet revolution (fall of the communist dicatorship)
It was also briefly abolished in 1787-1795 during the rule of Joseph II

Neutral is the best word to describe it
There are barely any latin amricans living here and I never met one
So czechs haven't been able to create a stereotype about latin americans
Not sure, probably neutral
Most of the things I have associated with these countries were related to things that popped up on r/watchpeopledie when it was still there lol but other than that no opinion on the people as such
The difference I was learned (and was named and from my experience was heavily used here) in late nineties was that expats were expatriated by their companies
Company I was working for moved me to UK (and then elsewhere) and everyone here and in UK call me expat
If I would pack my shit, hop on the plane and ask for job in the UK I would be an immigrant
no we don't shift holidays, both may holidays are saturday this year
I actually forgot that 1
is a holiday
and 8
(end of ww2)
I am surprised that you don't have end of WW2 as a national holiday
It feels to me as much more important holiday than May 1st
What the fuck
A) that will dull them real bloody fast and B) we use one of those roller things because we are not animals
let me go back on that
Most of us are not animals
Why have I never thought about this before
I already use scissors for many things in the kitchen where other people would never think about using them but never thought about cutting pizza with scissors
Scissors are a great tool, much more convenient to cut many things with them rather than with a knife
I second this
I think it's a bit sad that he's ranking so low

Praha (Prague) and Brno, our two largest cities always fight who is better and rest of the country is on one of the sides or doesn’t give a fuck about it, and as someone from Czech part of Czech Republic we always make fun of Brno and in Moravia it’s the other way around
There is Brno which is laughing stock for people from all of the country and then there is the capital- Prague which is a laughing stock from people from Moravia
But in the end we all know who's got metro and who's got black dildo on the main square
We also use it in Czech but we spell it skanzen
I guess Barandov Studio is the closest to what you're describing
Not to be confused with the tv channel ran by Jaromír Soukup
Also maybe Ateliéry Bonton Zlín, but those don't exist anymore
Prague (1
5 million), Brno (0
4 million), Ostrava (0
3 million)
Prague's official mottos had been the "head of the kingdom" and the "mother of cities", which gives you the idea of how self-important Praguers are
/s It has been the capital of Czechia and the largest city of the country for more than 1100 years
Brno is the second city (or the first village as some snotty Praguers would probably say) with a bit of an inferiority complex towards the capital
It is also a rather nice and livable student city
Ostrava used to be a little town until the industrial revolution kicked in
The once "steel heart of the republic" is now trying to shake off its "sooty" image
I'd say it's the other way around, Brno doesn't have inferiority complex, Prague has superiority complex
Everyone outside of Prague hates people from Prague and vice versa
I am from Prague
We do have mandatory vaccination
In czechai they are for quite some time
Sure, Elizabeth II=Alžběta II
To be precise, it is inconsistent
For one, her son is Prince *Charles*, but the beheaded one was *Karel* Stuart
But it's completely random who gets translated and who doesn't. Juan Carlos was Juan Carlos in Czech, not Jan Karel, but Felipe of Spain is Filip
Hans Adam of Liechtenstein is not translated (Jan Adam), but Margrethe of Denmark is Markéta
Yet king John of England is always translated as Jan
Pope Francis is also always translated as František and in general names of popes are always translated
There is pretty much zero consistency, which is pretty typical of our language in general
In Czech:
* John Lackland = Jan Bezzemek
* Richard Lionheart = Richard Lví Srdce
* Charlemagne = Karel Veliký
* William the Conqueror = Vilém Dobyvatel
* Henry VIII = Jindřich VIII
* Mary of England = Marie Tudorovna
* Phillip II of Spain = Filip II
Španělský
* Charles I = Karel I.
* James I = Jakub I.
I suppose ruling monarch names are much more likely to be translated
Prague isn't just cesspit of junkies, tourists, hookers and arogant people

Děkuji ti - (I) thank you (sg
Děkuji vám - (I) thank you (pl
or formal)
Děkujeme ti - (We) thank you (sg
Děkujeme vám - (We) thank you (pl
or formal)
Díky
Dík
Hvala sound like chvála - praise
Děkuji is more formal than děkuju
If you want to use only one use děkuji
In Czech grammar approximately 1/6 is germanisms
Brno dialect "Hantec" is a drunk mix of German and Czech, for example Zoncna (sun), Hózny (pants), Šalina (tram, derived from Elektri*she linie*) etc
Many of them, and generally they fall into two broad categories:
* the ones that got domesticated and don't feel German anymore (knedlík from Knödel, helma from Helm)
* the ones that are not domesticated, these are used in colloquial speech or slang and in formal settings another word being used: kšeft from Geschäft (obchod), ksicht from Gesicht (obličej), kvér from Gewehr (puška), hajzl from Häusel (záchod), piksla from Büchse (dóza, but it is German too), mašinfíra from Maschinführer (strojvedoucí) etc
Himlhergot, I can't remember any
flaška-Flasche (bottle)
A lot of, if those angainst which Jan Hus protested count
I came here to say this
Especially the Brno slang
If any Germans would like some examples would like some examples, just comment, and I'll reply with more tomorrow
Did you get really get that from Austria
Palačinka has quite [a long chain of loaning] and you could take a short cut
Please can you post examples
I’m unfamiliar with Brno slang :P
Yeah
The latter
The words from the second category belong to the Austro-Bavarian dialect group, since they are usually borrowings from Austrian German
EDIT: Another example for specifically Austro-Bavarian word, but this time fully domesticated and entered literary language: žemle from Semmel
Depends on what you consider long hair it ranges from very common to not as common
Long hair is pretty much accepted
I'd say it's not rare, but not exceedingly common either
I have long hair myself, and nobody really minds it
Also worth noting that having long hair was somewhat seen as being counter-culture under communism, which might be one of the reasons why it's so accepted
Not too common, but I am sometimes one of them
I get a hair cut once a few years
Nobody cares about anyone's hair
I would say it used to be more common up until maybe the mid-2010s, then it started dying out
I used to have long hair for a long time and I there weren't a lot of times people gave me shit because of it, but it happened a handful of times
That said, once I cut my hair to a much better haircut, dating became *a lot* easier
Yes, Czech people stare
It has probably not much to do with your appearance
They are bored because there is no view
So they look at something at least marginally interesting, aka
other people
It's not personal
They will forget you as soon as they get off the metro
You need to stare back deeply into their eyes to assert dominance
*Kudlanka*, derived from *kudla*, "jackknife". Praying mantis is then *kudlanka nábožná* meaning it's "religious".
The insect order is called *kudlanky* (would be *kudlanka* in singular) and the praying mantis is *kudlanka nábožná*.
Kudlanka - derived from the word "kudla" which means jackknife
"Kudlanka Nábožná"
It literally means "Religious Cricket" (or also Religious Mantis, but that's lame)
It's an example of [Euro English]
you mean a jump cock ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Nábožná indeed means religious
*Kudlanka* apparently traces its etymology to the word *kudla*, which means **jackknife** in reference to the shape of the front legs
Pretty cool name imo
magyar nyelvben is also pretty clear, "in hungarian language".
New world symphony by Antonín Dvořák, was even in spave
I think Je taime moi non plus is pretty popular also
[Moldau] is another well-known masterpiece
Damn that’s right
I wanted to go with Karel Gott and his Vcelka Mája or just generally with him, but I believe yours is WAY more famous
Or is it Škoda lásky, better known internationally as Beer Barrel Polka
I would also choose Modlitba pro Martu for the important role in our modern history
That we are part of Russia
Boils my blood
Eu favela)))
Merely German-speaking Czech province
This was terribly confusing for me while learning English - in Czech, Slovakia is Slovensko and Slovenia is Slovinsko
So I always wanted to say Slovensko, logically, as Slovenia at first
Some were executed or imprisoned, some were killed ehm
disorderly, some were deported to Germany or sent to Soviet union, some were blackmailed by communist police to become THEIR collaborators
Of course some innocent people were also marked as collaborators and vice versa
Not really possible to count
Hard to say, especially since the line is quite blurry
Does [zámek/chateau/Schloß] count
Does fortress/Festung count
Does [tvrz/fortified house] count (this one lost the tower)
Or [Arab guard tower]
Castles are everywhere
Just everywhere in Europe
A few dozen, mostly as a child
I got kinda bored with Czech castles by the time I was 9 or 10, to be honest, it was more of an excuse for my dad to go with me
He was the kind of person who'd always ask questions during tours and play the smartass
I also worked as a guide at a castle for one summer in high school
Jsem na tom stejně
Was it Trakai castle
People mention laptops as benefits
If you're given laptops to work on, it's not a benefit, it's a work tool
A phone (with subscription), a laptop and a car all free to use for personal use as well
Lunches are paid for by the company and since you included healthcare, that as well, although it's not really a benefit because it's mandatory
People don't scold me when I arrive late, which I do, even frequently so
And nobody really seems to care when I don't check work emails when not in work
That's pretty much all I need for a happy work life
The other stuff that people mention here like phones, laptops are a thing too, though I don't really need that
Sick days and food coupons are nice tho
5 (up to 10 depends) days off
8 sick days (without doctor note, max two in a row)
30 fully paid sick days (with doctor note)
fully paid public transport in Prague
sim card (which I have no clue where it is) with some tariff (I don't use and have it redirected to my personal number)  + some (midrange) Android phone for these interested
(or Blackberry)
about 2EUR daily contribution to meal vouchers
some monthly contribution I can recall the number (about 40 EUR in local currency if I remember correctly) to pension funds/ some other non meal vouchers up to your decision
better bank rates as it comes to interest on savings accounts, interest on loans, mortgages, credit cards, better exchange rates, better card benefit programs
Some discounts here and there, list is quite huge from theaters to coffee places, including access to Makro (known as Metro Cash & Carry elsewhere)
shitload of things and activities for childrens
yearly bonus, free working time and many things I can't remember right know or I don't even know these exists
Pension retirement insursnce (on top of state mandatory one)
Extra healthcare
100 % paid sick leave
Sick days 4 are standard, but if you need more, its not a problem)
Extra vacation above the state minimum
Bridge day (2x - basically extra holiday)
7hrs work day (9-17, 1hr lunch break)
Homeoffice (not really lol, its one day per month)
Meal vouchers
Multisport card
Discount on out products (16-33 %)
Activity vouchers valid in pharmacies, gyms, cinemas, some online shops etc
Also its possible to transfer unused vacations to the next year, so this year i am able to use 37 vacation days
I dont see a laptop/phone as a benefit since its usual work tool
Also none yells at me, none cars if i go early or come late, no e cares how i actually fill the attendance (none checks), if you need to leave mid day, you just tell the manager you are going to get a haitlrcut or whatever
And btw its an american company
As opposed to using your own laptop, or having to pay for job related trainings, certifications
> If I can use it privately, it's also a benefit
Curious trivia:
My work contract allows me to use office equipment for personal purposes "to reasonable extent" and in law-abiding manner, with one specific exception: I can not use it for watching porn, even out of the working hours
I would never do a job where it would be my responsibility to get a phone/laptop/certifications/whatever
It doesn't really work like that here, everyone has the same basic insurance which is mandatory, the services don't differ
You can have extra private insurance with the basic one (for example for dental medicine, which is not covered very well by the basic one), but it is not that common and very rarely provided by employers
True, but i work in a field where people are used to working outside of regular work hours (tourism, hospitality)
should wrote +5 (up to +10) above legal minimum
Yes Blackberry, we are still using this crap
Yeah, there are a lot of American companies that have this mentality
Not saying I like it
I have a friend who had to do required continuing education, and she has to pay for it
Weak
Sorry, but /u/Archidiakon is right
Yes, these letters (graphemes) are traditionally referred to as "vowels" in the English mainstream, however from a linguistic point of view, it is wrong
Last time it was maybe remotely true was before the Great Vowel Shift
Similar widespread mistake is to talk about "long vowels" when referring to eə eɪ aɪ ɔɪ aʊ ɪə ʊə. These are not long vowels (i.e. monophthong vowels with a greater quantity) but diphthongs
Let's agree that we both use a different definition of "vowel". Your definition would be frowned upon in the field of linguistics, mine would maybe confuse uneducated English speakers
nope, just drinking
Nah, Slovak is still fairly inteligible :^)
Eh, never had a problem understanding Slovak
Yeah, me neither
The Munich treaty - It allowed for later German occupation, which led to demise of many people capable and willing to resist undemocratic regime, which together with disappointment in behaviour of UK and France significantly eased the communist take over
The repercussions of communism still have large impact on the country as can be seen on  personified example of our PM
Well, the first thing that comes to mind are Husitte wars, but I'd say, that Czech National Revival is more important, because for few hundred years, only peasants were talking Czech-ish and this event changed everything
People started speaking Czech, started writing Czech books, poems, plays, ancient manuscripts and it really strengthened our national identity
> It's either 1866 and Austria's end of German hegemony after losing the war to Russia,
I believe you mean Prussia
Was Marianne that lady with her tit out
I see, thanks
When I was younger I didn’t like most of Czech food, because it’s mostly veggie sauces, but the more older I am the more I love them, but there is stil one think I wouldn’t ever eat, Prdelačka- soup from blood
Aspik, it's so disgusting
I don't know if it's the texture or the taste (probably both, to be honest) but I really hate it
Damn you just reminded me of it
One of my favorite foods that I haven't had in like half a year
Haha that’s my grandma’s favorite
Funny, here when something "jde do kelu", it means it's going into shit
One of my most favorite dishes
I have heard “jdu do kelu” only in Moravia, especially in Ostrava
Other end of the country but I hear it anyway
No, they are pretty much the same language with small differences
In CZE:
National Museum in Prague
National Technical Museum
Museum Of Public Transport
National Gallery
Czech RepuBRICK
Škoda Auto Museum in Mladá Boleslav
and practically any castle u see
We have more than 2000 castles, so enjoy
In Algeria:
I'm half Algerian, and I know this is AskEurope, but I think any information is good
Museum Of Fine Arts in Algiers
National Museum Of Arts And Popular Traditions
Museum Of Modern Art in Oran
Cirta National Museum
Martyrs Memorial and Mujahid Museum
I second [Technical Museum] I loved it as a child
It has small aircrafts suspended from ceiling of main hall
Also [Museum of Decorative Arts] in Prague is nice, if you like design
Its building was recently renovated, too
Same in Czech
Pretty common
I mean, it's def not at every second corner, but if a town has about 50-70k inhabitants, there will probably be a KFC
(plus many more in tourist locations, plus a few kfcs on highways)
In 2019, there were 105 KFC places, but earlier this year, they opened one near me so might be 106
40, so almost half of them are in Prague, and they have actually more restaurants than McDonalds, which had 101 in 2019
Very, every city with over 50k population has at least one KFC, and the bigger cities have several
Prague for example has dozens
Wow, TIL that our neighbors have almost no KFC’s whereas we have a ton of them
Interesting
Yeah, Czechs are batty about their KFC
When I went to school in Olomouc, my czech girlfriend took me to Brno
It was my first time to Brno, And we only went to the mall
She insisted we go to KFC because she loved it, and thought it would make me feel at home
I'd never had kfc in my life up to that point
Eh, I guess most people can cook to some extent, but way too many men still expect their girlfriends/wives to do it all the time
Some millennial men who cook like to present themselves as God's gifts to humanity because they know it's still not the standard
My father has almost like a phobia of even trying it - he was a stay at home parent for some time when I was a kid, he'd do all the cleaning and everything else around the house, but cooking was still up to my mom
I (female) also didn't learn much about cooking until I moved out for college, and I feel like that's not uncommon, in some families you're just expected to figure it out for youself later
Special family recipes and such aren't a big deal here IME, I just like
googled it
>  in some families you're just expected to figure it out for youself later
Thank you, up until now I thought I was the only one who experienced this
Weirdly, my family's refusal to teach me how to cook because I "would make a mess" was coupled with constant moaning how I'd be one day completely lost in the big bad world because, among many many other reasons why I completely sucked, I "couldn't even cook". The skill was supposed to just somehow be divined into my brain without inconveniencing anyone
That sounds pretty funny, NGL
Here, almost all restaurants stayed open and switched to offering delivery, maybe there would have been a lot more chaos in the last 2 months if that had been forbidden
It was shocking enough for Czechs to have no draft beer for so long
I've dated two Italian girls in my life and, ironically, the first one was the worst cook I've ever met
Her repertoire of dishes included completely wooden pizza, burnt eggs totally stuck to the frying pan and cereals spilled under the heater
Although, to be fair, she was very careful about pasta being al dente and everyone's pronounciation of Italian names of dishes
The second one wasn't a horrible cook and she took the "no corn or pineapple on pizza" thing very seriously, but she liked it with french fries on it
While I still love Italian cuisine, I've become a bit sceptical about every Italian claiming to be a cook
No offense
Same with "mess" being one of the reasons :D My mother luckily didn't blame teenage me for it, she just considered cooking fails a natural part of college life/early 20s, she'd joke about stuff like "don't worry, when I first invited your father for dinner, I made him spaghetti with ketchup and I thought that was so impressive"... My grandparents would ask if I went to the mensa regularly, so that "I'd have at least one hot meal a day", the idea of cooking as a student didn't exist to them I guess
I suspect it could have something to do with the older generations (and Czechs in general) relying so much on lunches in school and workplace cafeterias - you could basically go your whole life from preschool to retirement home eating in cafeterias, and for dinner, you could survive on some bread and butter every night until you got a wife to cook for you
I mean
we don't exactly have the healthiest eating habits compared to countries that love cooking like Italy or France
OMG, up until right now I thought my family was weird, that's exactly how I grew up down to the you'd-make-a-mess part
what weird aspect of our culture are we up to here
Right
I feel like I don't know almost anyone under 35 who irons
The only reason I own an iron is because my friend gave hers to me saying she was probably never gonna use it again
It's not that you can really "not know how to iron", but it's fucking pointless for most people
If something dries too wrinkly, I'll sooner chuck it into the washer again and try hanging it better the second time around, before I'm gonna iron anything
Hungary, maybe
It is the closest one
I guess Denmark, during summer they make up around 99 % of drunks on the streets of Prague, so they must be people of our culture
Honestly
None
Hungary would be the closest
Russia feels omni-present even though it’s quite far
I'd throw in Serbia, Croatia
Actually it was Yugoslav border right
All of the stans except Kazakhstan
Because we have a long-standing historical friendship as nations beginning with the alliance between interwar Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia, which was only tarnished when we buckled to political pressure and recognized kosovo
Czech republic considers diplomatic relations with Serbia as one of it's top priorities and is one of the few supporting and lobbying for Serbia's approval into EU
Here's a list of the big official meetings and co-ops between our two countries, politically and business-wise
[Bilateral relations]
I would rather forget
Politicians have no integrity and they deemed that recognizing kosovo would go a long way with EU and NATO
We also had euro qualifier against Kosovo last year and both away and at home we had regular people cheer that kosovo is serbia
People had serbian flags at the home game
We're still waiting for some kind of fat fine for that
We are unfortunately part of something which is called post-Soviet bloc (or post-communist country)
But Czechoslovakia was independent only formally (1968 invasion and 20 years of occupation)
I would not call it complex
It’s more like historical experience
I don’t mean it in bad way
Nothing against Russia
I just wanted to point out that Soviet Union did not bring our nations closer to each other, but exactly opposite
That’s it
Lmao I understand, already admitted my mistake and my apologies again
I misunderstood
Okay man
Sorry man I was reacting because I thought it has something to do with the Czech Republic
Chill out :)
It's different
Czech republic is quite Prague-centric and it shows
People in Prague earn more money and objectivelly have better quality of life
Most of the cultural shows happen there and it seems that anything interesting happens in Prague
Also, lot of people want to move there
Personally, as Czech from Moravia, i like my life here and I don't ever plan to move to capital
But it is everyones choice
I’ve been to both Rome and Paris and personally, I found to Rome to astronomically more dirty than Paris
Paris wasn’t even that bad compared to the piles of garbage on every street in Rome
Austria: Family gatherings in the outskirts of Vienna, pubs under trees and in vineyards
Belgium: Walking the streets of Bruxelles, exploring various ethnic cuisines
Bulgaria: Crossing Rila and Pirin with friends
Croatia: A week on a yacht with friends, streets of coastal towns
Czech republic: Living there, lots of memories
England: Evening on old hillforts near Scottish border
Estonia: Long summer evenings in the old Tallinn
France: A week long stay on a cottage of an old family friend in the Pyrenees, visiting local historic sites
Germany: Visiting Bautzen with a local Lausitzian guide
Greece: Renting a motorcycle with my dad, travelling the interior of the island of Crete
Hungary: Fading memories of camping near Balaton in the 1980s style
Ireland: Sleeping in a haunted hunting lodge
Also when fog rose near an ancient cairn and suddenly the mountains were visible
A sound of beating drum (actually a plastic canister being hit with water) in an abandoned adit
Italy: Sicily visit, staying there with relatives
Netherlands: A nice contemporary legends conference in Amsterdam
Poland: Exploration of underground corridors of the MRU
Romania: Mountain hike over Hargita and Caliman with friends, getting lost there in a funny way
Scotland: Skye, climbing alone on Sgurr nan Gillean while the rest of the tour stood somewhere seaside
Serbia: Just passed through Beograd when travelling from Bulgaria and woke up for a while
Looked quite ugly, sorry, there is definitely more to explore
Slovakia: Walking in old mines that looked almost like Moria
Slovenia: Repeated caving expeditions to the Karst, discovering local landscape and remains if the WW1
Spain: Two seaside double weekends by sea with a summer camp in the 1990s. Nothing that special, but I liked one of the girls
Silesia, no one would be able to stop them since no one knows what they are saying half the time also the dust and fumes from Ostrava would cover any tracks of an uprising rather quickly
Moravia, historical land/region of the eastern half of the country
But I don't think there are movements advocating for secession, if anything they are advocating for the return to pre-1948 state when the country was [administratively divided along the borders of our historical lands] (Bohemia-Moravia-Silesia until 1928 and then Bohemia-Moravia/Silesia until 1948)
These historical lands had some power of self-governance in certain areas
But even these current movements are fringe with no prospects of succeeding
On a more serious note, there are actually separatist movements in Moravia
Used to be quite strong in the 90s, now their position is much weaker and they are mostly calling for a federalization of the country
Frankly, they won't be missed too much either
Moravians made fun of people who wrote they are not Czech but Moravian in the lastest census so
So [something like this] is happening after all
There are tons of dogs, but not strays
I've only seen one dog roaming around without its owner and it was 13 years ago, but I'm not sure if it was stray or just got lost
I've seen foxes and deers sniffing in the trash on the edges of villages though
With cats it's more tricky
There are definitely loose cats in the countryside, but again, I'm not sure if they are strays, or have an owner and just roam around freely
Dogs and cats must be all chipped and registered here
When I lived in the Netherlands, the largest problem were stray rats
They were freaking everywhere
Rats and mice
Roam freely in towns
What
What if they ran under a car and caused an accident
Or ate a poison
Or bitten someone
Do people really not care about their pets
Not violet
It probably depends on the age of the kids and the social group in question
At our 2 year olds birthday party it was both kids and parents since all of the parents know each other and we've been friends before we had kids
If she invites someone when she's older idk
Probably just the kids
There is no attention given to teaching about dialectal variation
Usually, any dialectal feature is frowned upon, and getting corrected by some  pedantic teachers is common
I remember learning briefly about different registers of Czech (standard, spoken, etc
We were taught about something called "obecná čeština" which is in English misleadingly translated as "common Czech" (it's an interdialect spoken in Bohemia)
And that's basically it
Sometimes, there would be more focus on local literary authors, but otherwise not much attention
The school curriculum is to my best knowledge everywhere the same
So, no matter which dialectal region you're from standard Czech is taught everywhere the same, from the same aspect, same preposition, absolutely no localisation whatsoever
So, for example, if you're a kid from Ostrava (no i-y merger, long vowels merge with short vowels) Czech is taught to you the same way as to a kid from Prague (i-y merger, no long vowels merger): you spend countless hours on learning where to write "i" and where "y", and no hours on where to write long vowels and where short vowels
I didn't know there are so many differences between Czech and Slovak regarding usage of the colloquial language
Here (Prague) it's completely normal to speak in colloquial Czech while in public, even our teachers often use obecná čeština while teaching (except Czech teachers in primary/middle schools who are "trying" to use the Standard language while teaching but stop the moment the class ends)
EDIT: I'm talking about speaking, when writing you basically have to use the standard language
period
We were taught about Czech dialects at my school and how they differ
Not very in depth, but we have had several lessons about that
But yes, everyone was expected to use standard Czech, not common Czech or any other dialect
Especially our Czech teacher required that even in oral exams (like you actually got a mark depending on not just what you knew but also whether you used proper language)
This was a high school in Brno, btw
Cool
>But yes, everyone was expected to use standard Czech, …
My Czech teacher at elementary school went as far as not allowing us to refer to "y" and "i" as how they are pronounced, instead we had to use "tvrdé y" and "měkké i", lol
Either regular cheese and ham sanwich or bacon, fried egg and mayo
Traditional Czech [*chlebíček*] (open sandwich):
Butter, Italian ("vlašský") salad, ham, cheese, pickled cucumber, boiled egg
Sandwiches aren't big thing here in Czechia
For me it is tuna sandwich from gas station
Do I see padrones
Because I'm pretty sure I see padrones
Leber = Liver
Käse = Cheese
Leberkäse tho is not "liver cheese", but a [meatloaf] If you want a meatloaf with cheese, it's Käseleberkäse, i.e. cheese-livercheese
Semmel is a small round bread
Usually [this]
Probably ODS/KDU-ČSL/TOP 09/STAN coalition for the next Parliamentary election
I hope they will make it
* The Senate has passed constitutional action against the president
Unfortunately it will probably get rejected in the other chamber of our Parliament
* Right-wing opposition (4 parties) is talking about forming a coallition for the next parlamentary elections (our D'Hondt coefficient is really harsh and puts small parties in a great disadvantage)
Our president who is disrespecting the constitution is finally getting sued
Let's hope they'll be able to put their ego aside as well as old grudges between KDU and Kalousek
Even though I am not a fan of KDU, I think it is important for centre-right parties to unite and do something about this joke of a government
Goodbye corruption
Hello even more corruption
I'd rather have another term of Donut Emperor than let ODS take the wheel
Hell I'd make myself vote for ANO if that would prevent it
At least Andrej pretends to give a shit about people that are worse off
ODS actively despises anyone who need to make use of our social security system
The only thing they're interested in doing is making sure the haves get more and the have-nots get kicked to the curb
Expansion of mortgage interest deduction system
WHAT THE FUCK
Pretty much every economist on the planet agrees that this is some of the worst economic policy-making you can have
ODS is keen on imposing massive government austerity that will shit on those who need it most
Almost a quarter of people who work in CZ are low-wage earners, and any cuts in social security will turn their lives into living hell at a point where this really ISN'T THE FUCKING PROBLEM
Don't even get me started on their disaster of a environmental "priorities
" How can a party show [THIS MOTHERFUCKING PIECE OF SHIT GARBAGE] AND CALL ITSELF A SERIOUS POLITICAL PARTY WTF
ODS and its inbred corruption has fucked us over before
Most of the people who were in the party 10 years ago are still there, and they're greedy fucks that don't give a crap about social mobility or the environment
ODS can go choke on a big fat meaty cock for all I care
Such a diverse coalition won't have common vector
It is going to be a mess from day 0
Looks like you need some freedom
why do you dislike them more than far right
A high chance of Babiš not being a prime minister/in the government
Imagine if the CDU, FDP, and the British Tories had a baby that was twice as stupid and ten times as corrupt as any of those parties
That is ODS
Also because there is a chance of KDU, TOP or STAN not being able to get into the next Parliament since they might not pass the 5% threshold
One would think that "I'd rather vote ANO over <literally anything that isn't commies or fascists>" wouldn't be an idea people would hold in 2019
Guess Babiš will literally have to come to people's homes and steal money directly from their wallets to make people wake up
Bernie is a leftie even by Europe’s standards
Nowhere in Europe would you find socialism in the political mainstream
Lmao they are not socialist in the slightest
Nordic countries frequently top the rankings in ease of doing business, they are very capitalist albeit with high levels of redistribution and strong welfare state
That does not make them socialist by any stretch of the imagination
Austria, it's like us but better
Austria as it seems to be the closest to us
Austria
Culturally I would feel at home
Austria
Their German is the most understandable
Switzerland
I've been there as a teenager and I loved it
The people, the nature, everything
If Switzerland was "full", then Germany
Probably Switzerland
The second choice would be Germany
"Czechia, it's like Austria but worse"
Yeah, but to Czech, Austrian German is somehow closer
And those accents they have across Deutschland
For example, have you ever been to Hessen
Well I have been only to Salzburg and Wien, so you are propably right
When I was at the university and travelled home to weekends, I almost always took the train, because it's the best option considering the price, comfort, and speed of travel
Recently, the tickets for that journey (\~150 km, 2h 20min) are about 6-8 eur without any discount (there was 45% discount for university students back then)
There's a complicated system of discounts, but for the normal price you can ride 15 to 25 km for one euro
For me it's the most common mean of transport after walking
And since September 2018, students pay 25% of the full price
Back in 2017, I went from the Czech Republic to Edinburgh
Since I never travelled by plane at that time, I decided to take a bus from Prague to London and a train from London to Edinburgh
Unfortunately, I didn't make it from Victoria to King's Cross in time and my booked train left without me
I didn't want to think about any other way to get to Edinburgh so I went to buy a new ticket
It cost £137
I begged my brain not to convert it to CZK
Unfortunately, it did it and I wanted to cry
And then again when I saw it on my bank account
Yeah, it's kinda funny how cheap travelling by public transportation can get
I paid about 20 Kč (that would be about 70 cents) for about 80 km of travel distance by train
Yup, I travel around 360 km as student and usually pay between 2-4€
Yeah I as a student can go from Brno to Prague which is approximately 200km for 50 kč/2 €
Fun fact: a full day ticket for ČD trains costs 599 Kč (22,88€)
I find especially funny that it's cheaper for me to visit my sister who lives 20km from me than to visit my grandparents (by city transport) who live on the other side of my hometown
Supreme Court is in Brno, but it seems weird to me
Constitutional court is in Brno, everything else is in Prague
As well as Constitutional Court and Supreme Administrative Court
And Ombudsman
However otherwise it is unusual to have HQs of state institutions outside of Prague
Brno just doesn't have a good location - from my home town, it is like 5
5 hours to get there with public transport and it has quite good train and bus connections and it is still quite far from the borders
There are simply not any similar towns even in Moravia/Silesia with that long travel time to Prague
>It takes 2 hours to get from Prague to Brno
Well, the quickest train I found is 2h 26 min
I can get to Prague train station at similar time (2
5 hours), but there is another \~30 minutes waiting time which is in total 5
5 hours
And there are actually many places in Bohemia with much worse travel times
Prague is just better located and it is like 5 times bigger, so it wouldn't make much sense to put more offices in Brno
We had a list of about a 100 books from which we had to read 20, so I avoided the ones I knew I'd hate
And usually reading a summary was enough anyway
Even as someone who enjoyed literature, this was
screw you, Mácha
Máj is something I can appreciate now  for the language, but having this as a study material
and that's highschool, you have this also during elementary school
We read Máj. My brother read Máj in the class and was required to make Máj analysis in 6th grade
How TF was he supposed to do that
With Máj?? So I wrote it for him in the most simple way I could but still with the basics of analysis from our highschool teacher and he still got 5 because it was not enough and wrong
"gospodin"? We called "Hospodin" the God
coincidence
I don't think so
[Superawesome]
Related languages have cognates
I'm shocked
> Is tovarish a lost word or do you have other uses for it
I believe that in Russian this word used to mean "deputy" as in "deputy minister": tovarysh ministra
Not sure this meaning survived communism
Sounds like "hospodář" which means householder or someone who takes care of property
"Host" in czech also means Guesst :D
For Spain: "public transportation is always late", actually I don't remember any significant delays and I have travelled through Spain a lot
Also, I have heard how Spanish people start working late, but it is similar like here
It is true that dinner time is super late in the evening (well, at night for me), but people wake up the next day quite early anyway
So I don't quite understand when they get enough sleep
The traffic in Italy is a little chaotic, but it's really easy to adjust to
Adjusting to home traffic after returning was worse
I received many honks during that time
Where I was, life didn't start until 9 AM
But you gotta realize that Spain should be in GMT+0 timezone, but they decided to be +1 with majority of Europe
That's nothing
Spanish bikers are the true hell
Is it
Wasn't it Breivik who travaled to Prague in order to get illegal firearms and failed
And ended up just getting his license and guns legally in Norway
Well, after what happened with the Gamestop stocks I definitely have more than enough lol
This has been the case in my country as well, but I am coming to terms with the fact that the pension system I am currently paying for through my taxes likely won't bring me that much benefit
It's simply unsustainable with the current birth rates and aging population
And it's not something any government so far wanted to get dirty with because it will be painful and the benefits will come decades later, which is way past the horizon the 4-year-electorate cares about
So it's more and more common for people of my generation to do some investing for when they are older just in case the pension system really does go to shit
Well, if one can afford a decent life with a low salary, then it's just the country getting poorer, rather than the middle class disappearing, no
I see
In my head I interpreted "pension" to mean the public one
Putting money into a private pension product already sounds like investing to my ears, just through a (hopefully) less risky product
Thanks for clearing that up
Yeah the state pension is similar to what we got here I think
There's basically an extra mandatory income tax which goes towards paying for the (current) pensions
That's the type I was saying I'm not certain will bring me any real pension as there won't be as many people when I'm old to pay for me
Private pension, on the other hand, is more about investing your own money (and potentially getting some extra from the employer/govt) and then cashing in on the result of that investment - not relying on others to pay you when your time comes
Yes, for same reason
Yep, all the time
It is rather embarassing
There are also the situations where someone asks me to translate an English text and I can 100% understand what the text means but I just can't think of the words in Czech
I bet it happens because at this point I probably read far more in English than in Czech
Yes, I did
It can happen to everyone
All the time
Even after being back in the country for year and a half
Yes, I don't really mind it with friends who often suffer from the same phenomenon, but it's kind of annoying and even embarrassing in public
I image it's simply down to exposure
While I'm exposed to Czech by talking with other Czechs, I literally don't really consume any media in Czech
Fuck, I read some of the books for our the Czech language Maturita exam in English
Yes
In my defense, I have to say that I speak Russian with my wife and mostly English at work
Add Spanish after work as I learn it, and you will understand why I often sound weird speaking Czech
Or any other language, frankly
Yes, same reason too
[Icelandic]
I like Swedish
Swedish (I prefer the more southern dialects
though)
Oh I'm not Swedish
One commercial tv channel called Nova
It is, I would say, the most popular TV channel here
There is also ČT, which is a national TV station, and it is popular, too
ČT 1 (jedna) one of the four publicly owned tv channels here, the others being ČT 2 (dva) ČT 24 (dvacet čtyři) and the most recent ČT 3 (tři) they also have a kids channel which is an art channel after eight in the evening ČT D/art
ČT 3 is called Kmetflix as Kmet is elderly person who is the target audience
You forgot ČT Sport, formerly ČT 4
The i/y and í/ý dichotomy
Both i and y are nowadays pronounced the same in Standard Czech: i/y - /ɪ/, í/ý -
/iː/. There was a difference few centuries ago
They could be merged into a single grapheme however we have a lot of words that are pronounced the same and although you cannot hear the difference you can see it when you write the words down: e.g. *bít* (to beat) vs *být* (to be)
Also some consonants are palatalized before i    but that could be solved making palatalization explicit - e.g. writing *ťi* instead of *ti*.
Czech is so hard
Don’t know if it is true, but it was told that it is the hardest slovan language and in top 10 hardest languages in the world
Adding to that, there is no real grammatical rule for when either of "y" or "i" is written beside of "well, that's just how it is". So you essentially have to just memorize a long list of words when the "y" is written
Because that's just how it is
We can use both ways in Czech
Padesáttři or třiapadesát.
It really depends on your first language
If you are a native Slavic language speaker, it's easy
If you are a speaker of an Indo-European language that still has cases etc
it isn't that hard although not easy
That said, Czech is full of irregularities, has many declension and conjugation patterns and also the free word order changing the meaning of a sentence doesn't help
Orthography is pretty simple though
Then there is the thing with Common Czech: you learn the language (Standard Czech) and then you realize people around you speak what sounds like a different language
There's a huge gap between Standard Czech (with its archaic roots) and a Common Czech
That's true, I just assumed that u/dsmid was specifically talking about "vyjmenovaná slova" - which is a list of words in the root of which the "y" is written
just because
As was previously mentioned, there used to be a difference in how you pronounce those words but not anymore
Hence, all grade schoolers now have to at some point memorize the list of words perfectly and it's a big part of their evaluation
Making a mistake in relation to "vyjmenovaná slova" is considered to be severe and you can lose a lot of points for that
Yes, i/y has a different function but only in the orthography
The softening can be solved by making it explicit - e.g. writing *-ňí* instead of *-ní*.
OTOH i/y distinction is a nice relict and it illustrates how Czech has evolved (writing i/y is not "random", it has deep etymological roots)
Removing it would make Czech simpler but some information would be lost from the language
"No man ever steps in the same river twice"
let's do the same shit for 3rd time :)

Why do you even comment on this thread
That's actually quite surprising to me that you first realized that there are other currencies here in Czechia and not in your neighbouring country Sweden
Oooh that reminds me of when I was a little kid
I knew people here learn English, so I thought people in England must learn Czech
It was pretty disappointing to realize pretty much nobody learns Czech :/
In 2018 we had a geography textboox in which Slovakia literally borders the Soviet Union
The map was labeled "The world after the dissolution of Czechoslovakia" (Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, Czechoslovakia in 1993)
Blame whoever came up with Benelux
And some of them still are
Dobře ty
Lol
That really is kinda freaky
Where did you learn it
Well, I am a Sudeten German and I still live here
It’s true that we were expelled from Czechoslovakia, but some of us returned, even though in much smaller numbers
This is our home after all
Even after Communism made the country twice poorer than Germany
That sure is some dedication to tradition
But yeah, Sudetengermans aren't unheard of in my hometown
Both of my friend's grandmas are Germans who never had to leave because they were either married to Czechs or considered essential employees
Returning is fine too, as long as you don't come for my family's house
I’ve been to Germany many times and I can tell you, the Czech Republic made a huge progress in the last 20 years
Now if you go to Germany you don’t see practically any difference to the life in the Czech Republic
I mean sure, paperwise the salaries are lower here, but so are the prices
OK, I suppose it's a matter of opinion
I've lived in Germany too, and I feel like the quality of life is still a good bit higher there, not only in terms of purchasing power, but also the way stuff works (administration, customer services, etc
Sure most of our streets don't look totally derelict anymore, but the post-Communist mentality is ingrained much deeper
Until about a year ago, I did not even know "kid's table" was a thing that existed anywhere
We had it for big birthday celebrations usually for kids under 6 or 5 (or whoever wanted to join them, usually we all until puberty preferred playing with "fellow kids" instead of sitting and listening to adults)
Small, shorter table without the tablecloth, easy to clean, where they can make mess freely and have fun together
Of course not in the case there were just one or two of them
We used to, but now, sice "kids" are 20-30 yo, it's Young  table
I didn’t know until now
Being a fan of Florence and the Machine, I actually first heard the term "adult table" in [this video] and I thought it was a joke
Because while we learned about American Thanksgiving traditions at school, it never involved an information about children sitting separately
A few years later someone mentioned "kids table" when talking about their Thanksgiving family gathering, so I remembered Florence's song, googled "kids and adults tables" and found out that families actually do have kids dining at a different table or even in a different room
It was quite shocking
A nordic guy looking for AC when its 20+C is the most danish (nordic) thing ever lol, its really not that hot here right now, especially if you live by the sea where its windy

Right now
" To be, or not to be, that is the question "
I think it is self-explanatory in this current pickle we are in
"Czechs are laughing beasts
- Reinhard Heydrich the "Butcher of Prague"
The "laughing" part is because we have an undying sence of humor which knows no boundaries including self-mockery
And humor was probably the only way to survive the betrayal by the Allies in the Munich Agreement, nazism, communism etc
And the "beasts"? Well Heydrich was killed by the Anthropoid group and was the highest ranking Nazi assasinated during WW2
It's complicated
Above the normal courts we have 2 high courts, Bohemian and Moravian ones
Above them there are 2 highest courts: Highest (or Supreme) Court of Republic and Highest/Supreme administrative Court of the Republic
Both have close to 100 judges
Supreme Court (the first one of the two mentioned) consists of two *collegia*: Criminal *collegium* and Civil *collegium*. Normal cases only being heard in a *senate* of three
In special cases, a *plenum* with more judges being called
Also there's a Constitutional Court of 15 judges, but it only concerned about the constitutional matters, i.e. whether a law is in accordance to the constitution
EDIT: as this question arose in comments to other countries' courts: all judges retire at the age of 70
We have that option too
6 - šest
20 - dvacet
26 can be "dvacet šest' or "šestadvacet" (a means and in czech, notice that the second form has no space in it) i'd say the first one Is more common
But we go further
1326 can be said as "tisíc tři sta dvacet šest" or "třináct set dvacet šest"
The first means thousand three hundred twenty six
The would be translated as thirteen hundred twenty six
The second form is far more common, but doesn't work with numbers greater than 1999
The first is rather formal
Conveniently omitting numbers 14, 15, 500 and all ordinals
Also instead of devadesát, Russian has devanosto
Hey guys, it's like sedmdesát and osmdesát, don't overcomplicate
I saw it
They are not complicated, but they are not directly connected to the spanish cardinal numbers, but to the latin ones
Former Soviet bases either fell to disrepair or were repaired and used as housing or storage spaces
There were two large military zones used by Soviets and lots of small facilities they used and their final destiny depended on many factors like distance from nearest town or means of privatisation
For example large areas were managed by the state, not the municipalities, and the government preferred to try to sell them whole for large-scale projects like a planned cargo airport in Milovice - but most of the buidings were vandalized and damaged by theft meanwhile
Nowadays, there are many different uses for these parts of landscape including nature preserves amd game enclosures, solar power plants, housing, light industry zones or sporting (e.g. ultralights and similar) airports
Unused objects are slowly falling to disrepair or are demolished, but remain popular among urbexers, larpers, airsoft and paintball players and similar groups
There is also one former rocket base at Křivoklátsko that was transformed into post-apocalyptic town for larps and festivals
There's underground bunkers and many tunnels
It's always a blast going there

Let's refrain from using good or bad
We can still analyze music consumption a bit further though
You can imagine two pathways in getting to like a particular song/album/artist/band:
passive listening
* active listening
For both cases, you can like a song straight away or it can grow on you (or, for completeness, you aren't gonna like it)
Now you can either distinguish between these two pathways or consider them equal
Let's skip that
You can make a metric, a ratio of active to passive listenings which led to liking a particular song/whatever
You could probably cluster the songs by this metric, each cluster would have popular songs and less popular songs
The songs heard mostly passively are heard through specific media which impose certain conditions
One can optimize the songs with these conditions in mind
And the point is, while it's a great feat being/becoming the embodiment of the contemporary taste/fad, it's only that
Note, that I'm not talking about quality whatsoever
I'm also not saying that the songs are listened passively over their lifetime (I was talking about the phase when someone is introduced/introduces themself to songs)
> > while it's a great feat being/becoming the embodiment of the contemporary taste/fad, it's only that
> You're using a lot of words to say that they're bad
No, I'm not saying that, I'm basically saying that Max Martin achieved a great feat, but it's short of godlike
Most used bus in Prague has capacity of 160 people and rush hours on busy lines will explain you this number is just theoretical number from designers office without actually trying how many people can fit in
It also stops every minute or two, in rare cases in three
There simple isn't space to discuss anything with driver in this traffic
Also that thing is 19 meters long so unless you are near to him, he is not going to hear you at all, he is locked in his driver booth and there used to be a pictogram sticker saying "do not talk to driver" It is probably still there
so yes, it is complete different here
It usually depends on the number of people involved
You say hello and good bye in an elevator, small waiting room or a train compartment
Definitely not in a full urban bus or similar
But it always ends with greeting, any small talk is very uncommon
It's more about big city/countryside difference
If you travel to a small village with like 5 other people in the whole bus, you usually say thank you and bye
Pat a Mat (A je to)
Stories about two neighbors/friends, who always try to solve some easy task with tinkering
They are really clumsy, they usually fail at first, so they try more and more bizarre approaches
In the end, they succeed, is some ridiculous and stupid way
I didn't know that
I loved that because I was introduced to it during vacation in Itally when I was stuck the whole day indoors one day and this was the only thing I could watch
So I, Czech, watched french TV series in German language in Italy
At least there's not much talking
Spongebob was the same, in German first, but since I understand only little German, it wasn't easy to watch it
Not entirely the same language but we've got a few with Slovaks
When we talk with each other, we each usually use our respective mother tongues because they are mutually intelligible
For example, in Czech, *sprostý* means "vulgar" while in Slovak, it means "stupid". A friend of mine once almost got into a trouble when he with his other friends met a group of Slovaks somewhere and they talked and the Slovaks spoke in a very vulgar manner, cursed all the time etc
so the Czechs said by the way something like: "You're cool guys, only that you're a bit too vulgar," which the Slovaks understood as "you're a bit too stupid" and almost got into a fight before the misunderstanding was clarified
Some other possible misunderstandings that came to my mind are *chudý* which means "slim" in Slovak but "poor" in Czech so when a Slovak wants to compliment a Czech that they look "slim", they might accidentally call them "poor". Or Czechs may get excited when a Slovak casually mentions they've got *pivnica* ("cellar") at their home because *pivnice* means "pub" in Czech
Or when a Slovak asks a Czech for *"horká čokoláda"* ("dark chocolate", literally "bitter chocolate"), they get "hot chocolate" instead
Its archaic meaning (in Czech) is also tidying or going around the house
It's famous here thanks to Němcová's novel Babička
TIL Greeks are dwarves
I was the same
I had a weak moustache, chin and sides
I thought I'm lost forever and then I stopped shaving due to the pandemic for 3 months
And dude now I have a good beard that filled up everything and can be shaped
Honestly all follicles grow at a different pace
My cheeks looked empty until like the third month
Moustache only got better after like 2 and a half
So if you have time where you can look funny for a couple weeks, Def give it 2-3 months of growth
If even then you don't see a chance, I say go clean shaven
But you can never tell after like 2 or 3 weeks
You're a deregulated heaven compared to Belgium and Netherlands
Belgium especially
I see what you mean
Well in that case, probably better to go clean shaven for now and come back in a couple years
It does get better with age I found
And even if it doesn't, it's not really a big deal
I don't expect anything, that way, I can be only pleasantly suprised
>Is the football one really not the one that comes to mind first tho seriously
no, because football not the sport number one by the audience, not even second
Pretty sure audience in countries you don't live in doesn't really affect your perception of what comes to mind first

From my perspective you was "genuinely" surprised that there can be a championships in other sports than footbal
Actually so many languages, but Polish is my favourite right now, kind of because i can understand it a bit, plus it sounds so soft, almost artistic
It makes me go: You should learn it, so you can understand it fully
I really like how arabic sounds
Also Irish just because I love a certain irish song
Well english is my favorite, but I love to hear german and slovak (sup brothers)
But my german is very bad *shrugs*
Swedish man: *erection*
The kaiser Sigismund of Luxembourg is considered a huge villain in Czech republic
He guaranteed safety to Jan Hus, who was among the first to speak against the catholic church only for him to be later burned alive for his beliefs
He is considered a great emperor of the HRE by Germans though
Teddy Roosevelt
Yeah, both Metternich and Bach (Alexander, not Johan Sebastian) are big bad guys of our history
I blame Alan Moore for this
I remember a post at /r/ShitAmericansSay where an American guy explained to a Brit how the 5th of November is an awesome holiday because its point is to remind the government that if they will attack citizens' liberties, the citizens will revolt and blow up the parliament like the brave Fawkes guy tried
Yeah, the whole hussite movement was just a bunch of raiding religious fanatics who tore down most of monasteries in Bohemia, such a shame
In our history classes we are taught about them in a neutral way - they're not pictured as heroes of the nation
I think English just changes the languages which adapt words from it but they won’t perish
Czech, for example, is extremely efficient in taking the words and changing them to fit
It can be easily seen in the case of verbs which we conjugate as if they actually were Czech
With Czech being an official language of a 10 million country, there's not a big reason to be concerned so far
Our language survived germanisation under Austria-Hungary, I am not concerned that it will disappear anytime soon
What would be needed to happen is National Revival
We had this, when most of the population were speaking German
And Czech language did comeback
A lot of famous Czech writers are from that timeline and its basically very important path of our history
On the other way, we lost easy connection with our neighbours
And a lot of useless words were invented
Like sorry, but I dont see any good reason to have months named differently then rest of the world
It is better to look for things that unite rather than things which divide  IMHO
The revival is somewhat a double-edged sword as it saved the language but it also efficiently kills anyone’s will to learn when taught in a school
I think it’s basically just you, us, Finns, Croats, Ukrainians, Belorussians, and Lithuanians of the big nations in Europe
Slovaks for example have months named normally
I envy them a lot for that :D
That’s not really correct though
I don’t want to play that game of who was in worse situation but to make it clear Czech was supposed to be suppressed be German when we were a part of Austrian empire
I understand the uneasy situation of Irish nonetheless, hopefully it will get better
Ah, I’m sorry to hear that but I do believe Czech can be pretty hard to learn
Slavic languages are all like this
Good luck with learning though
I’d like to give you a piece of advice but I never learnt Czech as a foreigner ofc
I’d go for a language course at least for the beginning to get  the grasp of the basics
The badassest job group in the history apart from mercenaries would be voraři - timber rafters, who would steer huge rafts made of tree trunks from lumber camps down the rivers to port cities to further process
It is said that it was especially hard and taxing job that was strictly regulated and I just can’t imagine driving a 100 tonnes worth of loosely tied tree trunks through whitewater, selling it after a week or two of floating and then walking back to the mountains to make a new raft
We had those too, although probably just in the part where I live (Wallachia)
I'm not sure as I don't know exactly how the Slovaks feel about them but generally, I'd say they're less glorified here than in Slovakia
There were also portáši - the ones who fought them on the side of the law
Definitely 90s or early 2000s. Would be very interesting to see time I spent my childhood in with eyes  of (almost) adult
1920s during the First Republic or around 1870 in A-H.
>To live in New York full of mafia families
You might want to visit Italy

From the comments here one would think that Poland is gonna be a new North Korea
I hope PiS does well

In Czech we have this awesome translation od Simpsons joke, where Homer sees a sign 'Die' and freaks out and than a tree bends and shows the whole sign 'Diet' and he freaks out even more
In Czech it's 'zhebni' and 'zhubni'
The Czech dubbing of the Simpsons, especially the early seasons, was amazing overall
Zhebni = die
Zhubni = lose some weight

Let me know which one are correct
2 of them are on opposite sides of Prague, 1 in Brno and 1 in Ostrava
Maybe there's another one being built somewhere, I'm not sure
Ikea is love, Ikea is life
All 4 stores, with 3 more on their way, will give us meatballs and hours of pain
When we try to build our furniture, some would say, that this is torture
But it Doesn't matter, why should it
Because their design is fucking lit
Really
That's pretty strange, unless your IKEA is cheaper
Interesting, "černoch" is OK here
"Negr" is the slur
Pretty much everyone agrees that we are in Central Europe
We like to correct people who says otherwise
Definitely central, I'm sure most people here noticed Czechs can get upset if someone calls us eastern europeans (not me though)
It does make sense though to be called central, both in geographical and cultural sense
Culturally I feel we are very close to all the nations of former Austria-Hungary + Bavaria and Saxony
Visiting any of these places doesn't really feel any different to what it's like here, while I can definitely start feeling the difference when going further west/east/south/north
Well, I think I can say, that almost everyone in my country consider Central Europe as our region
Central, but a lot of people, mostly from over the pond, are saying Eastern, which is wrong
Exactly
This is why you need a defined region of central Europe
Basically along the lines of historical Austria Hungary + parts of eastern Germany
Anyone who claims that Slovenia and CZ are more similar to Russia and Ukraine rather than they are to Austria and Eastern Germany they are our of their mind
>Cz
Not only Eastern Germany - Czechs have also many things in common with Bavaria - for example they have Baby Jesus (Christkind) as a Christmas person same as us and Austrians
It does for any west Slavic country
Yea Bavaria as well
I kind of took it for eastern Germany cause it borders us (mostly to differentiate it from like Nordrhein-Westfalia
From what I've heard, Bavaria is closer to Austria than Prussia, so it makes sence
Sure, I understand that
I am currently living in Munich, so I had to point it out
:-) It is quite interesting to see that we have pretty much the same culture - they are also celebrating "Maibaum" (májka), "Hexennacht" (čarodějnice), St
Nicholas also on the 5th and so on
Well, isn't in other parts of Germany more common Weihnachtsmann
Sure and then 400 years of Austria (Austria-Hungary) :-)
Well I think that it's best to do a geographical division as the following one to be at least moderately accurate
Western Europe (France, Benelux, west Germany, possibly Denmark if it's not North, British isles and Switzerland)
Central Europe (Austria, Eastern Germany + maybe Bavaria, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Poland)
Southern Europe (Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece) and you could do a Balkan subdivision or include them in this
Northern Europe (Norway, Iceland, Finland, Sweden Estonia and maybe Denmark)
And then Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, maybe Bulgaria
As per your point, making it a Slavic Vs Germanic thing is more of a cultural split than a geographical one
There it would be a slightly different map based on language groups and such
Although for instance CZ is much more closer to Germany and Austria than it is to Russia and Ukraine culture wise
The thing is you could eternally argue subdivisions until you'd end with one that has Limburg being a different part of the planet than Brabant
You have to make some rough rounding up eventually
But some round up strategies are just plainly stupid
For instance completely leaving out the idea of central Europe is way too broad and in the end it's basically the equivalent of saying someone from a Swiss village is the same as person from Arctic Norway
Hh, I am glad you have nice memories from Czechia
The beer is cheaper is than water is also an argument which an Austrian living in Prague mentioned in my podcast interview about expat life in Czechia :-D
Same here
I remember when I was a kid and no one could explain to me why they're coming on 5th when St
Nicholas day is on 6th
Well I guess that you are probably talking about the infamous Vietnamese markets which are selling fake brands, cigarettes without the stamp (Gebührenmarke),... which are also illegal in Czechia and you can hear about police searches at those places periodically in the media
I've only heard about those places as it seems that they are somehow focused on Germans who cross the borders for cheap shopping
Personally I wouldn't go there
I see, thanks for the explanation
We have just the Christkind (Ježíšek), no Weihnachtsmann
Of course there is also visible in past years Santa but that's probably the same all around EU
Yea, I know that someone will always disagree
That's why I tried to put Denmark in both west and north and was really struggling with Latvia and Lithuania since they could also pass as more options
But I was simply trying to pick a slightly better geographical model (albeit imperfect) than East X West which is super useless
Yes, that's what I thought with the same on the 5th - even-though the Nicholas day is on the 6th he comes on the evening of 5th :-)
That's the Bohemian lifestyle I guess, hh
Those must have been really interesting times
How difficult was it in the 90s to speak with locals in German/English
Yes
Even at school, we had to take off shoes and wear slippers
Hygiene, people, hygiene
Sometimes guests are allowed to keep their shoes on - a big party, wedding etc
When I imagine dog shit smeared where little children play
Well of course
They are very comfortable
We didn't have crocks when I was at school, so I wore foam sliders
Hey, just because your Trump's wife is younger than our Trump's wife doesn't mean you are any better
I know, white socks in brown sandals, that's a big controversy here
I don't care about fashion anyway (at our school, nobody did, we were mathematicians) and Czechs you meet are mostly on vacations, thus in "beach boy" style
You think I wear my hawaiian shirt, tesco sandals and cargo shorts in our streets
Nope
I dress accordingly in army surplus clothes
Not exactly poor's people, but Smažák.

Vltava by Bedřich Smetana
Everyone knows it and it is very symbolic of our nation
I'd say [Ktož sú boží bojovníci ] is the most patriotic song I can think of
It used to be unofficial hussite "anthem".
Most of songs sang by Karel Gott
[My colour - red and white]
I'm certain we would like it
We're generally proud of something with a Czech background made by other nationalities, so at least that'd be in your favor
Is it normal to eat rabits in your country ?
Thsi might be a weird question, but I heard few people say how they don't understand that some people eat rabits, deers, ducks And stuff which was a little bit weird for me because in Czechia we eat those normally
Is it actually weird for some countries ?
Ani Pinďa to už nežere
OP is reffering to the domesticated rabbit, not wild rabbit
Haha thanks :) that song was pretty funny, but really sad at the Same time .
Same :)
Some people here actually still keep their own .
In Czechia eating horses would be probay the same as od someone ate a dog here
Are there some parts of Poland where it Is normal to eat horse meat ?
We use duck fat too, just not for vegetable, but usually for cooking some soop And using it instead of water, beacuse it tastes better
Do you really ? I never heard of that
That looks really good :D
That's really sad :(, but thanks for answering :)
Horse salami is normal in Czechia
Just google "koňsky salám"
Uhm, I believe some 10 years ago I used to buy horse meat
Haven't seen it for ages tho
Actually yes :D
That's pretty interesting
I Will for sure :D thanks :)
Czech Republic and Slovakia, at least our languages
Czech republic - Slovakia
Yeah, old times of Great Moravia
If that were the case, the country never would've split up
The only thing that is truly similar is our languages, other than that, basically everything is different or at the very least on a same level of similarity as our other neighbours
I will preface this with the fact that I hate creating multiple-tiered reply-arguments, but you set me up for this one and I feel like I should respond
>We share a common history (of over 70 years)
68 years, to be exact, when I subtract the war years
Before that Slovakia and Bohemian Crown Lands were largely foreign from one another and there was little to no communication between the two nations
Czechia also has 392 years of common history with Austria, for example; if my memory is correct then modern-day Slovakia also has 700-900 common years with Hungary
>traditions, culture, food
Only partially
On in a wider picture, when really considering "traditions" and folklore, the Czech ones are largely different from Slovakia's, save for Eastern Moravia
Not to mentions that the Czech ones are way more extinct than the Slovak ones
Slovaks are also on average pretty devout christians, something that Czechs absolutely aren't.
> My dad is Czech, my mom is Slovak, I have both citizenships and to say that we have no similarity is so very nuts
I think it is obvious why you think what you think since you live in a very specific type of a family
Of course you're going to be exposed to both cultures and preceive them as one when one of your parents is a Slovak
This is also very individual, my grandmother is Slovak and she's dropped basically everything Slovak about her and is a naturalized Czech at this point, and so is everyone from her family who moved here
>Seriously, we watch the same movie during Christmas,[...] understand each other, listen to similar music
This is something that stems from having mutually inteligible languages and Slovakia historically having a smaller creative base
Of course your media is going to be dominated by another country's media if the domestic market cannot satisfy the demand
I also do believe that this phenomenon only works one way - there are very, very few Slovak songs and movies that I've ever watched
>like the same sports
On any larger level of similarity than any other country in the region
I don't think so
>eat the same food
Only in a limited fashion
There's a single Slovak meal that I've eaten in my whole life and that's halušky
>drink the same alcohol
For lack of domestic suppliers, perhaps
Also Czechs on average favour beer over spirits
>You’re telling me a German will have svíčková for Sunday lunch
No, but I doubt an average person from around here has svíčková for lunch as well, or at least not any more commonly than any other meal
>bake some koláče
The only person who I've ever met that does that would be my Czech grandmother, maybe twice a year
>afternoon visit which they will drink slivovica during
They'd probably drink beer
So would the Germans, funnily enough
>while watching some Hrebejk movie
People watch Pelíšky literally once a year, my guy
I hate myself for taking my time to dissect your comment like this, and I feel dirty as a result of it, but to me it seems like you live in a very specific bi-national family and have probably only really experienced Czechia in the form of Slovácko
In other words, my mileage varies by quite some margin
If you removed the slight language barrier, I'd even say that Poland is culturally closer to Slovakia than Czechia is, at least on a wider level, and I'm saying this as a person who's lived most of their life in the Czech-Polish borderland
On a similar note, when I get past German or communicate in English, I find that a lot of Austrians I know are closer to my mindset than most Slovaks are
And as more people speak English on a better level, these barriers will slowly fade even more
Just my two cents
absolutely not
for example
Kyslík-O
Vodík-H
Draslík-K
Dusík-N
Actual element names are translated, but the abbreviations are not
Aluminum is still AL (in czech Hliník)
Well, some are pretty same to the latin names, some are just in normal language
For example, gold is zlato in Czech, but it's Au, but Wolfram is W, like in latin
> olovo (Sn)
Wait for real
In Czech olovo is 'Pb', 'Sn' is cín.
But we still managed
For example, to remember dusík, we just said "udusíme (we're gonna choke) N(disliked teacher with N-name)
And then there is C-uhlík, Na-sodík, Mg-hořčík, Al-hliník, Si-křemík, Ca-vápník, Fe-železo, Cu-měď, Ag-stříbro, Sb-antimon, Au-zlato, Hg-rtuť, Pb-olovo, and other minor changes
We wanted to be original, so we call it "draslík".
Fortunately, some czech names were rejected: lithium(Li)-japík, beryllium(Be)-sladík, bor(B)-bledník, fluor(F)-kazík, fosfor(P)-kostík, chlor(Cl)-solík, titan(Ti)-chasoník, chrom(Cr)-barvík, kobalt(Co)-ďasík, nikl(Ni)-broník, arsen(As)-otrušík, selen(Se)-švábel, brom(Br)-brudík, tellur(Te)-župel, jod(I)-řasík, wolfram(W)-chvořík, osmium(Os)-voník or uran(U)-nebesník
Nebesník is epic
Yeah, I had a class at university with an Italian professor who told us about the highway assassination
My mind was blown (no pun intended) when I heard about it
Mafia doing something so high profile, that's insane
We have tons of great vietnamese places
There's also some good indian, chinese and thai stuff
It's quite hard to find anything good from americas though, apart from burgers&steaks
- Italian restaurants are also sort of common
- Indian cuisine seems to be gaining popularity
Heck, I saw a fast food place recently with bunch of Indian sauces
- While sushi is available pretty much everywhere, Japanese cuisine is otherwise unheard of
There are few restaurants in Prague, but they are stupidly expensive and there are still many popular Japanese dishes we simply can't get here at all
^Yes, ^I ^am ^a ^bit ^salty ^about ^it
- No idea about Mexican
There are 2 in my 100k city, but neither is very popular
- Burger places are everywhere, but as you said, you will rarely see them serve other typically American dishes
I don't live in Prague and I only look for new restaurants there every couple of months
But simply by being in Prague, the prices are ... not very affordable
And my **quick** search confirms that
Quite simply, I'm not paying 300Kč (~€12) for a bowl of ramen
And that's not even accounting for the time spend getting (~1h30m to the center) there and the price of transportation and/or parking
Because every single one of these places is trying to be everything, but affordable (unlike many actual ramen places in Japan)
Obviously you can go to expensive ramen bars in japan, but my point is there isn't really a cheap alternative here
Furthermore, there is more to Japanese cuisine than ramen and sushi
I admit, I'm not the biggest fan of ramen
It's alright, but I can easily live without it
I love Japanese curry and okonomiyaki and those two I cannot get in Czech Republic, unless I make them myself
Okonomyaki is thankfully not terribly difficult to make
Do you use Japanese mayonnaise and okonomitaki sauce, or do you substitute them with something
"Robot" - this Czech word it's quite used here
I am not sure if this word is popular in other countries
Wtf
Lmao
are u okay
Oh cool, we've qualified
We won't get off the group stage anyway

In the 9th century, the Přemyslid dynasty moved its seat to Prague
The Prague Castle was built and soon it became an important trading and cultural centre
Since then it's been the seat of Czech rulers
Premyslids moved their capital from the *Levý Hradec*, which is a few kilometers north from Prague (now part of a 8,000 inhabitants town of Roztoky) in late 800s or early 900s.
In the next century, Premyslids partially wiped out, partially incorporated Slavnikids, their main competitors for the leaders of Bohemia role, so Prague became the capital
Wasn't Vyšehrad a seat of Czech rulers for some time
Ah, you're right
It was - from the second half of the 11th century until 1140
Thanks for the correction
We've got a lot of idioms with that meaning that are associated with sausages but sadly, English language is not much colourful when it comes to words for specific types of sausage
*Je mi to buřt.*  - "It's a scalded fat sausage of thick short cylindrical shape to me
*Mám to na párku
* - "I've got it on a thin cooked sausage
*Mám to na salámu
* - "I've got it on a salami
We've got a lot, normally quite colorful ones are used
* As others have pointed out, the German-derived "je mi to buřt/párek/salám" (It's sausage to me)
* The variation "mám to na salámu" (I've got it on salami)
* Mám to v piči (I've got it in the cunt)
* Mám to v prdeli (I've got it in the ass)
* Prdím na to (I fart on this)
* Seru na to (I shit on this), but also "To mě nesere" (I'm not shat by this)
* Mrdám/píchám/jebu na to (Fuck this) but also "to mě nemrdá" (I'm not fucked by this)
* From Slovak, and quite recent: "Mám v piči na lehátku" (I have in my cunt on a deck chair)
This one is not about not caring about something specific, it's about not caring in general
* Do toho se neseru (I'm not shitting my way into this)
There's probably countless others that I'm missing right now
For Czech,
* *Je mi u prdele*, lit
"it is near the ass for me"
* *Mám v píči*, lit
"I have it in cunt"
* *Je mi buřt*, lit
"it's a sausage to me"
* *Mám na háku*, lit
"I have it on a hook"
We can say "Je mi to u prdele" which means "That's by my ass". Otherswise and worse "Mám to v píči" - "I have it in my cunt". Otherwise and more civil, "Je mi to jedno/egal/fuk" - "That's no matter to me
To je mi buřt is like verbatim translation meaning exactly the same
I love the circus one, occasionally use it also in Czech
Or more vulgar:
Je mi to u prdele ( It's by an ass)
Je mi to u piče ( It's by a pussy)
My favorite one is: "Na to ti sere bílej tesák!"
I also know ,,Mám v píči" - I have (it) in cunt/pussy
This is a good one too
In my family, we say: "Na to ti sere pes Alfons a kočka Minda
All credit goes to our Slovak bratia :) I legit laughed out loud when I heard that first a few  years ago and still I find it quite funny
We just love asses
It's screwed/I'm screwed - To je v prdeli/Já jsem v prdeli - It's in ass/I'm in ass
Leave me alone/Fuck off - Jdi do prdele - Go into ass
It's fun - To je prdel - It's ass
He doesn't take it seriously - Má/dělá z toho prdel - He has/makes ass of it
Or simple Fuck
- Do prdele
- Into ass
Edit: It all is of course mildly vulgar so we also have civil idioms :)
I just say it in (mangled) Polish, but in Czech it would be "Není to můj cirkus, nejsou to mé opice," but it does not quite roll off the tongue as easily
The word "robot" comes from a play written by Karel Čapek
It is called R.U.R. -  Rossum’s Universal Robots
In the play, "robots" was a name given to the artificial workers
It was suggested by his brother Josef
It stems from an archaic word for hard work - robota

It's also worth mentioning that despite they were called robots, they weren't robots in the modern sense but artificial organic life forms, much like replicants from Blade Runner

Isn't Jo Nesbø popular everywhere
Most of crime fiction is just him in our bookshops
That is seriously fucked up story
Good but insane
The word robot to be precise, we won't claim it whole :-)
Yes, that's him
I too love this book
Well, claim, I don't think there's much for "claim" as he basically was Czech - he was born in Czech lands, he lived there, he worked there, of course he also lived in other countries as many others, but if he wrote in Czech I think everyone would consider him Czech author
But because he wrote in German, he's part of "Prague German literature" group of authors writing in German
But I'm far from expert
Not exactly, it's made from that word which is robota (and it's still used as synonymum for hard work in Czech and for work in Slovak), so he made robot from that, as robota is femininum and robot masculinum
"Democracy is fine until it serves what I want" says everyone
Only truly free system is individualism
Weird
In Czech, that's the standard phrase
What does one use in Polish then
"Co tam" a "jak tam" is very weird for me
Like asking what you'll be doing when you get somewhere
In Czech, you can also say "Jak se vede", literally "How's it going".
Like, I understand your phrases, but their meaning is not at all what I'd expect
Funny how archaic and perfectly normal are often polar opposite in our languages
-a at the end is common for colloquial shorter versions of given names
Sometimes, a name has radically different colloquial version originating in a somewhat transformed German version of the name
-ouš is also used sometimes in similar context
And some names are just shortened
Examples:
Josef - Pepa
Jan - Honza
František - Fanda, Fanouš
Antonín - Tonda
Adolf, Adam - Áda
Bohuslav/Bohumil - Bohouš
Daniel - Dan
Tomáš - Tom
Yep
Same in Czech Republic
But we have Jan - Honza (derivated from german Hans)
Also Josef - Pepa
If only he had put his huge talent to a good use and built industry, trade and cooperation, rather than waging a senseless war

Let's say that Český in this case refers to the territory of Bohemia proper (Čechy in Czech), not the whole country or its people
The first sentence of your response might be a bit confusing because Bohemian and Czech are (or at least used to be for centuries) synonyms
To be precise, Czech language used to be called Bohemian language until the early 20th century
In English
Yes, it's an exonym and Czechs never used it in their own language

No, but:
After 200 years, 30 or so amendments are probably not enough

I don't think an amendment from 1789 can be called "recent", even if its ratification was completed in 1992

We don't like being considered Western European either or yes, we are impressed when somebody calls us Western European but it's not that we would actually feel a part of it
We consider ourselves being Central Europeans and basically "the most Central of all Central Europeans". We often talk about our country being "in the heart Europe" or when we are self-deprecating, then being "a beer belly of Europe" and generally consider ourselves being something between the East and the West
We simply hate when someone says Czechia is an Eastern European country because we are a Central European country and the fact is an important aspect of our national identity
We are taught at school that Central European countries are Germany, Switzerland, Lichtenstein, Austria, Slovenia, Czechia, Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary
Parts of other countries, namely Slavonia (Croatia), Vojvodina (Serbia), and Transylvania (Romania) are sometimes considered parts of Central Europe as well
Afaik, V4 countries generally prefer being considered Central European and then Austria and Slovenia I guess

Point is, in post-war Eastern Bloc, there was a metric ton of shitty, cheap beater cars, including interwar cars like the Praga Piccolo and other affordable 1st Republic cars, a lot of these cars' top speeds were rarely above like 70 km/h and that is in _pristine service_ condition

I don't think so
It all comes down to the way the question was asked
If you ask it the way that makes people imagine typical Asian selling cheap stuff in a market with their super broken Czech, there is no wonder parents would prefer their kid to date a native Czech
I think this is again related to Czechs being negative on default and since they have no experience with Jews they rather say no than yes
Overall, I don't think this survey implies that we are as racist or xenophobic as people try to make it out to be
The situation is also getting better and the younger generation is much more open towards different cultures and ethnicities
I asked my mother and grandmother and they do associate them together
Gypsies are even often refered to as blacks
I mean, it's not that this affects a shitton of people, since the Jewish, black and muslim (and asian as well to an extent I guess) populations are pretty low, but holy crap where is this coming from
I don't think most Czechs mind Asians at all
It's just that your average parent is going to imagine a guy in a shop with shitty cheap clothing imported from China speaking broken czech if you ask about Asians
That's why the number is so low IMO
We don't really have black people in the sense most people know the word so gypsied take the honor as the darkest-skinned group of people living here
For afroamericans we usually use "černoch" which basically means black but people know you're referring to afroamericans
Estonia is doing so many progressive things it's honestly inspiring
Shows everyone that you don't need to be super rich and properous to think out of the box and come up with modern and unconventional ways to improve different aspects of our society
I wish my coutry was like that too but Czechs are really backward in so many things
If you tried to implement this here, you would get bunch of smartasses sitting on their ass with a beer commenting online why this is a stupid idea
But do they have the machine that goes PING
No, I mean the machine that goes [PING
We have a law here that every supermarket with at least 400m2 area has to donate such food to food banks or charities
Usually supermarkets will also offer these products at discount (25-50%) on day of or day before the product's expiration
Also there is an app where restaurants, bakeries etc
add in their leftovers and people can buy/get it at discounted price
What's up with the map projection
It looks really weird to have Kazakhstan go that far "north".
I visited Krakow this summer and loved it
Happy birthday Poland
Also, thanks for the Witcher (both the books and games, not so much the old show haha)
The commie blocks many people live in weren't built for this
I hope this won't result in deaths of the more sensitive people
This is quickly becoming an invest in an AC or die situation tbh
Oh god oh fuck
AC is not common at homes here
Not sure if it's worth it though, you would utilize the AC only 2, maybe 3 months a year
For me, a fan is enough, although I hate the noise during the night
Nice

Actually it's likely not a coincidence
In Czech, fat is *tlustý* and it's also a common surname
Quite a lot of Austrians, especially from around Vienna, have got Czech surnames because a lot of Czechs moved there for work in the Habsburg times (as well as other nations from all of the monarchy)
Over the time, they lost Czech diacritics or were fully transcripted to German pronunciation but they're still easily recognisable
Tlusty is likely one of those
It's strange to me why so many people consider learning 'just' a trade to be a bad thing
I don't perceive those people to be inferior
It also seems to be a better choice for the society
I don't see a productive reason why most people with <105 IQ (or true intelligence  equivalence, to avoid inevitable 'IQ doesn't mean shit' reply) should go to college, perhaps with the exception of extremely motivated people in non-STEM fields
I frankly have much more respect towards a good and honest plumber than to some humanities graduates who consider themselves superior to people without university level education
>(or true intelligence equivalence, to avoid inevitable 'IQ doesn't mean shit' reply)
[Also Kazakhstan] ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
Ah, the French empty diagonal, we meet again
So far it's been a normal summer, compared to last years
Temps mostly between 20-25, occasionally above 25, rarely above 30
May and June have been quite rainy as well, which has helped a lot with the drought that we've had since 2015
I think I'll pass, thanks
Teplice, so one of the warmest areas of the country
We've had 2 days above 30 and don't know how many days above 25
There were 3 days this week alone ([Monday] it was 27°C, [Tuesday] 26 and yesterday slightly above 25)
I approve of temperatures like this
Checked what was the weather like [on this day last year] and we had a 38°C heatwave
> formerly part of te USSR
Hungary was never part of the USSR
It was part of the Eastern Bloc, but so was e.g. Slovakia, which has 91 % in the table
[Seznam will actually be one of the default search engine options in Czechia and Slovakia
Just because some countries consume a lot of potatos because it's a very forgiving plant when it comes to climate and ground fertility doesn't mean all slavs eat a lot of potatos
It's amazing how this sub can be sometimes so progressive yet be casually racist (inb4 "slavs aren't a race", I know, I cannot find a better word for it) about slavs
EDIT: Before you reply, this is nothing personal, I'm venting out frustration about a really irritating trend that has been sweeping the internet for the last couple of years
I know you're just trying to make a joke
