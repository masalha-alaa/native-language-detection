Ireland sold us radioactive milk for poor children lmao
Not European but,
That time our dictator lied on an interview in the US saying that there wold be free elections in Mexico, every one back home believed him and when he meddled in the elections the people got so pissed that they started a revolution that devolved into over 10 years of civil war with over a million dead people
I can only imagine Diaz coming back home after the interview and hearing that people truly believed that we wold have free elections:
“Of course were not having free elections dummies, that was just a lie for the gringos
Wow poor in Germany is middle class in Mexico
You are right, Poor in Germany is way better
free speech is crazy there, it’s honestly a good thing at the end
Germany of all places is the one that has less of that “a la America” free speech
American style
I always think that It would be awesome to live there
But I wonder how difficult is to get goods from outside
And as a Mexican it terrifies me to not have my daily avocado
I once heard that french fries are not French, but Belgian
Edit: my bad, We were supposed to talk about brands
The same if you call anyone from Catalunia, “Spanish” or if you (from ignorance) say that Catalan comes from Spanish
We love spicy food
Even kids candies are very spicy
I remember on one ocassion, we were eating in a restaurant in Sweden and we ordered a bowl of jalapeños peppers, then  we ate them like they were potato chips
People made a “WTF” face to us
We even asked the waiter for a spicier chile
I thought at least this was normal in Latin America, but my colombian and Venezuelan friends cant stand spicy food
That all mexicans are drug dealers
I was on vacations in germany and when I mentioned that I was mexican, one guy said: “So you know el Chapo
He thought I was lying when I told him I did not
I was working at a company with units in the USA and Mexico
When US managers came by, we like to show them around down town and take them to eat some Mexican food, you know, the whole Mexican experience
This asshole new manager comes, we are already setting things to show him the city and after we suggested a lovely restaurant to eat he asks "So, is it clean
I was so mad at him and I couldn't avoid to say "Well, it's Mexico, obviously we all eat on dumpsters next to a shit hole you fucking asshole"
I'm from Mexico, so not Europe, i hope you don't mind
In a buffet there was a sign for "gorditas de chicharron prensado" ([Gorditas] are a mexican dish made of corn dough and filled with different things, such as beans, cheese, eggs, or stews)
Gordita is also a way to say "fat" in a nice way
So they had an translation in the sign that said "Chubby girl from pressed chicharron".
The language is European (Spanish), but not sure if the word is used in Spain
The word *ahorita* (literally meaning, *little now*) can mean both "right now" or "probably, eventually sometime in the future".
* Haz la tarea
(Do your homework)
* Ahorita la hago
(Yeah, I probably will do it, or not)
* ¡Quiero este reporte para ahorita
(I want this report ASAP
Edit: Spelling and formatting
This looks difficult as hell to learn, but I'd love to be able to use it on daily conversations
Cheers to Turkic languages

As a Mexican I read this with an accent I've never heard before
That's my kink
Isn't la Nouevelle Calledonie theirs too
They are a weirdly-governed territory but all the people there have French citizenship by default, that sounds like they're a part of France
Lmao
We still get them around once in a while
I think there is a song featuring that whistle sound
Tacos, definitely
Not trying to be a dick, but in a poor country like mine, thats good enough sadly
I only had a hard time to understand the first sentence
Es Catalán?
I'm pretty sure it's a diplomatic flag, so for embassies and stuff
We are friends with the German ambassador in Laos and he had the flag with the Eagle flying in the front gate if his house

Innocent question, is TUM impossible to get in for a non EU student

Sames goes for Mexico
The last one, sold the cancer treatment of some kids and gave them a placebo, everyone died
They even make a real-life soap opera:
- The Governor goes to the radio/Tv station to give an interview and denies every accusation, stressing that he is a man of values and that he has nothing to fear
- However, The Governor flees to Europe or the USA
- He lives with all the stolen money for some months, till he is  found and extradited to Mexico
4 .- Then, He is  incarcerated for a year
With All the privileges, practically it is like if he were in a 5 stars Hotel, away from every other inmate
5 .- They wait till things cool down, then a judge “finds no evidence” and he is set free
- The governor comes back to the Tv station and gives another interview
He makes himself a victim how he was poorly treated and even his family suffered
That there were hidden forces that wanted to incriminate him
- He is pardoned and his billions returned because obviously that money was from his wife’s inheritance
This script is repeated every time a Governor’s or even Mayor’s term is over
Presidents are too powerful, they do not need the script
This country is a joke
At least they try to hide it

And many more scary names from Mayas and Aztecs
But
hey I think we have access to Spanish rulers names from 1525 to 1810 and José Napoleon
I think the real question is: “Are there any well executed public project in Mexico
In Mexico:
they estimate 10x more money than needed for the project
They try to do the project with 1/20 of the money
It logically fails or is done with a lot of faults
They divert almost all the money to their pockets
For me all the names that are indigenous if you are not indigenous
For example: Citlali, Mitzi, Yatzil, Ix Chel, Metzli, Itzel, Xóchitl, Ikal, Cuauhtémoc, Moctezuma
Or going too far from religious names like María and José.
for example: Corpus Christi, Sagrario(sanctuary), Resurreción (Resurrection), Yahvé, Joshua
And when my fellow Mexicans want to make their children names unique by giving them foreign names
For example: Jessica, Stephanie, Jonathan, Hercules , Afrodita, Kaiser, Dixie, Brayan, Kimberly, Socrates, Washington, Stalin
Here in Mexico Brayan or Brian is a meme for someone  that is uneducated, poor and a crook
The same goes for Kimberly
Not cool naming your child “ Stalin Gomez García” or “ Luigi Perez Hernandez”.
I prefer my child to be the 10382083th Juan or Luis than giving him a weird name and let him be bullied in school
I remember always taking a six-pack of Sumol back home when I visited Portugal

Let me confirm the tap water you have is spot on delicious (I know it doesnt have flavor but still) even better that purified water here
When I first got there i probably looked very stupid buying a gallon of water
In Mexico we call it “el trono” (the throne)
We have it in Mexico too
Your favorite
Sounds like you care a lot about the historical element of your country and region , I’d love to hear your thoughts :)))
These are great suggestions for the next time I am there
I was only in Stuttgart shortly for a school trip and did not get to experience it fully
Thank you very much
Spain would smell like jamon iberiano tbh
Yeah
O Jamon Español
Una delicia por cierto, siempre compro cada que puedo
Bueno, tampoco le diria que no a una buena cervezita, el producto mas genial de la cultura occidental
(Tanto que mi ciudad literalmente vive de fabricar y venderla lmao)
¿En que tipo de comidas se suele usar el Jamon, por cierto
Yo lo uso para sandwiches mas que nada
That Europeans do not shower
They only use wet wipes to clean their bodies and perfume to mask the smell (specially the French)
Some friends and relatives that visited Europe reinforced the idea( 80s - 90s)
There is this idea that Europeans have poor hygiene and thats why they brought infectious diseases and  rats to the Americas
The first time I visited Europe I find out that it wasnt entirely true, but still it was new to me to find that there were indeed some people that smell and that the  smell was so strong for us, but others European didnt care
Many people said it, so as a kid I didnt question it
Yea, they even sell the idea that the Aztecs took a shower twice a day
And Mexicans like to blame Spain for all the corruption
“We were invaded by the worst of Europe, if only the Germans or the English had conquered Mexico”
Just recently, our President wanted the Spanish to ask for forgiveness
I used to work with russians and i loved that they were so direct and honest, and it caused some funny interactions too

Songs dedicated to worship Drug trafficking and drug lords
[song that glorifies “el chapo” fooling the mexican government and DEA
The saddest part is that this music is too popular in northern Mexico
It’s technically a royal anthem being used as a national one
It sounds like a Christmas song
I cry
I mean, it's not our fault your country's name is weird like that so you default to the name of the continent, which stupid or not is disorienting and vague
You are basically stealing a demonym from a total population of 1b+ people
I feel very isolated in many opinions altough I am not European I am Latin American
Maybe it’s because you have to open your mouth more while pronouncing English words
An American dude once told me that you have to open your mouth more while speaking English, that way people would get what are you saying
That you would only say "OMG" and such if you were religious, whereas l non-religious people say "gosh".
Having had some experience as an English teacher, it's really hard to just say "I don't know, I'll check it out" instead of making up bs
As someone living in Mexico City I could use a country like this
Doe anyone live there
If I heard someone say może być I wouldn't know how to answer either
> There also a hieraki of which alcohols we do share - beers are seen as personal items only to be shared in dire situations, whereas mixers and spirits are often shared if asked
That's interesting, in Mexico it's the exact opposite, bottles are seen as more expensive and therefore you'd need to ask for permission to have some of it while beers are shared even without being prompted to
I love learning little details and social etiquette like that
Taste in beer is not as strongly developed here as it is in Europe, so most people wouldn't turn down a beer even if it's not their favorite brand
In Mexico it is
As a Lone Wolf, people find weird when  I tell them I ate alone in a restaurant or I  went alone to the cinema
Why people from the capital says “quesadilla con queso”(wheat tortilla with melted cheese) when it is implied that all quesadillas have cheese, its name even have the prefix ques- with means “queso”(cheese)
All the country makes fun of it
Its weird how germany name changes a lot between distinct languagues
In spanish is Alemania

Where I live drinking tap water can kill you, so bottled water is a must sadly
I guess microplastics kill you slower
We always wonder how things would have been if conquerors hadnt come or if smallpox hadnt wiped out 90% of indigenous people

At least in my country we definitely feel closer to Brazil more than even countries like Spain as we have similar family and culture  values as well having the same struggles every Latin American country has go through that will be alien to Latin Europe
TIL, thank you
Some centuries ago the first Europeans that visited México were shocked when they found out that the locals sacrificed other people at the top of a pyramid, extracting their hearts and having a feast with their blood, arms and legs

That many places in Mexico can get very cold, of course not cold like in Europe but definitely cold

Cons: Violence, Organized Crime, there is almost no law enforcement, Mosquitos, Summer on steroids
I'd like to see the opinion from people from the Caucasus, like Hayastan, Sakartvelos, Azerbaijan
Some authors say those beautiful countries are asian and a few others say they are european
What's the truth behind this
No one obeys the law
The richer you are the more impunity you have
Very high corruption
Very high crime rates
Drug Cartels have a lot of power they even own some States and businesses like Avocado
But we have sunny days almost every day and Summer last 8 months
As someone thats lives in a place, that even right now in winter, is always between 30 to 45 °C, I wonder what is worse
well, i get what you are trying to say
I can feel that pain
That also happens in a very sunny day with 40 degrees lmao
That the Spaniards defeated the aztecs because of their superior technology
In reality, they were heavily outnumbered, but the Spaniards were smart enough to make alliances with other indigenous tribes
Another one is that “La Malinche” betrayed Mexicans and aided the Conquerors
La malinche was a woman that was gifted to Hernan Cortés (the leader of the conquerors), she became his lover and she was extremely useful because she knew Mayan and Nahuatl and with the help of another Spaniard that lived some years with the Mayans, they could translate from Nahualt to Mayan and then from Mayan to Spanish, helping the conquerors to communicate with the natives
Nowadays Mexicans refer to someone that despise Mexico and prefer foreign culture, especially European or American, as “Malinchistas”
In reality, when the conquerors arrived, Mexico didnt exist, it was a group of many tribes and the most powerful and dominant where the aztecs
The aztecs were like the romans, they were ruthless with the other tribes and demanded taxes including slaves
The subdued tribes found an opportunity to free themselves from the Aztecs when the spaniards arrived
Little they knew they were just trading one villain for another
a) I just know that most of the conquerors that came, where from the south of actual Spain
For us they came from Spain thats why History books says “Españoles”, with no distinctions among Castillians, Galicians, Catalans or Basque
If Castillians were the only ones to come, it is not taught  that way
B) if by tribe you mean very small groups, then in some cases it was correct
When Spaniards arrived to the Yucatan Peninsula they found abandoned Mayan cities, most of them were divided in small groups
I dont know if it was the same with the Tlaxcaltecas
In fact the Aztecs were form by 3 city-states: Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan
But in a nutshell you are right, they were cities that are better identified as City-States
What does Puolustus mean
I thought it meant maybe defense but you mentioned that also it includes the *Finnish* adjective
"Va de Guatemala a Guatepeor"
"It goes from GuateBAD to GuateWORSE"
When we don't find something at the supermarket for example,we say
"Oh god we are now north venezuela"

Ironically, Mexico is the OECD country with the longest working hours (2226 hours per year on average vs 1371 hours per year in Germany)
I know, don’t worry
Another sad thing is that Mexico is also the OECD country with the lowest productivity
Absolutely, there's an inverse relationship between work hours and productivity so total output decreases as well
Another thing that happens in Mexico is that while productivity has increased in the last 20 years, wages have stagnated
My dad calls me Chuchis, when I was little and starting to speak I was convinced it was my name
I don't think it means anything
My grandma called us grandkids cabronas/cabrones which is a cuss word jaja

How about starting with bark downwards then turn progressively as they stack up

Well, there are 68 recognized languages in Mexico
unfortunately, most of them are endangered
even though the caste system is long gone, people do not want to use their indigenous languages because there is a lot of discrimination against them
They encourages their children to learn and speak Spanish
I went to one of the Chontal Maya villages and they only wanted Spanish to be taught in their school
I'm not European but this happened in Europe so i guess it counts
When I was in Germany I went to a football game and had to take the metro to get to the stadium
Beside us were some drunk fans and we started talking singing and jumping
Then, one dude asks where we are from, we say Mexico and they start talking about cocaine and cartels
We were kind of shocked, insulted and disappointed at the same time
Anyway, I think it applies for all countries but, if you meet someone from a country with big infamously bad things (like el Chapo for Mexico, Pablo Escobar from Colombia or Hitler for Germany), just don't bring it up
Ask instead about culture or something you can find in common between you and the other nationality
Like Germans, Mexicans like football and alcohol, why not start there

Frankfurt looks more like a capital than Berlin
In Mexico is the other way around
There is a huge disparity in HDI between Mexico City and cities in other states(especially in the south)

They nailed the looks of the lady
Now this is a Tory promise I believe
Too late
Now that i think about it for all the mocking most of you here do to USA you too also don't really listen to your national music or rarely dress with your native clothes
>nd what do you even mean with "national music"? Music in our language
Music genres from your country, in mexico mexican music is always on top and heard not just by "uneducated rural peasants", same as Colombia, Puerto Rico overwhelmingly exports a ton of influential music for how small they are and Brazil lives in a bubble where foreign artists are just equal to national ones with national genres
>Anyway, your comment doesnt really make sense in the first place
Europeans mock gringos for their "lack of culture/traditions" all over this thread yet your own clothes and genres are relegated to second for rock, rap, trap, hiphop
And yes, we do have people who use "costumes" everyday but do have the expensive holiday dresses as you have, modern designs for blouses and shirts are a thing, a german official with a leaderhosen
Basically that
Climate change, y'all
Just wait till your temperatures keep rising and you no longer experience proper winters but a perennial state of spring-sumner with a growing tendency for longer, dryer summers

At what point do they indeed represent a significant part of a movement though
If these terrorist attacks were being committed by far right militants would you also say that they don't represent a movement
>When it's a bit more than a handful of people
Most Muslims don't commit these acts, but a significant proportion of Muslims hold incompatible values to those of the West: [
>The early Nazi party could a good example
Would you say that the current "attack on Europe by Islam" that some want to portray the situation here as is as organized as the Nazi party was
Or maybe not at all
I don't understand the point that you're making
What I was asking is the following:
If e.g. Sweden Democrats militants beheaded Muslims in their mosques, beheaded imams, drove cars into crowds of Muslims, etc would you go out to defend the Sweden Democrats saying that these people are not representative of their movement

they didn't even try it (it's good, I swear) they were too offended  it was hilarious

I've never been to Norway so I really don't know, I try to stay away from Mexican food when I'm not home
However I went to a Mexican restaurant in Madrid (La Boca) and their food was really good, almost the real thing but x5 more expensive
3-5€ for a taco when you can but one in Mexico for les than 1€
And I'm a Mujer btw
Memorial in Dublin to the Great Famine (where Ireland's population fell by between 20% and 25%)
This was a horrible, horrible famine that killed or displaced more than 2 million people in Ireland
It was caused by a number of factors:
The attack of potato blight caused considerable hardship in Ireland
In 1846, three-quarters of the harvest was lost to blight
The Freeman's Journal reported on "the appearance of what is called 'cholera' in potatoes in Ireland, especially in the north". The Gardeners' Chronicle announced: "We stop the Press with very great regret to announce that the potato Murrain has unequivocally declared itself in Ireland
Nevertheless, the British government remained optimistic over the next few weeks
Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel wrote that he found the reports "very alarming", but said there was "always a tendency to exaggeration in Irish news".
The succeeding Whig 1846 British administration, influenced by the doctrine of laissez-faire, believed that the market would provide the food needed
They refused to interfere with the movement of food into Ireland, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food
Throughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food
Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases
Irish exports of calves, livestock, bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine
This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport
You can learn more here:
Edit: Made the wording clearer and added the Wikipedia link
Edit 2: Added a date to clarify the timeline
Yes, forgot to clarify
About one million died of starvation or diseases related to a lack of food, and about one million moved out of Ireland
One of the many sad things is that the population hasn't rebounded to pre-Famine levels
A quick search gives me that the guy is a businessman and entrepreneur and has acquired a large empire of media companies
That's like literally the opposite of a communist
Hussites, or something else
As a mexican, seafood tacos are a common thing in the coasts
ok this is epic
This is delightfully petty
I love how they added the “hitler gasses millions” in parenthesis, just to really drive the point home
I feel like you looked for the worst places
Were they really democracies
As in every person, even the lowly peasants, had a voice over what the government would do
There were a lot of republics in ancient times, but they most of them were run by the elite
It was democracy but for the elite only
I think that is exactly how it should work
Hello guys, it is me a friend and today we're gonna talk about why am I single

22c is "cold" temperature here in cancun,guess that explains why the tourists become white ice cream in the 32c summer
In Spanish the names are even more similar
Suecia for Sweden and Suiza for Switzerland
lol
It's not that, it just simply  that they have not stablished relations
Many latin american nations were quickly recognized by the british after their independence  but for other european countries it took decades to stablish proper relations, not that they acted like they didn't exist but simply other things were more important
This made me think about The Sirens of Titan
I have the idea that a small country must be easier to successfully manage
Am I wrong
Here in Mexico average must be around 40

Let me drive this suburban in marseille
45 years later the people who were fetuses in their mother's wombs during that time died en masse due to diabetes, heart disease, and other diseases/disorders caused by their body having adapted to a starvation environment while living in abundance of unhealthy food
This is so fucking stupid omg, i wish all humanity dies off this planet, what a bunch of stupidity I've seen in all this turkey france  spat, fuck erdogan and macron for feeding their hogs dumb jingoistic shit to eat
This could make a cool flag
Then Mexico is indirectly responsible for all those nobel awards

Not European but,
That time our dictator lied on an interview in the US saying that there wold be free elections in Mexico, every one back home believed him and when he meddled in the elections the people got so pissed that they started a revolution that devolved into over 10 years of civil war with over a million dead people
I can only imagine Diaz coming back home after the interview and hearing that people truly believed that we wold have free elections:
“Of course were not having free elections dummies, that was just a lie for the gringos
Wow poor in Germany is middle class in Mexico
You are right, Poor in Germany is way better
free speech is crazy there, it’s honestly a good thing at the end
Germany of all places is the one that has less of that “a la America” free speech
American style
I always think that It would be awesome to live there
But I wonder how difficult is to get goods from outside
And as a Mexican it terrifies me to not have my daily avocado
I once heard that french fries are not French, but Belgian
Edit: my bad, We were supposed to talk about brands
The same if you call anyone from Catalunia, “Spanish” or if you (from ignorance) say that Catalan comes from Spanish
We love spicy food
Even kids candies are very spicy
I remember on one ocassion, we were eating in a restaurant in Sweden and we ordered a bowl of jalapeños peppers, then  we ate them like they were potato chips
People made a “WTF” face to us
We even asked the waiter for a spicier chile
I thought at least this was normal in Latin America, but my colombian and Venezuelan friends cant stand spicy food
That all mexicans are drug dealers
I was on vacations in germany and when I mentioned that I was mexican, one guy said: “So you know el Chapo
He thought I was lying when I told him I did not
I was working at a company with units in the USA and Mexico
When US managers came by, we like to show them around down town and take them to eat some Mexican food, you know, the whole Mexican experience
This asshole new manager comes, we are already setting things to show him the city and after we suggested a lovely restaurant to eat he asks "So, is it clean
I was so mad at him and I couldn't avoid to say "Well, it's Mexico, obviously we all eat on dumpsters next to a shit hole you fucking asshole"
I'm from Mexico, so not Europe, i hope you don't mind
In a buffet there was a sign for "gorditas de chicharron prensado" ([Gorditas] are a mexican dish made of corn dough and filled with different things, such as beans, cheese, eggs, or stews)
Gordita is also a way to say "fat" in a nice way
So they had an translation in the sign that said "Chubby girl from pressed chicharron".
The language is European (Spanish), but not sure if the word is used in Spain
The word *ahorita* (literally meaning, *little now*) can mean both "right now" or "probably, eventually sometime in the future".
* Haz la tarea
(Do your homework)
* Ahorita la hago
(Yeah, I probably will do it, or not)
* ¡Quiero este reporte para ahorita
(I want this report ASAP
Edit: Spelling and formatting
This looks difficult as hell to learn, but I'd love to be able to use it on daily conversations

Sames goes for Mexico
The last one, sold the cancer treatment of some kids and gave them a placebo, everyone died
They even make a real-life soap opera:
- The Governor goes to the radio/Tv station to give an interview and denies every accusation, stressing that he is a man of values and that he has nothing to fear
- However, The Governor flees to Europe or the USA
- He lives with all the stolen money for some months, till he is  found and extradited to Mexico
4 .- Then, He is  incarcerated for a year
With All the privileges, practically it is like if he were in a 5 stars Hotel, away from every other inmate
5 .- They wait till things cool down, then a judge “finds no evidence” and he is set free
- The governor comes back to the Tv station and gives another interview
He makes himself a victim how he was poorly treated and even his family suffered
That there were hidden forces that wanted to incriminate him
- He is pardoned and his billions returned because obviously that money was from his wife’s inheritance
This script is repeated every time a Governor’s or even Mayor’s term is over
Presidents are too powerful, they do not need the script
This country is a joke
At least they try to hide it

And many more scary names from Mayas and Aztecs
But
hey I think we have access to Spanish rulers names from 1525 to 1810 and José Napoleon
I think the real question is: “Are there any well executed public project in Mexico
In Mexico:
they estimate 10x more money than needed for the project
They try to do the project with 1/20 of the money
It logically fails or is done with a lot of faults
They divert almost all the money to their pockets
For me all the names that are indigenous if you are not indigenous
For example: Citlali, Mitzi, Yatzil, Ix Chel, Metzli, Itzel, Xóchitl, Ikal, Cuauhtémoc, Moctezuma
Or going too far from religious names like María and José.
for example: Corpus Christi, Sagrario(sanctuary), Resurreción (Resurrection), Yahvé, Joshua
And when my fellow Mexicans want to make their children names unique by giving them foreign names
For example: Jessica, Stephanie, Jonathan, Hercules , Afrodita, Kaiser, Dixie, Brayan, Kimberly, Socrates, Washington, Stalin
Here in Mexico Brayan or Brian is a meme for someone  that is uneducated, poor and a crook
The same goes for Kimberly
Not cool naming your child “ Stalin Gomez García” or “ Luigi Perez Hernandez”.
I prefer my child to be the 10382083th Juan or Luis than giving him a weird name and let him be bullied in school

Spain would smell like jamon iberiano tbh
Yeah
O Jamon Español
Una delicia por cierto, siempre compro cada que puedo
Bueno, tampoco le diria que no a una buena cervezita, el producto mas genial de la cultura occidental
(Tanto que mi ciudad literalmente vive de fabricar y venderla lmao)
¿En que tipo de comidas se suele usar el Jamon, por cierto
Yo lo uso para sandwiches mas que nada
That Europeans do not shower
They only use wet wipes to clean their bodies and perfume to mask the smell (specially the French)
Some friends and relatives that visited Europe reinforced the idea( 80s - 90s)
There is this idea that Europeans have poor hygiene and thats why they brought infectious diseases and  rats to the Americas
The first time I visited Europe I find out that it wasnt entirely true, but still it was new to me to find that there were indeed some people that smell and that the  smell was so strong for us, but others European didnt care
Many people said it, so as a kid I didnt question it
Yea, they even sell the idea that the Aztecs took a shower twice a day
And Mexicans like to blame Spain for all the corruption
“We were invaded by the worst of Europe, if only the Germans or the English had conquered Mexico”
Just recently, our President wanted the Spanish to ask for forgiveness
I used to work with russians and i loved that they were so direct and honest, and it caused some funny interactions too

Songs dedicated to worship Drug trafficking and drug lords
[song that glorifies “el chapo” fooling the mexican government and DEA
The saddest part is that this music is too popular in northern Mexico
It’s technically a royal anthem being used as a national one
It sounds like a Christmas song
I cry
I mean, it's not our fault your country's name is weird like that so you default to the name of the continent, which stupid or not is disorienting and vague
You are basically stealing a demonym from a total population of 1b+ people
I feel very isolated in many opinions altough I am not European I am Latin American
Maybe it’s because you have to open your mouth more while pronouncing English words
An American dude once told me that you have to open your mouth more while speaking English, that way people would get what are you saying
That you would only say "OMG" and such if you were religious, whereas l non-religious people say "gosh".
Having had some experience as an English teacher, it's really hard to just say "I don't know, I'll check it out" instead of making up bs
As someone living in Mexico City I could use a country like this

If I heard someone say może być I wouldn't know how to answer either
> There also a hieraki of which alcohols we do share - beers are seen as personal items only to be shared in dire situations, whereas mixers and spirits are often shared if asked
That's interesting, in Mexico it's the exact opposite, bottles are seen as more expensive and therefore you'd need to ask for permission to have some of it while beers are shared even without being prompted to
I love learning little details and social etiquette like that
Taste in beer is not as strongly developed here as it is in Europe, so most people wouldn't turn down a beer even if it's not their favorite brand
In Mexico it is
As a Lone Wolf, people find weird when  I tell them I ate alone in a restaurant or I  went alone to the cinema
Why people from the capital says “quesadilla con queso”(wheat tortilla with melted cheese) when it is implied that all quesadillas have cheese, its name even have the prefix ques- with means “queso”(cheese)

Cons: Violence, Organized Crime, there is almost no law enforcement, Mosquitos, Summer on steroids
I'd like to see the opinion from people from the Caucasus, like Hayastan, Sakartvelos, Azerbaijan
Some authors say those beautiful countries are asian and a few others say they are european
What's the truth behind this
No one obeys the law
The richer you are the more impunity you have
Very high corruption
Very high crime rates
Drug Cartels have a lot of power they even own some States and businesses like Avocado
But we have sunny days almost every day and Summer last 8 months
As someone thats lives in a place, that even right now in winter, is always between 30 to 45 °C, I wonder what is worse
well, i get what you are trying to say
I can feel that pain
That also happens in a very sunny day with 40 degrees lmao
That the Spaniards defeated the aztecs because of their superior technology
In reality, they were heavily outnumbered, but the Spaniards were smart enough to make alliances with other indigenous tribes
Another one is that “La Malinche” betrayed Mexicans and aided the Conquerors
La malinche was a woman that was gifted to Hernan Cortés (the leader of the conquerors), she became his lover and she was extremely useful because she knew Mayan and Nahuatl and with the help of another Spaniard that lived some years with the Mayans, they could translate from Nahualt to Mayan and then from Mayan to Spanish, helping the conquerors to communicate with the natives
Nowadays Mexicans refer to someone that despise Mexico and prefer foreign culture, especially European or American, as “Malinchistas”
In reality, when the conquerors arrived, Mexico didnt exist, it was a group of many tribes and the most powerful and dominant where the aztecs
The aztecs were like the romans, they were ruthless with the other tribes and demanded taxes including slaves
The subdued tribes found an opportunity to free themselves from the Aztecs when the spaniards arrived
Little they knew they were just trading one villain for another
a) I just know that most of the conquerors that came, where from the south of actual Spain
For us they came from Spain thats why History books says “Españoles”, with no distinctions among Castillians, Galicians, Catalans or Basque
If Castillians were the only ones to come, it is not taught  that way
B) if by tribe you mean very small groups, then in some cases it was correct
When Spaniards arrived to the Yucatan Peninsula they found abandoned Mayan cities, most of them were divided in small groups
I dont know if it was the same with the Tlaxcaltecas
In fact the Aztecs were form by 3 city-states: Tenochtitlan, Texcoco and Tlacopan
But in a nutshell you are right, they were cities that are better identified as City-States
What does Puolustus mean
I thought it meant maybe defense but you mentioned that also it includes the *Finnish* adjective
"Va de Guatemala a Guatepeor"
"It goes from GuateBAD to GuateWORSE"

Ironically, Mexico is the OECD country with the longest working hours (2226 hours per year on average vs 1371 hours per year in Germany)
I know, don’t worry
Another sad thing is that Mexico is also the OECD country with the lowest productivity
Absolutely, there's an inverse relationship between work hours and productivity so total output decreases as well
Another thing that happens in Mexico is that while productivity has increased in the last 20 years, wages have stagnated
My dad calls me Chuchis, when I was little and starting to speak I was convinced it was my name

Well, there are 68 recognized languages in Mexico
unfortunately, most of them are endangered
even though the caste system is long gone, people do not want to use their indigenous languages because there is a lot of discrimination against them
They encourages their children to learn and speak Spanish
I went to one of the Chontal Maya villages and they only wanted Spanish to be taught in their school
I'm not European but this happened in Europe so i guess it counts
When I was in Germany I went to a football game and had to take the metro to get to the stadium
Beside us were some drunk fans and we started talking singing and jumping
Then, one dude asks where we are from, we say Mexico and they start talking about cocaine and cartels
We were kind of shocked, insulted and disappointed at the same time
Anyway, I think it applies for all countries but, if you meet someone from a country with big infamously bad things (like el Chapo for Mexico, Pablo Escobar from Colombia or Hitler for Germany), just don't bring it up
Ask instead about culture or something you can find in common between you and the other nationality
Like Germans, Mexicans like football and alcohol, why not start there

They nailed the looks of the lady
Now this is a Tory promise I believe
Too late
Now that i think about it for all the mocking most of you here do to USA you too also don't really listen to your national music or rarely dress with your native clothes
>nd what do you even mean with "national music"? Music in our language
Music genres from your country, in mexico mexican music is always on top and heard not just by "uneducated rural peasants", same as Colombia, Puerto Rico overwhelmingly exports a ton of influential music for how small they are and Brazil lives in a bubble where foreign artists are just equal to national ones with national genres
>Anyway, your comment doesnt really make sense in the first place
Europeans mock gringos for their "lack of culture/traditions" all over this thread yet your own clothes and genres are relegated to second for rock, rap, trap, hiphop
And yes, we do have people who use "costumes" everyday but do have the expensive holiday dresses as you have, modern designs for blouses and shirts are a thing, a german official with a leaderhosen
Basically that
Climate change, y'all
Just wait till your temperatures keep rising and you no longer experience proper winters but a perennial state of spring-sumner with a growing tendency for longer, dryer summers
A classic "appeal to people's base xenophobic fears and steal their wallet while they're distracted" strategy, it has been employed by many regimes throughout history

At what point do they indeed represent a significant part of a movement though
If these terrorist attacks were being committed by far right militants would you also say that they don't represent a movement
>When it's a bit more than a handful of people
Most Muslims don't commit these acts, but a significant proportion of Muslims hold incompatible values to those of the West: [
>The early Nazi party could a good example
Would you say that the current "attack on Europe by Islam" that some want to portray the situation here as is as organized as the Nazi party was
Or maybe not at all
I don't understand the point that you're making
What I was asking is the following:
If e.g. Sweden Democrats militants beheaded Muslims in their mosques, beheaded imams, drove cars into crowds of Muslims, etc would you go out to defend the Sweden Democrats saying that these people are not representative of their movement
In related news, Chucky Lozano is hospitalized after Mexican fans cast down a rain of tortas, tacos, and quesadillas on the young man, following his game against Germany

Isn't that the original that started the trend of every European country making it's own version and the mods starting to delete them
This is outrageous
It's unfair
You've never seen it empty before because you always go through it at rush hour when the others near you are also going through it to commute, this pic was taken at a non-rush-hour time

Nationalism is a really bad drug
Imo they should,this is how the chavez regime went to the shitter in Venezuela, although they have oil to finance the "revolution".

Interesting, I'll have to dig some more on that
Thank you
I will, thank you very much
European version of El Chavo del Ocho

This is actually a problem:
Spain has a lot of university graduates with padded resumés (titulitis) that have few practical skills, but it also has a lot of highschool dropouts
The Spanish labor market is missing the middle technical trades education (Formación profesional) that countries like Switzerland or Germany highly encourage
I thought that wasn’t a thing in Europe, wishing you the best from Mexico

I had no idea the Mexican mint was so important
I'm also very surprised to find that's where the fabled "pieces of eight" were minted
Growing up in Mexico we weren't allowed to use "mom's good scissors" for anything, which were Fiskars
Never knew they were Finnish
Why Poland has still its flag
Oh my God
Are you trying to get the world to kill ya
American version would have the us and the venezuelan flag swapped
I've been visiting Poland ball way to often
It's Indonesia or Monaco
Silly me

As a Northern Mexican, I'm always surprised with the temperatures in Europe, which is way more north than my hometown, but still South, West and North West Europe don't have an extreme temperature difference compared with us

He looks ready to take out the younglings in the future
Haha pasta with ketchup, I met some Italians during an exchange program in Brazil and we invited them over and we had frozen pizza from the supermarket, after it was ready we (Mexicans) proceeded to soak our pizzas with hot sauce (because that's what Mexicans do) and they started yelling at us WHAT ARE YOU DOING
they didn't even try it (it's good, I swear) they were too offended  it was hilarious
And that's how you piss off an Argentinian
I've never been to Norway so I really don't know, I try to stay away from Mexican food when I'm not home
However I went to a Mexican restaurant in Madrid (La Boca) and their food was really good, almost the real thing but x5 more expensive
3-5€ for a taco when you can but one in Mexico for les than 1€

Memorial in Dublin to the Great Famine (where Ireland's population fell by between 20% and 25%)
This was a horrible, horrible famine that killed or displaced more than 2 million people in Ireland
It was caused by a number of factors:
The attack of potato blight caused considerable hardship in Ireland
In 1846, three-quarters of the harvest was lost to blight
The Freeman's Journal reported on "the appearance of what is called 'cholera' in potatoes in Ireland, especially in the north". The Gardeners' Chronicle announced: "We stop the Press with very great regret to announce that the potato Murrain has unequivocally declared itself in Ireland
Nevertheless, the British government remained optimistic over the next few weeks
Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel wrote that he found the reports "very alarming", but said there was "always a tendency to exaggeration in Irish news".
The succeeding Whig 1846 British administration, influenced by the doctrine of laissez-faire, believed that the market would provide the food needed
They refused to interfere with the movement of food into Ireland, then halted the previous government's food and relief works, leaving many hundreds of thousands of people without access to work, money, or food
Throughout the entire period of the Famine, Ireland was exporting enormous quantities of food
Almost 4,000 vessels carried food from Ireland to the ports of Bristol, Glasgow, Liverpool, and London during 1847, when 400,000 Irish men, women, and children died of starvation and related diseases
Irish exports of calves, livestock, bacon, and ham actually increased during the Famine
This food was shipped from the most famine-stricken parts of Ireland: Ballina, Ballyshannon, Bantry, Dingle, Killala, Kilrush, Limerick, Sligo, Tralee, and Westport
You can learn more here:
Edit: Made the wording clearer and added the Wikipedia link
Edit 2: Added a date to clarify the timeline
Yes, forgot to clarify
About one million died of starvation or diseases related to a lack of food, and about one million moved out of Ireland
One of the many sad things is that the population hasn't rebounded to pre-Famine levels
A quick search gives me that the guy is a businessman and entrepreneur and has acquired a large empire of media companies
That's like literally the opposite of a communist
Hussites, or something else
As a mexican, seafood tacos are a common thing in the coasts
ok this is epic
This is delightfully petty
I love how they added the “hitler gasses millions” in parenthesis, just to really drive the point home
I feel like you looked for the worst places
Were they really democracies
As in every person, even the lowly peasants, had a voice over what the government would do
There were a lot of republics in ancient times, but they most of them were run by the elite
It was democracy but for the elite only
I think that is exactly how it should work

22c is "cold" temperature here in cancun,guess that explains why the tourists become white ice cream in the 32c summer
In Spanish the names are even more similar
Suecia for Sweden and Suiza for Switzerland
lol
It's not that, it just simply  that they have not stablished relations
Many latin american nations were quickly recognized by the british after their independence  but for other european countries it took decades to stablish proper relations, not that they acted like they didn't exist but simply other things were more important
This made me think about The Sirens of Titan
I have the idea that a small country must be easier to successfully manage
Am I wrong
Here in Mexico average must be around 40

A lot of that surveys in fact don't measure happiness but satisfaction, but satisfaction != happiness
You can be extremely depressed and even so report high levels of satisfaction with your job and government because objectively you know they work properly

Let me drive this suburban in marseille
45 years later the people who were fetuses in their mother's wombs during that time died en masse due to diabetes, heart disease, and other diseases/disorders caused by their body having adapted to a starvation environment while living in abundance of unhealthy food
This is so fucking stupid omg, i wish all humanity dies off this planet, what a bunch of stupidity I've seen in all this turkey france  spat, fuck erdogan and macron for feeding their hogs dumb jingoistic shit to eat
This could make a cool flag
Then Mexico is indirectly responsible for all those nobel awards
I am fortunate to have been there, have seen it
