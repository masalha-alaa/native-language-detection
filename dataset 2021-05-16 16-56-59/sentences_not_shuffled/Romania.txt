I'll have to look up the sources again since it's been a while since I read them but:
A few years back there was a scandal of a pediatric doctor that did extremely painful medical experiments on children he was supposed to be treating, such as putting a metal rod near their backs and putting screws into their spines to "fix" scoliosis or something similar with bones he considered weren't growing properly
He mostly targeted poor families, or families with kids with weird conditions because he figured they wouldn't be able to or have the power to question his practices
Also the fact that it's been revealed several orphanages drug the kids there and tie them to their beds to keep them compliant
I've also read a religious article of an "exorcism" that was performed on a little kid they called posessed because "he would suddenly go very still and start shaking violently" (to anyone with a brain it's obvious he was just seizing)
Instead of following the procedure for a seizure, which is making sure he isn't in danger of hurting himself by bashing his head or something, they rushed him to a church and placed him on the floor there (and it wasn't a soft floor by any means)
Or the fact that we've had gay people thrown in prison for being gay several years after communism fell (I think either late 90's or even early 00's)
Or, not that sinister but just plain stupid and more recent: the church brought "moase" (aka remains of "saints") during the current pandemic and hundreds of people just lined up to kiss them, all on the same spot too :) (it's a /s smile, don't get me wrong)
In the early 70s, our fabulous dictator banned abortions because he wanted a baby boom
For Romanian women
Gypsy women were allowed to get abortions
Some doctors would recommend gypsy women to get abortions even if they were not necessary
Secrete police/party members would actually be in for some gynecological exams and make recommendations
Our communist dictator, Nicolae Ceaușescu, forced workers to build the parlament building and all the workers were then put in the foundantion of the building,this is just a myth but still very dark
When we(Romanians) had our revolution against the ruling party,the communists,(1989) the army shot at the revolutionaires
In return when the revolution was over, the dictator(Nicolae Ceausescu) was executed by firing squad on Christmas day
We were supposed to be a democracy
still working on that
I would have to counter this
In Ireland we have the Kerry Dark Sky Reserve, a Gold Tier Dark Sky Reserve (it was the first Gold Tier in the entire northern hemisphere, awarded in January 2014), and is now part of only 4 Gold Tiers in the whole world
More info can be found here:
So, not to say the German town is not dark, but is not the darkest place in Europe
Would love to visit it someday though
Cheers
> Or the fact that we've had gay people thrown in prison for being gay several years after communism fell (I think either late 90's or even early 00's)
The former
In 2000 Homosexuality became officially legal
oh my god, I didn’t know about any of this
Romania really is fucked up
Also don't forget the absolute atrocities that the Romanian troops did during the world wars
Romanian concentration camps were something that even the nazis found excessive
thanks :') i hate it
edit: i read it as "the latter" lol, not that it makes it too much better
and this is just a small part of it
if you go ask people under the poverty line or roma people you'll get even worse stories
I actually didn't know about that, damn
Yeah, history classes are very lacking
Check out what the troops did when they took Budapest or occupied Transnistria
Edit: Also check out how the families of gypsy soldiers were killed in concentration camps while they were fighting the war
And that the iron guard performed vampire rituals by cutting they're palms and drinking each other's blood
Or that they skinned jews and put them on meat hooks
Yup
we luckily didn't get the exposure that Hitler got
The only exposure we got is that we changed sides like Italy but only they are getting the attention
Hungary, no reason whatsoever
I would allow Turkey to join the EU and then choose Turkey
I don’t want to sound stereotypical, but
Hungary
"Item select"
[Extinction ball]
I wouldn't  but if I really have to then Luxemburg
Most romanians would say Hungary tho
Vatican could make for a nice little lake
France
Liechtenstein
Lowest casualties
I like you
We need you bro *for access in Turkey*
I might change my answer to Ukraine
Me too
It’s time for revenge
Is that even a sea
It is
They even make their own euro designs
Yes they do
We have some of the best maternity/paternity leave laws in the world
4 months mandatory maternity leave after the child is born and 21 other months of leave for one of the parents as decided by the family, for a total of 2 years
Can be either the mother or the father
If the child is born with a handicap, it's 3 years in total instead of 2
The leave is paid with 85% of your average net income for the past 12 months, up to a cap of about 1700 euro a month
Can I copy your laws
Just a bit, I mean most of the thing actually
We are so behind on everything
Suicidal people will kill themselves anyway, why not have it be as painless as possible
They do offer a lot of psychological help and tests to make sure they are not killing someone who doesn't actually want to die
Example: a girl born in a jehovah's witnesses fanatic family, raped by her uncle violently and because of that shunned by her family and friends for religious reasons
Why keep living in that nightmare of a life
I mean just being born to fanatics is bad enough
I myself would like if our country would have legislation for the present time, not for the 50's.
Also, it would be great if laws would be made for the people, but they sure aren't
Unrelated to progressive laws, I would change the financial laws to make them compatible with living in 2020
it's frustrating to do any kind of business here
I don't even mind the taxes, but the hell you have to go through in order to be able to pay them
A damn mess
Yeah and with Erdogan and the government being a bit too religious, I don't think that will happen soon
You mean like yourself
Gotcha
How dense are you
By that law they offer free sanity pads in public spaces and pharmacies where women that *need* them can have access to them
And a healthy woman is *in fucking need* of a tampon when blood is coming out of her huh-ha and it's not gonna stop if she tells her uterus that lobbyists are just pretending to care about feminism
And these are *absolutely necessary items* for a woman to *function properly in civilized society*.
You can take that straw man and shove it up your ass and if you want you can pretend it's a tampon
These are *necessary items to function without issue in the modern world*. Having more access to them is only a step forward
Vlad the Impaler defeating the Ottomans and asking the other european powers for help but instead got thrown in a hungarian cell
When we made the Ottomans attack themselves in the middle of the night (Can't remember if it was Vlad Tepes or Stefan The Great who commanded that operation)
We rejoined the First World War a day before it was over
Romanian troops didn’t even have enough time to get out the country
I’m Romanian
Vlad the Impaler (vAmPiRe) once made an ambitious plot to kidnap the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and force them to surrender while he was at war with them
The plan went off pretty well, except for one minor detail: the small kidnapping party Vlad was leading **missed,** and accidentally ended up entering the tent of the Sultan’s retainers, rather than the Sultan himself
And we were on the verge of greatness
Alternatively, the whole reign of Carol II
Our Parliament just decided a week ago to get rid of the Prime Minister and its cabinet without a backup plan
They were so surprised they did it that they still don't have a plan
Wtf
Now we have the same PM bc no one made any proposal for a new PM everyone would agree with :))
Yeah, but you did scared the s*it out of everyone
That counts as bonus points :))
Didn't bulagaria invade first ?
Yes bcuz the saxons from transylvania were defending and sustaining pretendents to his throne
Yeah, Romania declared that it would not be neutral in another balkan war
Fair point
"He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents, Dan and Basarab Laiotă (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's illegitimate half-brother, Vlad the Monk
Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them impaled (which inspired his cognomen)
Peace was restored in 1460
Yes but you cant claim he didnt have a casus beli ,anyway isnt know for sure that the reason he was imprisonned was that one
I'm about to go to Netherlands next week(for a job) in Waalwijk
Any advice
I can go with a bus, or with a plane in EINDHOVEN which do you think is a better choice(from Romania)
Thank you, I guess you're the first non-xenophobic helpful comment
Oh, guess I was kinda late, all I see now is"removed" so I thought all of them were like that
You live in a rusty Soviet-style apartment block built in the early 70s. Your city used to be a regional centre of industry under Communist rule - your mum and dad worked at one of the biggest textile factories in the country
Obviously, like many other cities in your region, all industry virtually disappeared after 1989
You work as a janitor at the only shopping mall in the city - it was built in what used to be the industrial district
You don’t tell your boss, but sometimes you stare at the shop windows around you; you wonder what it’d be like if you got a new pair of shoes or one of those fancy new “laptop” computers
The clock ticks, and before you know it, it’s 1 pm - lunch break
As you eat the ham and butter sandwich you made for yourself at home, you stare at the McDonalds inside the mall, in front of which you see a long queue of mostly young people
You wonder what your son is doing - he had left the country 4 years ago to go work in England as a restaurant waiter - but you haven’t heard from him in 2 weeks
You silently hope that he’s doing okay, and that he hasn’t forgotten about you
It’s the end of the month, so you collect your monthly €270 paycheck and head home, driving a 90s Dacia car
On your way home, you see a bunch of ads for the upcoming local elections
All of them have certain promises embedded under the parties’ slogans - we’ll raise the minimum wage, we’ll build new hospitals, we’ll build more highways
A long time ago, you’d have looked at these claims with optimism
But now, it’s been 30 years since the fall of communism, and the minimum wage has only went up as prices went up, no new hospitals have been built in your area, no new highways either
You’re home - you park your car, walk up to the 3rd floor, where your apartment is, crack a beer open, and turn the TV on
A couple of hours later, you fall asleep on the couch
You wake up the next morning - rinse and repeat
I don't know how the google street car had the courage to go there and take photos
Craiova ?
Did you see any poor people living in a new building
I've been living in a 20mp apartment with the girlfriend for 3 years now and have only been on 2 holidays in those years
None of us really spend money on the things you listed above
Our combined income (after taxes) is roughly 10 times our expenses, and it could be higher if I would work full time but am still studying
I wouldn't consider ourselves poor, but not stinking rich either
That's not a good way to judge poverty
Usually people driving BMWs, sporting the latest Iphones and some chains on them are so deep in debt that they can only dream to be as rich as a homeless addict living in a sewer with 2 cardboard boxes to his name
Exactly, lol
For my 3rd birthday my parents took me to McDonalds
I based this on the Southwest region yeah, my mum’s side of the family is all from there - Craiova, Slatina, Târgu Jiu, etc
We have the same saying like you guys
totally made sense for me
I get what you mean, and in a way, the perception of McDonald’s has massively shifted in places like Bucharest/Cluj, which have drastically improved in terms of standards of life compared to 20-25 years ago
I grew up in Bucharest and the city back then is completely different to how it is now
When I was a little kid, I used to be scared to go into local parks because there were stray dogs everywhere and the rusty benches usually had used syringes near them
People could afford basic necessities, but most luxuries were out of the question barring special occasions such as your kid’s birthday or whatever
You could pretty much get away with anything as long as you bribed the police with a sufficient amount of money
And it wasn’t just the police lmao, I always used to hear an urban myth about how in the late 90s-early 00s students in some schools who wanted to get high grades in the Baccalaureate (our variant of the SAT) would just leave a notebook with $20 bills under each page in front of the supervising teacher when they gave their paper in
The city right now is fundamentally different
For starters, it *looks* different - various historical areas have been rejuvenated/renovated, the road network is less of a mess, office buildings and skyscrapers have been propping up all over
People’s life standards have improved to the point where Bucharest has a higher HDI and GDP per capita than plenty of areas in Western Europe
The city also massively grew in size with the real estate boom of the late 00s - early 10s, the parks have been cleaned up, corruption has significantly been clamped down upon, etc
In a place like Bucharest, people’s opinions about McDonald’s have definitely changed from “let’s eat like Americans” to “ew, it’s unhealthy, let’s just make a kale salad instead”. But in many places forgotten by time, nothing has changed from the 90s till now
> I also forgot to bring in the homeless and particularly Rumanian beggars who live in absolute poverty by several measures
Most of them go there to beg as a job, as a choice
In Romania they build villas with the money they "earn" there
[For ex
] (the news coverage is in Romanian but main subject is how a Swedish delegation came to Romania to see with their own eyes where the beggars live and they were perplexed)
All I'm saying is that most of the Romanian beggars don't deserve your pity and giving them money actually makes things worse
Omgg the Mcdonalds birthday parties
Such an Eastern European classic haha can’t believe I forgot about them
In my local Mcdonalds they were held in a mini-tramway next to the McDrive area
I actually went to one of my friends’ birthday parties there as a kid
Either we didnt have those (from Baia mare) or j was too poor to even know about it
Lol but I do remember when they opened up the first McDonald's in our town and they had a swirly slide
There was a lineup of kids because every other slide in our town was metal and went straight down
This one was plastic AND it went in a circle
It blew our little minds
>  I always used to hear an urban myth about how in the late 90s-early 00s students in some schools who wanted to get high grades in the Baccalaureate (our variant of the SAT) would just leave a notebook with $20 bills under each page in front of the supervising teacher when they gave their paper in
Definitely a real thing, although I'm not sure about the amount
And the money given to the supervisors happened at the beginning of the exam, to make sure they look the other way when you tried to cheat
My highschool had a lot of night classes (seral), with older people who were trying to finally get their BAC diploma, and they were the ones who were paying these supervisors
Im so happy to read this
We came to Canada in 2001 from Baia Mare
I've always told people that romania is a beautiful country but its not fun to live in
I genuinely hope and wish romanian politicians and leaders would get their shit together and it sounds like it's happening slowly
> In my local Mcdonalds they were held in a mini-tramway next to the McDrive area
Dristor
> I doubt that counts for all or most of them really
I don't :))
How do you think they end up there all the way from Romania
If they were so poor they would beg in Romania
Also it's because you guys have a very high standard of living
You think you give them a little amount of money, but for them is better than the one they receive elsewhere (especially in Romania)
They "earn" in Norway and they spend in Romania (and not in the big cities, so the difference is even greater)
+You underestimate how much money you can actually make from begging
[Example] from a show from US
[Example] of "romanians" (few words that they use are in Romanian) that begged in UK
> the conditions they live under here aren’t worthy and pretty shocking
I agree and I don't really understand them
But they don't think like you and me, they have their own set of values
When I went to order frozen yogurt a few years back, I forgot the word for gummy bears and said it in english, so the cashier asked me where I'm from :')
I also frequently translate words directly, for example I wanted to say "the building's records" and I said it as "recordurile cladirii" (recorduri still means records, but only the more common meaning not this one), and my family still reminds me of that to laugh at me
For the most part people don't care much, some might think it's funny or that I'm not Romanian (at first), but I've had a negative experience of someone asking me "how did your romanian teachers ever pass you" or "you'll never get a job like this", as well as constantly correcting me
I honestly don't think my Romanian is That bad, but I'll admit my sentence structure tends to be wonky, and I need a bit more than most to think of words (this is only visible whenever I try to say longer sentences)
I don't care too much tho, cuz I'm moving to Spain in a few years anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, I'm a stereotype lol)
Oh hell yeah
I forget words in Romanian and just blank out until I forget the word in English too and I'm just stuck there staring at the poor person I was talking to
Yep
I learned English to understand what games are saying and to read all those science articles that don't get translated, as a result I have trouble talking in Romanian about those because I genuinely don't know the translation
Same goes for creatures that I read first in English, and I discovered most people that do that refer to those creatures by their scientific name in Romanian
You would think that a snake so common kept as pet like the Mexican Black Kingsnake would have a name in Romanian too, but it doesn't. Lots of creatures are in the same situation
Yess I'm starting to have the ability of a toddler when it comes to explaining things in a coherent and normal way and it's so annoying, like how did that even happen, i'm still speaking my language everyday yet i'm losing vocabulary
It's even harder when you are trying to switch between 2 nonnative languages
Every time I speak German for a longer time and then switch to English or vice versa I sound like I'm having a  stroke
For day to day use no, but for work related (IT) issues, English is so much practical and concise, aside from being the ‘native’ language for most of the stuff related to my work
Most of the times though I find myself acknowledging that the primary advantage of English is being more concise over my native Romanian
Yes, oh God yes
I forget words in my native language but know them in English
Im top of my class in English and my teacher said she thought that i probably think in english instead of Romanian since i understand English easily but when translating i kinda suck
I use English daily
I feel like I'm getting better at English, not worse at my native language
I use it so much that I created my own language englo-romană or in English English English-Romanian
Yes, especially since I go to a private school that uses the Cambridge syllabus
I mostly use English to communicate with my friends (which are mostly Romanian) and that makes it even messier
I constantly have the fear of mixing the two and it somehow resulted in my self-esteem taking a huge blow if I can’t find a Romanian translation for an English word I know
I’ve shared my fears with my parents, they claim I speak Romanian perfectly, but my fear remains, as unjustified as it is
EDIT: Paragraphs were a mess
Yeah definitely
My boyfriend and I even randomly speak in English
When I write to my friends we often write in English
So much media we consume is in English it's hard not to end up this way lol
I've also been learning English since I was like 5, and so it just became second nature
I tend to find it easier to express certain thoughts in English, it just feels more natural I guess
I can't say I feel bad about it, it's just the direction I developed in
YES
I feel like it's getting worse year by year
Almost all entertainment and media that I consume is in English and I catch myself speaking English like 25% of the time, especially when texting
I used to find it a bit irritating when I saw/heard other people do it and now I'm just as guilty
There are so many words I know in English-but there is no translation in Romanian,or the translated word is unused/weird
Sometimes i even forget words in my native language,or thats just dyslexia
Wait what
What rules
There are rules
Like besides people /place names and the start of sentences
I don't know this in any language lol
Oh boy French classes here were always the teacher talking to themselves and students doing whatever
No one ever cared to even pretend to listen, save for a few kids
It used to be really bad, but now I’m fine with it
I use American accent but can sound a bit Slavic sometimes
I don't mind it, but I know it sounds generically Eastern European
I don't speak with any accent
Is this just me or a general Romanian thing
As a Romanian raised Irish person I think that my English accent is very heavily Irish sided and I do like it
Like some other people on this sub are saying, you shouldn't be ashamed of your accent
If you can convey what you want to say to the other party then that's fine for me
when i'm home alone speaking english to myself,you could probably tell i'm american if you were 50% deaf
when i have to speak in front of other people it's just horrible(bonus points if i'm nervous)
I don't know honestly, I do sort of have an accent but I never thought about it being that noticeable and it doesn't really bother me in english speech anyways as most people still can understand it
I'm disgusted every time I hear my voice when I speak English
I've been told by Americans that I have a French accent though in my opinion I don't sound french at all
Not really tbh, it doesn't sound weird or "russian" in any way but it's pretty obvious I'm not a native speaker
I do like it since half of Romanians have great English accents, but half dont give a fuck
Its like a slower american accent Id say
I sound like a far-eastern Russian trying to mock a British accent and when I was in London I was asked several times if I'm from Russia, so
yeah, I guess
Romanians don't have an accent(I'll explain)
Romanian is phonetic language,that is the sound in the alphabet match the sounds used in words,unlike English,the only exception are found in borrowed words and the 8 letter clusters and sound clusters
That makes our language without an accent,althought this aplies only for Muntenia and Dobruja
So Romanians have the advantage of learning Russian(the sounds â ă ș ț also exist Romanian) and English(since we don't have an accent)
If you hear a Romanian speaking English,it sounds like a Russian speaking English,but he forgot he's Russian XD
I have found that there are more Romanian English accents
There is the Eastern European one but there is also one that sounds more like an Italian/Portuguese accent
You def have a Romanian accent
It's extremely hard to hide
You can even hear it from guys like Andrei Terbea (has a yt channel), who has an almost perfect American accent
I have noticed this with everyone
Have seen native Germans make tons of grammar mistakes and native English people make them
I had to learn the grammar of German and English in school, whereas I never had to think hard on Romanian grammar because, most of the time, it would come out ok naturally
I figure that it's the same for other languages as well
Tbh, English is one of the easiest languages that I know of so every language might feel difficult for native English speakers
That's probably one of the reasons
Compared to German or Dutch though it's much easier
And Hungarian is one of the hardest languages I tried (and failed) to learn, German is a piece of cake by comparison
I do know that Hungarian is very different from germanic and latin languages so it's probably why native Hungarians don't find these languages so easy
And it's the same the other way around
My girlfriend is half Hungarian and has been trying to teach me some
I can read and pronounce but damn if I understand anything
You guys have no gender in the language, it's wild
Still trying
I live in a place with significant Hungarian population and would like to be able to communicate easily with everyone
Well, you'll notice that more then 45 minutes have passed and the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
Which I almost can't believe and hope I haven't jinxed it
It think the most simple answer is the price tag
People know phones need to be changed once in a while, they know phones are dropped once in a while so most aren't comfortable paying that much for just a phone
It's specially true now that calling, whatsapp/messenger/etc
and browsing is possible with almost every single phone out there
So buying a phone that costs more then a gaming system or a fridge (just examples) is kind of silly
To be honest a vast number of people in Romania aren't very rich and those that are well with money still have a more "value for money approch". Sure the  contracts for the carrier aren't expnesive at all and you could well get an iphone if you're willing to pay more for the contract
To be honest it seems to me and I'm not the only one here that apple products are  overpriced and so are the accesories
I had an iphone once but I really liked the android os as soon as I got it
Ro is on the poorer side of life
You're not gonna see people use iPhones unless they want you to (you know, the kind of people that keep flashing the amount of money they have)
Besides that, to buy an iPhone (if you don't live in the capital) means ordering online and some years ago this also meant ordering from outside the country because no inside company would bring them
Now there are more people that have iPhones than 10 years ago, but still not that many
Another thing is that when you buy a Sim card with a payment plan (ex: pay 5 euros per month for a year), you also get an android phone if you pay an extra 2 euros per month
Shittier phones come free with the plan
So what incentive would people have to buy an iPhone except prestige or some technological snobbism
I have friends that have iPhones, but all of them either received it from a relative that lives in North America or as gift from a snobbish family member or won it in a contest, etc
Really it's just the price difference and the specs are not that great either
I mean yes, iPhones are super expensive in Romania (considering the phone I'm using right now was 1
100 lei, which is approximately 230€ and works just fine) but I lived in Italy for a long period of time and iPhones are still not that popular
Sure, a few of the popular girls in highschool had them, but the rest of us had Androids, you'd rarely find someone with an iPhone
I guess it's also just the price
Since in Italy you can get a good Android for €250 and an iPhone is close to €900, maybe even more
i think that one of the reasons might be that apple is an american oem and americans just go for the in house stuff
idk or maybe it just became a trend and everyone likes to sheep along
or maybe NA is the least tech savvy nation so they just go for the simplest to use phone haha
as for europe,i think it's mostly because they're less expensive,dk how to explain the germany phenomenon,(i'm terrible at history so don't @ me)i think it's because of the past economy where people were forced to buy the most basic stuff(pls don't kill me if i'm wrong)but i think that the money saving theory applies to most european countries
on a whole,tech enthusiasts would rather go for android since it's less limited than ios
Why would i "invest" in a company (apple)that takes it's customers for stupid, and shits on them some examples: first and most important intentionally slowing down older phones to force people to but new phones,  removing  existing feautures on phones and selling them sepparate after, lobbying against right to repair laws in USA,   alot of iphone  fixing content blocked on youtube, and many more
Plus you can use your friend's charger if you need to
i kinda have to disagree on the android stuff
every android company has its own android "skin" so the os - or at least the ui - is not really the same
apple on the other hand makes stuff more simple,all iphones(and tablets for the most part) run the same os and the same ui,the macs have their own os and so do their watches
that's why most people go for apple products,because they're simple and seamless to use,not like android phones that each have their own individual ui
i personally am an android fanboy but i can totally understand where iphone users come from
or maybe i just misunderstood what you were saying haha,feel free to correct me if that's the case
>the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
*sad pitchfork noises*
Is that shit for real
It just seems so unbelievable to me that she didn't know what the Play Store is
I mean, at least in Romania we have a lot of advertisement for apps and they always say something like "available in the Play Store" or if it's a poster they have the Play Store logo, so I don't know someone could be not aware of the Play Store
lol not if you get a huawei
jk you're right
I meant it more like a rhetorical question and expression of surprise, I wasn't actually implying you might be lying :)
I just find it very strange that a young person wouldn't know such a basic thing about phones, but alas, who am I to judge
I'd say it's Vaslui, the Detroit of Romania
Bucharest doesn't have that good of a reputation either
I'm not sure but I think Caracal due to some recent events
But the city we make fun of it's Vaslui
personally I'm the most dissapinted by Târgoviște
it had potential to be cool due to its history
but its kinda gone to shit now
its ugly, there's trash everywhere, there are lots of abandoned buildings, the historical places are trashed and poorly taken care of by the locals
the only thing saving this town is the chindia tower and all the museums
Vaslui news articles are the Romanian equivalent of Florida Man
Edit: Bucharest overall is okay, far from being comparable to Vaslui imo, I'd say it's mostly the ghetto neighborhoods like Ferentari
But almost every large city has those
Is it either or neither in this context
I can't really tell
I am a Vaslui native and the facts are the following:
The city (town) of Vaslui is actually decent or at least mediocre
The main reason Vaslui got this reputation is because of what happens in various villages across the county of Vaslui
If the county and its capital didn't have the same name then the perception wouls be different
You wouldn't say, for instance, that the people of Munich are barbarians based on what some idiots in some bumfuck village in Bavaria are doing
Detroit is a specific expression, not a shorthand for shitty place
For a city to be "like Detroit", it needs to be a former industrial city that fell apart after the factories were closed, causing many residents to flee to cities that had jobs for them
Vaslui was never a notable industrial town
Nooo, Vaslui beats Caracal for sure
Caracal only had this one recent event (which was horrible indeed), but generally it is hardly mentioned
In Vaslui there is a lot of fucked-up shit going on, it easily wins the contest of the most fucked up place in Romania lmao
It’s “either”, because you used “doesn’t” and English doesn’t accept double negations
Why not both
Who just sits on public toilet seats tho
Edited
Thanks
Moldova is definitely poorer and there would be something to say about Ukraine and Belarus and maybe Albania idk
Yeah the casino is a shame
But it is still a very good walk right next to the sea
It is nice to go there after beach(since it is you have a beach next to it) and after that chose from a bunch of restaurants
It is pretty cool but honestly you might as well go to somewhere better like spain
You might think of this as being cheaper but i assure you it might be the same or even higher depending on what you want to do
People also come there in summer to flex with their cars so there is that
I can say one thing
We always blame it on the traffic
My wife was having a baby
In Romania we say: my dog died
And since I'm living in UK:
Me: - traffic was horrible this morning
My colleague: - but you don't drive
Me: - shush, they don't know that
Came here to say this
Even in University, profs only get started 10-15 minutes after the official start time
It's gotten to a ridiculous point
I made a reservation for my birthday and made it for earlier so people have time to arrive but then I find out that someone has to actually sit there at the agreed upon time or they won't hold it for me
I ended up sitting alone with my girlfriend and another dude for 3 and a half hours until everyone gathered
I was planning for the whole thing to last around 2-3h total
And “the subway was too crowded, so I had to wait for the next one”
we aren't actually lying
Also, if you have to switch at Unirii station during rush hour, it means extra 10 min
That's how it's called here as well
Despite our lack of proper maintenance of many things in our country, subway is actually okay
Quite clean, tickets are not very expensive, some gates are new (especially the one in central areas and the new stations)
It is not as big or modern as the one in London or Paris, but it looks a bit better than the one in Warsaw or Budapest
However, for some reason I found the tube in London to be extremely loud compared to ours, but it might be because of the way tracks are built
It isn't smelly and some stations have convenient stores while the most central station has a McDonald in there
I still wish it looked like the one in Moscow (if you don't know how it looks like, I strongly suggest you google that
To be honest traffic is a major problem in Bucharest as too many people live there and public transporation is usually crap, so subway is probably the best and fastest way to move around the city
Also, really interesting that you have a Romanian girlfriend in Japan, haha
>I think overall Romania looks a million times better as people percieve it, sure its not rich but I never felt like it was poor
Thanks
A lot of people don't realize that
Funny that I've always dreamed to go to Japan as I grew up watching a lot of Anime and picking up Japanese words
I somehow consider it a dreamland
However, I never imagined there are a lot of Romanians there
Interesting
on paper: handy-man
in reality: jack of all trades
IT Support
IT Department but could work anywhere
Probably got the job for  money but has absolutely no idea what to do
Romania - that odd one who is sometimes considered crazy by other co-workers
Works in IT, early 20s, slightly underperforms most of the time but does really well on a few key projects
Frequently takes smoke breaks but doesn’t really hang out with anyone from work
Plays video games at home for most of his evening
I am that not very important staff guy that always steals everyone's shit
Hot and kinda slutty receptionist
Romania: IT support that takes too many smoke and food breaks, so he ends up working less than expected from the management department (Germany) he usually gets in fight with Hungary over which department is better
Like "I slip you an extra 5 Euro bill and you make my panini extra tasty" type of situation
Accurate
I would have said something related to oil
go to the main page of the subreddit and in the top left corner there will be 3 dots, press on them and go to user flair
Most of the time I don't even know what kind of English I'm using :/
I hope it's English tho
> couch
both couch and sofa
>sidewalk
what even is the british version of that
>pants (for trousers)
pants
>gas (for petrol)
i didn't even know it was correct to use petrol for gas, but i'm gonna use it from now on since it's identical to how we call it in my language
>vacation
Vacation
I use holiday to speak of celebrations (Christmas, Easter holidays, etc
) and vacation to speak of actual free days
>candy
not using sweets
>And what about accent
For example how do you pronounce the short O sound like in not
Or do you pronounce your word-final Rs
yes and yes, both in the american way
no reason
The sheer distance between everything and the fact that most americans consider an 8 hour drive no big deal
Super sweet everything
Really oldschool roads
( not bad but oldschool)
But otherwise nice people
The sheer distance between everything and the fact that most americans consider an 8 hour drive no big deal
Friend of mine saw a bag of six doughnuts for 1 dollar
Of course he made a joke about obesity levels in the US
My biggest shock was how small the statue of liberty was because when I saw it on TV I thought it would look completely different
Also beaches in California are not filled with models that will make you feel like you are in heaven
Of course dress code in Walmart or shops in general and morbid obesity
Also seeing an automatic rifle being carried by someone
How you balls freeze in a building all year round, I went to school and I was wearing a sweater and my colleagues were wearing shorts and flipflops during winter
It's frowned upon to put ketchup on pizza, i had all my American friends shocked when i asked for ketchup on pizza day
> Slovenia
you must be tall as hell
Same
There are a lot of inesane things I bumped into during my businy visits but two things stuck with me: I though sesism was bad in our neck of the wood but oh boy do they take it to a whole new level
Nobody blinks an eye that I'm a woman in a top technical position, I was a novelty in the late 2000's when I started but got no comments and was judged purely on my credentials even then but boy was I turned upside down and questioned left a d right while my male colleagues were just take as is
And second the work culture is borderline exploitative
Sure nobody's forcing you to work overtime on no pay but you better do it if you ever want a raise or a promotion
> Everyone on reddit seems to think that wearing shoes inside your house is weird
I can assure you people in real life think this way too haha
My wife is visibly disgusted every time someone jumps on the sofa or in the bed in movies while keeping their outdoor shoes on
Just get slippers or indoor shoes, c'mon
In Budapest they had quite a difficult to understand parking system, and we went up to a young woman to help us
She wasn't familiar because she didn't drive, but she spent 5 minutes searching for someone who knew and could explain
She finally found someone, it was a family coming back to their car in the parking lot, and they gave us their ticket, since they were leaving, and it was paid for the full day
Now that's what I call kind people
>  Is that a legit stereotype/stat
from what I heard, yes
Well we have indoor shoes for that
Like [these]
What is the bad thing happening right now in your country with everyones attention drawn to the obvious current subject
In Romania they are massively illegally cutting forests with even our government lying to our faces about it
Illegal logging
However, citizens are increasingly aware of this
The sad thing is that nobody knows who can actually help us
We have ghost companies selling masks to the government for millions of euro or city halls buying decorative fountains instead of funding the hospitals
Liquid Snake
Whats happening without being in the news
(Taking advantage the spotlight is on corona)
Good one
:))
There’s a dark secret lurking somewhere
They even bought lights and decorations for Easter (Suceava, nonetheless, which is a hot-spot of infection nationwide)
They should raise the quality of life and security for people
What do they want
A bunch of newborns with no future and fucked up families
Ilie (M) and Otilia (F)
Traian and Gelu for males and for females maybe Geta
Probably Haralambie and Zaharie in Romanian
I thought you guys were legally obligated to name your baby boys Atila, Arpad or Laszlo
Ileana is still quite popular here and it sounds good too
I would add Paraschiva, Filofteia and Neaga for girls
I thought letitia is just what our prime minstress called Latvia a year ago
Aren't Kaan and Kağan the same names
Also, I saw the name Gokhan in a turkish drama, it was the name of a highscbooler, probably not written Gökhan though
Are they Romanian
I know no Ilie IRL
To me it sounds like a name people use in more rural areas
You must be Ferdinand
Yeah, well I thought it comes from the old population of Geto-Dacians if that makes sense
Yeah, there are still many more
Is this some sort of Slavic joke that I’m too Latin to understand
It's actually short from Gherghina a variation of Georgeta or Georgiana
Vasile
Everytime I hear the name I picture a 75 years old man from the countryside, I can't imagine someone named Vasile being younger than 50
Are turkish names perhaps hierarchical
Are there some names that can be considered high class
Because sometimes here in romania, that's the thing
People in villages will have lower class names than people in cities
Omg my mom used to believe that shit but thankfully she's normal now
I remember she was afraid of toasters and microwave ovens when I was a child
I always imagine Vasile as you do, but drunk
Are they also Romanian
I bet my mom during the late 90s/early 2000s would match it and surpass it
Here are some of them:
- doing absolutely no work sunday and on religious holidays
- periodically drive to a monastery to bless the car
- periodically call the priest to bless the house
- keeping garlic at the house entrance to repel the evil spirits
- if traveling by train, pour sugar on the floor around the seat and in the compartment doorway (don't really know the reason for this)
- periodically burn incense and smoke the whole house, recite some prayers when smoking the corners
- if I felt sick she would burn some matches and drop the ashes in a glass of water which I would then have to drink for the curse to be lifted
- a different prayer and saint for everything (eg one for good food, one for good grades, etc)
- Not 100% antivax but ~40%
- scared of the following because of radiation: microwave oven, toaster (this one is the weirdest), phones, phone antennas, tv antennas, phone towers, computers and anything left in the wall socket overnight without good reason
- would talk about the good/bad energy she felt while interacting with people
It also had color
- many more, but these are just the ones which come to mind now
I don't know how I turned out normal tbh
Isn't the burnt match toxic
I mean, how wouldn't that make you sicker
Well I wasn't drinking the matches, just sipping from the glass that had some burnt matches on the bottom
I am still here so I guess it's safe
I'm personally very glad that this is happening
And I think loads of idiots in eastern Europe will complain
2050 it’s too long for me, 2025 would had been better
And all cars except hybrid or electric should be banned until 2020
That would cause a massive traffic decongestion in Bucharest for sure
It’s not about what you want, it’s about what it must be done
And that is the only way to archive the future
People would be upset but who care
Humans don’t know what they want until you show them
Only if you could stop being so selfish and think about others
I switch between English and Romanian pretty often but I do forget words in Romanian sometimes
Yes
Sometimes I think some sentences sound weird in Romanian so I say them in English and sometimes i forget the Romanian word and I have to translate it
I never had this problem
That being said, I learned or tried to learn lots of languages along the years
So I can recognize quite a lot of languages by accent and key words, even though I don't know them well
I've been learning english for about 7 or 8 years
About 1 or 2 years in i began thinking in english and not in my native language and i still do
This wasn't a problem until 3 years in when i knew about the same ammount of words in english as my native language and i began forgetting words in my language in favor of english
As an example, i just can't say Făină (Flour)
I just can't remember that word
Yep
I would be watching something in English and if some unexpected word/sentence in Romania pops up I have to think twice before I understand it
Same if I'm listening to the radio and a new song in Romanian comes along but the singer talks fast/ is hard to understand
The first ever perfect 10 awarded in the Olympic games went to Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci
We have an entire village displayed in a museum (Astra Museum of Folk Civilisation)
We have a cemetery called "The Happy Cemetery" located in the village of  Săpânța,Maramures and it's extremely colorful
The tallest wooden church in the world, and the second tallest wooden structure in Europe, is found in Sapanta Peri, Maramures of northwestern Romania
The 257 foot tall church is topped by a 23 foot cross that weighs 1,000lbs
Romania’s 22,298km rail network is the 15th most extensive in the world
Bucharest’s mass transit network is the fourth largest in Europe
Timișoara was the second city to be fully iluminated with elwctric poewer
We have the 'Happy Cemetery' 3
Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building
Transfagarasani highway is the most beautiful road
We have REALLY good internet
Romania is one of the largest producer of wine in the world and the third producer of cereal in the EU
Romanian is the only remaining Balkan Romance language that still exists
During the Cold War,Romania was the only Warsaw Pact member that didn't invade Czechoslovakia
Constanta is the largest port on the Black Sea
The Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest is the second largest building in the world(after the Pentagon)
I think that you have more saunas than cars
I didn't remember the exact measurements so I just looked up the measures and I got them from probably an American site
If only we had the infrastructure for it
Didn't saw it was in pounds and feet
I've heard my mother mention this bs as well
It's interesting to see it's a thing in other countries too
It’s the same in Romania :/
That the coronavirus was created by corporations in an attempt to lower population
Man, we really do have the lowest IQ in Europe
We have this exact same thing over here in Romania
Your Orban is more creative than our Orban
> that the evil european union wants to replace us all with muslims
Wait
I thought it was the Jews who wanted to replace all of us with Muslims
Did they switch it around this time
Or, does the evil EU = Jews
Oh come on Hungary, don't leave us like this
It's not
We have Soros conspiracies too
Not good, man
Nope
Keep your crazy Orban
> Do they also play into his Hungarian origins in Romania
Yes
That's why he's perfect as a boogeyman
I also heard some conspiracies about Soros wanting to take Transylvania and give it to Hungary
How about a recycling bin
This is an idea horrible, don't think you can even know who is doing the action
In my language have conjugations different based on which person is doing the action, but in english don't have such a thing
Not have sense, many languages have a order word very normal
Love cheese because has taste good
Who's don't like cheese
Don't know what say
Love puppies
What should say now
In language Romanian, tend not to use pronouns before a verb, as the conjugation form of the verb is usually enough
Also, double negation means negation
Understand that this is annoying
Cannot do nothing connected to this
Is very hard to write in English with the structure of the language of the Romanian, but want will try
Want to say "is doing action the".
Frumosul băiat merge mâine la magazinul ăla
Beautiful-the boy goes tomorrow at store-the that
Romania is way ahead of most of you, we have been boycotting this entire millenium
Hell yes
FIFA is a corrupted institution, Qatar is way worst
No team should go there
Let them organise a championship without any big teams, and even without the last edition champions
Yeah, a bitter joke
I think the bribes are very much an important part of the situation, cause it just shows how countries that don't deserve to host such an important event end up hosting it
Without the bribes there will be no WC in Qatar, and 6k people would be alive now
There was also this news that 15 out of the 16 people that had a vote when Qatar was elected as hosting country are now in jail or facing corruption charges
That is worrisome, to put it mildly
If I remember correctly, countries like Australia, Japan and South Korea were bidding to host WC 2022
Any of them would have made more sense, although I would have inclined towards Australia, since the other 2 hosted a WC 20 years ago
Do you think the EU should remove visa free access for US citizens until their country complies with EU law
Currently the citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland and Romania do not have visa free access to the US
These 4 countries have a total population of approximately 69
3 million, about 13
5% of the EU population, or 15
5% after Brexit
This means that approximately 1 out of 7 EU citizens do not have visa free access to the US, while every US citizen has visa free access to the EU
This is against EU law, [regulation No 1289/2013] and [regulation No 539/2001] which basically say that if a country has visa free access to the EU, then it should also give visa free access to all EU countries, otherwise EU members are required to react in common until the situation is remedied
The situation is not new, the US has failed to comply with this for 15 years now, and I think it is time for the EU to respond
You still might think that this isn't an important issue, but it actually is, by letting the US get away with differential treatment for it's member states, the EU undermines itself and it's members
Just recently the Romanian president visited the US president and among other things they talked about the visa problem Romania has with the US, two years ago during another visit they talked about the same issue and since then there has been no progress
By treating EU members differently, the US can essentially "bribe" these countries with things that it offers to some members and not to others, for example visa free access, and thus they can get easier concessions in negotiations, or maybe allow US firms to win government contracts where otherwise they wouldn't have
I think it is a big issue and it's time for the EU to address it
Sorry if this is breaking any rules, but I made this post on the /r/europe subreddit, and someone suggested I should also post it here
This is an important issue in my opinion and I am curious what do you think about it
You would be surprised but Romania and Poland are actually very close to the Nato agreed %. And that didn't help the negotiations or anything
You know why
Because It hAs NoTHInG tO dO WItH It
I frequently travel to USA
I have a 10year visa, it took maybe 3 days to get
Had no issues going in and out
Do I want more rights
- yes
Do I feel 2nd rate Eu citizen because of that visa
- no
Should USA stand by it's EU agreement and lift all visa requirements
- yes
Should EU revoke USA access
- no
Just make it uncomfortable at the airport, with some extra unnecessary checks like cash check, hotel arrangements details etc
See how you like standing for 2hrs in line
Yeah I agree
I 100% agree with you
Well
isn't Netherland the only country against Romania joining the Schengen
wait
yes they are
Same here but my nephew really wants to visit NY
It's one of his dreams and it's hard to explain to a kid why it's so complicated to have a simple  family trip there
I have two other friends applying for travel visas and it's been a nightmare doing all that paperwork and going through the whole process for a god damn week of visiting
In Romania an US soldier killed a person (a somewhat band-member of pretty popular band) and guess what
Got away with it
Then again I recently saw a documentary on netflix about the honey industry in the US, and they were felling hopeless that they can't extradite a german who was convicted in the US
I was starting to think I am the only one noticing that the world has a huge lack of functioning brains in key positions
I can only imagine thousands of Florida men invading the streets of Europe wearing those flowerish shirts and long white socks with sandals
brr
I heard something about Rotterdam being the biggest marine hub for EU imports/exports and Netherland feeling threaten by Constanta port at the Black Sea
But tbh I don't see how Constanta could ever equal Rotterdam
Romania has no infrastructure for it and this development could take a very long time
From my understanding a route from Asia and Middle East via Black Sea would save a lot of money but it is also more dangerous considering the recent events in the region- so I don't think this concern is fully justified
But who knows
It's not stupid
It's economy and they are protecting theirs
The only way to change something is by having the big transport companies putting pressure on Netherland in order to save money
But who owns the biggest transport companies
Mostly nordic countries and German companies
It's like House of Cards and we are on the losing side
The sad truth is that they are asking the wrong questions
The question is not *"What do we lose"* but rather *"how can we all benefit from it"*. Europeans still have to work on this issue and I hope they will temper their egos and start working together for the benefit of everyone :)
Yes
and I think we can all agree that EU had/has some rough times
But for me it seems like a maturity transformation and if our leaders can find a way to collaborate we will all benefit
If not, we will return to nationalism and fighting for individual survival
So that is why we don't force things with US visas or Schengen or stuff like that
We know it takes time and we are doing it baby-steps so that everyone is ready for the next level of diplomacy relations
"Winter's not like summer", Traian Băsescu, then minister of transport
Oh boy Viorica Dancila wins here
- She mentioned that she used to tutor math
When a reporter asked her what is the area of a circle she confidentely said r^2
- "This misinformation is simply a lie"
- She said 2020 as twenty-twenty
It doesn't work in Romanian and it sounds stupid af
- She pronounced Boeing as "Boing". Three times
- " We can say that we will reduce democracy
uhh
bureaucracy"
- "People who misinform the EU are autists"
- "Of course we are not trying to intervene with the problems of other member states(EU members) such as Iran and Pakistan"
There are many more but they are pretty hard to explain in english (mostly grammar mistakes)
*Is in the capital of Montenegro , Podgorica*
Former Prime Minister (Viorica Dăncilă) : "It is an honour for me to be in Pristina"
And Mircea Geoană taught that he would become President , he was that confident to say : "Dear Romanians we won !" , Traian Basescu got elected instead
I think I mentioned it before
Bucharest's mayor, Gabriela Firea, had a CT done and and she found out there's a metallic wire in her colon
Well, she decided it was a good idea to put those images on her facebook and accuse the opposition (mainly the president and his party) of "inserting a metallic wire up her colon".
Now to make it worse, she has a family
I don't wanna know what her kids will think of her when they grow up and read that post
everything Viorica Dăncilă has ever said is stupid
The socialists literally voted over night to offer independence to some 3 counties that proclaim themselves hungarian
Worst move ever
Our president foamed over TV the next day haha
President of Romania literally said a week ago that an important political party in Romania is giving the west and central part of the country for free to another country, Hungary, just like that
(Ofc he was lying)
I mean
he's not wrong
Mentioning Băsescu, but not our former prime-minister, Viorica Dăncilă. What is this travesty
Ah man
I laughed so hard
Btw, in Romanian whale is 'balena'.
> It could be understandable, since in hungarian, bálna means whale, but what even is whale breeding
Hungary is landlocked
yet it still was ran by a fleet admiral long ago
This is in 'too stupid to be real' category
how do people like this end up running something like gazprom
She's basically stupider than a brick and she has scripted speeches because again, she's stupider than a brick
And slower than one, too
May whatever controls our lives have mercy on Romania
Please
And yet my dad has the balls to say that Iohannis is somehow dumber than her because he speaks slower
I mean, I understand that he is a hardcore PSD-ist and considers Antena 3 the voice of God, but come on
[She can't even speak English , leave alone Romanian]
Viorica Dăncilă would like to speak with him , I am sure that they can be friends :D
It's really hard to pick just one thing
iirc he's an ex teacher and he speaks exactly like teachers when they have to dictate in a way so even the slow kids finish writing
just take a random quote from her and it should be fine
Closing the churches
Romania is running out of our favorite drink, Mona (it is actually medical alcohol but people drink it because we are a superior civilization)
Somehow this is the most French thing I have ever read
Nah, tbh i never forget Iceland
Its the maps that forget them
Nope, it is actually a big thing in Romania to dream to visit Iceland
No, I never forget it's there
It's a gorgeous country and I always wanted to visit it, so it's on my mind a lot
I forget Iceland exists way too often, its just not involved in anything significant
Yes please give us any trains that go faster than 50 km/h
I would
But I'd want it to pass through Bucharest
Just today I saw an article about a hyperloop future map of the EU
Appareny the EC is starting to look into it
Such an initiative is impossible since it would have to pass through Romania
For some reason infrastructure projects can't fucking manage to ever be completed in Romania :(.
I do
But I am very curios that if it passes through Romania it wont be a high speed rail
only a slow speed rail:)) CFR pls
Man 50km/h is good speed
Try 20km/h with a 30 min stop every other hour
And I thought we were the only ones 'discussing' about the connection with the airport
To be fair thought we might finish the line after decades of talks in Bucharest because of the UEFA European Championship
They have my blessing then
This is honestly something SF
It's painful that we are able to build it, have the money, have the manpower but our CFR (public rails company) somehow only manages to not do shit
Whenever you see an r/askeurope post, do you skip through the comments to find your own country or browse through it normally
I usually skip to Romanian comments to find things i relate to but if im really interested i just browse normally
No bias whatsoever
Best/Tot/New are my only criteria for browsing
But once I do lock on a thread, I check to see what country replies to what country
Since not all questions have Romanian answers I do browse for my country
I do tend to skip to romanian comments
Same here
Maybe it’s a Romanian thing
Well hello there
I love hungarians replying to us Romanians and vice versa
Same but with Romanian flairs
Not quite as common here as in Western Europe since we have a lot of poor people in small villages, but most people only knows about Africa from those documentaries where they show tribes of savages with no water or food and houses made of grass
People are always surprised when I told them there are cities in Africa and internet
I was surprised once to see a UNICEF poster with a dark skinned girl that was Indian and not African
That's how the situation is
there is no such thing in Romania
I am not surprised to hear there are this kind of ads in the western parts of europe, we don't have enough money to support our selves so no one is going to donate to an outside organisation when there are so many that need help inside the country
No love for Eastern Europe
Murmur has the same meaning in romanian
I find it beautiful and calm but only in romanian, the english version sounds like someone is getting bored by saying the word
Why would the first "mur" sound different than the second one
Oh boy when I first started reading Harry Potter, I didn't have any way to watch the movies, so I read the names the way it seemed logical to read them
I thought Hermione was pronounced "Hare-me-ohn" and read Seamus the same way you did haha
I completely forgot about that
The 4th book came out after I started watching the movies but it must've been helpful to people who hadn't
Gods I wish I could experience the books again for the first time
They need to come quick with that selective memory erasal
Damn how did you go around not seeing the movies but having read the books
It's pronounced her-my-oh-nee
I remember this word from the Harry Potter books which take place in the 90s.
Never got one but we used to get a catalogue from a local furniture store at my old house
As kids we would look through and pick pages we liked most and dream about having our rooms like that
Unknown to us mom had ripped one of those pages for safekeeping and after we moved she ordered that furniture set for my sister's and mine bedroom
Sadly they neither had the neat blue color that was in the catalogue or the sea creatures themed handles anymore (it had been years between that catalogue being issued and us moving) but it still was very neat to see it in life
We still have it to this day
Yeah, I received it once or twice
I always liked looking through them, but I understand completely why they decided this
It’s 27 degrees here and it’s almost November, this is not normal
Fu*k supermarkets
My problem is that it's the third year my pickles are ruined because of the warm weather
I like my salted pickles but they can't get ready if the weather keeps being warm and I don't own a dark basement to keep them cold :((
Romania used to have sooo many snow in Winter and now you wake up with +5 Degrees
On the other hand Romania has been having pretty harsh winters recently
I feel that western europe has been spared the climate change of the 90s and 00s when eastern europe started having heatwaves and no-snow winters
I mean the climate change is horrible but I can’t complain about 24 degrees here
Minus wouldn't be normal either
That makes a good line to get more people involved in the climate strike movement
Still better than Kelvin
Generally Germans are seen here in a positive light
They have the reputation of being hard working and honest people
That said, there are still a few people who hate Germany do to conspiracy theories
To sum it up shortly: we elected a German ehtnic president in 2014 who used a campaign focused on German values
He also won a second turn in 2019
It's sort of a mixed bag here
Our president has German origins (is from a German speaking minority in Romania) and the anti-German sentiment became very evident when he was was running for the presidency
It's still there, people saying he's not "one of us", that he is not working for the welfare of the country, but for the western interests, because GERMANS
Plenty of nazi comments as well, cause Germans are of course all nazis
He's not a very good president, but definitely not because of his ancestry lol
Then there's the universal idea that "German made" is good quality
And the general stereotypes of Germans being strict and well organised, German products are good because they make things better there, etc
>Also some Slavic friends of mine, arguing that Germans are oppressive and expansive by nature and very rude, unfriendly and humor-less
Germans are literally one of the nicest people I've met, I was actually surprised by how polite and friendly everyone was as opposed to many people from my country lol
Generally no
Germans are viewed in a positive light in the current generation, and it's the same case for the older one who lived through WW2
My grandmother is from a village, next to which there was a large German garrison in WW2
The locals were treated well and traded with the Germans while they were stationed there
I know this wasn't the case in other countries, but here they mostly kept to themselves and didn't bother the locals
In contrast when the Russians came my great grandfather upon hearing what was going on in other places, took his family into the mountains and stayed there until 1946 out of fear
So they had a far better opinion of Germans when contrasting it to the Russians
Lesser evil
I haven't heard of anything like that in Romania
I'm not really sure it was ever a thing, maybe just around the war time
But comunism got us an people had poverty to make them forget the wars
After the comunism fell, school change
I learned german in high school and I got to know a lot of people interested in german culture
People in romania are chill about west European people
Many of the old people I know don't even seem to know that there are differences between western countries, they just know they are all more evolved than Romania and that is it
(I said I learned the language, but I forgot almost everything
No offense, but that language is so complicated I got to hate it a bit
But I'm not sure you can count this as anti german sentiment
The general sentiment here (among people who are aware of other countries of course, cuz most live in their own little bubble and couldn't tell you the capital of Belgium if their life depended on it) seems to be that the Germans have "gone soft".
That the current leadership of germany is too left leaning
I've heard "They should invest more in ther military"
"They should take a more agressive stance against Russia" and things like that
Not a lot really about WW2 Germany
With the people that I did talk about that period, most say "oh yes they were great civilised people" .
"If they wanted a chicken from you they'd buy it, when the Russians came they just took everything"
These people however don't seem to realise the fact that the reason why that might seem as such to us is because The Germans were our allies in the war and the Russians crossed our border in 1944 after 3 years of war in which we killed millions and millions of their people
TLDR: Most people don't know anyhhing about Geo Politics or History, many of the ones that do think Germany has gone too soft
About WW2, people live under the false impression that the germans were civilised and the Russians were savages because they can't make the difference between allied and enemy troops marching trough your land
Many view Germans not as bad as Russians
Let's not forget that our president is of German ethnicity and he won the last elections with 66% (in the 2nd round)
And If I recall correctly, even the crazy rhetoric wasn't about him being specifically German, but that he "is selling our country to the foreigners".
Not exactly
It's mainly about how everyone either leaves for germany or simply work there and come back home with money
Well, I talked with some romanians from Germany who said that all peope from the Balkans work very much in your country comparative with a muslim and the fact that you use them as cheap  manpower but after that they are smth like "Do you like my BMW
I bought from Germany" , ,,Did you see my house
I build it with the money that I worked in Germany" and things like that
:))
If you're refering to the recent Covid 19 cases and the hell that followed (including reports of working conditions) then yes, we had some news article and discussions about this in the past month and a half or so
Until now it was pretty much about explotation from italians (not all, just mostly in the south) and different incidences
Now Germany entered the discourse
The truth is that most of the exploitation is done through other romanians (of course with the german/italian/british counterpart agreeing) and are towards people coming from very poor place and often uneducated (enough)
It's basically trapping people that feel don't have any other chance
This should be a broader discussion but it's unfortunately overshadowed or quickly forgotten
There is little we can do in Romania against this if the "host" country doesn't do nothing (number one reason why after these many years we still have exploitation in Italy) and in this regards I think Germany recently started discussing on modifying some of it's laws (according to what I've read in our media)
He is ok
Some may say that he is pretty lazy for its german heritage but he's the best option so far
Yes and no
Our president was more then once compared to Hitler, of course
And some people literally believed we're going to be gassed if we elect him
And for fuck sakes he's even a sucky orator so the comparison is mute from the start
On the other hand if modern Germany would want to invade today's Romania a lot of us would probably be very happy to learn german
Just don't give nothing to Hungary
Same in Hungary
:))
Even though our health system is pretty shitty and underfunded (some state hospitals are in a really bad state) we do have universal healthcare
At least I know that if I have an emergency, I won't have to declare bankruptcy
And I did need it to go to ER in the past few years and all I had to pay was for some of my medication
Also, a lot of medication can be compensated, this means you won't have to pay hundreds of euro for a dose of insulin
Y'all need universal healthcare, my dude
Good or bad, it can be a lifesaver, literally
My country is not as economically developed as most western european countries are
That being said, the hospitals are pretty ok I'd say
The big ones I mean
Sure the American ones are better, but when I cracked the skin of my head open and had some really bad deep scratches on a lot of my body, they drove me 10km with the ambulance, I stayed internated for a night, they use anestysia on me twice and gave me a lot of antibiotics and I went for checkups for like a month
Costed me 0$ .
The treatment I recievied is comparable to what I'd get anywhere in the western world
My brother had a very serious car accident like 6 months ago involving one death, and they had to remove his spleen and he had some cracked ribs too
They kept him internated for more than a month
When shit got tough, they sent him to the capital
The total cost was some 2000€ and that was all brides
Corruption and what not
Still a lot less than what'd cost in the US
And that's costs that you wouldn't meet in say France
Overall I'd take my country's healthcare over the US's any day
The French or German healtcare systems are flying spaceships compared to both tho
Even Romania has free healthcare even tho its not great but its still there
Personally I use a Water Filter Pitcher but I think most people drink tap water here as well
I don't trust tap water because afaik it contains a high quantity of chlorine
Yes, it is
Even in Bucharest, which have a reputation of water being polluted, I never had any issue with it
I don't trust tap water, and I prefer carbonated anyway
Even if I drink still chances are higher it'd be from a well than the tap; not a fan of the idea
Don't drink tap water in Bucharest
In the rest of the country it's fine
But in my family at least, you never give guests tap water
It's somehow not polite
You have to buy bottled water for the guests
The water is good,but once you start using bottled water for an extended period of time,let's say more than 4 weeks,your throat will try to do anything it can to stop you from drinking the tap water,your body will literally refuse to take a sip
You can actually try this it takes less than a week to get back to being able to drink tap water
Yeah uncommon here, the tap water is safe, but we don't trust it
Same my brother
Although chlorine is perfectly safe to drink considering that the quantity that is in the tap water is really low
The taste might not be very favorable though
Really
What part of the country
Places where I lived (Moldova and in Bucharest) the vast majority of people would either use some kind of filter (either a Brita or something built into their kitchen sink), or would buy those 5L bottles from the store
I've been drinking Bucharest tap water and I'm still around though, so it's probably fine
Same here
I used to drink bottled water but switched to a Brita to reduce plastic consumption
The water tastes fine straight from the tap but if you let it sit for a while it gets kinda nasty
In Bucharest, we bought a water cooler like those you found in an office and would order 19L bottles for it
We recently switched to a classic water filter and drinking tap water
Tastes the same and it’s probably cheaper in the long run
I've got one better, the kitchen tap tastes yucky
The main bathroom tap though, tastes like fresh spring water, and it's always colder that whatever "cold" water the kitchen gets, so we drink that one
But we do have bottled water too, for pets that can't have tap water
And of course, lots of sparkling water
Only saw them in teleshopping, nobody actually buy them here
What do you mean with really ? You don't think those who buy bottled water or use a filtration system are in minority ? Even you said that you're drinking tap
I'm from AG :-)
Same brothers
Yeah I think they are the majority at least in the places I mentioned
I'm not a representative sample :) I've lived abroad and that's how it occurred to me that i can drink tap water
Pretty often
I feel bad because I have to be corrected by the person I'm talking to
Romanian and English are pretty similar in some aspects because they both originate from Latin and use the Latin alphabet
For example I was talking to someone and I said "introvert" just like I would say it in English, but I got corrected with "introvertit" being the right word
So yes, sometimes I mess up similar words
When I need to debate or to talk about something
For some reason it’s almost always easier to say that stuff in English
That goes for more eloquent language as well
Very often I can use fancier language when speaking in English than I can in Romanian
Everyday, multiple times a day
Most of the media I interact with is in English and most of our uni curriculum too
Oh yeah, and its extremely frustrating when you know the person you're talking to doesnt know english well enough to know that word
having learned both English and French and speaking them on a daily basis makes all my explanations to other Romanian folks trilingual
>how to ask for more pillows in a hotel
_You sir make it sound like a matter of national security
Yeah, it has some latin influences but definitely not a romance language
Not giving the old people your seat in the bus/tram
Never ever bring someone an even number of flowers (it is reserved for the dead)
Don't ever, ever say anything bad about someone's mother
Not even if it's true or if you think it's a joke
You can make fun of people's weight, religion, politics, anything you want, worst case scenario the joke won't be funny
But say anything even remotely bad about someone's mother and things will go from "hahaha" to "wtf did you just say to me" in one second
Our capital is **Bucharest** not **Budapest**, and we aren’t Slavs nor Gypsies
You sound English, are you English
In Bucharest old ladies rushing in the tram to grab a seat is like an olympic sport
I got violently pushed aside so many times by frail old ladies in tram 41
I can't tell if they had ptsd from younger people not giving up their seats, or if we, younger people, have ptsd from them running for the seat
It’s funny how this happens all the time in 41 considering you can wait 30 seconds for the next one if that one is too full
It must be the most frequent tram in Bucharest but the old ladies never disappoints
Some people really feel entitled to their seat
The maddest one I've witnessed is an old man on crutches got on the full bus, happened to stand near some lady who was sitting, she then shouts at a young girl on the other side of the crowded moving bus to get up so that the old man can go take her seat
Ngl line 41 should already be a meme or a reference to România at how infamous it is
Most of the older people only have the good memories from the communist era and they would tell you they've lived better in those times
Communism is a sensitive topic, so you have to be careful when you are talking about it with older people
My grandpa is 80, and he could tell you at least 10 reasons why he thinks it was better in the communism than right now
A very Big NO NO
By any chance, were you in germany last summer
I generally agree, I for once can’t sit on a sit if there are other people in the bus, but some of them are very rude so if it wasn’t for my annoying empathy, I wouldn’t let those
I got in a bus once when it was empty and took a seat
It got full eventually, but I still had my window seat, looking out the window
I heard some ramblings and curses to my right but ignored it, as none of those were addressing me
All of a sudden this 40 year old who was standing grabs me by the jacket and starts yelling at me, at that time a 15 year old, that she's pregnant and I don't get up, how dare I and who raised me so badly
Who's she
And how can I sense there's a pregnant lady hidden among the standing passengers in the bus if I had my head turned looking out the window and no one says anything to me
Luckily for the pregnant lady, I was nearing my stop so she could sit down
But communication goes a long way
it's much easier to ask for a seat, than expect something and getting angrier with each passing second
Yes, funerals, if you bring flowers to the cemetery, or to monuments or statues of dead people
It goes so far that wreaths also must have an even number of flowers in them
Half of Europe apparently
You should see how funny it is when women receive flowers from multiple people and have to make sure they distribute them so that they don't put an even number in a vase :)
Yeah it gets real game of thrones around rush-hour on line 41
Most of them did struggle in those times
Especially in the '80 when Ceaușescu decided to pay upfront all the country debt by all means
So food ratios started to get smaller, it was hard to get any food from the stores
People would have money but couldn't spend it on anything because there was no products in the stores
They were not able to build homes either because Ceaușescu wanted people to live in blocks
People that were around 30 years in the '80 despite communism
Older ones still praise it
Yes
They were right next to me on a plane to romania
It was really wholesome to see him practicing romanian
Damn roads, we have the fewest kms of roads in Europe
We are the country with the most population not being able to afford a vacation
Well we Romanians have quite the selection to choose from
I dont reallt have a source on this but I suspect we are the country thqt comes last in most statistics in the EU
Hey i live in Bacău
Can't remember the news report, I think it was per area
Vacation not vaccination
Condoleantele mele
And happy cake day
You can edit the flair and delete the flag
Wait why
It looks fine to me
Mulțumesc fratemiu
Well I didn't expect you to point it out :D
Oh okay
Awkward no, aggressive yes
There's a specific set of people, the "passionate for history" kind, that are also a bit of elitists/insecure that just need to teach everyone the "correct" history of the world
I was in an international school for about 2 months once and there were people from all over Europe and a couple of places in Africa and Asia
All of us were ignorant about stuff about the other countries
We had so many dumb conversations that ended up with some of us being less ignorant at the end
There were some people there that felt the need to teach everyone about their own history and culture
A guy corrected me on several stuff about Romania's history
He also kept trying to get into arguments with all the western Europeans
It's not like he knew more than anyone else or that he had better information or some shit
He just really wanted to proven that he knew shit we didn't or that we were brain washed
This dude was also white trash that almost punched a guy for trying to change the conversation
In that school I learned that you should just avoid the people that try to direct every conversation to some historical shit cuz it might be really annoying to deal with it
Stress
These are countries with high amounts of hours of work per day I believe
they got more peasants
those people live healthy at old age
I think the major factor is the laid-back attitude
I've been to Spain a couple of times and people are not stressed, they smile, they are welcoming and are just simply chill
As opposed here, everyone is grumpy, has a lot of problems which are treated with way more anxiety than in other countries and simply are not that happy
I traveled a bit around Europe, but Spain is the only place I'd see myself move in Europe because of that exact feeling of relaxation
L.E. Diet, healthcare and general public service quality play a major role of course, but the mentality is what struck me the most, at least a my age where I don't have health issues and I can afford good private healthcare
oh, sorry, must have gotten them mixed up
I will move to Estonia for the sole purpose of speeding, and then spending an hour annoying the police as much as I can while still abiding by the law
“Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Cry, study en masse and bringing little portraits of jesus christ so we can pray for jesus to help us pass this exam, or beg forgiveness for our sins
We dont have any tradition of doing this but 3 years ago, when I finished my middle school (last year of hs now) I remember me and my colleagues put all the desks as a border in the middle of the class and played something that I think is called Labtennis in english (basically tennis with your feet and a football) and then we put all the tables back, unscrewed all the light bulbs
Every student got on a table and we were throwing them to each other until each one broke
The only example I can think of is Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders
There are a couple of scenes where he speaks Romanian and it's not that great, but I can understand what he's saying
Do you have any examples
I cant remeber a film where foreigners spoke Romanian
Genuinely curious
Agents of shield is super cringe, vampire films, vampire series (van helsing is awful, and they make that vampire speak multiple times in Romanian
Oh no
I totally forgot about the existance of vampire films set in Romania
But thanks for the info
I will now proceed to forget these exist
Good day
Haha
I find this very awkward but i still do it anyway
Glad to see it's not only happening here in Romania
Also, when i was a kid and stayed in my grandparents small village for a month or two people i would always say hello to passing people ( that's what my grandma said to me )
if the person i said hello too did not recognize me they would always ask me who am i or who my parents are
( al cui ești ?! - who do you belong too
in a very basic translation ) Fun memories
Reading the question, I thought it was a Romanian asking because this is the habit everyone here has
We say hello to random people only on the mountain
And in villages
If its someone who works on the mountain like a shepers or something then yes but if its another climber its not traditional
You know a country is big on hiking when they have a long set of rules about how to say hello on the mountain
For me in the country side we say hello but not on trails
We never do atleast and only greet back if greeted
I've heard that if two strangers meet on a mountain trail in Netherlands they have to fight until only one lives
Handshaking the guys everytime you see them, which in Romania is normal, in the Netherlands no, and here you also have to hand shake women too
Kids riding the pig after you killed it for Christmas
WTF indeed
We had this before 1989 on VCR, when almost all available* movies were dubbed by the same lady
*read 'smuggled'
Nah, is common in many European countries
Never had it but it's not considered outlandish here
We call that "șpriț".
He can't answer, probably had an aneurysm
Not really
It seems most of our ancestors marriages were between relatives, distant or not
I will try to respond kind to this stupid question
No, we hug them, women in Romania thinks is very disrespectful to shake their hands except when you meet them for the first time
That doesn't mean you should make extreme assumptions just because a culture is different
Haha, for me is uncomfortable to handshake everyone
I think you just get used to
Crăciun Fericit
Crăciun Fericit
Crăciun Fericit flăcăi!
Well i wish you a merry and a happy
I personally like this, altough I'm not sure it fits what you asked:
"Să te ia Hanul tătar
" is an old saying meaning "The Tartar Khan shall take you" and is mostly used by old people to curse people that annoy them or they don't like
We have the same in Romanian
We have the exact same expression in Romanian, with the same meaning („a șters-o englezește“)
Every time Charles tries to speak Romanian
I appreciate the effort but
I dont understand anything
Yes in romania we have a guy "iwant2c:(I think) and his melody called "catena"... fidnt understand anything(almost) from it
We've got these "trappers". They just mumble completely random words (usually types of drugs and derogatory names of women) and try to make it sound like it rhymes
And people actually listen to them
A lot
Some of them got to make a song with bbno$ where he was singing the hook in English and the guys were trapping in Romanian
I swear we didn't understand anything more than the foreign listeners
I know very very little about Hungarian, except for a few letter pronounciations, but I believe in The Usual Suspects the Hungarian was genuine, no
Only video of the [full scene] I could find
Farty five sheep
I just looked up a [video] kinda sounds like Portuguese hahah
Seems like they just straight up handed him a written speech without explaining diacritics or ce/ci/ghe/ghi
But honestly the Italian scene from Inglourious Basterds is my favourite scene from a movie, ever
Bawnjawrno
Well, you can tell he hasn’t been practicing a lot, but I could understand him, so I don’t think it’s *that* bad
In Romania they say that if you don’t study well, you will end up working at Macdonalds
What do they say in your country
ik I'm also from romania
but I've been told that I'll scrub toilets if i don't study well
In Romania they also say that you will become a builder that works hard
In Romania they also say that u will live in a fucking garbage bin if u don't memorize the entire history of Romania
Traiesc de aproape 17 ani in Romania insa nu am auzit asta niciodata
That's what my family was doing while I was a kid (though with cabbage and tomatoes), and they are probably still doing that
It's real and honest work
And standing on your knees, in the field, with the burning noon sun above you, collecting beans, really shapes you up as a kid
Hated it then, but oh man did it teach me how to work
One of friends wanted to become a garbageman because he liked being one in SAMP
Offtopic: Do British people say "arsehole" instead of "asshole"? That's the first time I notice it
It's a 20th century trend, go to a good Uni, get a good job, work there 20+ years, and then retire
People think that this is a magic formula but 21st century showed that it is a shitty strategy
Hard for some people to understand that Transylvania is a real place
This doesn't actually qualify since it happened to a friend, she lived abroad for 2 years I belive and she was once asked if there is electricity in Romania
That Transylvania exists
As a Romanian, when i say to italians that i was born in Transylvania, they ask me : "can i see Dracula
" It is a joke indeed, but EVERY person i met told me "Oh, Dracula
" after i said that i am romanian, so yea thats sad on a side because we deserve to be recognized for many other things, but people don't know anything but Dracula
On the other side, to be positive, it means that is really is a know story
Another question is :"Are you guys so poor
Now
I should stay here for 2 hours at least, but i can say that as EVERY other country, we have rich, benestant regions and cities like Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, Timişoara, Braşov, Galaţi, Craiova, Constanţa, Brăila, ecc
,  where life is quite good, of course if you are wanting to work and to study, we are still developing
And faster than other developing countries
Our population may be getting lower and lower, but it's good, because those 19 millions who fight for a better Romania are doing their best, the fault is on the politicians and on those who vote them
And those 4 million abroad are struggling to get back to Romania, or to help their relatives who are there
Now, we also lack on infrastructure, on roads, on healtcare, but its because our corruption is as high as Italy's, maybe even higher, and of course there are poor regions
And thats normal
Romania is indeed half-broke, but the important is that its people are wanting to change
Slowly, but still changing
So, two things: we are not as poor as people say we are, and we helped humanity with many other things than inspiring an Irish dude to take Vlad Ţepeş and make a legend about him as a vampire
A romanian invented the engine for airplanes, another one invented the pen, you would still take notes witch pencils if it wasn't for him, and many other things
Bye
That our language is not russian
I had to defend the Netherlands on this one occasion lol
I just came back from a cultural exchange from the Netherlands and it was amazing
In the geography class back in the Romania, the teacher said that the dutchies don't speak dutch, but flemish
I ended up arguing with that stupid man on the fact that you may find flemish speaking people in the Netherlands, but dutch people will speak dutch
Then he said something among the lines that dutch is actually flemish or something like that
One time a guy from US asked me if the Pizza comes from Romania
“For the hundredth time, Romanians are **Latin
** We have ‘ROMAN’ in the name
This pales in comparison to the time somebody asked my mother if they have chocolate in Romania
When I was in eight grade a group in my class went in a school trip in France (some francophone program)
They were asked almost the same questions
:))
Too soon
Yeah I tend to say Transylvania when asked where I'm from because they don't automatically make the connection to Romania and assume I'm a gypsy
It's easier to explain that Transylvania is a real place than talking about gypsy statistics
Tieni un F in segno di rispetto per non aver dato uno schiaffo a quelle americane
È per via del fatto che siete conosciuti per i gesti che fate con le mani, e anche per i molti dialetti
Non è una brutta cosa, però c'è chi la prende troppo sul serio
It's because you are known for your hand-gestures, and for dialects too
It's not a bad thing, but there's who take it too seriously
Salutes from Romania
What is electici tea
Never heard of
Yeah my father had to explain that he understands what a fridge is
Wild
You guys have electricity
•-•
Are you from Turkey
It's because people can't understand why both communism and fascism are/were a lot alike in some areas while being totally different in others
Finally, you guys have potatoes
Even though Romania is higher than latvia at potato production apparently
Just jump over it lol GG ez
Some guys in Romania used it to get back at some French comedians for a "Romanian beggers" joke once
Stop throwing that type of shade
We are getting there :)
Well, lets say that the impaling thing was true, as Vlad used to impale ottomans to scare them, and that the castle is a real thing, but without the Irish guy it couldn't have been known, and without the things i said first, the Irish guy couldn't get the inspiration for Dracula
I would like that both our countries could be more appreciated, and not anyone claiming anything
Lets say it was an unwanted cooperation :P
In all fairness this was in early 2000 and most likely Romania only got in the news with it's extreme poverty after the fall of communism (and during communism) and two or three digits inflation at that time
But it's exactly the same principle
People take for granted what they see TV for 5 minutes in a 2 minutes commentary, a movie or a tv-show
Then they assume that poorer means they live in some sort of a remote african village where plumbing, cars, tv's have no use
Unfortunately this ignorance is a human trait
Just for example
I'm pretty sure that quite a few romanians (and this could very well be extentended to all europeans) think Mexico is just a bit more modern "wild west" and South Africa is a safari with starving children
And I'm saying this because I've literally talked to people who truly believed this
They couldn't care either way but that's the knowledge they had on those places based on what they've seen on 'television'. It's not about bad faith but just pure ignorance
I'm pretty sure in some remote places some pupils still go by cart
Albeit now it would be more of a choice (there should be school buses for such places)
You mean there's no yee-haw going on in Texas
Nah I don't want to lose my clients, but I will with others

Honestly I had the same misconception and until I visited Berlin it wasn't cleared up
I have to wonder why schools teach this so badly
Yes, same roots
There are many similar words both in Romanian and in Italian, like:
IT         RO
Coda - Coadă (Tail)
Rosso - Roşu (Red)
Verde -Verde (Green)
Vita - Viață (Life)
Tu - Tu (You)
Noi - Noi (We)
Voi - Voi (You)
Pane - Păine (Bread)
and many others
Let's be fair
Stalin's system didn't fall right after him for someone to be able to directly assign a body count to him
Worse of, that system kind of educated half of the world the next half of the century
In my mind they are both equal murders and there's no amount of "but Hitler killed X persons" that can convince me otherwise
exactly
now americans use ‘socialist’ when they actually mean soc-dem and it’s sooo annoying
it’s very hard to discuss this topic with them because their political spectrum leans so right-wing that they genuinely can’t conceptualise the norm being a good social security net, free healthcare and education
Mado, io la pasta senza il sugo non la mangio, cioè non mi piace
Poi se è il sugo fatto in casa si abbonda, che strano ma vero, anche se mia mamma non è italiana, lo fa in un modo buonissimo
E poi in Irlanda mi sa che i piatti migliori sono a base di patate, non ci sono mai stato, però da quello che ho sentito, poi magari mi sbaglio
Ma comunque puoi andare in un ristorante italiano in ogni paese, non sarà mai buono come in Italia
Una delle fortune ad abitare qua
anti WAX
Great decision
Anti-waxers are a danger for the entire population
Yeah, I support mandatory vaccination but I don’t have a strong opinion on it
About the anti-vax, if people want to die who I’m to stop them
I want to save those that want to live (with a few exceptions)
I saw someone translate "ciorba de burta"(liquid soup) into "burt soap"
Not the worst worldwide (I've seen some terrible ones in SE Asia and in Turkey) but the funniest in Romania was the sign posted in the Bucharest Airport around 2009
Three letters added and we entered a new dimension
Tallinn, really
When I went to Tallinn there was definitely a "tourist" vibe, especially in the very core of the old town, but it seemed very gimmicky, tourist trap-y, and overall moreso oriented to families and couples and such
Riga on the other hand had a much higher stag party and drunk tourism energy to me
Not quite on Prague/Budapest level yet but it seemed of the same principle a lot more that Tallinn, imo
We cannot get out
We cannot get out
The heat has taken the hallway and Living Room
Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there bravely while the rest retreated to the cellar
We are still holding
but hope …Óin's party went five days ago but today only four returned
The temperature is the highest to the wall at the Kitchen
The heat took Óin--we cannot get out
The end comes soon
We hear drums, drums in the deep
The sun is rising
Here its surprisingly cool
Ussually in May is very hot already but right now its very cool and with good winds and a healthy amount of rain
Right now in north-east Germany is not that bad
The wind is still cool
I'm also very skinny (~ 110 lbs) which apparently makes me feel colder
So I don't open the windows to go to bed yet
30C ..normal summer for us,we are used to it  .Hope it doesn't go higher tho
No,it's too hot
The mornings are likr 19-20°C and the afternoons are hotter it's so hot
I don't have AC so when I'm outside, it feels like my shoes are melting

The orthodox way
One of the first rhymes we sing to our kids is about stealing and getting caught
Older people say about young people that they are "born with phones in their hands", it's usually them just being annoyed with how much we rely on technology, I think
A tendency to begin a revolution and corrupt politicians :D
F yeah !
You forgot the best one, Romansh speaking swiss
also I guess it depends on what region they come from
I would be temped to say that every city here has at least a sector that would make it a good candidate
I mean we have a humongous abandoned and unfinished building in the middle of the capital
It is there since the '89 revolution
It was supposed to be the mausoleum of the comunist doctator, but they shot him and they didn't know what to do with the huge ugly building
So it just sat there for the last 30 years, and there are no plans to do anything about it
Idk
In Romania there are memes about Vaslui for being the poorest city
These are the ugliest cities based on memes:
1 Vaslui
2 Braila
3 Bacau
4 Galati
5 Tulcea
Again,idk why these are,but I based on what me father said 'bout Vaslui,I agree with it
On the contrary,the most beautiful cities are those that were once under Hungarian jurisdiction
In Romania, we have Vaslui
The ppl in Vaslui have a bad reputation of uneducated, usually drunk ppl who only wear flip flops, even on the streets
You can see why we all make fun of it
Braila in Romania, sa moara jaxi, its ugly as hell
grey and plain
vaslui is like a chernobyl without radiations and full of latinazed gopniks
what was the name of that gipsy village filled with "colourful" palaces
It was somewhere around Alexandria
Not all commie blocks were bland and depressing
Some cities had more progressive architects and more freedom to design
Sure many are in disrepair but the architecture itself is not that bad
In Bucharest though they all had to be bland and functional
However if you pay attention in smaller towns like Turnu Severin, Constanta etc, the 'golden age' architecture is quite interesting
tzeapa frate =))))))
I think there are way uglier cities in Romania, especially small and poor Baragan stuff (Mizil, Rosiori etc)
Have you actually been to any of those cities
Old parts of Bucharest, Constanta, Horezu, Craiova, Turnu Severin, Iasi are absolutely stunning from an architectural point of view
All in the south and east
I'd say the only cities in Transylvania which are more interesting predate the austro hungarians by quite a few centuries
One exception though, Oradea, small but pretty
What's wrong with you
Vaslui is not ugly at all
My vote would go to the small towns in Jiu Valley (Petroșani, Vulcan etc
Sau Vaslui lol
Buzescu is the name of the village
There are tons of those all around Romania
Try the public transportation in Bucharest, there are tons of crazy old and homeless men in the bus
To be fair
I've never been to the US but in Europe I've seen crazy people everywhere
We got crazy people, both on the streets and on TV, but the general population doesn't give a crap about them and doesn't give them attention
They don't go viral and don't get any more air time on TV
> Why does it seem that Europe has fewer people acting crazy in public than the US
The main reason for this is the language barrier: very easy to find English-speaking Romanians
Hard as fuck to find Romanian-speaking Romanians
In other words, the dumbest of my compatriots might be on the same level as some of the US ones, or some even worse, but as long as you don't understand them, their stupidity won't propagate
This shit right here
We have the worst healthcare in the EU by any measurable means, but a system like the current American one would undoubtedly lead to an obscene level of misery, suffering and deaths
Well
now between our countries indeed I can compare
It's the poor to extremely poor blanket that goes nuts
Stress and month-by-month living for a long time and then just something happens (a dear one dies, etc); and they're going crazy
I've indeed noticed that here, also
And the good news is that it kind of fixed itself once the middle-class has grown and the poor got kind of a break; At least it's not living at the limit;
As for healthcare and social programs
I think we're on the same boat
Mental health for the poor is not a thing
It costs money
Some people are still ashamed to admit having a problem, etc
But it is getting better, slowly;
It's a long one:

The third one didn't hold up that well, did it
it's also a thing on r/Romania but I am probably too old to understand it
On r/Romania it's a thing as well
but with a frog
And new decor every week
I don't get it either
Same in Romania with the frog
Its miercuri flacaii mei
Same in Romania
Was in Istanbul with a colleague, on a small ship across the Bosphorus, when a local started talking to us in English first, then in good Romanian
Turned out he never been to Romania but he worked on the Black Sea shore at a lighthouse and listened to Romanian radio broadcast for years, so he learned Romanian by himself from the radio
That explains a lot  every holiday in Romania, when we try to find deserted, lonely places in the wild, we encounter a German and his grandkids or a German family :)) Mostly in the Danube Delta
Sometimes in the mountains
They are like part of the landscape
But it also gives me a good feeling, like "*we are not the only ones trying to find some peace of mind away from this world*"
[Workers day] is the day when Romanians go out for a barbecue and I think that's beautiful
The Moldova Region, the eastern part of the country
The poorest region, Vrancea county is the center of seismic activity, floods happen almost every year
The stereotype is that it's also the region where violent crime is also the most common, especially Vaslui county
Also, similar to your example, the [Valea Jiului] region, which was historically a mining region, but it has seen a significant reduction of mining activity after 1989 which led to severe unemployment and depopulation in the area
Although miners are not seen with sympathy in Romania because of the [mineriads]
Moldova has a history as rich and sights as beautiful as Transylvania
But because there wasn't any Irish author to write a science fiction book staged in it, it's ignored by most of the few tourists that come to Romania
Edit: I see a number of people talking about the modern day Republic of Moldova
I was also talking about the Romanian region of Moldova, wrongly called Moldavia in some English literature
The two don't just have the same name
They used to be the same country
That country never included Transnistria
In all but political sense, I still consider them the same country
Both are beautiful and deserve more tourists
If you ever decide to visit this region, I recommend Iași, Suceava Fortress, the churches and monasteries in the subregion of Bucovina (which spills over in Ukraine),Neamț fortress, Piatra Neamț, all in Romania
I sadly don't know enough about Eastern Moldova, other than what I visited as a foreign tourist: Chișinău, wineries of Cricova and Milestii Mici, Old Orhei, fortress of Soroca
There are others things to see, but I can't vouch for them
Hope this long edit clears some things, or confuses you enough to learn more about the region
Moldova, especially Vaslui
Moldova itself had zero meters of highway until some dude built one meter of highway in protest
Vaslui is the poorest region of Moldova, Romania and the whole EU
People there live in [dire misery
All the parts, we are truly a crapy country thats barely holding on from total colapse
The extreme south is way poorer
Have been to both Vaslui County and Giurgiu County and I can say Giurgiu is way worse
Oh come on
It’s not a book that sets Transylvania apart from the rest of Romania
Nor the tourism associated with it
The issues of the other two regions run way deeper than how many tourists the myth of Dracula brings in (it’s also not the only reason people come to Romania either)
If you look at the history of the regions is very clear that the influence of the Hungarians and the Habsburg Empire led to a better development of Transylvania in comparison with Moldova and Wallachia which were pretty much always busy  having to fend for themselves agains multiple enemies coming from everywhere
That meant better infrastructure for Transylvania, more urbanisation, education, you name it
Yeah, we can find dirt poor places in different parts of the country
At least the people in Giurgiu are closer to Bucharest and in theory can find a job there and commute
On paper though, the north-east region is the poorest as we all know
You better
May I suggest you guys base it on [Ioan the Brave] the Moldavian version of Dracula
It's not my business, since I am not from the Republic of Moldova, but I think Transnistria should have never been part of Moldova
Some Soviet officials drew internal borders with no consideration of history or culture
This is the root of the modern problems in Transnistria, as well as Crimea and Ukraine
I was actually talking about the Western Moldova (Romania)
If you ever consider going that way, I would encourage you to check out the northern part of it
Start in Iasi to experience a relatively modern city, then go to Suceava for the castle of Medieval Moldavian rulers, check out the churches in the surrounding region (called Bukovina)
Finally, go to Targu Neamt for the fortress, and depending on the time of year go to sky or just for a hike in Piatra Neamt
Nobody has a worse opinion about Romania than Romanians
Because there wasn't any
In case you are wondering about the Irish author who wrote a famous book staged in Transylvania, his name was Bram Stoker
He wrote a novel called "Dracula".
How is this a bad opinion of Romania
I was talking about its historical development
I think the union of 1600 when Michael the brave, lord of Wallachia united Transylvania,Moldavia and Wallachia under his rule by conquering them, sadly he was assasinated in 1601 at the order of HRE emperor i think and the union quickly fell apart
Either Michael the Brave and his union that lasted one year ,or before that when he and his army got all the way to Adrianopol , there he was supposed to receive Austrian support to take Constantinople but unfortunately the help from the Holy League never came
There's an amazing youtube history series about this now
Although it probably isn't common knowledge, I definitely heard of that
I think it's one of the more famous things in Canadian history really
Along with burning down the White House
Yeah but to armchair historians and people who follow "fun facts" accounts on Instagram it was the Canadians
It feels weird when I have some products from another store with me
Especially if I forgot to ask for the receipt at the other store
I had a small panic attack when I realized I have a candy bar from a different store in my pocket and I don't have the receipt
Is that even in big cities
I can’t imagine a herd of 50 people all thanking to the bus driver when they get off the bus
We used to drink wine out of jars
(my friends and I were poor and pretty lazy to buy proper glasses, so we used jars from jam or pickles)
And I cut cheese with a butter knife
(same reason)
\*Sips wine from a coffee mug
&#x200B;
(I did have wine glasses, am not a savage,  but all but one were shattered in an unfortunate accident and now whenever I and the gf drink wine, she uses the wine glass and I use my mug
need to stop procrastinating on buying new ones)
The UK is so weird with cycling infrastructure
Like there is the National Cycle Network and it's one of the few countries where Google Maps offers cycling directions
But on the other hand, cycle paths sometimes start and stop in the middle of nowhere (or worse, in a fence, right after a left turn, coming down a steep bridge) or the markings suddenly go missing halfway through a residential area with bendy streets
Hmm perhaps you make a valid point, but it's still lacking in that regard
The example with the cycle lane ending in a fence after a bend down a bridge is something i actually encountered a few weeks ago
Also can't count how many times I ended up cycling on what felt like pretty busy roads with fast traffic only to realise at the end that there *was* a cycle lane somewhere across a field and behind some bushes, maybe on the other side of the road for good measure - but no sign to guide you towards it
Anyway, I can't complain too much, the cycle infrastructure and drivers' awareness of cyclists back home is just none
The word "dick" (pula) can be used in 40 (probably more) ways, ranging from "what the fuck / ce in pula mea" (what in my dick) to "far away / in pula cu satelitul" (in the dick with a satellite)
I can explain them all in one post so here's a link
You forgot about our ability to speak in mostly vowels
Extreme example: Oaia aia e a ei, eu i-o iau
I am pretty sure amor is used in more intimate situations than iubire
In Romanian we call it Moon as well (*Luna*), however the Moon landing gave the word for the landing on any planet: *aselenizare*. TIL it comes from Selene
In Romania we have the same thing, its called "numeral cardinal" and "numeral ordinal".
For example:
Cardinal are numbers: unu (one), doi (two), trei (three)
Ordinal are the order of people: primul (first), al doilea (second), al treilea (third)
Also in Hungarian
Hah, same with pula (dick) in Romanian
We also have "dor" in Romanian
Funny thing is that they say it's untranslatable but I see plenty of languages have similar words
Love your explanation of modal particles
In Romanian, pain would be "durere". Also comes from Latin "dolor", so yep, related
Though Romanian "dor" seems to come from a derivative of "dolor" as well
Makes sense, since the feeling of "dor" may include pain
I feel like a lot of people don't understand the question or are you all just trolling
>Also, when I'm at work, I don't give a fuck if its already bright outside
I want daylight when I'm done working
Exactly
Personally, winter time is hell on my depression, because I'm rarely outside when the sun is out
Dragnea, one of the most corrupt politicians of our country, is in jail
During the first World Cup in 1930, King Carol II personally spoke with the footballers employers do give them a holiday for going in Uruguay and participate to the event
Mind you, back then, footballers didn't had the big salaries they have now, it was more like a hobby, so they needed to have "regular" jobs too
We have Transfăgărășan- the best road in the world
And Transalpina  the second best road in the world
(Romania)
* Never in our history have we had an expansion war
Still alive today
* Around 40BC romans were knocking at our door, however our ancestors couldn’t be bothered defend the land until their leader burned down all the grapevines plantations (damn, we were chill)
* During the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia we refused to participate (alongside Albania) and publicly criticized this
* There’s almost no racism here
L.E.:
* We had the first public illuminated towns in Europe with both gas and electricity (Bucharest, 1857 and Timisoara, 1884)
Ba mă-ta
Oh that's nice
We had to put 5 soldiers unload a whole AK magazine each at the same time on the Dictator and his wife :D
How is this wholesome
Edit: now it's better
Nah, don't try
There are a lot of corrupt politicians free
We still vote for corrupt politicians because they apparently are against those we hate
apparently
What
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever
Just because they can't put all corrupt politicians in jail he shouldn't try to to put any
Even if they put one corrupt politician in jail its still worth doing
Small progress is still progress, no matter how you paint it
Well he loved Romania and it's people
but too much if you ask
everybody
He got our national debt to 0, he urbanized the country, he got everybody a home and a job, education was real back then (today we get fed a lot of useless stuff) etc
BUT he instated food shortages for long periods of time, didn't know how to manage stuff, his wife (Elena) had a doctorate in chemistry but didn't know what CO2 was, he couldn't read well (words on his speeches were enlarged for him to be able to understand them)
He wasn't an ass he had an ass hat :D [in my opinion if the communists wouldn't have taken over we would be much better off
] :3
He edited it
The unedited comment was just about their amber production
Why did you bring them up
I really can't see why you decided to mention them
Yes, they are
But Russian speakers have a different opinion
He will be free in less than 4 years
One corrupt politician in jail and, yey, the things are moving
Im not here to argue, live your lie bro
"Food
No need for food
We can eat our friendship away
" -Ceauşescu most probably
Ibiza would be a perfect place
Bucharest, imagine driving through the infernal traffic on the main boulevard around 1 pm and crashing every time, or the impending doom of the angry granny with a Kalashnikov
Alexandria, Romania
And the protagonist should be a politician
A mix of Eastern European cities would be great, it would have everything
And the some stuff that happens in rural Romania may be straight out of GTA, so why not
Bergen, Marseille or Budapest
Nothing too big for Rock Star, but it would take like 10 years to complete since they don’t only need a big map, they need a dense map, with lots of things to do
Or you can play in Focșani as Marian Oprișan and start from stealing wallets in the train station and evolve to stealing wallets from journalists who enter the PSD headquarters
That sounds interesting but the concept it’s a bit outdated, seems more like a 2000’s approach for an open world
Pretty sure is Cyprus
I think that's where they find the Apple at the begining of AC1
Probably Bran's castle, the infameous Dracula's lair
Instead of that castle i recommend Peleș and Corvin's castles
They are way more interesting
Dracula and Dracula's Castle
Palace of Parliament, it’s just a big monstrosity in the middle of the city
Bigar Waterfall- an extremelly small,  isolated waterfall that looks good only in photos
Bran castle (also know as Dracula's Castle) in Romania is overly crowded and very boring
Castle Bran its full of little Shops with souvenirs at the entrance
I agree for La Rambla at least, but I discovered a more chill one near the hotel where I stayed, it was named Rambla de Poblenou, which was actually a nice experience, not crowded, pretty chill and few people
Castle Bran is very lovely on itself, but very overrated
They sure as hell like to milk the Dracula story
I beg to differ
Growing up, I had family who lived in Bran and that meant plenty of trips in the area
However, when I returned after many years, last summer, I discovered an experience of fairy-tale atmosphere, I learned from history that I never paid attention to before, and left with an extremely positive view of the Bran Castle
On top of that, I got to share this experience with a friend from abroad and she was even more mesmerised than me
I think it's definitely worth a trip because it does a great job of mixing facts and fairy-tales in order to 'set the record straight' while, of course, entertaining with a little Dracula trivia
I've been there and got some cool stuff from the gift shop
But the thing was, I went there a day before Halloween
I didn't really think about Halloween at all at the time, but now I wish I waited a few weeks
It was extremely crowded and everyone was talking 10 different languages at the same time
They didn't even let you take pictures
Some old lady almost fell off the staires
The next day I went to Peleş castle and the experience was 10 times better
Or maybe it was an illusion of quality since I got there from what was basically hell
Compared to other castles, Castelul Bran is much smaller imo
The market right below the hill you walk up to access the castle is equally as much as a tourist trap
Yes
There are so many more other mesmerising places
People see a part of Romania and think they saw everything
I personally prefer walks or hikes, we got the nature so why stay and only see the city
Well, issue is that we dont
manage tourism well
We dont have sites or guides for them, so people dont know unless they do separate research
A shame, really
Fuck yea
That's one of the reasons why I am getting into politics the moment I am of age
You know what they say: "be the change you want to see"!
Thanks mate
Always go for the top
Might even try to become the first female president in Romania
~~I have an uncontrollable desire to impale people and drink their blood
I emigrated to the UK if that counts as a stereotype
But then, I'm not here to steal bikes, beg on the tube or as an agricultural worker
Also don't hang out exclusively with other Romanians
Never been in a horse cart either
Just walked everywhere before coming to the UK
You got me at "I don't want to reclaim the lost lands". Hello friend
Make that 1
2 million :D Transylvania will always be a sore spot: we see it as the cradle of our nation, but you guys had it for hundreds of years
And yes, Trianon took the major cities along the border from you: Satu Mare, Oradea, Arad, Timișoara
It's complicated
Yes, in the 19th century, but most Dacian tribes had been in Transylvania
The capital, [Sarmizegetusa Regia] was there, its ruins are still there to this day
Hard to let go of the thought that entire territory would be part of another country
If you want to put it in a childish manner, "we were here before you guys" :))
I never realised that you guys actually come here to visit that often
That's awesome
Not sure I'm following your train of thought
No, I'm not a Dacian per se, there is no such thing, but the Dacians are our ancestors, along with the Romans and all the migratory tribes that settled here for a longer or shorter period of time
Are you a hun
You do know that most scholars call it Daco-Romanian, right
"It" refers to Romanian, since you were wondering about the Dacian influence on the language
But that's not the point
The point is that I'm not sure what you're trying to convey
Are you trying to say Hungarians have a better claim over Transylvania
Perhaps
Are you saying that Romanians have no claim whatsoever just because the Dacian influence isn't blatantly visible
That's a lazy take
Are you saying that the Romanians as a nation came into existence in the 19th century
Not a lie
Are you saying that Romanians as a people didn't exist before the Middle Ages
Wrong
So, what is your discourse
Because I'm not following and from where I'm standing you're just throwing counter-arguments but it's not entirely clear which of my statements you're refuting
Yes, we were here before you
Yes, Trianon wasn't 100% fair but that's what happens when you're not on the victors' side
And yes, the province you had a hand in developing and whose native population you oppressed is now part of Romania
Deal with it
Well, the language stems from Vulgar Latin + migratory influences, mostly Slavic
Over a hundred Dacian words have survived and are still being used, but this is something that Wikipedia can go into more detail than me
As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling population
But check the 1848 Revolution and you'll get your names
Check Transylvanian writers like Goga or Rebreanu
Check the 1892 Memorandum
As for my phrasing, I would have put it between inverted commas had I known it would be taken so literally
I never said "over the Principalities". I also said that you took my initial "cradle of our nation" too ad literam and I specified that I should have put it between inverted commas
Now, this exchange has become tiresome, so I will disengage from it
Have a lovely afternoon
Not a native English speaker  And I didn't mind the exchange itself but it felt like both of us were becoming slightly hostile towards the end and I don't like arguing with people, especially not on the Internet where you don't have tone of voice, inflection, mimic and other non-verbal cues
Absolutely
Any iteration of Dracula really
The accent they use is utter bullshit
Or the pronunciation of our cities, it's like they took LSD before speaking them
If you ever talk to a Romanian who grew up in the early 00s, they'll most likely reference the fact that they know Lithuania as the country where Polly, from "Kids from Room 402" is originally from
I think it's a Canadian kids cartoon, but for some reason it was picked up by Fox Kids Romania and dubbed, then it became really popular
It was on every day, at least 2-3 episodes
Anyway, the annoying character (Polly) keeps mentioning Lithuania in every single situation
"Back home in Lithuania, we used to do this". I'm pretty sure she never said a specific city or village haha
[Here's an episode] so you can get an idea
Of course, the English voice acting sounds really off to my ears, because I only heard it in the dubbed version, where her voice was intentionally made suuuper annoying, to fit the character better - [here is the same scene, dubbed]
Hell no
I had to rewind that scene 5 times before I could be sure that he was speaking Romanian and still I couldn't understand what he was saying
Haven't seen it, but if you want actual Romanian in big movies, it's either Children of Men or Borat 2
I know, weird list, right
Eurotrip was the absolute *shit* when we were in middle school
It's still a great comedy, but back then it was eeeverywhere
IIRC they don't go to Spain, but it should be relateable as a European in general :)
You're thinking of Civil War, but there was only one line: "cum sunt astea, sunt bune
" (how are these, are they good
) said to a guy selling plums
Sebastian Stan only lived here until he was like 8 iirc
I heard an interview with him speaking Romanian and it was a bit rough around the edges, which he admits to
As a side note, there was an insane synchronized *woah* in the theater crowd when the big block letters saying BUCHAREST came on screen
So you know how romanian is a latin based language
well that's WRONG
Latin was based off of romanian, actually it's not romanian, it's dacian
Yeah, that ancient civilisation that used to live in the Balkans, Dacia
As a matter of fact, the Romans were actually dacian all along
But the Roman Empire was nothing compared to the Dacian empire, that streched from today's denmark to mid africa, to today's India
In fact they/we, the dacians, built underground tunnels that connect the carpathians to the black sea and Istam- uh
I mean Constantinople
But be careful, there might be aliens hiding in them now
Zalmoxis is the only one and true god but technology has corrupted people
All of this truth is kept secret by the evil catholic church in the archives of the Vatican
Transylvania is also the true Electromagnetic centre of Earth of course
□□□□□□□□
You don't even need to go too far on the internet to find people who legit believe in this stuff, more or less crazy depending on who you ask
I believe there's also a pseudo-historian on youtube with a decent following whose whole channel is based on stuff like this
I’ve heard this EXACT theory, but with Romania instead of Hungary
I'm disappointed that I had to scroll so much down to get to our (Romanian) gem of wisdom
You forgot that the Dacians also built the pyramids, invented writing and are the ancestors of all human kind (and that Deutchland means "the land of the Dacians")
And that our national poet invented the theory of relativity but he was assassinate by the jews who stole it from him and attributed it to a dumbass named Einstein
Not only this, but Jesus was Romanian too
He was born somewhere close to Botoșani or Bacau
He couldn't have been a jew, because obviously jews are evil and he was full of love, so he was Christian (somehow)
Oh and Eminescu was the best physician that ever lived
Then the jews killed him and gave all his work to Einstein to claim as his own
Hearing Funar speak (or reading from his books) cracks me up every time
Wait, people really believe the Sirius part
I saw it in another comment earlier but I thought it was made up by the OP just to add to the craziness
It's bad if you're a hardcore nationalist and absolutely against any form of globalization
Yeah
if its only within Europe and europeans
How
You didn't knew that
Yeah yeah, but did you know that the flood in the Bible started from the Black Sea
Now I'd like to see "Star Wars: Hungary strikes back".
Everyone knows it was created by the Dacians, the Dacians are the ancestors of Romania who actually invented the Latin alphabet, the Romans stole it from us
Both
My handwriting just switches cursive to the other way mid-word/sentence with every letter
It's confusing and I don't know why I started writing like this
We write the first 'a' not sure how to make it, but we do have some people who write the second 'a'.
Transnistria and Gaugazia because we have a conflict with those 2
Even if we control that land
The Great Hungarian government in the Not so Great Romania country (yes, hungarian people in Romania have their own party) actually tried to claim 'their lands' (Ardeal) in 2020 during the pandemic when all their party members forwarded a law regarding this matter
They also want their own flag and language to be used in schools and on the street as official language in that area
stay tuned
Retaking Algeria is a basic one, but I hear the most about retaking Québec or making it its own country
And if you go to Brittany, you will never end hearing about how the French stole Nantes and how the Normandie stole the Mt Saint-Michel
That guy takes jokes way too seriously
As long as you bring pizza
Do you promise to build highways
This is the first time I hear about this
I think it answers the question of how media covers this subject
Most media agencies have 1-2 articles about either the election results (the official ones from the dictator) or about protesters getting arrested
Unfortunately not enough coverage
I've actually heard about this but it's definetly not covered enough so more people can realize what's going on
Some media trusts are starting to post about it:
Also, Radio Europa Liberă has posted since yesterday night
I hope that they become
- Some (usually) white people are like "so my great great great great grandma was half irish therefore I'm also Irish"
- imperial system
- don't include tax in prices
- tipping
The credit card in the States is very confusing
I have always wondered how it works
In my country its pretty simple, but in the USA it seems like a pretty big complicated deal
How people are poor and can't afford stuff, but they live in huge houses and have a pool in the backyard
I mean, I get that prices are different in the states for some stuff
But I don't get the logic
Also, lawns
And why the fucking hell do your neighbors have a say in how your fucking yard looks like
I once saw a video of someone being shot while in the car with his family, by a police officer
My boss, knowing that I travel, asks me why I never go to the US
What if I went there after getting a tan
Why don't you use the metric system
It's so much easier to understand
Also farenheit
What's up with that
But do you like buy something and pay the same price in some installments
Or some kind of fee or interest is added to the initial price of the product
And do you always use credit card
I also heard that they check your bank or credit score or something if you want to rent a place or something
120 days maternity leave: only the mother (duh
) can take it and either 60 or 90 days -I can't remember- have to be taken after the child is born
The others can be taken either before the birth itself, or after, depending on each woman's health
21 months of parental leave (either the mother or the father can take it) paid with 85% of your net up to about 1600 euro a month
If the kid is born with a handicap, it's 33 months
45 days a year in case your kid gets sick, paid with 85% of your net (no cap as far as I could find)
This is until your kid turns 7, or 18 if he/she has a handicap
5 days if you get married
2 days if your kid gets married
3 days for a close relative death (child, spouse, parents)
1 day for the death of a brother, sister, grandparent
Not sure it fits here but in Romania one parent of choice gets 2 YEARS of 80% paid leave when they have a newborn baby
>Friday pulla as a benefit
That would be a whole lot of different benefit in Romania
I think the reasoning behind it is to take time off to handle the funeral preparation
You are responsible most of the time for the funeral of your parents/spouse/children but not for your siblings/grandparents
To be honest I never thought about it, but what /u/cdanisor said makes perfect sense
Yeah, when we had our son it was really great having my wife at home with him for almost 2 years
I forgot to mention, but there's also maternity leave for 3 or 4 months, so in total there's 2 years of parental leave
I can't imagine raising a kid with only a few months of maternity leave
It's not even about the costs, but about actually bonding with your kid and raising him up
If you're at work 8h, spend another 1-2 on breaks and commute, you sleep for 8, when are you supposed to be a parent to a newborn
In the remaining 3-4 hours each day
May I piggyback on this question and ask Scandinavians what exactly happens on Walpurgis Night
I've heard some interesting things from someone who claims to have lived in Sweden but I don't want to have any wrong preconceived ideas about it
Haha here in Romania we somehow have the Home Alone movies as a Christmas staple
They haven't missed a year since I was in middle school, that's like at least 13 years
It was fun at first but then it just became weird lol
>Apart from that, nothing special
But, I’m curious what you’ve might have heard
Yeah, something along the lines of everyone getting drunk and/or having orgies in public
Well there's like 3 home alone movies I think
And they play them on the days up to Christmas and on Christmas day as well (at least that's how I recall from recent years)
In Romania I noticed it depends
One of my close friends' family has a big Christmas dinner with the gifts and the tree decorating on the 24th
I grew up with the tree being done up about a week before, gifts being opened on the 25th in the morning  and then we'd have a festive lunch
Not sure what the "standard" is, but I think my experience is more common
Few Romanians know about the existence or Zalău, so I assume even fewer foreigners do
Of course it's Zalău, but it's supposed to be in Sălaj county, and everyone knows Sălaj doesn't exist
I would say Oradea as it isn't that popular as Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest or Iași. The old buildings are very well kept, there are many pedestrian-only streets and the public transport is better than your average Romanian one
You've been banned from r/SalajNuExista
r/Salajnuexista spread the truth brother
In Romanian we have the word "Stârc" (heron) which is similar to the English "Stork".
However one one is of Slavic origin while the other one is of Germanic origin
This has always baffled me and still can't accept that these aren't somehow related
So in Romanian we have the word "fain" whice mean "good, nice" and in English there is the word "fine" which has a very similar meaning as the Romanian one, and the are pronounced the exact same way
Romanian: cum = what (Cum te numești
= What's your name
English: semen
Well,I happen to know a word,but im afraid it will make this thread go from nice to nsfw
It means "with" in romanian
Was curious about the same thing, but I don't think I have seen one Moldovan flag on this reddit
There's at least one, cuz they jumped to tell me that O-zone isn't from Ro :P
Haha, that sounds super legit, I know a few people from Moldova and all of them are super proud that O-Zone is Moldovan
They are also quite pissed that the rest of Europe believes they are from Romania, as an expat I have witnessed this kind of interaction before :)
Finland
Love it
Rusia somewhere far in the north,maybe kola
Not necesarry French in general ppl who refuse to use english and assume everyone speaks their god forbidden language are toxic and cancerous it happend to me tooin r6,lol etc
Something similar happened to me in the airport in Wien
I was buying a coffee and complaining about the pretzel price
My language was very very "colorful" but the bartender said nothing up to the point where he couldn't restrain himself and started laughing really hard and replied in Romanian "you are right".
If you should them to me without context, I would have guessed they were tarot cards (fortune telling)
I’ve never seen Spanish playing cards
The French deck is the most popular here, but Hungarian decks are also used
I used to have one of those
It was a little confusing ,but it was cool
I think I had some, I don't think I ever saw the entire deck
We also call it Hungarian in Romania
It's either "cărți ungurești" ("Hungarian cards") or "cărți de cruce" ("Cross cards", named after a very popular* game called "cruce"/"cross", called like that because team members sit across from each other)
* - very popular in the westernmost part of Romania, like my hometown of Oradea
I do not know if we have this thing in Romania, but I agree
After a certain age our senses become weaker thus we become more prone to accidents
Old people should at least take some mandatory tests
Yes it's sad that some old people have to depend on someone, but it's much safer that way
They’re old, not stupid
They can drive just fine, and in the case of my family, we’d be living in a hole in the ground without the help of my grandparents
Aren't driving licenses renewed every 10 years in our country
over 25C it's hell
perfect around 15-20C
chilly around 5-15C
cold below 5C
I call everything under 15 degrees cold, and 15-20 degrees a bit cold
But i’m generally a warm weather person so i can’t speak for everyone
Depends of your definition of jacket
Like a thin one or a winter one
If it’s a thin one then 15-18C depending of the sun
15-20 is already light jacket/hoodie and jeans for me, 10-15 maybe a leather/jeans jacket and anything below 10 winter jacket, under 5 add a scarf, hat and gloves
I would say below 20 it's chilly
Then below 10 is cold
And below - 10 is freezing
But I'm also a skinny woman, so there's literally no hope for me to survive something below - 10 without 12 layers of clothes
It really depends on the location
For example when i lived in Romania i could easily tolerate -20C in the winters
(When it used to get that cold) i would say it's properly *cold* when it's around -10C
In the Netherlands on the other hand i'll start wearing my  jacket when it gets to below 10C. It feels so much colder when there's so much humidity and wind
Around 15C is probably my favourite temperature though
What counts as a *good* jacket
I could walk around in a coat and scarf in any weather if I wanted to
Uhm
It's 13 C here in Barcelona rn and I'm freezing to death even with a simple jacket
And back in Romania I feel fine at - 10 C.
So I don't rlly know how to answer that question
In Romania I had issues in summer bc I felt suffocated, but in winter I feel great
In Spain I feel better in summer (tho I hate summer still) but winter is just a nightmare
It's like it doesn't eveb matter how many layers you have on, the cold feels like it's INSIDE you
Like it comes from inside your body
Its so fuckin weirrrrrd
10 degrees celsius is fine and fresh, a bit crisp
Below 5 it is quite cold but really pleasant even if you're only wearing a sweater, that if it's sunny and there's no wind
Below 0 is cold, Below -10 is really cold
I am one of these weirdos that hate any temperature above 20 though
About the same
> and 15-20 degrees a bit cold
Depends what season
Springtime, with a bit of sunshine and barely any wind, quite agreeable T-shirt and jeans weather
Fall on the other hand, that's definitely non-consensus between hoodie and no hoodie if you watch people on the street
Ah, that sweet undecided crowd that didn’t yet abandon sandals and/or shorts, mingling with people wearing a long sleeve shirt + windbreaker
You can clearly see the discomfort but they stick to their decision
Hello, fellow *university-city* inhabitant :))
Students are the absolute *wooooorst* at this, I swear
In the middle of the winter, they'd run to the corner store in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops
You can see the obvious goosebumps from a long way away, but they still insist on looking casual
European union flag
Maybe France sometimes aswell
I like playing France in Victoria 2
I associate Europe with blue now as well
And yellow stars
More interesting is that he's from Switzerland
Hello Australian, I’m Romanian
Is this your first winter
In Romania we have winter from december to january, but it's warm outside and sunny
Snow only for a couple of days
Holidays help in two ways, depending on your personality:
Streets are filled with light decorations, which can make you more cheerful if you are already somewhat cheerful
If you're a grumpy old man, holidays are good excuse to get drunk
Here it gets dark around 18:00, and sunrise is around 7-8ish during winter
But we make do, if there’s a winter market or festival it doesn’t matter, if there’s indoor activities again, it doesn’t matter
The worst part is when the weather’s bleak, it’s cloudy all the time, and it stays like that for weeks
No sunshine is by far the worst
I even prefer when the temperature goes below -15, usually it’s clear skies then
And strangely enough it doesn’t feel as bad as between 0 and -10
Not to mention everything’s frozen, no slush, no puddles
The weather changed though, we used to get proper winter around the start or mid November, ending in the beginning or mid March
Now
in the last years we didn’t get any snow until perhaps December, with temps varying between +5/+10 to -5/-10 at night
Which tends to be highly appreciated by the flu
So, an extended flu season
In the bright side we didn’t get any snow in March
It happened in 2018 I think and it wasn’t fun
Edit: without snow, there’s no winter feeling and no skiing
Which sucks
For this year's new years eve I went to Spain
It was warm, sunny, green, the day lasted so much longer, and that was in January
I was happy that it only got dark at like 7PM while at home In Romania it started to get dark at 4 and it was cold and miserable
You cray, man
For perspective you'd need to spend a winter week somewhere dark and wet and bleh
You will appreciate the fuck out of the Aussie climate
In Romanian it has the same meaning like in English
In Romania having big balls means being very strong and that when having sex you will c*m fast, and very, very much
How can he not say anything to his friends
That will turn them against him
I imagine winning the lottery to be news worthy
keeping them uninformed it's impossible
Aaaaaa nope
I haven't thought of that
Happy cake day
There is actually a party that I voted for and wasn't the lesser evil
I think that's a first in Balkans
The way Presidential elections work in French-inspired systems, you have pool of candidates competing in the first round
If none of them get over 50%, the top two compete in the second round
I always vote for the one like most, regardless of their chances in the first round
The only politician I would truly trust would be myself, if I was one, but even that wouldn't be 100%.
In Ro its pretty much the lesser evil, for the central elections at least
For how much trasseism, political influence and GOT-like scenarios you have in Romanian politics, you can never be sure that one party is good and one is bad, although there is one thats obvisously bad (PSD)
When choosing mayors its a whole different story, everybody chooses based on achievments/notoriety/party theyre memebers of
It could be all three, or just one of them
The more you follow politics, the more you realize all the politicians are evil, so you always vote for the one that is less so
They may not be evil from the start but power/the prospect/promise of power corrupts everyone
Literally one time - it wasn't some wholehearted thing, just "oh these people seem to have some common sense". They proved to be idiots as well in the end
Otherwise
Have never believed in any politician or party here
It's all a shit show and any tiny little person who seems normal and good in the head just gets crushed
It's all a game of bribes, money, and who has the loudest mouth
It won't change until all the current dinosaurs and their kids are dead and buried
Always lesser evil
I don't believe in politicians nor respect any
Usually is the lesser evil, but with USR I think they are good and try to fight with corruption, but they are not yet big enough to win any elections
On a national level it's almost always down to the lesser of two evils
On a local level, I'm proud to say that my hometown (Bz) made some progress
We had the same fat incompetent dude as a mayor for 16 years that bribed his way in office
All the old, uneducated or poor people voted for him cuz in election years he would give them bags of food (like rice, flour, oil, stuff like that)
Then this one younger dude came along and ran against him
This dude seemed intelligent and a good guy that genuinely wanted to do some good
It was the first time in my life that I voted cuz I believed in the candidate
And he won
And he actually did a lot of good for the City
Currently, with the pandemic, my city I'd one that has the least amount of issues
We are also in a somewhat favorable area, but still
The guy did a lot of good for the City in just one mandate
Now I think it's his second one
And we will definitely vote for a third
So you voted PSD, which technically isn't the "lesser evil", it's the most evil
All the others, even USR, are "lesser evil", some less than others
Are you even allowed to vote anyone else
And yet he always chooses
Geralt likes to think he is above things like good and evil but he always cares
I believe there are elections even in North Korea
You're in trouble only if you dare to vote anything else
We had the same system ("thanks" for that, BTW)
I feel like everyone smokes here
It can’t remember a time I went out and nobody at the table smoked
Even non-smokers smoke when drunk
I wouldn’t be surprised if 5th graders smoked nowadays
It is quite common to smoke, it is not seen very positively, but the majority of people still do it
The only enforcing done here is about smoking indoors, that has been banned a few years ago, at least in restaurants, clubs etc
i was very happy as a non-smoker, since at least I wouldn't smell (hair and clothes) after going out
Most people out of the older generations smoke
Out the younger generation not so much
It's still a high percentage tho
Declining very slowly
Here it's not rlly percieved as bad
Most ppl find it normal, but as a 14 y/o, I realized how bad it was when I heard a relative say they don't smoke (I was at a wedding) and I remember thinking "an adult that doesn't smoke
Kinda strange
" and that's when it hit me that if that thought came to my mind then smoking is clearly a problem here
I think it’s way lower than 17% total
Highly unlikely that the two groups don’t overlap
> I wouldn’t be surprised if 5th graders smoked nowadays
Umm, that's legit the most common starting point
Can't speak for anyone else, but in my experience, 5th grade was the time where everyone started being dumb enough to "prove themselves cool to others", so most of them started to smoke, skate, wear baggy clothes or general rebellious actions
It was in the 7th grade when i first saw my classmates smoking
That’s 13 year olds i think
Better for them I guess since a lot of people start smoking because is seen as cool
Well yeah, do you know anyone other than teenagers that wear things like [these] And any parent who approved of that style back in the day
Shit, in 9th grade people were already fucking back in my day
Nowadays schools begins at 6 yo, but back then it was at 7, so maybe that's part of the discrepancy
I can honestly say most of the smokers in my class started between 5th and 7th grade
This isn't common with people back home, but for the people that left the country
*Do not question how Latin our language is
It's fucking Latin, ok
(I got a German dude once tell me that German is more Latin than Romanian and I almost popped a vein)
Saying that all Romanians are gypsies
I feel like our reputation has improved in the last couple of years since I haven't heard this as frequently as before but it still is annoying
And the fact that the name Romania is very similar to Roma doesn't help either
talking about hungarians
Being called a Gypsy (atleast for thr non gypsies)
So Romania in the middle ages was Wallachia and Moldavia is now Republic of Moldova,right
In Friends there's a moment when phoebe's scientist boyfriend moves to Minsk and they *constantly* say that he moves to Russia
Which bothered me so fucking much
I mean, they have no excuse
The show takes place in the 90s, not the 80s.
As others have pointed about their language, it's also the case for Romania
While officially, the country is called "Tarile de Jos" (literally "the Low Countries") and the language "neerlandeza", the overwhelming majority of us know the country as "Olanda" and the language as "olandeza". I think many Romanians would scratch their heads if they were asked where are "Tarile de Jos" or where do they speak "neerlandeza".
EDIT: Another fun fact, the Dutch are sometimes referred to in Romanian as "batavi". Make of that what you want
Wasn't Cyrillic created from the Greek alphabet tho
Don't quote me on this but Romanian has many words of latin origin and even loan words from French so you could say we doubled our latin
We also have slavic, turkish and a few words of dacian/thracian origin like barza which mean stork or branza which is cheese
Lately there are more than a few people who credit the dacians for a lot of things and take inspiration from them
I personally don't like that, they were a group of people that existed here some 2000 years ago
This is why you can hear jokes like the dacian draco was first on the moon
"Yeah,the oldest country on the continent uses an alphabet from the 9th century but before they wrote with hieroglyphs,right
It was part of the joke(reffering to Greece,not Bulgaria),so don't take at seriously and I'm from Romania btw :)
I did not know that there are waay more videochat studios than hospitals in Romania
We have the highest rate of home ownership in the world (96%)
The Romanian word for orange is _portocală_. Now it makes complete sense
Wasn’t the first country Moldova
When you stick by neutrality, you have to be prepared for war with both sides

In Ro there are some nudist beaches and outside of that you don't really see topless women
I would say that normally there are like 5% topless women in non-nudist beaches
There used to be quite a lot of women doing it around early 2000
If you are tanning on your back and laying on your belly then most women (80%) would be topless since you don't want to get the tan lines and also if your bra is wet it's annoying to lay on it
There are some smaller beaches where i've seen a lot of women go topless and i have tried it myself with some friends
I would say most young women generally avoid it on crowded beaches because of the potential harrassment since Romania is not the nicest place for women
Your friend is wrong but in Southern and Eastern europe it is definitely more common than in Britain or the US
Personally, I only go to one or two places at the beach here and they're a bit more "free spirited" so to speak
I definitely see like 20-30% of women going topless, myself included
I think it's a thing of, if you see enough other women doing it, you'll feel more comfortable as well, so it becomes less of a "thing", and more of a "my bra is itchy I'll take it off"
Also, with kids it's not really hygienic to let them sit butt naked on the sand
In the past there weren't really any options for kid's swimwear, but now there are, so why not protect them
>For a normal job you get like 800€
Dude,how cheap are flights to ur country
Some unlucky people get less than 400€ .
And tbh,lego is pretty expensive . A small set costs over 10 €.
I saw the Indominus set once, it was on sale in a store 1y after the movie
600 and the minimum wage was 1800 at the time I think (our currency)
I always got the knock-offs Legos as a kid, biggest set wouldn't get over 50
But some pieces didn't fit, some were wobbly and so on
i don't think it is normal throughout all of europe as I've never heard of this happening in my country
but it should be normal
you must know who you're letting into your home
i can understand the early modern english text, but i struggle
i can understand some parts of the middle english text
anything under old English just looks like another language, i can't understand any of it, not even if i try
Early Modern and Middle: 85%
Old English: 0%
Early modern English and middle English are pretty easy but I can decipher maybe 2 words from the old English paragraph
I perfectly understand Middle English, but I have a hard time understanding Early Modern words
His lord’s ‘war’, not his lord’s ‘men’, I hear
In this case, the Crusades
Actually, English was originally Latin, due to the Roman conquests of Anglia
It was with migrations from Saxony and other places that it turned Germanic, much the same way as it turned French with the invasion of the Normans
Perhaps to learn a bit about [Uncleftish Beholding
No man ‘further’. There was a commenter a bit above who translated this into Dutch and modern English, and the original poster confirmed almost everything he said
I speak English, and I wonder, would ‘ridderlijkhejd’ happen to translate to something along the lines of ‘rider-likehood’?
‘Anon’ presumably doesn’t mean the r/GreenText kind
*Mostly* the same thing
It is interesting to see that ‘-ly’ and ‘-like’ have (probably) the same root
Despite that, it is thought that there was at least some partial mutual intelligibility between Old English and Old Norse
They were most certainly way more mutual intelligible than Danish and German are today, as Danish struggles to have mutual intelligibility with even Norwegian and Swedish
It's been a researched topic for quite some years, and many Germanic linguists sympathize with the idea that Old English and Old Norse were mutually intelligible
Of course we would need to pay attention to an older form of Old Norse, not the regular Old Icelandic, which is the language of the Eddas
One example of similar phonetics that comes to mind is that Old Norse originally also had the /w/ sound that later became /v/ in words like "vér" (=we), the same sound which has been kept in English ever since
Here's a [thesis] written on this topic, that elaborates on the mutual intelligibility
That's what we do on 1st of May which is Workers' Day
It's either beach, barbeque or picnic
Our former president, Ion Iliescu (the first president after Ceaușescu, also a commie) wanted to say that the Dacians come from the Thracians and went: "The ducks come from the trucks".
im very late to the thread [but this is basically english with romanian, accent sounds like]
you're weak, check [romanian politicians]
So this is why ducks sound like trucks when they're quacking
Deep undercover trucks
I mean
It's not completely untrue
Ducks can come from trucks

I'm new to the subreddit and don't know how to make the country show up next to my comment
Honestly all of eastern europe was pretty much the same after WW2 as a direct result of Russia's actions
If you ask me a more dark event was the 1907 Peasant Uprising in which the government killed around 11000 people and had 10000 more imprisoned because they protested for their right to own property
Thanks !
Probably the treatment of minorities during the fascist & communist eras
The fucking Dacia Logan
Call some miners to beat up some students that were protesting (they called them huligans and said they were setting things in fire and were violent) all the while in a democracy
I was about to say corruption, but I think Vlad Tepes did something more fucked up: literally sticking people's buttholes on huge sticks (sharp) and letting them die (the people were sliding on the sticks until
yeah
google)
Or the whole political prisoners thing during communism
For most it was basically a death sentence
Not quite, but we have a saying in Romanian: luni nu creste nici iarba (not even the grass grows on Mondays)
Mărțișor - the red-and-white braided string we gift each other on the 1st of March to symbolize the beginning of spring
The first 9 days or March are called Babele ("the old women"), you pick your Baba and whatever the weather will be for that day, will also be for the whole year
The key mythological figure here is Baba Dochia, associated with the return of the spring

Dragobete - love holiday, celebrated on 24th of February
There are all sorts of regional customs but I don't think they're very widely practiced, despite so many people complaining about Valentine's Day and "ew fake import holiday, we have our own traditions" every year lol
Also plenty of pagan traditions surrounding Christmas, Easter, weddings, funerals etc
Wow, that sounds very similar to our traditional 'capra' which means goat
There's a specific dance and music that accompany it around Christmas time
You can check it here:
Same for Romania, we even have a cake we only make for funerals
We do this 3 days after the death, then 9 days after, then 6 weeks, then 3,6 and 9 months after, then every year for 7 years, very popular especially in the countryside, kinda pointless if you ask me
Don't forget all the other, more unsettling, traditions we have in different parts of the country like poking dead people in the heart with a sharp stick or unearthing the dead after 7 years to check if they are  still dead
All of that to prevent them from turning into monsters that make vampires look like sissies
If I start delving into all the ways to protect yourself from such monsters, if you somehow failed to poke your dead, I'll be typing here till tomorrow
Thank you for the video
I see you mention the Morris dance and I have to reply with our 'călușari' dance which also looks very similar or at least the costumes do
Must check it out also:
Regarding the 'capra' it usually happens between Christams and the New Year's Eve
The 'capra' groups visit then to usher in the festive spirit so people accept them in their yards and offer them sweets, hot tea etc
Well to make sure that they stayed dead
Isn't that part obvious
If they are not there then obviously they turned into strigois or worse
And strigois are not somethig that you want to meet so you got to know if you should start investing in protective charms and stuff
Yeah vampires are little pink sissies compared to a strigoi or a moroi
If the dead people don't stay dead there's also a chance that they turn into "pricolici" (pronounced: prikolichi)
That's some sort of combination between a vampire and a werewolf and is, again, something that you don't want to deal with
Depends who you are asking, but they can be thought of as lesser strigoi
The scary part is that they look like people but like to devour them
I think the best visual representation of one would be  in the "A night to remember" trailer from Witcher
(Not sure what type of monster that one is, but it's pretty close to what a moroi would be)
I mean, there are also:
- werewolves
- witches
- balaurs (huge dragons with multiple heads)
- pegasus horses
- ogres
- dragons
- all sorts of fairies
- tueaday demons
- normal demons
- undead (also come out of graves but are harmless when compared to strigoi)
- solomonari (dragon riding, weather controlling, overpowered wizards)
- chimeras ( called zgripțuroaice)
- giants
- basilisks
- ursitoare (some sort of beings which come to newborns and bless/curse their life for no reason)
- vâlve (spirits that can be good or evil)
- vântoase (wind spirits)
- zburator (translated as "the flyer" but it's actually some sort of cupid)
- zmei (this one is a more complex being which can take many forms, including human forms, forges and uses tools and weapons, likes to marry young girls but their natural form is either a dragon or a balaur
Haha yes, in the dub they use the word "capcaun" (ogre in Romanian) so the concept was/is not something new or foreign to kids
(We have some fairytales for children that can easily be rated M, but I think Hungarian fairytales are much more hardcore)
Yup, we had a channel which aired animated versions of Hungarian fairytales and I used to enjoy them a lot
Thinking back, I have no idea how they were allowed
Those are exactly the ones I've been watching too, but dubbed
The only dish that I know that literally all Romanians like is boeuf salad
If you don't eat that, you don't belong here
My GF doesn’t like “mici”, and in Romania there’s no barbecue without “mici”.
Romanian who hates pork rinds
A Romanian who doesn't eat sarmale
A Romanian who does not blast manele from their car/bluetooth speaker in a bus
The Hungarians in Transylvania
I would one up you with a fin that also likes people and is very close to other ppl
Sarmale
I don’t like it either
Looks a lot like barf, disgusting
Many people dont like them
No idea, but everyone loves it
What is it called over there
People may or may not like boeuf salad/sarmale,but if you don't eat mititei, we prepare the stake
What kind of disease do those people suffer from

the same word refers to land (or lands) as well which is neutral but the earth does not have plural which makes it probably masculine
but it's most likely neutral
couldn't be bothered to check the dictionary)
"Soare"(male, the sun) and "Luna"(female, the moon) in romanian
In our folklores (part of our culture) almost everytime the sun is a woman and the moon is a male
And for Earth it depennds on its used name
Earth- masculine/neutral
Terra- feminine (altough this is only used by scientists or science teachers)
Yes *Pamant* (Earth) is neuter
Un pamant, doua pamanturi
In romanian Nutella has feminine gender you can't argue it
Same in Romanian: Soarele (the sun, male), Luna (the moon, female)
Yeah, same for us: Soarele and Luna
hello fellow sarma eater
Hello there fellow vampire
Now that I think about that
The Sun is a male, the Moon is a female and their son the Earth is transsexual
:-D
Hellow fellow mamaliga eaters
That would be the interwar era
Which really wasn't. The 20s were ok
Sure, we had corruption, election rigging, no universal suffrage and bad working conditions but things were ok-ish and we had potential to improve
But the 30 is were shit hit the fan
We had an incompetent King who fucked up our electoral system even more by making votes officially meaningless as he would put in power whoever he wanted, the economy was going downhill, We had fascist groups gunning down each other in the streets, politicians getting assassinated and in the last 2 years of the decade we became an oficial one party royal dictatorship with  an incompetent playboy as our dictator
In Romania, "the golden age" is used to refer to the communist regime
Some use it ironically, some don't.
I mean probably in the interbelic period(1919-1939) ,because the romanians developed a lot in that time and the capital Bucharest was called "Petite Paris".And I do agree
Communists called the reign of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu (1965-1989) "The Golden Age". But that's used mostly sarcastically today
Many Romanians would consider the years after WWI as the greatest because the country was united, including Bassarabia (modern-day Moldova and parts of Ukraine)
The country was an important player in regional politics
The economy was doing well, though it was mostly based on agriculture
Things went downhill fast when the Great Depression hit, which coincided with the rise of nationalism, Christian Terrorism (Legionaries), and a weak "Playboy" king
On top of everything, Soviets and Nazi decided a big united Romanian country does not fit with their plans
For Romania it is probably the period after the First Unification, from the 1860s to around 1930
It was the most culturally significant era in our history, economically we had a really good situation, being one of the biggest oil and gas producers in those times, and the monarchs really built a lot of nice places in the country, like Peles Castle, Sinaia and lots of buildings in Bucharest
And while we did have most of the same problems as today (corruption, communist leeches, bad infrastructure) we were really developing fast, and we actually had a middle class
1919-193o, right between when we **finally** reunited the country and Carol II came along to screw it all up
Romania became the most influential military in the Balkans probably, developed wealth and industry, and finally had (basically) total ethnic unity under a single flag
During communism, the communist party tried to convince people that the communist period was the Golden Age of Romania
I can agree but I can mostly disagree on this
While Romania has improved its economy and people were having jobs, some fundamental human rights were not present which led to the Revolution
Personally I think the start of monarchy was the golden age, and I might be a crazy monarchist but I could see many people actually agreeing on this as that is the time most institutions were formed, Romania got its independence, united and acomplished the dream of Romanians , many things were done and no one wanted it to end I guess
I’ll tell you what wasn’t a golden age: Communism, even though so many idiots here classify it as that
Not exactly
The golden age for Romania certainly was the 70s. Before Ceausescu decided to pay loans back and ration everything, Romania was quite a country of plenty
Most people worked 7 to 5, had good wages, nobody was homeless, and you actually had stuff to buy
People going to eat at a restaurant was a common thing, not a luxury
And even censorship was weakened during that time and western culture started getting in a bit too
I really feel like Romania as a whole was so much better in the 70s than it is today from the point of view of wellbeing of the people
explain that to the retards who mourn him still
Indeed
And, because the focus was that everyone needs to have a job, most people had very easy jobs where they didn’t have to do much
A totally different focus than today’s world where you must work 120% on minimum wage or you’re fired
Insane compared to what
To current condition for many people, it’s certainly not insane
A lot of people, illegally
When you're paid miserably and you having food next month depends on having the job, you don't risk complaining to police if the boss says "you're gonna work more than what's in your contract or you'll get fired".
Romania nowadays is full of corruption and it generally is the go-to country for cheap labour in Europe
I don't think you're spoiled
You really don't have to pay that much more to have a good experience, you just need to do some research and plan stuff out better
I don't have a horror story, but I will share a funny memory from two years ago
I got a bed in a cheap hostel in Budapest - super nice location, and the place was decent for how cheap it was
When I get to my room I see it is actually a very large room divided by thin walls, each compartment with two bunk beds
When I got to my compartment there was a heavy smell of feet, socks and wet stuff
I got in, there were 2 South Koreans in there and of course I looked at them and their feet with disgust but saluted nicely
Then I fell asleep for an hour or so because I was super tired
When I woke up the two koreans were gone
I started unpacking my stuff properly when another korean showed up, with bags and everything
When he entered I saw on his face exactly the same disgust I must have shown to the other two guys - his face was saying "omg this filthy european smells like an animal".
I think this was 2 or 3 years ago
My family and I were coming back from our holiday in Greece and we stopped at the parking lot of a big hotel in Serbia
I took out something to eat something and then I accidentally locked the keys inside the car
We had to call some mechanics, who forced a small opening through the front passenger door and then used a long wire, shaped into a hook at the end to grab the keys
The whole ordeal lasted around 30 mins, during which a crowd of around a dozen people had gathered to see the events unfold, amongst whom 3 or 4 people who most likely wanted to steal something from the car once we managed to unlock it
Once we managed to grab the keys we took of as fast as possible, therefore avoiding any further complications
Another one happened last year, while driving towards Greece
I unknowingly ate some bad pizza the day prior and then vomited every few minutes for about a third of the road
Even after I stopped vomiting I still felt very weak due to dehydration
This is the day that I would definitely say was the most uncomfortable in my life
Not my story,but the story of a camily friend pf my parents
They want to the beach in a vacantion and leftbtheir kids in the room to sleep while  they watched the sunrise
and someone got  into the room without  making  waking up anyone and stole all the money,the car key and  the car
Very nice story
Not even Romanians that love how their heads are a part of their body will not step foot in Craiova
I'm very sorry for your experience
Ugh man I'm really sorry
I'm romanian and I instantly cringed when I read Craiova
Please go to Transilvania or Bucharest next time
Waha festival if you like camping
That would have been way too much
I dont k ow the full details of the story,but I gess they got everything back in the end
Not in my hometown but in the city I'm studying, the vice-mayor told the citizens to get out by the windows with the vacuum cleaners to "clean" the air
not in my homecity but in the harbor town many boats overturned and tons of cocaine have spread  and they floted to the shore and were discovered by an old man who called the police and it was a very big national scandal:))))
But adding the necessary energy for powering all those vacuum cleaners
I doubt that is going to do more good than harm
The Maramureș region does not get enough love, it has beautifull monasteries and lovely nature
I fully agree
I always said that if i have enough luck in life i would buy a small apartment in Gijon an retire there
All of Asturias is beautiful
I'd say French and Spanish
German is way too hard and Russian is just completely out of this world for me
Try Hungarian, Estonian or Finnish if you're into killing yourself
:-P
I think you're wrong here
But let's ask somewhere and check who's right
No French versus German though
Spanish or Italian versus German
:-)
True
Languages from the same "family" are easier to be understood
For example, for me Italian or French are (I assume) like Latvian is for you
It took me one year to understand English
Tho we have a lot of "false friend" words (words that have different meaning in my language but sound the same in English)
I assume Lithuanian is even more different
With Slavic languages I only know (kind of) the Cyrillic alphabet and that's it
Do you need a rope or
some soap
A chair
A gun
A cannon
:-P
One of my best friends is a Hungarian girl from Transylvania, she's on reddit too, and she tried to teach me a lot
it didn't worked at all unfortunately
:-/
I don't know
well I can't do that
I'm sorry
But I'm sure you can find someone if you ask on r/Hungary
I hope you are not upset
I'm absolutely sure you will find someone in r/Hungary
Not many people learn Hungarian and they will be happy to help I'm sure
:-)
Are you the guys with the phrase made only out of consonants
Or am I confusing languages here
woah I actually thought she teaches Spanish everywhere (except for Spanish-speaking countries of course)
This is my favorite fact about czechia ️. Your weird aversion to vowels
Awesome fact and brilliant username, man
But I do appreciate it
I can't pronounce this shit, but that doesn't mean that I don't find it cool
Ceausescu probably
a close contest between Nicolae Ceausescu, his wife Elena or Ion Iliescu
An entire party (PSD)
Depends whoever you are asking
Some might say Antonescu (ww2 romanian non nazi field Marshall) and some idiots might say Ceaușescu (last communist leader)
[Carol II]
Politicians, leaders and kings
Some examples:
King Carol II, Nicolae Ceausescu, Liviu Dragnea, Viorica Dancila, Ion Iliescu, Vadim Tudor
Note: some of them were loved during their period of rule but now, they are hated by new generations
I think Hitler should be excluded from this kind of question because it's too obvious, just like every question involving video games in which Poland flexes the Witcher
Followed closely by Iliescu
Not even close lol
Ceaușescu is seen as positive and the best president we had by more than 50% of the population
Saul Bruckner
Ion Iliescu
Petre Roman
Adrian Năstase
King Michael
Would be a realistic list by the amount of damage they did
Edit: Number one should actually be Gheorghe Pintilie, born Pantelei Bodnarenko aka Pantiușa
We can hate Iliescu from birth till death
He will just refuse to die
The entire f*cking government not only Dăncilică
Elena Ceaușescu, Orban (some of them) Ion Antonescu (i really don t understand why he s so hated) Iohănnuț
and the rest of PSD's hierarchy
Their joking
He is generally viewed favorably even if the rehabilitation attempts failed
It really doesn't help that the soviets validated his anti-bolshevism really hard
Antonescu was voted the 5th greatest Romanian of all times in 2006 by the people
The biggest threat to Romania was Bolshevism, and he fought the best he could for Romania before being betrayed by King Michael
He is indeed considered "one of the less terrible fascists" because he didn't try to kill most of the Jews from Romania
But, as you can see, the bar is extremely low (He still killed a lot of them)
That disgusts, disturbs and disrespects me
Why would you see King Michael as hated, I mean sure before his death many communist old people hated him ( including my parents ) but after his death I think everyone woke up from all of that hate ( again, including my parents )
Personally I don't see him being hated
It’s disgusting to see how much people love Ceausescu
King Michael didn't do much
He naively believed in the allies and thus shortened the war a little, but the end would've been the same
Moreover people seem to love him
If he doesn’t die during this period he will never die
Immortal communist dinosaur
A conservative pseudo dictator that is smart and refuses to leave his seat preemptively will create a realy shity power  vacum when it happens(Or if he is assassinated it will be even worse)
Also general oppression and international isolation
Is the same thing as he said
Why is Elena Ceausescu hated
And Iohanut, by counting his votes, he doesnt really seem hated
Ion Antonescu participated in the Holocaust
The whole political class, to be more accurate
> King Michael didn't do much
Exactly
Antonescu kept the country safe, otherwise we would ve been annexed by the soviets
He had nothing to do, he had to be hitler s dog, Hungarians already wanted all of Transilvania not just the northen part, Bulgaria wanted all of Dobruja not only southern Dobruja (Cadrilaterul) and Russians wanted all of Bukovina and Moldavia not only Basarabia and Northern Bukovina
He has to do anything Hitler said otherwise our country would ve been divided between them
If that small talk happened a couple of years ago, they are most probaly reffering to how he was better then the respective power at that time
Or they were communists
And we ended under the soviets and participated in the holocaust
Historical hindsight is a really big thing when talking about Antonescu because yes he was a nationalist that tried to do the best for the nation, but he was also an anti semite military dictator that legitimately wanted to colonize the transnistrian governorate and saw only the economic problem of the holocaust
A good man he was not and we should not try to rehabilitate him
PS:The only thing he deserves nowadays is to be judged for what he actually deed and not for staying against Stalin's USSR
Would ve ended under the soviets anyways though
And we ended under the soviets **and participated in the holocaust
Well, funny enough, I did my Erasmus in Poland and I was told I had a very good accent in Polish
I only knew to say some basic sentences and to excuse myself for not speaking Polish, but apparently I had such a good accent that people thought I was taking the piss when asking me something and responding with "sorry, I don't speak Polish". It's a hard language, hard pronunciation, but it can be manageable though
As for Romanian
I think it's not that difficult
Grammar is easier compared to most Germanic and Slavic languages, only Romance languages might have a harder time
It's a very phonetic language too, so once you know the rules, it's easy
Now depending on which is your mother tongue, there are usually 4 sounds in Romanian that foreigners might have a harder time repeating:
1) the thrilled R. If you have it in your language, then it's all good
If not, it's easy to spot a foreigner by this
2) diphtons and triphtongs
Romanian has many combination of vowels that might be hard to foreigners to reproduce
The best case I can think of is "oa" as in the cities of Timisoara, Sighisoara etc
3) ă. Some sort of schwa in Romanian
Many languages have this sound, but they do not really have a letter for it
If they do not have it, they will usually have a hard time pronouncing it
4) î/â. This one reflects the Slavic influence in our language
It can be found in several Slavic languages, so for them it is easy, for the rest, not so much
Hard on all levels
Grammar: Except the fact that we also have a lot of gender pronouns, nothing too hard
Yet we somehow manage to not have an equivalent for "it", which makes Romanian not the best country to be non binary in
Accent: I've never actually heard a lot of foreigners learn Romanian
The biggest problem I've seen is putting too much accent on vowels
In Romanian *most* vowels except the one with the accent are more on the silent side than for example English
I'm no expert tho'. Don't quote me on this please
I read that many Romanians in Spain have a pretty good accent in Spanish
Yup, Hungarian seems like a very difficult language
However, the Hungarian accent in Romanian sounds very funny
What about the romanians living in italy
I heard that they have a very good italian accent
absolutely not
because not everyone has a high paying job, so those who are working minimum wage would have to work more hours to get the same salary that they'd have if everyone was working 5 days instead of 4 days
Why not reduce the work of the service industry too
I worked as a pharmacist some time ago and it's really unfair to have to keep a place open every day of the week until 10pm, just because *maybe* someone will come in
The beginning of the week was mostly dead after 8pm for us
But we just had to spend another 2h doing literally nothing
Not to say anything of the wasted time spent on Sundays
I mean, I know it's idealistic, but how about not treating the service industry/any other kind of retail as slaves to the consumers
Some jobs have "dead times", instead of spending an hour or two in a coffee break every day with your coworkers, you could consolidate that time into one extra day off
And since you'd have less time at work, you'd be more incentivised to actually work and get things done
I mean, you get paid for the work you have to do anyway
So if instead of spending a few hours every week of doing nothing productive, why not use that time to chill
A tighter schedule usually means more productivity, just because you have less time to spend in coffee breaks
Who said it has to be by force
It doesn't have to be dramatic, you know
It can easily just be an option available that some people could take that slowly reshapes the way people view work
Also, the culture of going to a bar/restaurant at any hour could be slowly and gently reshaped
We don't need to start a freaking revolution + a little bit of genocide just to get people to act nicely to the service industry
Well, that's true
And as someone suggested in another comment, it would be nice to have the option
I, for instance, work in research, so sometimes I work 10-12h a day for 6 days a week and then other times I don't really have anything to do, cuz I'm waiting around for results from other people
It would be nice for people to be less rigid about the amount of time everyone has to spend at work
Not really
In my contract it says I should work 9-5
And the work is in such a way that even if you have just reason to skip work, you're still viewed in a bad way
France - for convincing other empires to let us establish a country of our own in 1859 (Napoleon the 3rd, merci beaucoup
) and then supporting our independence dreams (1878)and our unification  (1918 ) despite other wishes of the neighboring empires (looking at you Russian Empire and your plans to reach Mediterrana)
Then again France was a big advocate in getting us in the EU in 2007 (undeserved I know, but we really appreciate it)
Thanks Netherlands for keeping us out of Schengen so that we can keep our corrupt politicians in check with justice and other sensitive topics like this
Not in Europe but thanks USA for having us in NATO and basically having our back in our relation with the difficult eastern neighbour
And yes, President Wilson  for breaking the old Austro-Hungarian Empire after WWI and promoting people's right to self determination
Italy and Spain for welcoming our immigrants in their countries and provide a home to millions of us looking for a better life
And not at last, Greece and our Balkan brothers and sisters - we love you guys, we're the same in spirit, and that is deeply embedded in our nature :)
Pretty much all of western Europe:
- We got lots of big companies investing here as we are cheaper
- A mentality that helps us fight corruption as much as we can
- Great food and vacations
- Hungary for giving us Transilvania
(Just joking, calm down)
I would like to thank Bulgaria for being the poorest country in the EU, so România isn't.
anytime man
ur welcome bro
>Hungary for giving us Transilvania
(Just joking, calm down)
I almost spit out my food with laughter :D
Happy cake day
TECHNICALLY, kürtőskalács was invented by the szekely, the transylvanian hungarians, so TECHNICALLY you should thank Romania
Just kidding of course, but Transylvanian Kurtos is the best
The hungarians make a second hand kurtos
Fuck French
That language hard af
None of my teachers even try to explain it to us
Only Google does it
I can mostly understand all other romance languages when written ( let's say around 90% because, besides romanian, i've also studied french and latin), but when spoken I can't really understand a lot
Strangely enough, I am Romanian, i know the language, and I know Italian too because I lived there, but I cannot understand ANY other language which many understand knowing one or the other
Most of my friends in Italy understand Spanish really well, whilst I can barely make out a half sentence, not to talk about French
I always liked French until I had to study it in middle school in Italy
I barely passed
Also, I can't understand French written or spoken
Maybe spoken a bit better than written
But just enough to maybe make out a word here and there
Thankfully English is pretty international, otherwise, I'd have a load of issues when travelling
i can understand a little bit of italian if i concentrate enough
Yes, I can pretty much understand most of the French words someone is saying or writing but sometimes when they talk too fast I can just pick some words
Afterall, the lexical similarity between Romanian and French is around 75%
French is understandable sometimes, but many of the more complex words and even some normal ones just dont make sense to us
Its quite a jump from "la stanga" to "a gauche"
Me personally I can't understand French that good, neither written or spoke, but I can understnd Italian written and spoken
It's hard to tell why you can't understand romanian, but we're able to understand (somehow) italian
Our vocabulary is 70% from latin
Meh, not really latin but french
Even though, I can barely speak french :D. Except some basic sentences
Hmm
We kept and adapted the latin grammar, maybe that's the reason, but I don't think so
Do Italians study latin
A streak of bad luck is making it easier than it sounds
I has shitty teachers at math,which I was supposed to excel,French,music and art
Let's just hope that I am not gonna start hating the last 2 .
Romania
How do I add a flair
Nevermind found it
Daily
Seems there’s always something big going on in the USA
Fires, hurricanes, protests, COVID response and, of course, Trump
And this is just in the last week or so
r/news is for USA news, r/worldnews is for USA news and the tv is also for USA news so too damn much
Maybe it's just me but since Trump took office we also have "Breaking news" type of stories
News about the US was a daily thing everywhere even before but before I fell that I never saw the top headlight "Breaking news" type of story outside the national election days or a mass shooting/terror attack (and even then only if it was a slow news day nationally)
> First of all,do you believe that this actually exists
Well, it exists in the same way the "Common Asian identity" or the "Common African identity" exists
it's very loose
&#x200B;
> Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
No offense but I would rather have USA as the Superpower, not Europe, especially not Europe lead by Germany
Why are soo many Europeans obsessed with being a Superpower
Why can't we be more like Switzerland
&#x200B;
> Do you really believe we can build a federation only through good words and good intentions,not even having a common language to begin with
You know there is a saying about good intentions
I don't think we can build a federation, not like this
The current structure of the EU is very undemocratic, it's a technocracy ruled by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels
First, we need some serious reforms before we can talk about a federation
Here I very much agree with Yanis Varoufakis, even though I'm not his biggest fan
I for one whenever I think about this something like a family tree pops into my mind
I'm Romanian, then, coming from the southern part I feel more close to the Balkans, then Eastern European and then European as a whole
I do believe in a European identity, but not something like a nationality, more like a family group
Just like how we have the romance family, the germanic family, southern slavic family and so on, I believe in a higher European family
As much as I would like an European superstate, I don't think it would be too feasible, at least in the near future
What makes Europe great and what helped every European nation throughout history was the competition between small groups of people
That's why I feel that for Europe, a system that brings closer every group of people, but at the same time promotes a peaceful competition between them would be the best system for Europe
If we're good at it, why not promote it
Instead of a big group of people that work for a man at the top, a small close-knit family that lives together and in which every member does its own thing, but still contribute to the overall happiness and well being of the family would be best
A national identity is built,and so is the European identity,I am sure that by 2069 there will be a federation
I believe that, although there is commonality of some aspects between European peoples, there is not enough to justify the creation of a new state
For a European federation to be created requires a great number of people to admit that they, their forefathers, their national heroes, and all that they have stood for in the past, are wrong
Even in Spain, there are separatist movements
Even in Britain
To form a confederacy of European states means that all of these people must suddenly be happier
Furthermore, it means that almost every national hero of every nation must be made guilty for defending his nation’s sovereignty or for harming his brothers, if a federation is what is right for Europe
Bran castle
It is nice, sure, but it doesn't warrant the attention it gets
There are far more beautiful castles and fortresses in Romania
With that being said, Bran is in a beautiful area of Romania that is definitely worth visiting
i wouldn't say its overrated, it's definitely worth a visit, the bran castle gets the most attention, but there are more cool castles in romania that don't get as much traction as they deserve, my personal favourite is the peleș castle which is sinaia
The Old Town in Bucharest
That is legitimately the only place I see tourist guides talk about on YouTube aside from the Palace of the Parliament
I looked up on youtube to see how are foreigners presenting Bucharest and for 20 minutes straight he just walked in the Old Town showing the PotP only when it was visible from one of the streets
"Exploring Bucharest" my ass
>Disclaimer: I hate it when people label a city/country as a whole as "overrated" or <another negative label>. They're toursity for a reason, and life outside of tourism also does happen in those places
This
Cities like Paris, London or LA are famous for a reason, they hold special bits of history and culture and they have places that you won't find anywhere else
Plenty of people have heard so much about those locations and want to go see them in real life, and there's nothing wrong with that
Even if you end up disappointed, it's better to satisfy that curiosity than to regret not going
Hell, maybe you'll absolutely love that landmark and have the time of your life there, despite the negative stuff people say
A tourist trap is something that advertises itself to be more authentic/local/interesting than it really is, for the purpose of money
Just be aware and educated about what you're visiting and what to look out for
After all they're just normal cities that exist in the same world as our hometowns, there are all kinds of people and attitudes there, and they are not what they were 50-500 years ago
Because it’s way cheaper than Mamaia, like half price
Worst thing is Vlad the Impaler never even lived there
If anybody is interested, Poenari Castle is actually were he lived
Castelul Huniazilor ar trebui vizitat de mai multi turisti
E un loc foarte frumos
I live in the Netherlands since 2019 and Amsterdam is my favourite city, except the very touristic part
I wonder why Ducth people hate Amsterdam so much, lol
Hahah it's called the *Little* Mermaid for a reason :P
Exactly
It's okay to not enjoy a place, but it's also important to go with realistic expectations
I agree
It's sad because Romania has quite a few creepy places but the only one that gets attention is Bran Castle
If you want to show her some real strange stuff show her Hoia Baciu forest
Eu l-am vizitat si consider ca se merita
I think it’s much more extreme in the UK
London literally feels like a different country
I lived in Birmingham for 3 years and I moved to London and i don’t feel like i’m in the same country
Our Goulash-eating friends to the northwest
Some people believe their in the past and continue hating on hungarish
Hungary of course, and people who call Bucharest Budapest aren't helping
Hello hungarians
Bulgaria
We are constantly wrestling for the bottom two places at the bottom of any european top when it's about something positive and at the top 2 position when it's something negative
Hungary or Russia
Hungary, of course
Is there *someone* that didn't try to conquer us
Besides that, apparently lots of people have beef with Hungary and them with us
United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama-
We have a lot, really, but notable are Hungary, Russia, Bulgaria, and Turkey, because we want Transylvania, Bessarabia, Dobrogea, and independence
Well then
Hungary I must say ... or Russia
Nah Hungary
There are wayy too many Romanians here
Also regarding Transylvania i say we let  the true people decide
The vampires
Hungary
Easy
Yeah, here many people hate hungary because they "claimed" Transylvania
What did Vietnam ever do to Moldova
The thing is we are rivals
And there is only one way to find out which one is better
We put the Orbans in an arena
The one who survives is the winner
Even in Walachia they haven’t got to good of a name, even if we haven’t interacted that much
We care for you, Transylvanian bros
Gotta get that sweet kurtos
I see no russian here, they must be afraid
You wish
Bulgaria is Romania's Dinkleberg, two equally shit countries yet somehow those damn Bulgarians over the Danube always give out the better impresion with their fancy tourism and good PR, damn you Bulgaria
Come on how bad can it be
Hopefully they kill each others
Win win situation
It wasn't me, man, i dont know
but those hungarians are talking shit about you, brothers, you must do something
just break my heart, those bastards
Yeaah, but our Orban will die better
Ah, the good ol' switcharoo and blame Hungary
Gold
Party like it's 1849
Hold the phone
earthquakes coming more and more in the Balkans
Oh no
Not a repeat of '77
Part of me understands it but part of me doesn't... What do you mean by "also his wife"
Ahahaha now I get it
there's this nice little poem my grandmother taught me "sare n-avem, pâine n-avem dar canal la mare avem, şi se plimbă cu bărcuța Ceauşescu si Elena"/ "We don't have salt, we don't have bread, but channel to the sea we have, and riding on a dinghy are Ceauşescu and Elena
" Quite nice to see the other side of Romania (the Hungarian part) cause I'm part Hungarian and nobody will tell me anything xD
I really wanna go to Disneyland, and the Paris one is the closest obviously, I live in Spain but
I don't really like it
I wish I could rather go to the biggest one in USA lol
And as for other tourist places
I really don't see the appeal in visiting the capitals, in any country tbh
I think that capitals are usually the most boring part of every country
Most capitals are rather similar and very touristy
I feel like it's better to go to more traditional places
Like Instead of going to Barcelona I would tell someone to visit Playa de Aro which Imo is prettier lol or even Tarragona
And in Romania instead of Bucharest to visit places like Sinaia, Sighisoara
I don't feel the need to visit Paris, Rome, Madrid, Lisboa
I think there are much more beautiful places than those in said countries
I'd be curious to see how many tourists come for Barcelona-specific things they are interested in (such as Gaudi's architecture or Camp Nou) versus general stuff like beaches or parties, or just to tick Spain off the travel list
Same for London
Tbh Barcelona itself seems great for people who are genuinely interested in Barcelona-specific things (like Gaudi's buildings for an architect, or Camp Nou for a football enthusiast)
But I assume these people are just a small percentage of the total number of tourists
There are flights that can land in other places of Romania, we don't only have an airport in Bucharest though
And fine, if you want a quick 2 days vacation
But Imo if I was gonna take only a weekend vacation I would just go somewhere in my own country or to a a neighbor country rlly close than go to a different country that's more far
If you wanna really visit a country you need to go with time
I don't know any Portugeuse but i remember someone telling me "pula" in portugeuse means "jump".
In Romanian it means dick
And i remember something about a portugeuse singer singing a song with the word "muie" which means "blowjob" in Romanian
Edit: I forgot to mention the word "Cum" which means "How"
The word "Nervos" in Romanian means "Angry", which is pretty different from the English word "Nervous".
We would usually call these "false friends" when learning a language:
Romanian: librărie | English: bookstore
Romanian: bibliotecă | English: library
Romanian: desert | English: dessert
Romanian: deșert | English: desert
Romanian: drujba = chainsaw
Russian: drujba = friendship
It is like that because during communism, a soviet company Friendship was the only and main producer of chainsaws, so we adopted that word for it
Cocina in Spanish meand kitchen
Cocina in Romanian means pigsty
“Geci” in Romanian means jackets
“Geci” in Hungarian means jizz
Related to pezevenk, we have the word pezevenghi in Romanian, which means something like naughty
In Romanian it’s close enough
We have “curva” meaning the same as in the Slavic languages, while for the Spanish and Italian “curva” we say “curba”
Also romanian: cald (warm) and german: kalt (cold), are pronounced the same but mean the exact opposite
In the past couple of years I realized that yes, I in fact do like living in my country, which is my home and where my friends and family are
And even though there are issues, I started to look at them with the mindset that issues exist everywhere and we should try to solve them as much as we can
There are plenty of countries with more issues than mine, and plenty with a lot of the issues solved, but that have other kind of issues of their own
SO I am fine home :)
Nevertheless I like to travel very much and I'm looking forward to the restrictions being lifted
How do people put their countries next to their names
I want that too
Anyway, I don't see how to answer this question
Im Romanian but studied in Italy since I was ~7 and now I'm in UK, which I want to leave and maybe try out Ireland before coming back to Romania
Reasons:
Immigrated in Italy because parents did so,
moved to UK cuz things in Italy got bad,
I wanna move away from UK cuz I believe Brexit is bad, and in staying here, I am condoning UK's choice
Ireland is close enough, speak English so no trouble learning new language, I heard they're doing very well economically, and strangely enough all the Irish people I met are really cool & friendly
+ I have a weak spot for reds and I heard Ireland is full, so might even find my soulmate there, but I'm kind of a weird person, so I think it'll be just as probable as finding it anywhere else
So yeah, here's my life on a plate for y'all
I love my country but I hate the uneducated people from it
I visited England one year ago and I fell in love with the Victorian architecture and if i would choose a country to live, I would probably choose England because of the architecture and because of their accent which is so elegant
I love living in Romania
Yes, it has it's own problems, but it has so many beautiful places, beautiful people
I would NEVER leave my country to live in another
The country is not too bad, it could be way worse
That being said, I'm in a way forced to move out, can't really form a family here and I wouldn't want my children to be subjected to abuse
Spain is looking really good, not just scenery-wise, but as a people too, which is what interests me most
We're still researching things, but so far Gandia and Ferrol seem really, really nice
There is a big thing here
"I can't wait to leave this country".
Well is not the same for me - I always loved Romania and I would never like to leave it
There is also a cliche here (and it was commonly used in the past) how, as eg, "In Germany the salaries are much better and everything is much cheaper
I can't wait to move there and leave this s**th**e".
No, but I don't have anywhere else to go
Everywhere else is either crappier, expensive, or the Internet is slow
I gotta say, as a romanian living abroad, I feel you
Today was a normal day, woke up, started working, and as I am working from home, i put on some music
And some random Romanian rap song came on, and I suddenly bursted into tears, thinking of how much I miss home
You leave thinking of better 'prospects' and once you're there you realise how much your country means to you
Piggybacking on your comment to mention that even though I mostly agree with you and things are somewhat fine, lately I fear they took a turn for the worse
Our parliament just [banned gender studies] meaning they want to ban all educational institutions (including universities) from "propagating theories and opinion on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex". I can only imagine that banning discussions about gender identity, consent, sexual education etc will only rise the violence against the LGBTQ+ community, and young girls and women
On top of that, during the lockdown, women's reproductive rights have been reduced to 0
In the begining there were no hospitals in which they performed abortions (and there are still very few open to this procedure now), our internal affairs minister told us to give birth at home instead of going to the hospital (wtf
Currently half of the population is paying taxes for what, to carry unwanted pregnancies and be told to give birth at home
I feel like this is only a preview for what's about to come and we are taking after the Hungarian and Polish model
I have to admit, not one single place screamed 'you should move here' to me as Iceland did
Driving for 10-15 minutes on a highway without a single car coming from the opposite lane is one of the more soothing sensations out there
I want to move to Ireland soon
(current history is Romania - Italy - UK)
And I actually am curious how much is rent
I looked around a bit and prices seemed OK
I mean, in the UK you can get £1000/month for a house which
Well
Can't say I *love*, and on a website I found prices around €800-600/month
Even €500 if you really wanna risk it going low
Was I lied to by the almighty Internet
Also, where can I find a proper list of Irish universities
There's quite a few lists for UK unis, but I couldn't find many for Ireland
Thank youuu
>at least people who violently oppose the 'third gender' are not taken seriously
And we basically don't talk about this anymore
I wonder what went differently in Romania
I feel like we're on the same boat
A couple of years ago we had this referendum to ["define family" in the constitution] Currently the constitution uses a gender neutral language to reference marriage, and although gay marriage isn't permitted yet, it provides an opening for potential recognition
The association (the "coalition for family") who pushed for this referendum wanted to change the wording of marriage to "an union between a man and a woman", thus making gay marriage unconstitutional
Fortunately, people boycotted the referendum, but not because they're all so for LGBTQ+ rights, but because the proposal was ambiguous an left room for further amendments that weren't explicitly stated, so
yay for corruption and hidden agendas
This Coalition for family isn't really being taken seriously but right now they're taking advantage of the current shaky ground to make room for their extremist views
They push for a "traditional" family, they are against abortion they want to ban adoption by single parents, and they generally have a very aggressive stance towards anyone that is not sharing their views
Unfortunately they're backed by the church (how surprising
>But damn, banning an entire academic field
what happened to free speech
It's ironic given how often alt-right people complain about violations of their free speech
Exactly
But try to explain to one of those that free speech isn't the same as hate speech
>And I always tend to think about Romania and Bulgaria as the same thing lol How are things going with LGBT rights in Romania
Do you feel like society is getting more accepting
I personally feel optimistic about Bulgaria
We Romanians feel the same about Bulgaria
I think generally the population is starting to open up to the idea of LGBT rights, but I fear that this bill will take us a few steps back
We signed petitions and we are hoping that the president will downturn it
Recently there was also a bill to introduce sexual education in schools but it was severely botched so not much will change for now
Overall I dunno man, I feel that so much money and energy is being wasted on this bullshit instead of staying out of other people's bedroom and focusing on educating and feeding the poor
Thank you, I'll note this for later, I plant to move by August if possible, so will have to hurry up with preparations
Thank you
I expected a longer list, but often less is more, and it just simplifies the whole process
Do you also have a rough idea about the cost
In UK it's like £9
500/year I assume it is something similar
I assumed all these high costs come as standard in capitals, I was just looking at a smaller city not-too-far-but-not-too-close to Dublin
Similar thing goes on in London: 1small room goes for ~£800/month, or so says my friend
But I do see your point, for a small room, from ~€900 or whatever the equivalent would be, to €1500 is nearly double for same standard
Historically, a terrible place, between the Ottoman Empire, Russia Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and add some Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth to the mix
Now that everything is pretty much calm, we can enjoy the nature, as we're pretty well placed having access to lots of mountains, the Black Sea, the Danube Delta and so on
We have resources, we need the right people and we should be doing better and better
Russia's sphere of influence is a bit too close for confort though, that would be the worst thing
I mean, it's something
Our neighbors are not THAT bad, we have almost all types of terrain, bunch of rivers, pretty nice lakes and much more
As far as position in the continent goes, we kind of tend to be forgotten sometimes
We're a bit left out I think
Shitty, everyone and their mom came here basically
I think only Poland has a worse situation than us since they don't even have some decent mountains to hold back invasions
I always felt like we are in the wrong position
Just look at the language
Northwest: Hungarian Empire
Northeast: Russian Empire (and everybody else to conquer Ukraine and Basarabia)
South: Ottoman Empire
Yep, perfect
This has in no way ever hurt us throughout our history, not even once
We have a pretty meh relationship with our neighbors to be honest, as in we neither hate, nor love, we're just chill
Things get a bit hot every once in a while with Hungary, but other than that we're pretty chill
Somehow that makes me feel worse
Romanian here, moved to Germany for university 5 years ago, currently doing a PhD in Belgium with no intention of ever moving back
Like others have said, it's a matter of feeling like where I was born wasn't where I was meant to be
Romania felt in many ways small
small minded people, few opportunities  for what I knew I wanted to do (research/academia), large scars left by communism that I do not have the patience or will to deal with
It felt as if I would have wasted my life away if I had stayed and I wasn't particularly attached to any family or friends to compel me to stay
Being gay was also a huge factor cause I wanted to be able to live a happy and honest life with myself and those around me and Eastern Europe doesn't really allow for that
I love your profile pic
Same here
I moved from Romania to the UK when I was 13
Next year I will take my A-levels so I can move to Romania and pursue my dream to become a pilot
Really miss my hometown, Bucharest
You have a lot of courage
"A face treaba mare" - "To do the big job" or something like this
We also have the little job when we pee
One that is subtle I use is "Ma trece".A good translation might be "It struggles",since "It passes" does not make a lot of sense
What does a Saxon accent sound like to be different from a regular German one
If you can explain to somebody who doesn’t speak the language
La cagata della giornata
It reminds me of how Texans speak English in movies
Definitely
Dacia was the most 'successful' model, followed by the Lada 1200 and Skoda 120
Trabant trailed them at a distance :)
Back in the days: Of course it was, we were part of the Eastern Bloc, after all
Today: very rare, you might see them at retroparades, or being driven by some Moldovan visitors (I live near the border)
Moskvitch would like a word
Anyway
The Lada was meh, I don’t remember it being too appreciated, the real prize was the rear engine Skoda
The Niva 4x4 was a very rare sight, and we already had our ARO (same rust levels) which did the trick quite well
Not only Moskvitch, there were also Volgas and others, but I think that was the holy trinity until 1982/83 when Oltcit started to get traction
Oh yes
The Volga’s! Tanks on wheels, chugging petrol like a Kamaz truck
Then the Oltcit suddenly appeared, a fancy sporty car (for the time) that would get its distributor wet in any puddle, fun times
I woul take some rakija if you dont mind
Wth
who does this

1984 vibes

Simplu
The Goat with 3 kids
Widow Mother Goat goes out to get food, leaving her kids alone at home
>!The Wolf, who is also their godfather for some reason, eats two of them
As a revenge, the mother burns him to death
Honestly, so many dark stories
I remember I loved reading the disney stories books
Except they weren't the disney versions, but the original ones
I had huge books full of these stories, illustrated for children
I remember loving it and reading them before bed
Lol
Also tons of other older Romanian books with stories for children that were very dark
I remember one of my favorites was one about some kid that was converted into some sculpture by a fountain
I don't remember much more but I just know I loved it
It was depressing
Also, remember loving one about a poor child that tried to make some money by selling matches and if I remember correctly her father
Would always treat her like shit and only use her to get some money and she would stare through the window at happy families into their houses and I remember it broke my heart every time I read it
And so many more
I hate that these types of stories are frowned upon now
They're so good
I will 100% make my kids read them lol
Also, so many songs that I got taught I Romania or poems that were dark and meant to scare children into behaving well or being aware of stranger danger lol
Idk, I see kids nowadays doing some stuff that me, my colleagues, and my childhood friends couldn't even grasp when we were their age
So, anything that was dark then seems just meh today
Edit: oh, wait, I didn't read beyond the title
You were not talking about irl stories, my bad
Well, the little mermaid was dark (the original story by Andersen)
She traded her status to chase a guy who friendzoned her
Then she was given the choice to kill the guy to save her own life, but she chose not to (it's basically kill or commit suicide)
But I guess kids nowadays read it to, so maybe is not too dark
Lol
Also, the 2 kids actually die, unlike some other tales where they just get swallowed whole and are saved later
Plus, he cuts their heads and puts them on the window sill so the mother can see them and hurry inside thinking that they are waiting for her
As a kid I never truly realized how fucked up this story was
This sounds very tame Imo hahah
Yeah same for us, I don't think anyone ever associated it with skin color
In the Romanian story, she asks them to only open the door if they hear her sing
>!The Wolf changes his voice to trick them
The middle one always gets, he blows his cover by saying "Bless you
" when the wolf sneezes
And he also splatters the walls with their blood
There are similarities
>!In the Romanian version, there's only 3 kids
The wolf fixes his voice by having his teeth and tongue sharpened, not with honey
>!He actually decapitates the two older kids, and leaves their heads by the window so the mother thinks they are waiting for her
>!The goat makes him fall into a pit and he burns to death
>!The story ends with the goat and her friends having a party
Yeah
Why do I feel like I heard/read different variants of this story lol
That's the version I remember too tbh
You probably were told this story when you were young
It's written by Ion Creangă (or John Branch if you feel like over-translations), and in this thread I learned it's probably inspired by the German one
I would imagine there are other versions as well
If he hadn't lost while running for President, [this dude] surely would have won
Imagine a battle between two immortal beings
In the left corner the queen
And in the right corner putin
It shall not happen
I'm going to hell for this, but women will start crying and demand the rest don't hit them  because of their gender
Almost kissing people on the lips because in your country you start from the other cheek
(Romanian in Austria and France)
I had a lot of misunderstandings because of what I consider to be manners and red flags
For instance, we have a German guy in our group that constantly talks about others behind their back
He will eventually say those things to their face, but never as harshly as he did
This for me and for my other eastern friends is a big red flag
But for southern Europeans and other Germans not so much
That sounds rude as hell, wtf
And it's one sure way for people to seek to avoid your company
>These people are not liked in Germany as well, maybe the defenders were just polite
The defenders would say: but the person finds out what he said/was told eventually
Which was true
And he wasn't a lying backstabber per se, more like a gossiping bitch
But I felt like that completely broke the trust I had in these people
All of them
>Germans are usually very frank
This is one think I actually really appreciate in my other German friends
Although I had to tell myself repeatedly that they don't mean harm as very sincere people are sometimes seen as rude in Romania
I definitely fucking avoided them after seeing their true colors
Yes and no
There are things that I like better in western Europe
Things that make me more comfortable with who I've become
Notions and ideas that helped me evolve into a happier person
And I'll ever be able to go home and be the same person again
I also feel the need to ask for those things from my peers at home too
There will also always be a part of me that will not fit anywhere except in Romania
But I've found that Ro is not the only place the peasant in me fits in
That part of me that gets homesick is pretty much satisfied by my eastern European friends
They were brought up in similar conditions and left their countries for similar reasons and now they've evolved in similar ways
I'm never gonna fit in somewhere 100%. And that's OK
I do not take part in most of our culture
I dont like speaking my language, I dont find myself enjoying life here
Absolutely
I feel incredibly out of place here and have my whole life
I want to leave first chance I get, not only because the country is a socio political shithole but also because I just don't like being here
Yep
I dislike most of everything mainstream and popular here, and what I oike is deeply unpopular here
Also the mindset here feels very diffrenr from mine (not in a bad way)
Really I don't feel like I belong
It's not that I don't feel like I belong, it's just sad to live here, which makes me think I'd "fit" better somewhere else
Under 18, and i prolly will
The states seem like a nice option to pursue what i want
I live in the capital
Thats worse than small cities imo
Im under 18 anyway so i wouldnt be able to
Prolly gonna study abroad and take a job there
I am not looking for the american dream or whatever, but other countries to me dont seem too appealing or friendly to what i like in terms of laws and whatnot, and personally, while i think my country's beautiful, i dont see what i want to pursue that viable with the current circimstances, especially here
It depends really
Yeah, it's immature, but from time to time and in informal circles is by no means frowned upon
On the contrary it's a bounding mechanism
Peach schnaps, mmmmm
Nope
Have you ever visited the UK/Ireland
This probably goes for most countries, but telephone booths are so rare to see nowadays
Depends on the city
In some areas they are still common (which is very unfortunate)
Yes there are some, made almost exclusively by Baptists
I've seen one that had some Bible quotes (can't recall if there were more) but stuff like "Hell is real".... idk
It's funny that even if 95% of the population is Christian here, I rarely saw this kind of billboards
And even those were quite neutral
I’ve saw some of them on the highway but not much elsewhere
Someone else from Ro commented that there are some in the west of Ro
In my part of the country I've never seen anything like that
It would be super weird to see something like that, tbh
And how does he get the money to pay for them
Does God have a job, an inheritance
Or does he use his magical power to put them up
Where have you seen them ? I havent seen anyone
I can confirm it, saw them in the north of Romania (Suceava & Botoșani)
They are along the lines of „You haven't read any book if you haven't read the bible”. Made by Baptists or other Protestant groups
Haven't seen Orthodox billboards tho
seen none in buch
Wow, I haven't seen any
I’ve seen a few going in and out the city with texts like “Iisus te iubeste” (Jesus loves you)
In Bihor there are lots of them
Usually you can see a few at the entrences of cities
Timisoara and Cluj-Napoca have them from what I've seen
I think Timisoara also used to have one north of the city centre squares - not sure if it's there anymore
I am from Suceava, so you are spot on :D
Well, lucky you
There are a few, mostly as you drive out of the city
Edit: I found [some] [photos] They are all linked to  According to [this blog] the first one is on Centura and was paid for by the blog owner (who seems to be a Baptist pastor)
I am from Bihor and I haven't seen any :(
On Centura Oradea there are a few
I read the Italian labels on products when there aren't any available in English/French/Ro
I haven't died yet because of this, so I guess I'm doing OK
French or Italian, both have a simmilar vocabulary to Romanian and simmilar grammar (looking at French)
The issue is Romanian is a phonetic language, so everything is read out as it is written, unlike other Latin languages (looking at French, again)
If we only take into account the amount of understood words, I’d say French is more understandable than Italian, but I feel like communication in Italian is easier for someone with no prior knowledge, whereas French is kind of a pain, from a Romanian perspective, ofc
Well I'm kinda biased because I actually studied Spanish and we had French in school
But Italian, Spanish and some French
Italian is super similar and you really don't need to know it to understand the instructions on a product or ingredients on a label, etc
Because I speak some Spanish, Portuguese is quite easy to understand as well, it's like Spanish with a weird accent
Also heard quite a few words we have in Romanian
French is the hardest
I can usually understand the general idea of a text but it's hard to really comprehend something
When I see German written I feel like: ok fairly similar to English
When someone speaks German: Dafuq is this
I heard English and Dutch are pretty similar aswell
Did it take long for you to learn it
Oh that’s cool, English is probably the closest language to Dutch
Though Dutch might be closer to German
Some say Dutch is like a mixture of English and German
Alcoholism, barbecues, complaining
I just don't see Romania without these
Staying close to the family
Back during communism families would have about 5 children each so yeah
.  That's a lotta people going back to see mama and with children of their own
The food and alcohol, they are so good, that no one will ever want to replace them
I think that's true for us too
Plus homemade sausages and the like, they are the best
My girlfriend is polish and keeps saying Romania is like a slavic remix of ancient Rome
I was going to this year but the pandemic said no
Maybe next year
Do you guys have pituști
(I saw it written as pituski too) They are like red, flat meatballs made from very spicy/hot meat and you grill them
I love those so much
Mititei or Mici (both romanian words meaning "little ones" / "small ones") is a dish from Romanian cuisine, consisting of grilled ground meat rolls in cylindrical shape made from a mixture of beef, lamb and pork with spices, such as garlic, black pepper, thyme, coriander, anise, savory, and sometimes a touch of paprika
Sodium bicarbonate and broth or water are also added to the mixture
Served with mustard or salt, and a cold cold beer
Shawarma, basically a kebab thing with fries, lettuce, pickles and many condiments
(Mustard, Ketchup, Garlic sauce etc
Also, our Bagels and stuffed corns are to die for
LUCA, MATEI, PAUL, the best bagel and stuffed corns (mostly with cheese and ham) producers
And they are also pretty cheap
We have them in many flavours
Also, pizza is very popular, and most Romanians think we make better pizza than italians
I'd like to add that the reason they are pretty unique is that the sodium bicarbonate gives them an interesting texture that makes them like a fluffy and kinda gummy delicious meat cylinders
Is like eating a tender, meaty marshmallow
> and sometimes a touch of paprika
Blasphemy
I love langos
Exactly
Also, I think we should mention bagels
They are so many types and so good
It looks like there's a lot more vegetables mixed in with the meat and it mixes well with curry as well apparently, I doubt our dish would taste good that way
Also, in the pictures some of the *kofta* was spherical, you could get the death penalty in Romania for doing that to our *mici*
Kofta are a type of kebab, ours are not,but too add a good chunk of romanian cuisine is inspired by the turkish cuisine
Yes
We have tough ones, soft ones, with poppy seeds, with sesame seeds, with sunflower seeds, with sea salt, with all four, we have sweet ones filled with jams, chocolate, pudding or all three, we have thin pretzels, thick pretzels, pretzels with coconut and honey, pretzels with walnuts and sugar syrop (mucenici), pretzles with just honey, round pretzels, traditional shaped pretzels, swirly pretzels, pretzels with pretzels etc
God damn we love our pretzels
They're dirt cheap too
Luca, Paul, Matei, va invoc
The qofte basically just a meatball
The thing that makes the mici different from qofte is the bicarbonate sodium, it gives them a different taste and feeling (the mici are a lot softer)
From Wikipedia : "In 2013, with new European Union regulations regarding food additives coming to effect, there was a fear that mici producers will be forced to stop using sodium bicarbonate (E500) an important part of the recipe
" Romania protested because "According to producers, removing the bicarbonate sodium from mici would leave the dish unrecognizable, nothing more than a meatball

Will do
Having one, not sure, but it's kinda weird displaying it
Only public buildings usually do that
(TL;DR at the end)
From my point if view, I don't think it is weird to own a flag of the country
I am living far away from Romania and when I go home I take my flag with me because I go back to Bucharest near the date of the  National Day of Romanian Flag
Now, call me weird or whatever, I am here to answer because I feel like this question suits me the most
Last year, I arrived a day before the Flag Day and I decided to march from my house to the "Tricolour's Square" in Bucharest where there was a ceremony and there is a huge Romanian Flag, all by foot and the distance is pretty big but I was enjoying it
As I was walking with my flag (I have to specify it was not a small flag made out of paper, it was like one of these flags you see outside official buildings) I had people reacting to the flag and asking me questions
To my surprise, no one opposed to the actions, in fact I had a lady asking me if she can take a picture with the flag
Someone even came to ask me why I have a flag , I told them because I was not expecting every Romanian to know when the flag day is
I had policemen wave at me
A group of Turkish people asked if they could borrow the flag for a photo in front of the ex-Royal Palace, now Art Museum
I don't know if that really answered the question but what I am trying to say is, even if it might be weird, people would still be curious and some of them might even join but they will never boo you or think you are racist or anything like that
How would I have reacted if I saw someone do the same thing
Well probably the same as the other people to be honnest
TL;DR : It is not weird to have one, might raise curiosity if you display it
It's not weird in Romania to have a Romanian flag
on the 1st of December (national day) everybody puts their flag out the window so as we have a lot of communist buildings all together when you walk down the street you would see walls of flags and only flags
quite beautiful
it's kinda odd seeing a flag on someone's house, not alot of people fly it, you sometimes see them in rural areas, but not so much in urban ones
except if its the 1st of december, then its pretty normal
I have seen houses in rural areas that have one on display, but it's not that common
I think it's fairly common displaying one on the 1st of December and 1st of May, I always see lots of them in people's windows or on cars
This is such an underrated joke
I think it is [this] photo
This has been taken in 1987, showing how we moved an entire block of flats with people still being inside
It was moved to make space for a boulevard
The building had a weight of 7600 tons and still exists today
the union of 1918
I feel everyone knows this one:
Biggest empire to ever exist is now represented by this guy
Who do you think is rolling in their grave right now
I would've said the portrait of young Mihai Eminescu (our national poet, for anyone not aware - shoved down our throats from 1st to 12th grade), because that's in every single school book, paper and whatnot
However, going on wiki I learned that it was [taken in Prague, by a photographer named Jan Thomas] Foiled again
[This one] of a young man taken during 1989 revolution is quite known also
Fuck
This is quite recent history
'The relocation operation took place on May 27, 1987, and the process was more complex, consisting of splitting the block in two and moving diagonally through translation of both sections, on an inclined axis of 33 degrees, 50 minutes and 40 seconds'

There's a [statue] of the woman
U mean [this one
You should use him to generate power
The "used to be" was implied :P. And represented here in this thread, not in general
Whoa
Where is this
I think it's in Varberg, Sweden
Corruption
We can’t have poper healthcare, roads, infrastructure etc
Lots of incompetents, usually from the ruling party, in charge of everything
Wow, you guys in commentaries have really "first world problems".
The rate this is improving at is proportional to the rate of population replacement, sadly
Some people just don't see a problem with corruption
Romania likes this, Romanians dislike this
Same here
But I would say it's the worst in the public sector and smaller companies
I feel like in big companies this is not as bad
Romania has 19 million people, and I don’t think we ever “made ourselves heard”.
>Some people just don't see a problem with corruption
Because it's inside us since long, long time ago
We have normalized bribery (doctor, teacher) and the classical saying "he stole, but he also built".
This nation is uncurable
It’s more at the middle towards the top
It’s getting better anyway, I don’t think you can bribe police now
While I agree that things are dire, I don't necessarily share your pessimism, and I don't think it's very productive
But I understand that it may be frustrating if you've been battling it your whole life
I've had my share of frustrations and moments when I wanted to forget about the whole place
I don't think attitudes are not changing at all, just that they're changing very slowly
But even looking at how stuff was 10 years ago, the level of awareness around corruption is much higher, and way more people think it's not acceptable
And we have better mechanisms to enforce it and fewer incentives to be corrupt (for example if doctors are paid ok, which now they are, they don't need to be corrupt to afford food and housing)
Maybe in large part because of some diffusion of ideas with people working (not stealing wallets) abroad
Are we at a mentality comparable to western nations
Will we be there in 5 years
Clearly not
But will we *ever* get there
Yes, possibly
I pay 6€ for 30GB, with 2,8GB available in roaming
Ah, and basically unlimited minutes in all networks
For some reason, the most vivid reminder for me was when i was walking in front of the old communist party HQ in Bucharest
I remembered a picture from December 1989 with tanks in the street, people holding rifles, and the University Library next door half burned down
And this was not ages ago, my parents were around to remember that
The war in Transnistria as well, I have a friend whose dad was a war correspondent there
We profited off helping the NATO campaign in Serbia for a fast track to the EU and NATO, supported by the British
I don't say this proudly at all, but it's what happened, and it happened during my lifetime too
I've met people with VERY strong opinions about that
These events, just like the world wars, shape every aspect of where we live and who we are, the language we speak, where we go on holiday or to work and study, who our friends are
Of course it's otherworldly to think of the cities and towns you know laying in ruin, but the fact of war itself is not
I agree with you but the last european war happened in the 90's
You know, I can't really tell
As I said, some people have very strong opinions, but on both sides
Some say it was a smart move to provide a base for NATO, because they supported our EU membership
Others say it was a betrayal or our neighbours and that Serbs had a historic right over the lands they were fighting to preserve
I suspect it would tip in favour of the first, but I don't have any data to support it
Personally, I think EU and NATO membership are all good, and support people's right to self-determine (always - be it Bosnia in the 90s or Catalonia and Scotland today), but wish the cost would not have been a bloody war
NATO even failed to stop some of the worst bloodshed and civilian casualties as far as I know
We have quite a few old units but none of them are in use anymore\*. Most of them live on through literature and popular sayings
Here's a few examples:
*verstă* (comes from Russian) = roughly 1 km
*funie* = roughly 27 km
*stânjen* (from Latin word *stadium*) = 2,23 m
*palmă* (the distance between the fully extended thumb and pinky)
*șchioapă* (the distance between the fully extended tumb and forefinger)
*deget* (width of a finger) - some people still use this one
*pogon/iugăr* (from the Ancient Roman unit *jugerum*) = roughly 6440 sq meters
*vadră* = approx 15 liters
*oca* (entered Romania through Byzantine influence) = 1,5 liters
Up until the Union in 1859 between Moldova and Muntenia, these units were used in both areas but had slightly different sizes (the ones I mentioned above are the metric equivalents of the Moldavian units)
Alexandru Ioan Cuza passed a law that attempted to standardize these units and bring them closer to the European metric system
There is a popular story of him going in town under disguise and busting the shady vendors that were using a smaller size *oca* than the official one
Therefore we have the saying ”*a umbla cu ocaua mică”* (not very widely used though) = to lie or cheat
Edit: \*correction, seems like they're still alive and well :D
Pogon  .
It's use for measuring areas
It's around half a hectare (a hectare is 10,000 square meters for my american friends) .
Its exact measurment varies because it was mostly used to determine land proprieties like forests and agral land, so an exact measure was never really neded as a few meters never bothered anyone
One modern calculation puts it at around 5011 square meters
Romania has something called "prăjină" which has many meanings, but used in agriculture it is the equivalent of aproximately 25 square meters
(25
293 to be exact)
There are two that come to my mind now
The first is "litră" . Nowadays is used only by some old people
It is used to measure mass or volume
It is defined as being 250 ml/a quarter of a liter when measuring volume and 250 mg/a quarter of a kg when using to measure mass
"Arul" is the second one
It's used to measure surface when talking about farming/agricultural land by people in rural areas
It is equal to 100 square meters
There are others but these are the only ones still used, at least by people from where I grew up
Many people in Northern Dambovita still use Pogon/Prajina to measure their properties
I think the Pogon is only around 5000 square meters, but apart from that yeah that's about right
Since it was used for forests and large fields, exact precise numbers varied, as a few meters didn't bother anyone
The only exact measure I've seen for one is 5011
7 meters
My pet stone is 9 kilograms don't make fun of its weight you asshole
That's right
I took most info from [here] and the metric equivalent is pretty rough and varies from region to region apparently
And some famous guy in literature also used to think that a few meters of land didn't matter :P
The Colosseum, the Parthenon and the walls of Constantinople for sure
Maybe the Red Square
For natural wonders, Danube Delta and Mont Blanc
Versailles
El Escorial
Sagrada Família
Seville Cathedral
Mount Athos
Palace of the Parliament (Bucharest)
Ciorba (a type of soup)
When I was a kid I hated it and now is my go to meal
It's incredibly easy to make, it has a shitton of variaties, is very tasty, very filling and it can also became a comfort food
I've heard that a big problem with Irish is that the Latin alphabet really doesn't work well with it
Is there any alternative
Any bagel place
We don't have any as far as I know and I'm really curious about what a bagel tastes like
Not here
The most common word is still just "mail" or "e-mail".
Yahoo
Mail is still the most popular in Romania
We commonly use "mail", since mail is called "poștă" in Romanian, so when you say "mail" it defaults to email
Everybody I know uses the word gmail and not mail ok they use both but rarely mail
I think it's an European thing
I mean, in Romanian snail mail is poștă. So the word "mail" as it is in English didn't previously exist in our language
But it does now and it's the short from email
Because you know, it's such a terribly long word
You are the first person I hear that uses gmail for generic e-mai instead of those 2 I mentioned
Do you say I sent you a gmail on your yahoo mail address
Where does this happen
I mean in conversations i use gmail when its not about other mail sites
Hungary
Turkey
Russia
France
And Bulgaria or Greece
(this is if we don't count Moldova)
Turkey
Hungary
Austria
France
Russia
France did not really have that much of an impact on our history politically or even culturally until the end of the XIXth and the XXth century, but Romania has this crush on France and you'll certainly learn at least about the Revolution, Napoleon and his wars, WWI, WWII and everything after WWII
Most probably when learning about the Middle Ages France will pop up as well
The Ottoman Empire (Turkey)
Hungary
Russia
Austria
France
All the countries are looking at one another saying Germany
Ottoman Empire
Austro-Hungarian Empire
Moldova
Russia Empire
Germany, France
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
Moldova (being part of a medieval Romanian state for so long, then coming back into the country after WW1)
Hungary
Russia
Poland
I'm shocked that we are not mentioned in your list
I'd say Russia (USSR)>Turkey(Ottomans)>Hungary(Austro-Hungary)
I'm from Transylvania and it is probably true that we talk more about Hungary in general
In my himetown for example Targu Mures (Marosvasarhelyi) mostly everything has mixed history and you learn all sorts of stuff day to day (at school is sort of a "standard package if you will)
From ehat I can remember we learn some facts about everyone at school ,but in highschool at least for me was like 60 40 hungary and turkey respectively(besides romanian history ofc)
I'd say we learn more about Turkey since we were their vassal states for most of our history
Maybe people in Transylvania talk more about Hungary/Austria since they were occupied by them for most of their history
No, I think these 3 countries are presented equally, depending on the historical period
It’s a regional thing
Where I live there are a lot of Hungarian people, and we talk a lot about Hungary, though in the east and south it’s different
Where I live we had schools with Hungarian classes in them, meaning for each year between 1-8 there were 2 or 3 romanian classes and one hungarian, each with about 28-30 students
Under those years the hungarian section had a bunch more extra lessons, like hungarian literature, hungarian grammar, hungarian history, besides the more general ones
So our class had both a hungarian history and a romanian one, and each of them kind of told different stories
Between years 8-12 I went to a completely hungarian school
There we only had one history class, and it glassed over history though a hungary scentric view imho
Just ban EA games, problem solved
No, because we wouldn't have access to any game developed by the Americans
Ban lootboxes from games made in the EU
Hell yeah
How do you guys envision Europe in 100 years from now
From different perspectives: culture, politics, economy, demographics
I think there will be steady progress
I don't think EU will fall apart and I think it is very very unlikely another war will start inside the union
As long as extremist political parties are not becoming more powerful
EU will probably try to have good relations with US and China and will prosper on its own
I only wish we had more respect and empathy for one another
Maybe East Europeans will not be seen as second-class citizens anymore
maybe
The Might Union of Greater Romania will be at power once again influencing politics in the Balkans and Eastern Europe
Although I see Romania becoming a more developed country in the future with declining birth rates
Moldova will cease to exist and so will many smol nations
Hopefully the EU will no longer exist by that time
Omg same I clicked so fast bc of that lol
At least it's not fungus
I too want to see this future
Hopefully, your prophecy is the real deal
Is there a good reason for not wanting a federal EU
Don't know, I find very little reason to travel right now
I can interact with people from most of the world in my city and also eat their food
Cultures are already very similar in most of the world where there is no major crisis happening right now
Seeing random decorated walls and buildings is not something that I would spend thousands of Euros on, so the only real reason to travel is to enjoy nature
A federalized EU would be able to protect the natural wonders that we have much better and would allow for a more optimized way to spend the money you say "is being thrown away".
I also don't agree with the fact that the money is thrown away (although, it could use an optimized process and less bureaucracy)
My country is a prime example, the growth we've seen during the last decade due to EU funding is unimaginable and has a lot of positive effects on the EU as a whole
We supply a lot of the human resources that other countries cannot, due to an aged population, so much so that it is becoming a problem internally
I don’t know if you got the reference
Do you have a source for that
Or at least some sort of arguments on how it does that
This sounds like fearmongering and doesn't really make much sense
I see what you mean, we used to have those unions too and I heard they were beneficial to some extent
I think we still do have them but few people know they even exist
Still, I think that's something you guys can easily adapt to, if lawmakers wanted to
Moreover, why would the Scandinavian model not work everywhere else
I would like to see an EU where that model is implemented at a large scale, as it is the best one we (humanity) have so far
A federalized EU would be able to impose it much quicker
EU wide minimum wage is a lower threshold which would prevent member countries from going below a certain amount
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I never saw anything about not being allowed to have a higher minimum wage
There is no logical reason for the EU to drag member countries (or any countries for that matter) down
On the other hand, a federalized EU would allow a somehow coherent fiscal law, which would help it develop much quicker from an economical point of view
This would most likely stop all the companies from moving their HQ to the US and will boost the innovation market enormously
Is there EU regulations or reasons that I am not aware of for making unionization mandatory
Or any other way to counteract the effects you were talking about
I am sure it works right now because of the higher degree of education among the citizens, but I doubt that any Scandinavian country could survive long term without adjusting the model and make it work regardless of that factor
We can't implement anything like that here yet because the worker unions have been smeared in the media almost into nonexistence because the miner union decided to attack the capital in the '90s when the government decided to close the state owned coal mines
People still have a bad reaction when they hear about them
Nordic countries have the opportunity to experiment and adjust the model and make it more future-proof rather than try to slow down progress for the sake of keeping the old one running
Maybe I'm to dumb to understand the reason behind your view, but am always open to ideas
I am really interested in the subject of a federal EU and I know I might be biased because my country would benefit from it a lot
One other thing I wanted to point out
If there was an EU wide minimum wage, people might not leave for other countries because they can't make a living (of course with the condition that the minimum wage allows for a decent life)
The only people who would be moving would be for higher paying jobs or studying
I would even vote to implement a UBI system sooner than we'll need it
Automation technology is evolving at a rapid pace and lots of workers simply won't be needed in the next 1-2 decades
I was not aware of that regulation, thanks for bringing it to my attention
2 things I want to address though
First one is that fiscal experimentation in our country could lead to actual death caused by poverty
Our politicians are still, in large percentages, very limited in terms of mental capacity
I wouldn't trust most of them to be able to read and understand a text longer than 1-2 pages, let alone make experiments
That, and we don't have anything to experiment on
Mentioning worker unions is political suicide and no Romanian politician would touch them (see Mineriada if you want to learn more about why that is)
Scandinavians are electing better politicians who would be able to successfully improve the model
The only way we could ever have strong unions, is if they are forced on us by the EU
Secondly, I don't think being ok with the status quo is something any country (or individual) should do
There is always room for improvement
Again, I am aware that I might be biased about it and not get the full picture
Still, hearing anti EU arguments which are also logical is a breath of fresh air
I think we had many through the years, many random people end up in a meme because of the stupid things they said
just to name a few that pop in my head right now:
-  "capitala angliei meme" (literally translated as "the capital of UK meme" this poor girl got asked this question during a prom contest and she said Russia )
- " ce'i fa asta meme" (literally "what is this meme" a random guy on an obscure Romanian tv show saying this to his wife, the true flavor of this meme cannot be explained)
- "Cristi meme" (it started with this drunk guy being "attacked" by a dog, he keeps calling for Cristi who is the owner of the dog
Also, our politicians do so many stupid things, most of them become a meme sooner or later
Vadim Tudor is a never ending meme, although this man has been dead for years
I got 4 Moomins key rings left after I went to the Moomin Museum
(I bought 12 of them, but the rest I gave to friends)
Moomins rock
\m/
How about the "nu apă" (no water) meme
I think we had many memorable memes, seriously we could make a long list of them, I just posted the first that came to mind
also: "lasă-ma sa îmi beau apa minerala" ( "let me drink my sparkling water" (a drunk guy trying to tell a reporter about the fire that started at the bar he was at)
idk why but we seem to find humor is the dumbest shit
And the Viorica Dăncilă memes are still alive
You forgot Codrin , the living meme :))
Ce facem alexandru
(What are we doing alexander)
Inoata chelutu( its a dog swimming and its pretty trash)
Also
Stefan de la craiova(Stephen from Craiova, its a ghetto singer that is and was pretty trash)
Sister country, Moldova
Otherwise
hard to say
Probably Serbia is also a good bro
Bulgaria might be as well a candidate since we joined the EU
Hungary is that sibling that we like to pretend it’s adopted and we have nothing in common with, but we are way more similar than we imagine
Moldova is our little sisters
She is not the smartest but she is cute, though her boyfriend is quite aggressive
Those drunken chaps across the Prut river, the Moldovans
Moldova,same flag,same language
It was historically part of Romania
Some would say Moldova
But that's just like Deadpool's arm surviving after being cut and growing into a separate Deadpool
I would say Bulgaria
Romanians and Bulgarians are basically the same, just speak different languages
Like brothers, we fight all the time, for the stupidest reasons, but we also do everything together
Definetly Moldova,they speak exactly the same bar a few borrowing from Russian and they have a simil culture to ours
And I would also include Italy
This is so wholesome to read I love it
What if Lichtenstein decides to invade Switzerland
Statistically, they are the strongest military in the World, having negative war casualties (80 people once went to war
81 returned)
Bulgaria is like a brother in suffering
We weren't born brothers, we didn't intend to become, but we traveled the same road together and we'll probably get wasted together
I remember hearing this somewhere: "Romanians fought every neighbour they ever had except Serbia and the Black Sea"
You can be ours, we buy cheap liquor from you so I don't see the problem
>weren't born brothers
The Second Bulgarian Empire was sometimes called "The Wallachian-Bulgarian Empire" and at one point even spread to the North of Moldova
We and Bulgarians go way back
Further than either one wants to admit
Well, France used to be our momma up until WW2 too
We are indeed a difficult to understand bunch of people
They also hold half of Bukovina, and they force Romanian kids to go to Ukrainian-only schools
I was thinking Russia because it was in URSS
That you know of
They're planning the invasion in secret
And after
I consider France as being one of Romania's best friends
Yea but
Cheap liquor, you know
Russia is more like her aggressive pimp
Romanians call it "The Romanian-Bulgarian Empire", which is wrong because the term "Romanian" is relatively recent
"Romanian-Bulgarian" was coined by Romanian nationalists to suggest that Vlachs had a bigger influence in the Empire than they probably had
Similarly, I assume Bulgarian nationalism pushes for the name "Second Bulgarian Empire" to suggest Vlachs were not involved at all
The truth is probably somewhere in the middle
From what I gather, Vlachs and Bulgarians coexisted for centuries
Even from the Bulgarian Wikipedia (which I assume is bias towards Bulgarian narrative, same as Romanian is) mentions that the revolt that lead to the creation of the second Bulgarian Empire had Vlachs (from North of the Danube) involved
The degree Vlachs had any influence in the empire is a subject for historians to decide, hopefully without nationalistic bias
For the first few years, it seems to have been referred to as "Wallachian-Bulgarian", most notably by the Pope
Also, Arab chronicles called it just "al-Awalak" (Wallachia)
So there were people other than Romanians that called it that
In modern times, I agree it should be called just "Bulgarian", since it was definitely mostly Bulgarian
Afterwards we had an abusive dad (Russia) :( now we are in foster care with the US
I don't know how to break it to you, but I don't think they see it in the same way
Neither do us to be honest
You can have cheap liquor without ethnic cleansing
Obviously I wouldn't expect all of France to now go crazy and get out with Romanian flags and celebrate Romanian values but there are definitely people in France who appreciate Romanian culture
There are some who don't and there are some who don't even know where Romania is
I think the same thing applies to Romania
After all, there are many historical facts that bonds these 2 together, so even if it might not be very present through people today, they are very good friends looking back at all the stuff that happened
The Little Entente, the CFRNA, France-Romania Season etc
But what about the Ukrainian kids in Romania
Do we have any Ukrainian schools
It is if you don't allow them to also learn in their own language
>foreign language
That's the problem
A family who settled in Cernăuți (Чернівці́) before 1775 would have had to speak Romanian, since they were in Moldova
Then, they were suddenly part of Austria
Fast-forward to 1918, and the region became part of Romania
In 1940, for no reason, Stalin occupied Northern Bukovina and makes it part of Ukraine
Without moving again, that family lived in 5 countries, having to learn 4 different languages just because "YoU shOUlD LeaRN the LAnGuaGE oF ThE counTrY whERe yOu LiVe
Considering there are still villages with Romanian majority, after 70 years, I seriously doubt ethnicity played any part in Stalin's decision
It may have been more like:
Stalin: "OK, we tricked Romanians into giving us this random region
How should we sell it
Stalin advisor: "There are a few more Ukrainians there
We can claim that's the reason"
Stalin: "Brilliant
Advisor: "But the border doesn't match exactly
Stalin: "Now you have to commit suicide
Do you need any help
That WikiPedia line references an article that has nothing to do with the 1930 census, and is instead talking about the 2001 Ukrainian census, with some references to events from the 1990s.
That being said, it could be true for all I know
The more important question is: If Stalin cared about ethnicity, why did he leave villages with Romanian majority North of the border, and Ukrainian majority to the South
Why not also take parts from Maramureș (Мармарощина), where there are even more Ukrainians
And I am telling you ethnicity played no part in that
Otherwise, the border would match the ethnic composition and would definitely not include the Herța region which was always part of Moldova and even now has 91
5% Romanian population (According to [Ukrainian Wikipedia] and 2
3% Moldavian
You're basing your argument on the actions of someone you call a madman
Spaniola nu o știu foarte bine dar ce pot sa zic e ca am înțeles în proporții de 70-75% din ce ai zis
Pentru mine, cea mai dificil de inteles limbă e catalana
Pare o combinație de franceză si spaniolă. Creierul meu nu pare a intelege ca e o limbă diferită. Spaniola am învățat-o de la telenovele, pare cea mai ușoară de învățat, deși  majoritatea zic ca românii înțeleg cel mai bine italiana
Hmmmmmmmm
Eu nu cred că o persoană care vorbește franceza/spaniola/italiana va putea să mă înțeleagă.
(I bend the phrase a little bit there, hopefully it's more understandable)
În primul rând, sunt mai idiot așa că probabil alții au înțeles mai mult ca mine, dar m-am prins de ideea generală. Aș zice undeva pe la 50-60%. Din franceză înțeleg mai mult de obicei
Interesant experiment totuși!
în română pot înțelege aproximativ 70% din italiană și spaniolă, fără să le fi studiat
franceza o pricep cam 20% pentru că avem cuvinte împrumutate de la francezi, dar portugheza nu o înțeleg aproape deloc
Vai de capul meu
Noi Românii suntem destul de diferiți de restul lumii vorbitoare de limbi Romantice (?) Influențele slavice si cele turce (?) au afectat foarte mult limba vorbita acum multe veacuri de catre Daco-Romani
În concluzie, nu cred ca voi care veți citi aceasta scrisoare (?) scrisa la 6 dimineața (Italieni, Spanioli, Portughezi, Francezi sau
Catalani
De cand este aia o limba
) veți intelege ce vreau sa zic :D
Am înțeles cam 60% din ce este scris
Româna are un procent mic de latină, acesta fiind 30,33% , mai are 12% latină savantă și multe cuvinte din franceză si italiană.
Bun,probabil că am îndeplinit primul obiectiv, dar la compunere nu știu ce să scriu
Fraternitatea dintre limbiile noastre e cel mai prominent arătată, cel puțin în română, prin folosirea de cuvinte uzuale cum ar fi casă . Româna este cel mai slav latin dintre toți.
Italiana este cea mai ușor de înțeles,după acea Spaniola,Catalana,Portugheza și pe ultimul loc Franceza
Como sé tanto rumano como español y catalán, tengo una gran ventaja en frente a los demás para entender los demás idiomas romance
Entiendo casi perfectamente el portugués y el italiano escrito, y bastante bien hablado
Ya que hay palabras que se me pareceran al rumano, o al catalán o al español
Y me resultará familiar de una manera o otra
El francés es más complicado para mi
Eu am înțeles tot ce ai scris, gen 99% (logrado e singurul cuvânt pentru care n-am traducere), în general 100%. A înțelege limba scrisă e mult mult mai ușor decât limba vorbită.
Stres
Palavre
Voce
Aici m-am pierdut
Eu am înțeles 100%
yeah mostly also because we have slav influence in our language
as we say, Romania and Moldova are a latin island in a slavic sea
Ce mi se pare amuzant e că am inteles aproape tot comentariul tău în spaniolă, în ciuda faptului că româna e greu de înțeles pentru alți vorbitori de limbi romanice
La fel și cu italiana, majoritatea italienilor nu ne prea înțeleg limba datorită influenței slavice, poate si datorita lungii separări de mii de ani de romanța vestică, însă pentru noi italiana este cea mai ușoară limba de înțeles
Înțelegi ce zic
I observed that despite romanian speakers can understand a lot of what's said in another language, the reverse isn't true
For example, I understood 90% of what you said
(I never studied spanish)
Yeah, pretty much :D
Tu ai propus un exercițiu foarte mișto
i speak romanian and i understood everything you said
How did I understand 90% of what you just said
But Hungarian its not Slavic
Aaaaaaah, makes sense now :P
hungary is a boat in the slavic island who wants to join the latin island but it's not allowed
An admirable attempt, but no
"You proposed a cool exercise" :P
Thats quite unexpected
Stealing the bride (taking the bride from the wedding and taking her wherever she wants) and asking for a reward from the groom (most of the time alcohol) to bring her back
Similar, is stealing the bride's shoe then asking for a reward ( most of the time alcohol)
Brides going out of their way to not see any other bride doing their wedding day as it is considered bad luck
Also, at every wedding I've been to people danced the conga line
Is the conga line what we call the penguin dance
the honking thing is also available for funerals from what i've seen
Yep same here
You basically pay for your food and some extra for the bride and groom
Wedding stationery always includes the envelope people are supposed to put the money in
It's not necessary to be before the wedding
Doing this in the middle of the party is funnier
Also, she doesn't need to be searched for
The husband/best man need to pay for the bribe (usually alcohol)
For some reason everyone also always dances to el meneaito
ALWAYS
That is a tradition
Add our emblem to it
I'd say it's a necessity since the flags of Chad and Romania are almost identical
It causes a lot of confusion so something has to be done
Probably some animal symbol on it, like bears or wolves
Or if we're going extreme, the Dacian snake with a wolf head in the colors of the current flag
Someone pls do it
Different emblem, altough the flag itself it's naturally similar since we're the same people
But then it's not really a kingdom is it
Romanian as well and I'm here to say it depends
My friend can't leave her parent's house because they make her pay rent and doesn't have the money to move out
Although, I personally think it comes from abusive relationships, it still happens in our country too, it's just that no one really talks about it
I was waiting for some Northern European countries contributing to this thread, my own impression was that kids there are expected to ‘move out’ or ‘be independent’ by the time they are legally considered adults
A friend that got a two year masters in Sweden was telling me about that, and I always wondered if it was true or not
Interesting, we have the exact same saying in Romania, passing them a glass of water
Sounds very ...sane
In my experience even normal parents have a hard time to resist the temptation to control their kids as they grow up, with the “as long as you’re living under my roof
“ argument, but on the other hand never actually doing something to empower the kid out of said roof :)
Living in Ireland I always thought that the president dogs are national pets
They are very cute and friendly and it's always nice to see how they interact with guests
Sadly one of them died a few weeks ago, and the news broke all the records on Ireland's official reddit page
Our president has 6 cats in his residence in Sibiu, he is a soft cat lover
Italian with a Russian accent seems to be the most popular
Like a Portuguese person speaking italian while drunk on wine
Somehow "romantic", even tho it sounds like butchered russian
Something in between Portuguese, Italian and Russian
And that it sounds interesting
For me, Greek sounds similar to Spanish in terms of accent and flow
The most difficult Latin language out of all of them
I saw people say that it looks like elvish when written lol
Came here to say exactly this
Asked all my foreign friends, I got the exact same description
Eu am auzit ca spaniola cu italiana
I tried to read that out loud and laughed my ass off
I've heard people say it's basically Italian with an russian accent
My german teacher is german
He speaks very nice
But that might be because he speaks slower and clearer to us than he normaly would(we just started b2)
When i went to germany and wanted to speak german people would go full speed until they realised they needed to go a bit slower and clearer so i could understand them
Omg, where is this from
And "omlette du fromage" of course
Intr un fel
I agree with the choking part
Thank you serbia for being our only neighbour country that didnt try to conquer/take something from us
Thanks to Germany for making the best cars
Thanks Austria
And also Hungary
As someone from Transylvania, although the past might have not been the best, because of the Austro-Hungarian rule, I'm thankful because we now have pretty good infrastructure and awesome looking cities
Oradea and Sibiu are great examples
Thank you France
Merci la france
For  [French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)]
In the name of all of the EU, thank you Sweden for Pewdiepie, Minecraft, great music, Paradox games, great scenery overall, IKEA, northern lights, clean cities, the Nobel prize, attractive women, not being at war for over 200 years, Spotify and finally your damn meatballs
Love from Romania
Thank you
uhh Italy for
uhh colonising Dacia in 106
Truthfully speaking Serbia and Bulgaria are our only frenemies
Everyone else bordering us is our outright enemy (bar from Moldova maybe)
From Berlin to Warsaw in one tank
Thank you for joining together the EU
As a linguist, thank you for maintaining your own language (Schwiizertüütsch)
For anyone studying Germanic philology, your language (and definitely not a dialect of Hoch Deutsch as some would like to assume) is always so interesting to hear and read about
I didnt knew about the arad forest tbh but in my city we have a monument for the 224 serbians,croatians and slovenians volunteers who  who died here in ww1
We call it "pyramid of serbian,croatians and slovenians heroes"
The best compliment you would hear from a balkan to a fellow balkan is somethimg like "thx for bot trying to kill me*
Dobrogea/Dobruja and around ww2 you guys get southern side, ofc no hard feelings but we are still salty that the best beaches are there
Well i live there and with all the respect i'm to lazy to learn bulgarian
In my opinion that's the best you can get in this part of the world
Not 100% friends but definitely not enemies either
Kinda like friends with benefits(?)
Yeah tbh even if we take a look at the history you know vlachs and bulgarians had a pretty well relationship during centuries so yeah why let the fact that we fought around 3 wars against each other in the last 100 years tu ruin such a good relationship right
I sometimes do, but that’s really because I don’t want anyone to bother me
People do lock doors but I personally never lock it,I literally don't own keys to my apartment for 6 years now,I have nothing you can steal

I'm in Germany now and all I hear is talk about a potential lock down
Another lock down will not effect my job, but it will keep me away from my family on Christmas
Which sucks, but you know
It is what it is
At the moment
Our explosion of covid cases and the upcoming parliamentary election in december
I could work from home
If the boss would let me
My contract here ends next month and I'm dependent on her for my PhD diploma as well, so I *really* can't afford to upset her
Germany, I think, it's planning a lock down, but not yet
>However, it seems the Dutch are completely retarded when they're young
I think this applies to young people everywhere
And it's infuriating
If I'm not wrong, Babeș-Bolya University or University of Bucharest
In Romania all the good universities from the big cities are the same, then you have the rest
Hardest to get into is definitely the medical university in Bucharest
Also because if you're not super great, like most students, the yearly fee is immense
But I don't know about prestigious
I don't really know a lot of people outside my bubble (art) so I haven't really heard from people who give a shit what uni you went to
Maybe law
The one in Bucharest
Just because it's hard and a lot of students are rich and got in on status
For England: Oxford/Cambridge > Imperial/LSE > UCL/Kings/Warwick/Exeter/Manchester, and then everything below these probably couldn’t be called prestigious
For Romania: UMF (Bucharest) > UPB (Bucharest) > UBB (Cluj) > ASE (Bucharest) > Unibuc (Bucharest)
For social studies I think the most prestigious is the Carlos III in Madrid
Kings, Warwick and Exeter are far better than Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, etc
I'd definitely say PUB
It was always on top of UniBuc in my circles
Plus the campus is awesome
I haven't really heard that many compliments for/about UniBuc
As for the University of Politechnics, however, I've heard many good things (since its also so diverse)
UniBuc has many crazy teachers/lecturers and they're known to have many useless mini courses on each profile
For me all the big important universities from Iasi,Timisoara,Cluj and Bucharest are the sme
I really do not think that there is a big difference between UniBuc and UVT or Medicine from Iasi and Medicine from Cluj
Not so well known but USAMVB it's just amazing imo
Campus is cool, dorm rooms not the best but not the worst, most importantly great proffesors and labs 'n stuff
Manchester and Durham are overrated
As someone who went to a fine arts high school as well as the fine arts university, like 70% of the teachers drink too much lol
The worst were always in sculpture and painting for some reason
Same with Poli though, lots of useless courses because they can't just fire the old farts with outdates courses
Poli sau UT cluj
Care zici ca

Hi, if you
re from Hannover, do you know anything about the Leibniz Uni
Any info about the Elektrotechnik department would be great
Theoretically it
s part of the TU9, but it often gets overshadowed by the bigger guys in discussions about STEM unis I feel like
How does it compare to KIT or Aachen for example
Asking as a prospective student :P
That's awesome, ty for the detailed answer
Do engineers find work in the quantum mechanics department, or are there just mainly phycicists
I don't remember them having an engineering masters directly related to Quantum mechanics
Do you know any other universities that might have a good Elektrotechnik department
I'm interested mainly in smaller ones(not TUM and Aachen
maybe Ruhr Bochum
) but I'll take any information I'll get
Thank you again for replying, you've rekindled my insterest for Hannover and german universities in general
Not necessarily uninteresting, but I have yet to learn more about Bosnia
For me it's Belarus
Don't know why it sounds just like a downgraded version of Russia
And if I want to see a version of Russia, i would rather go the Mother Russia itself
Honestly, I consider Belgium to be a part of France, but I’ve never been there
Hei
Bratislava is cute af
I really liked passing through your country
I think most people will find that Romania and Poland, along with other countries in the area, are quite interesting and different from what Western people are used to
From natural landscapes to city experiences, it's something worth seeing
I've enjoyed London but that's as far as I've been
I'd want to revisit sometime, but I'm afraid visa restrictions would make me double think the effort
True
Moldova is basically an invention of Stalin's. Not that Moldova as a region didn't exist per se, but as a separate identity from Romania
It's a complicated situation nowadays
I agree
Best tea makers in Europe
I guess he means that it depends how much you're into it
If you come from the Netherlands or Hungary where there is nature, but somewhat more limited, seeing the nature in the Nordic countries would be cool and worth the big budget, but if you've already got amazing nature in your country or in cheaper nearby countries, visiting the Nordic countries on that big a budget would mean that you'd have to be pretty into it
Besides Finland maybe, for some it's just not worth the money trouble I guess
I'm just assuming that's what he/she meant
Quick unrelated question: are Norwegians into the whole sunny beach trying to get a tan experience
Like it's something often talked about when planning vacations
No, don't worry
I understood
Yes, I understand that
I said limited nature because the Nordics of course have all sorts of things that we do not have
They have a lot of cool mountains, icy beaches, you can see the northern lights, you can ride with reindeer in the wilderness etc
I didn't mean it as an insult
Sorry if it came out that way
I guess it is a very nice change of scenery for Norwegians
I mean I come from a country that doesn't have light winters, not usually anyway, and not in my opinion, and pretty hot summers, and we still flock to the sea side, whether ours or Greece's. Haha
You do have beaches of course, but it doesn't get as hot and touristy as Spanish, Italian, Greek beaches
I stand corrected
I stupidly thought it was in Lapland
Yes, you're right
Thank you
Just mentioning someone's mother's dead relatives is an insult in Romanian
How corrupt is your country
In Romania, we have many problems with corruption and this is the biggest problem of our society
What about you
Very corrupt but the future looks bright
As of late, corruption in Romania has been curbed, but there's still a lot of work to do
Nearly one year ago (May 27 2019), Liviu Dragnea, leader of the Social Democrats, the most corrupt party in Romania, that has ruined Romania for the last few years, was sent to prison
His absence left his party without any capable leader, so they lost the presidential elections and their government fell
With all this in mind, Romania is still a corrupt country and we mustn't let our guard down, because PSD can come back anytime
Anyway, the parliamentary elections in 2021 will decide Romania's path, so I'm looking forward to voting
According to the corruption perceptive index Romania is at 43/100 which is not great, but not as bad as I expected
Of course the OP is Romanian
I agree whit you since im from romania too
PSD are corrupt as fuck, regardless we have elections to put PNL and USR officials in power so future looks bright for now
Like our new transport minister has started using EU funds which means hes clean since they are harder to steal ofc
Overall pretty corrupt but its gettin better
On a scale from 1 to 10
Maybe a "wtf".
I wouldn't call it "the biggest" problem
Corruption is just a natural effect of something else: lack of education, lack of emphaty,  pettiness, arrogance, etc
Those are the "biggest problems". Until we, as a society, understand that politicians and authorities ARE our mirror, until we, as a society, will change the way we are and the way we educate our children - we will solve nothing
We can protest, we can write on Facebook, on Twitter, on Reddit and on the f*cking Moon if you want - but it will change nothing
We need to start educating people around us, even if it is hard and sometimes it seems nearly impossible
Very, but you already know it
This is like an underground corruption:))
How's that football stadium in Orban's village doing
At least our prime minister Orban is doing fine for now
Yes, in general, eastern Europe is more corrupt than western Europe
I admire Switzerland, I've learned French with the thought that I would visit this country
I've heard that you have problems with the integrity, Wallonia and Flanders aren't so united, so your situation is not easy from this point of view
Interesting you mention Romania
I can't deny what you said, the biggest problem is corruption, as I said in the description, which is the result of the society's thinking, we aren't able to understand that a possible public function must be a  reason of proud, in general, but, for us, is just an occasion to steal as much as we can
The biggest inconvenient is the incapacity to change our minds to follow the country's interest
For every corrupt political personage, there is a successor, and our hope is that we can defeat this succession
When we'll be able to understand that our country will be as we want, but we don't understand that we are the possibility to change
That's so annoying, why you don't protest
Romania won something after protests, except the attention of the media, maybe you'll be able to change something if you try to eliminate those parasites
Good luck, I'm waiting for better news from you, greetings from Romania
Let me guess, the first is Romania
:))
I totally agree, the situation is quite difficult in Serbia because the mafia is together with the politicians and the politicians are so glad to support them with a law or something, the same thing here in Romania, nothing new for me, just the scales are different, Romanian mafia is incomparable with the Serbian mafia, you would win in this category:))
It's pretty evident
I didn't know that the situation in Slovakia is even so difficult, I saw some comments from your compatriots and the situation is similar to our development, deforestation is a big problem too for us and the politicians are so annoying because they are fools and they don't even care if we know that they steal, it's all in our faces and we can't do anything, except to protest occasionally
It's enough:)))
That's pretty cool, I've heard that you are the happiest country in the world too
Probably , there is a link between these qualities
Yeah, these were my thoughts because we have a spiritual link with the French speaking region, especially with Lausanne, because our King had lived there, it's like a reason to be proud to recognize that I'm Romanian there
Yes i get that but im curious when you made your list why you chose romania specifically
Just askin btw
Normally, I'd have to be happy, but I feel a little sensation of discomfort because I should consider me lucky that the politic class from Romania isn't the worst
So I have  to support the anti-corruption until we  will be all of us non-corrupt
Thanks, it's one of my biggest frustrations, so I have to find my words to damask this incompetence, our generation must be the solution, I'm so hopeful and I really think that the teenagers have the possibility to deny the system where they have grown
Our situation is promising, the government had fallen and the new government is composed and conducted by the liberals, it's like an air mouth for us, but we have elections in November and this time I'm voting age:)))
[Numa numa yey
On a serious note, I think it might be [Ciocârlia
[Rapsodia Română] is also a good contender I would say
> Also i have to mention this too: Nightwish - The Greatest Show on Earth
I'm still butthurt about what happened with Tarjia to this day
Some of my favorite classical songs too
Oh don't get me wrong, Floor is a fantastic singer, but I grew up with Tarja, that version of Nightwish is what forever remains burned in my brain
The ridiculously thick accent, the awkward moves, the scene presence, the voice - I love all of it
Actually with songs that were originally sung by Tarja and now are also performed by Floor, in the new versions she can properly enunciate the words and the song is actually intelligible, but I think that it loses part of that charm for me
I love it when singers have an obvious, thick accent, kinda sucks a bit that so many singers are gravitating towards that generic Americanized accent
I've lived in Bucharest for the past 7 years, moved there from Constanța (quite a large city on the Black Sea coast)
I absolutely love Bucharest: it's noisy, overcrowded, very hot in the summer and not the cleanest
However, the underground network is amazing, the parks are awesome, there are a lot of leisure options (theatres, cinemas, malls, concerts) and the salaries are probably the highest in the country, what with it being the capital
Then again, the real estate market is quite expensive too
Nevertheless, I wouldn't move anywhere else in the country
Living in Bucharest
I grew up in a small city, where everyone knew everyone and you basically knew every single building to ever exist
Moving to Bucharest was
overwhelming I'd say
It's noisy, extremely crowded, and good luck finding a parking spot or driving more than 7 km in 30 minutes
I soon learned people kind of find their way around the crowded areas( I remember I was really surprised seeing people ride bikes, in most of the cities in Romania that's like being sentenced to death penalty on your way to work)
Also I noticed not many people know everything about every single sector, most of them just know their sector
The metro soon proved to be extremely useful, basically saves you so much time and connects the entire city (almost)
Someone pointed out the pollution and I have to agree, it is pretty polluted but it's also a lot cleaner when it comes to littering in comparison with other cities
When you get away from the super crowded area, Bucharest can actually be extremely beautiful
I always thought there was a nice combination between old and new
Bucharest feels like a 2 million inhabitants village
Idk, it's a decent place overall, slowly becoming more modern, hopefully we keep on this path
but the hellish traffic and all those winter nights when we had no heating or any running water, were absolutely no fun, I really wished I could move anywhere else, but job opportunities keep us in Bucharest
I think it's interesting to see how wildly different a city can feel for different people
I've lived here my whole life and I kind of hate it
Pretty much biding my time until a good enough opportunity arises and I'm out of here
Born and raised in Bucharest, I can attest I’ve never found a small city appealing, they lack the urban noise, the rhythm, the traffic
Smaller cities seem to die off in the evening, I can’t shake the feeling everyone’s away on vacation
Couldn’t get used to the quiet
Kind of like March and April when life almost came to a standstill
Even when traveling abroad in larger cities I feel at home, especially because of the crowds, the flow, traffic, familiar noises
That’s the upside of being late to the game, we weren’t early adopters so the technology had time to mature and competition amongst ISP’s drove the standards up
That’s perhaps one of the few aspects where the consumer actually benefits
I shudder reading horror stories from other countries (like the US) when it comes to internet
yeah same, bucharest born and raised and although i love it and love to explore it, it just doesn’t feel like such a big deal
i have friends that live in other cities and they keep saying that bucharest is such a jungle, where
it’s so quiet and boring sometimes, i even feel like i see the same strangers
nothing is unexpected or intriguing
i can’t wait to live in a bigger city to actually feel the city life
Germans are suspiciously quiet about this in the subreddits I'm lurking in :)) then again, as I'm not a German speaker, perhaps I'm missing out on some
How is your infrastructure generally speaking
I had a good laugh at this list :))
Here’s my thoughts:
You should know that many people aspire to reach your level
At least you have roads, we have so few and crowded that every roadwork feels like a heart attack, it completely blocks everything
We know bureaucrats as well, it’s how many employed in the administration justify their paycheck
However, our prognosis is usually “it’s either going to take a long time or we won’t be able to solve it”. Unless we ‘grease the wheels’. So you’re stuck with delays, but things happen in the end, we’re stuck with a system that protects itself and looks designed to help corruption flourish
Sadly, we’re similar here
Trains are late, the infrastructure is crap, as a result of years of defective policies meant to benefit some in the detriment of many
The internet is great, and cheap, but in some form or the other we do suffer from monopoly too
Probably the prices are adjusted a bit to our income level as well
On the other hand, none of the ‘good and cheap’ subscriptions available for households come with a lower limit
Everything is ‘up to’ but the minimum guaranteed speed is awful
People just don’t notice that, it’s pure chance
If you want your own dedicated IP and need a guaranteed bandwidth though, we’re talking totally different prices
In excess of 100EUR for a minimum guaranteed 100mbps symmetrical connection
What's the largest infrastructure project you wish the EU would build ?
Trains
I mean, an interconnected railway system across the EU
That would be fun
Blue trains with stars on them
That would be pretty
I like trains but I would build it for the cargo infrastructure more than for passengers, imagine delivering anything via electric trucks only on the "last mile" and everything else just via train containers
That actually sounds really cool
Don't worry, Romania has been trying to cross the Carpathian mountains with a wide road for almost 100 years now
Progress -10%. You won't be last when you finish it
That would be something, would you settle for a tunnel tho ?
Considering that Sicilly doesn't even have road to Italy, and how much closer those two are ....id say well have to way for the swedish-finnish one for a while
Are you unhappy with the way EU money are spent
If yes, it's because they're danish money spent outside Denmark or because you think EU founded projects are inefficient or corrupt
My notification only showed "finally putting enough funding into crack" ....
Screw that minimalistic crap
I want[ Orient-Express styled] high-speed trains
Let's ride in style
Imagine going from Cluj to Bucharest in 2 hours
Lads, as a german and a dane, would that tunnel actually improve trafic over there
I always wondered if being so close tot he other route would affect it's results
Let's suppose the tunnel is a good thing, that brings more prosperity
Then the tunnel is good for the whole EU as a part of that prosperity will increase some EU taxes and EU trade
Actually that would be awesome
I want trains with flags on them
I think aerodynamics might be against you there
Imagine going from Bucharest to Valea Prahovei in 2 hours
For us it must be Zalau county
It's a small county in Northern Transylvania, basically it's just forest and one town, I've never met anyone from there and never seen a car with their plates from there
Well, Vaslui doesn't exist because more than most Romanians ignore it's existence because they feel ashamed of it
In my country is a maximum security jail listed on map but i never found it and i think it doesnt even exist
> For us it must be Zalau county
Zalău is the town
Sălaj is the county
This is just proof of how meaningless it is
I’ve been here once during a work trip
The “city” is very small but at least we afforded a nice 4 star hotel since the prices were very small
r/Salajnuexista There is even a sub to confirm
Zalau, zalau, toata lumea-i din [Zalau]
No more Vaslui, the world has progresed past the need for Vaslui
No, because you simply deny the existence of your fellow Hungarians in Romania, then
Damn, true, I messed it up
With only like, 60 people
I was wrong apparently, the county is called Salaj in Romanian, the main city is Zalau
That's how unknown it is to us, we don't even know which one is the county and which one is the city
Well cousin, here comes Ferdinand the first
Why's he here
Nobody knows
Zălăuanii
Jur că e prima dată când aud cuvântul ăsta
Nu m-am gândit la cum li s-o spune
I'd say probably Transylvania, but then again I've never been to Salaj so I don't know which region they're closer to culturally
This "Bielefeld" is a death void where they send all the students who dare question the facts
The Hungarians can take Vaslui at this point and nobody would notice
Suna la fel de ireal ca si judetul Zalau
I say we give it to the Bulgarians instead just for the meme
It would really fuck up their economy
*laughs in Romanian*
Carol, Ferdinand and Mihai
Last one is still in use but you would never see anyone named Carol or Ferdinand
Decebal, Burebista, Traian, Mihai, Vlad, Stefan, Carol
Limited choices for Romanians
And Elisabeta, Maria, Elena and Ana for girls
If you were to add the name of the voivodes (who are called princes in English, but practically speaking they were basically kings) we could also add Ştefan, Vlad, Mircea, Alexandru, Petru, Rareş, Vasile, Radu and a couple of others
All of these are very common male names in Romania
Ferdinand would be so original tbh
If we count voievods, we get many more options
If we count empires that ruled us over the years, we gain access to Bulgarian, Turkish, Russian, Hungarian, and German names
I had a friend named Carol in grade 1-5 before i changed schools, but i swear i never heard anyone named Carol after that
Ferdinand never heard, Mihais are plenty
Yes it is
Carol I's German birth name was Karl
Carol is just the Romanian translation
Just like Maria is sometimes translated to Mary in English
Those are **so much** more common than the male ones
I think it's still used but most guys named Ferdinand are probably Roma
It was until the last monarch broke away from the branch, now it’s called “of Romania”
or Carl
Dora was translated as "Dora discovers the world" (*Dora descopera lumea*) instead of "Dora the explorer" (*Dora exploratoarea*)
I think we are a bit the odd ones out, but Dora teaches Spanish in here if I recall correctly
Also in dubbing because Romania dubs kid shows and some sitcoms the word dollars is often replaced with our currency, but that's mostly in newer dubs
How do we say mashed potatoes
Some people say "piure" which reminds me of french "purée" but then you have people who say "pireu" which sounds really ugly to me :))
Smântâna is delicious and deserves to be anywhere
All shoes are papuci, fight me
People argue about that
Indoor s.--> papuci
Summer s.--> şlapi
Its Feminine in Romanian too
No need, you're right
There is also Guguștiuc, which isnt really about translation as much as its literally named by the sound it makes (guuu-guuu-știuc)
And the Leneș, the sloth, which translated to "the lazy".
Micul Alexander, which is the ring necked parakeet, translates to "The Small Alexander".
Vaca Domnului - Authentic Moldova
Let's not forget "Pisica de mare" (Sea cat) which means stingray
I'm still confused, to this day, in what way did the people who named it think it's similar to a cat
Also Câine de mare, sea dog, which is a small type of shark, nursing shark i think
Yeah but at least [it kinda looks like a dog]
~~Romania~~Moldova: O-Zone - Dragostea din Tei
No YouTube link needed
The following is enough to already have it in your head:
Maya hiii Maya hoo Maya haaah Maya haaah haah…
Edit: fix country after drinking coffee
Thank you u/vingt-et-un-juillet for poinitng it out
"Connect-R Eu vara nu dorm" in 2012 for sure
every beach there was this song playing
also at u/vingt-et-un-juillet
I never understand why people always say the band is Moldavian
The band released their first album in this trio formation only *after* moving to Bucharest, and then they stayed in Romania for the rest of their career as a group
[Wiki]
"In 2002, O-Zone moved from Moldova to Bucharest, Romania, hoping to gain more recognition
There, the group became an instant hit band with their upbeat song "Despre Tine" ("About You"), which held the top position on the Romanian Top 100 chart for three weeks in February 2003
I think it's fair to say the members are Moldavian, but the band is Romanian
You are 100% right
Thank you
Now I have drunk my coffee
I thought  *I should mention the country as it's not mine*, then wrote mine
And everyone forgets about Stereo Love too lol
I really can't understand that reasoning, for the arguments I gave above, but whatever
Just as I don't understand how the news always refers to Sebastian Stan as "the biggest Romanian actor in Hollywood", as he only spent the first 8 years of his life here, can barely speak the language now and has been living and has built his entire career in the US
He's a *Romanian-born* American actor
The same IMO goes for O-Zone
[Our highways are falling apart]
The highways are terrible
The government pays a few times the cost for a km and there is no quality
Another badly executed project is the extension of the metro system
A new rail line should have been finished in 2011
As of 2020 it is still worked on
We can barely build any type of highway
But Moldova has it even worse
The ownet of Spartan, a fast food restaurant joint, constructed a meter of highway on his land, then made a huge event where he would releasr to the public "The first meter of highway of this country" or something similar
The subway in the capital, specifically the Militari branch
It has become an inside joke by now
Well here in Romania we have the Gouvernment
They did double the work just to compromise it
Madness
I like my mountains
In Romania, ID cards are mandatory
The fine for not making one once you're 14 or not renewing it when expiring is huge
They were 2 weeks ago
Now most can't be budged or care
Still great days for supermarkets
Now no
Everyone already freaked out two weeks ago
Now it's pretty normal
Yea a few weeks ago everyone was buying canned food and toilet paper to last for at least 2 months
Now it seems that the people have calmed down
Tons of flower, oil and sugar
(Romania)
That's underestimating it
What could one person do with all that meat, tho
Where do you even store it
Do these people think Poland is gonna close its borders and bam
no more meat in the country
Same shit is happening over here and I get equally confused about it
stonks
Zombies can slip on wet toilet paper
You can distract them by throwing the tube
You will need entertainment when the internet breaks down
Those are my guesses
Our word is short, it's simple, but it has an immense meaning: **Dor**.
You can't translate it
Not exactly
It's a word found in our most beautiful writings, from stories to poems
But what is it
Well, it's longing, but it's so much deeper than that
You say it when you miss someone or some place (such as your home) in a way that leaves your heart aching and your soul empty and yet at the same time, there is a subtle, sweet happiness in there
*Dor* is what a soldier will feel when thinking of home, of his family, of his wife, parents and children
It's what they will feel when thinking about him
*Dor* is what you feel when you think of your parents and grandparents, who may have been gone for a year, two, or fifty
*Dor* is what you feel when you finally managed to cook that dish just like your mother used to make and all you can think of is her
*Dor* is that little ache in your heart when you live in a different country and from time to time, with a sad, melancholic smile, you think of
*home*.
*Dor* is short, it's simple, but for us, it's one of the deepest feelings in our hearts
I like Dor, in Romanian
You see it has 2 or more meanings
The meaning that can be translated is from Latin popular “dolus/dolere” which means pain and the word can be used as “ ma dor bratele” = my arms hurt
Now, to the other meaning, which I love is .. well ... untranslatable :) . But it means missing someone badly, lust, the need to see someone you love
( imi este dor de tine = I miss you a lot)
Spoken by a romanian the word is very very powerfull and sends a lot of emotions
So, a short but powerfull word
Cheers ps: I also like “ie” which is a traditional shirt
Тоска (pronounced 'toska')
The word doesn't have a direct translation in English, but the best definition I could find was the one by writer Vladimir Nabokov:
"No single word in English renders all the shades of toska
At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause
At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning
In particular cases, it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness
At the lowest level, it grades into ennui, boredom
"Dor" in Romanian
I've heard that a few times here in Romania
What does it mean
I have never ever heard of toska in Romanian
There had to be a bulgarian somewhere in this thread to say that Cyrillic isn't Russian
It's not a Romanian word, but I like it a lot
How did something as random as "pig god" even come into being
"Vasile" and "Marcel". They sound terrible
Vasile
I mean it used to be an extremely common name and it still kinda is to some extent, but it's the most peasant sounding name I've ever heard
If your name is Vasile, you got at least 2 pigs, 1 cow and 10 chickens, a big bear belly, and very poor dental hygine but you still like to smile a lot, especially while drinking rachiu or tuica
Cornel, Ion, Olga, Carmen, Vasile, Vasilica, Viorica
Gheorghe
Thanks God I am also named Dan
what about Eugen or Septimius
The pen (Petrache Poenaru)
Insuline injection (Nicolae Paulescu)
The Coandă effect (is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface
It is named after Romanian inventor Henri Coandă, who described it as "the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops
") (Possible first jet engine designer) (Henri Coandă)
Gerovital (Ana Aslan)
The reaction engine, the jetpack, amphetamine, the fountain pen and many more
The first jet engine - Henri Coanda,
Ejection seat - Anastase Dragomir,
Insulin - Nicolae Paulescu are the first that spring to mind
Uhh
Fountain pen, the first reaction engine, ejection seat uhh
early VTOL thingies
And a bunch lot more I guess we are pretty Inventive
The Ball Pen, some say we invented the airplane
Also, we had the first city to use street lamps
Its romanian sorry
Also [Aurel Persu]  the first to place the wheels inside the body of the car as part of his attempt to reach the perfect aerodynamic shape for automobiles
>a controversial claim disputed by some and supported by others
>Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight
I'll change it to Coandă effect , but in parantheses I'll keep "possible the first jet engine designer" and add the definition of thw Coandă effect
Arguably the jet engine was invented by a Romanian inventor, Henri Coanda
It's wasn't a jet engine as we know them today, but it was propelled via a jet of air and it didn't have a propeller
This was showcased in 1910
Yes it is search nicolae paulescu
Here you can find a section of the engine
Yea this is what i meant to say
I am stupid sorry
Have a nice day
The structure of the education systems
By this I mean the amount of years/credits required for certain diplomas, the standards of quality and the requirements to obtain certain diplomas
(edit: I'm mostly referring to higher education, nothing between kindergarten and high school)
Ex: in civilized Europe you don't really need to publish a scientific paper to get your PhD in natural sciences
In eastern Europe you need to publish 3-4 depending on the faculty you do your PhD in
This, of course, results in all doctoral candidates publishing very quickly shitty paper in shitty journals
They could instead build their work over some years with others in their lab and publish higher quality work
Edit: my example is just to show how different the requirements can be
My point is that because the requirements are so different it can become difficult to get similar positions
I mean, as EU citizens we are free to travel and work anywhere in the EU, but my 5 years of pharmacy training are not the same as the 5 years of pharmacy training someone in the west did
So how am I free to travel and work if my diplomas are meaningless outside of my country
Well, my problem with this disjointed higher education we have in Europe is that you are allowed to move around the EU, you're allowed to get a contract or a PhD in other EU member states, but they can't actually hire you because they don't understand your diploma
The PhD thing was just an example of what differences there are
The difference between west and east is that in the east *it is a legal requirement*. And you can say whatever you want about the environment in your institution, but as long as it's not a legal obligation, you can find a way around the expectations of your prof
Good luck with your work, guy
You're focusing too much on the example I gave
I'm mostly thinking about getting a job or getting into a higher education program
In Ro for pharmacy I did 5 years, uninterrupted, with a total of 600 credits (iirc)
I came to Germany to do my PhD and they were fucking confused about the no of years and the facts that my diploma is called "bachelor/masters", although I have the exact same no of credits as pharmacy masters in Germany
The credit system is similar in all of the EU, I think
But it's not really taken into account tho
And to finish the diploma it would be nice to have at least similar if not the same requirements, just so the diplomas can be equated somehow
Not WW2 "collaborators", but we have a word "securist" for people who collaborated with the Communist Secret Police (Officially "Departamentul Securității Statului" - "Department of State Security", Unofficially called "Securitatea" - "The Security")
It is sometimes used as an insult even to people who didn't collaborate
I mean we don't really have smth like that cuz we were fascist ... we usually use "nazist"(nazi)
You can also say "legionar" not really sure what is the translation which was the name of the fascist people in Romania
If I call you a communist, you have my guarantee that it’s an insult
The most well known video games developed in Romania are probably Assassin Creed Rogue and Watch Dogs 2
Oh, and also most of the Fifa games
Gta and counter strike games are hella popular for the "older generation".
Now I think it would be minecraft and league of legends
Well all FIFA games since 17 were developed here according to Wikipedia, and I'd say those are pretty popular
Developed in Romania:
- Asphalt 5
- FIFA 2017 - 2021
- Assassin's Creed Rogue/ Altair's Chronicles
- Chessmaster
- Ferrari GT Evolution
- Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon:Future Soldier
- Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix
- Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 1 and 2
- Men in Black - Alien Crisis
- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
- Ghost Recon Wildlands
- Ghost Recon Breakpoint
- Watch Dogs 2
You guys made Space Engineers
Man, I loved that game
Control is my favourite game of the last 5 years <3
It is but has a big working branch in Romania too
EA has a large development studio in Bucharest, which, starting with FIFA 15 or 16 has worked on the FIFA series quite a lot
I actually have a friend who is a lead developer at EA and is mainly assign to work on FIFA every year
Same with Watch Dogs 2, Ubisoft is a French company, but has a well established development studio in Romania, studio that has worked on the Tom Clancy series and others
But yeah, the question from OP is a bit tricky
The games have been developed in Romania, but not by Romanian companies
For some 100% romanian games I will go for PC building simulator and action squad, decent games, also a small mobile developer has made a game called "The walls" it's a little unfinished and quite easy to win but it's good and another one called just tap or something, haven't tried that one but it looks promising
I like it a lot
Some of my friends have seen it
I am planning to binge watch it all once i have a week off :) cheers from Ro
My friends been bugging me to watch it for a while but I didn't find the time to yet ..I heard good things
I've watched the first season before all the hype started
I honestly find it a great show, the casting absolutely genial and the story is just incredible
I would like to thank Serbia for being the only country we’ve never had a war with
Id like to Thank the EU for helping us as a relatively new democracy
But also all our neighbours Hungary, Serbia,Bulgaria for being good neighbours with amazing food
I want to thank Serbia for not trying to invade us
This is so wholesome
However, I don't think that someone has anything to thank my country for
But I would like to thank Serbia for my Herman's tortoise
We have them in my country but it's illegal to own local fauna, so a foreign turtle is just fine
I love her lots
I'd like to thank Bulgaria for their tourism, they're definetly more smarter than us
And for their rose everything
I've been this summer there and bought a lot of rose scented stuff
I'd like to thank Ukraine (I live next to the border) for their cheap cigarettes, alcohol, sweets and everything else
I'd like to thank Hungary for
umn
well
sigh
their kurtos kolacs I guess
And for making us more united
I'd like to thank Serbia for never invading us and having our backs
I'd like to thanks Moldavia for their wine, cheap tobacco for rolling and their Bucuria sweets
I would thank hungary a bit because they brought kurtos kalaks to romania
Tbh,most of theneighbours of my coumtry were some assholes to us for most of our history
So I really can't say "thank you"  to any of them
Of there is a caountry that actually helped us ,im sorry if i forgot it
Its almost 12 o'clock
I don't know if it has a translation in English, but a local soft drink in Ronania is something called "must" which is basically a grape juice before turning into wine
Probably Adria Cola
It's a very popular bootleg Coca-Cola
I honestly don't know if we even have any, if another romanian could tell me i'd love to know
I used to think nestea, lipton ice tea, fanta, and fuzetea were only in romania, then i found out i was a dumbass
Frutti Fresh still exists and has a less sugary taste that most drinks
Note-it is one of the cheaper drinks,as in a 2
5l bottle costs 5 lei(just above an euro)
I haven't seen anyone drink Adria in a long time, not even old people who used to buy it since it was cheaper than regular cola/fanta, all I see now are people laughing about how bad it tasted lol
I don't think talking about Ceauşescu is taboo at all here
Chances are that if you watch some news channel you'll find some politicians comparing other politicians with Ceauşescu or his men, if you go to a park you'll hear some old people getting nostalgic for that period
You can freely talk about him or that period without getting any weird looks, now if you openly support his ideals that's another story
Love him or hate him, Ceauşescu was a big part of our modern history and we just accept it
Wish some people would get over the mindset of that period but I like to think we're getting there
Its not tabu at all, we just hate them
The only "nostalgics" are the ones who profited from the regimes
It's what youngsters call stupid old people
You're a commie
Also old people LOVE to talk about the "old times" back before '89 during Ceaușescu ruling and how perfect everything was and because they were some brainwashed little mouses they still believe it to this day
Or as an adjective: My dad is such a communist sometimes, he won't let me go outside
A lot of old people think Ceausescu was better than what's now and people talk about him quite often
It's pretty common to talk about it and compare the upsides and downsides
Most people that now look back fondly to that period either had family working for the state or were lucky to never have pissed off the state
On point
5% of games have Romanian language option so I prefer english becuz I can understand everything
There are few games in Romanian and the translation isn't good, so I prefer games in English
Well, Romanian is always the first choice of a studio to translate games into, so it’s always an easy choice
And the translations are always absolutely flawless, too, of course
Pretty much English,not only games translation but also everything else that is possible because jokes or other things usually get lost in translation
English
Very rarely I see something translated in Romanian and if it is, it usually is poorly
Game list (no order in particular):
Monster Hunter World
Planet Zoo
Jurassic World: Evolution
GTA V
Plague Inc
Minecraft (modded)
Saurian
Platypus
Nova Drift
Primal Carnage: Extinction
And others I play more rarely
Whenever a game has translations, there are some generic things
English is Better in video games
I prefer in English because most of the time it doesnt have Romanian transalation and when it has, its just so weird
The reksio games were also translated into daco-romanian
Wait what
It was a series of games that I used to play in my childhood which stared the polish cartoon character Reksio
The games were dubbed and everything,not just subtitled like most games nowadays
That's cool
Many people born in cities do look down on the ones who live in the countryside and the term “țăran” (person who lives in the countryside) is used mostly as an insult
As many stated before, countryside people are mostly seen as backwards and uneducated who have been politically indoctrinated by a political party, PSD, in Romania’s case, via unemployment benefits and false promises like bringing their kids back home
On top of that, one more negative sterotype aside from being poor and stupid is that many are alcoholics and wife beaters (wich sadly is backed up by many news stories)
The ones who move to the city for work or go to study there are also not very well liked by the city folk, either, especially if they’re from Moldavia, Romania’s poorest region, and are moving outside of said region
Well, Romania has a lot of vilages where the standards of life are amazingly low
But it also has some quite deprived cities
Being able to live in a city or close to one is sometimes just a step or two above the poverty in God forgotten rural settlements
So, basically, divide, yes, there is
Are rural people seing city people as stuck up
Idk, but from what I know most rural poor families would like it for their kids to find a better life in the city
Are city people considering rural people dumb
Yes and no
It is actually a great problem in our country
People in rural areas tend to be dumb because there are lots of villages where there aren't schools, or the local school is on the verge of crumbling, or it lacks basic things like a toilet or a heater
Basically, the actual economic clases you can find in Romania are: <1% really really rich people, middle class people, poor people, extremely poor people, people so poor that they somehow live only on the approx 20 euro per month they get for being poor, and people with literally no money that die by famine if crops don't grow or if their cow dies
More than half the population lives in a combination between post war times and the middle ages
Same thing here
People on the country side actually like the city
So they go to spain, italy or germany
I agree and I’d like to add that countryside people don’t like city people either, a lot of them think of us as some capitalistic sinful idiots or something like that
Adding on to this, in Bucharest we call people not from Bucharest as “provinciali”, and while not a **super** derogatory term, it’s mostly used to portray people from the rest of the country in a poor spotlight
How did disco polo become a political issue out of everything possible
Please enlighten me, it actually sounds interesting
I wanted to mention that as well, but I didn’t want my comment to become a text wall, but you’re right
Same here, many older villagers see cities as a sort of place that morally corupts young people, especially girls (fata de la țară devine fată de oraș)
We barely even get snow in my city
This Christmas it was 13° C outside (although it's quite a bit colder now at 5° C)
Ammonium nitrate, 20 tons, a truck rolled over and an hour later exploded killing 18 and injuring 13
2004
As per number of victims, probably Flight 371 crash that killed 60 in 1995
An Airbus 310 flying to Brussels
[Ukrainians reading this thread]
So there's this one depot in Targu Mures that has 5 times as much nitrate as the Beirut one
And it's 2020
We really should stop the actions of some guys in the past rule our present and future, cheers mate !
Aren't the top telenovelas Mexican though
Or I guess we can thank Spain for Mexico
>I wish that there were milk bars
Have you heard of
cheese
Me, most of the things I eat contains milk
I sometimes am lazy and hungry and I drink a whole 1L carton straight from the fridge
Extremely refreshing and deals with my hunger
I love milk, 2l a day min
I dont like milk but I am chugging water like crazy
I drink at leas 6 litres every day and when it is summer I can easily drink 10 litres so
I like milk and eat  all milk products except milk chocolate , not a fan .
Yuck water
, fish fuck in it you know
Nah leave it its funny:)
I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt
I think in Romanian, we use "Honolulu" when you want to say someone is far away or in the middle of nowhere
The alternative is "Patagonia" but that is less used I feel
In Romania we say "la dracu in praznic" that means "at the devil's charity". Not really a charity more like a dinner table you do for dead ones to romember them, commemorate table or feast in his name
It's with the devil in the corn field
(la dracu-n păpușoi)
Romanian - Plopeni, Machu Pichu, Marte (Mars), la dracu in praznic (where the devil gives you free food- but in a ceremonial way after somebody dies)
My favorite middle of nowhere expression is
La pulahara - it means something like at dicks end ( pula is dick and hara sounds like sahara)
Or another vulgar one that I like is: la dracu în praznic ( at the devil's wake )
In a formal setting you can use: în Patagonia ( in that region in Argentina )
Edit: another good one is în cur cu satelitul ( in an ass on/by a satellite
Or in fairy tales we use the expression: peste 7 mari și 7 țări ( over 7 seas and 7 countries
I've seem Romanians use Honolulu for this porpose or more commonly  the expresion "la dracu in praznic" where dracu is roughly translated as "the devil" and "praznic" is a religious thing, a sort of gathering of people that feast in the honor of a saint and it takes place on the day that saint died
Since the devil is both immortal and unholy it's imposible for his "praznic" to exist
It's kinda oxymoronic
So we have
La- "at"
Dracu- "Devil"
In- "in"
Praznic- "feast"(if we shorten the explanation)
So we get " At the devil's feast" which sounds pretty cool in english
Romanian:
"At the devil's praznic" (basically a meal you give to people after a funeral)
"Near devil's mother"
There are other versions,but these two are usually used
I heard Honolulu many times when referring to some God forgotten place here
> "in der Wallachei"
As someone living in Wallachia, I find that mildly interesting
I'm wondering about the origin of the phrase
Never heard Honolulu used but Patagonia defiantely
And „Palestina”, more widely used by old people
As a guy originally from Wallachia I am happy someone heard of us
Lol, when i was thinking of where the middle of nowhere would be in Romania, a random poor village in the romanian plains ( former Wallachia) came to mind
I think it's because apart from some urban centers the region is hands down depressing
I was also thinking about "la mama naibii" which means "at the devil's mother"
But also "Cucuieții din deal" and "La cuca măcăii" which, as far as I know, cannot be translated
I've also heard people use "Honolulu" or "în pulă cu satelitu" basically meaning "in the dick with a satellite"
Thay's weird because I never heard Patagonia used, but always heard Honolulu
Maybe more of a recent regionalism, but the most common among young people is "în pizdeea".
First time I see someone from the netherlands asking me not to be defiant
I did know that, yes
Pulahara : dick + Sahara
>I have an auto-immune disease and I'm on immunosuppressants
This sucks, man, I wish you all the best
Don't forget your training
Take a deep breath, maybe 2, and think of yourself as one of your patients, maybe that will help reduce the stress
Mass resignation
But shouldn't hospitals and government institutions have a different supply chain then consumers
I would assume they need larger quantities than me, and would not buy disinfectantant in a 1l bottle from the supermarket
I understand
i thought about those disinfectans used to clean surfaces, in spray bottles or something like that
There are non of those left here either, stores are empty
It seems you refer to those hand disinfectants
It is not as bad here yet, but i wouldn'tbe surprised if it is going to happen in 1 or 2 weeks
I tries buying, but was too late
I use some of that usually to mop the floor an clean surfaces in the house (washing machine, door handles etc)
I still have some left though, should be enough for the next 2 weeks
So you know how everyone makes fun of Italy for switching sides in ww2
Yeah we did that too
damn, laughed way more than I should have hahaha
EDIT: someone give this guy a medal, i'm poor lol
You got me, not gonna lie
I gotta say this actually made me laugh
No, our king staged a coup against Ion Antonescu and switched to the Allies
Yeah, they’re good
We eat them also in Romania
My grandmother also used to eat snails but my mom did not pick up that habit
Well, I also live in Romania and I never knew we ate snails so yeah, that's pretty rare, at least in my region
Cuz they would stick out as a sore thumb among all the old pretty buildings
And besides this, Europeans are not huddled into a few metropolitan areas with just desert in between (this is my ignorant image of the US)
In Europe it's more common for people to hate living in a big metropolis
And it's not like people live in the suburbs and work in the big city
Most city are medium sized and are well connected to each other, so it's fairly easy to live in one small town/village, work in a medium sized city and go in the weekend to the bigger city for shopping/fun
What I'm trying to say is that the population is much more spread out on the land and I don't think people here care that they don't all live in the big city
All the people I know that do live in big cities (Paris, München, Bucharest) they kind of hate it there and dream of moving out
Don't be an ass
Just because you have zero knowledge of a thing doesn't mean the thing isn't well known
Belgian cities are quite famous for how pretty they are
"Cine nu-i gata, îl iau cu lopata
" (The one who isn't ready, I will take him with the shovel
Pregătit sau nu, vin acum
(Romanian) (Word-by-word translation as the expression is “Cine nu-i gata, îl iau cu lopata
Gata sau nu, vin acum or cine nui gata il iau cu lopata (whos not ready im geting he/she whit the shovel sounds dump ik XD)
Looks like we got quite a bit of lopata's (lopeti in Romanian)
Am venit aici crezând ca sunt singurul român
Romanians assemble !!
Si eu
No, we are gonna shovel them out
No we won't
FEREASCĂ SFANTUL
Romania and Eastern Moldova are technically separate countries
I feel like Moldova kept a more of the older Romanian/Moldavian words
If none of us adapted, it would be harder to understand each other, even though we would recognize the words
For instance, a penalty kick in football is called "lovitură de pedeapsă" in Romania, but I heard Moldavians call it "pilitură de osânză". I recognize all the words, but I had no idea what the expression meant the first time I heard it
It would be amazing if Moldovans would adapt to standard Romanian because they keep using some strange expressions and weird words that sound very funny to most of us
We don't mind people from Moldova who speak romanian with their accent and some different words
It sounds pretty good actually, and singers from Moldova that use their accent are very popular and well regarded in Romania
That had to be a joke
Pălitură de osândă. I think that was a joke about how Moldovans use old or different words for basically everything
The words are synonyms but oviously "a păli" is used mostly in rural areas, and "osândă" is just an old word no one uses anymore
After a Google search I found this: [
Why does every single neighbor of ours is against us, I mean I know we had problems in the past, but that's just history
( I'm from Romania)
i dont understand why bulgarian beaches are more appealing to us romanians than our own, if that counts
Hmmm
why tf didn't Rep
of Moldova unite with Romania
What’s stranger re timezones is India uses 1 timezone although it’s large enough to fit 2 timezones, that is the sun rises/sets 2 hours later in the west
We share a border with a country that speaks the same language, but sometimes I can’t understand a word they say
They're mad we don't use a slavic alphabet
We're literally the odd one out, Latin amongst Slavics/Slavs
Never been to Bulgarian beaches, but I'll try to help
It appears to me that they invested more in resort type of things that cost only a bit less than here, but give to the average Romanian cheap person the feeling of going abroad for the summer holidays
Pentru ca numa acolo au vacante all-inclusive cu vreo 15 mese pe zi :)
Well that was deep
Lol me neither
The worst situation is when they're trying to overtake but they can't so they get visibly frustrated
So you’re saying Hungarians in Hungary are not against Romanians, only the Hungarians in Romania are
Shocker
First thing first I'm talking about the country itself hating us, not the people in it
Hungary hates us because Transylvania
Ukraine hates us because they are basically Russians, they are against Moldavia and Romania uniting
Moldavia hates us because the Russians brainwashed them to make them think that they're russian, which made them hate us
Bulgaria wants Dobruja, and we've also fought them
The only one who is neutral towards us is Serbia, because we were on the same side all the time, but we are not Slavs, so they don't care that much about us
Also Turkey hates us, we've had a long history of you massacring us and we massacring you
fair enough, i always hear people saying "omg lets go to the golden sands in bulgaria"(if thats what they're called and always felt like our country was never good enough for holidays
thats true lmao
Yep
There's nationalists in every country
Yeah, sorry it was like 4 am also woke up at 8 AM, as I was very tired, I forgot that Ukraine wasn't Russian anymore because I play a WW2 strategy game a lot, at that moment my brain was still thinking about that
We call dish soap "Axion" this is the only thing that come to my mind
here, in romania we call every type of sneaker ,,adidas" so actual adidas sneakers are calles ,,adidas adidases"
Well we have 'afidași' for trainers and 'pempărși' for diapers
That's all I can think of lmao
Adidas - all trainers
Jeep - SUVs
Pampers - Diapers
In Romania we use the same word for hairdryer with the exact pronunciation and we don't even have ö in our phonetic inventory
"Dero" , "Xerox" , "Pampers" , "Adidasi" , "Scotch" ,"Jeep", "Lego"
Ha we call it feon too
Had no idea it came from the Fohn
Zmeu tends to be the old, archaic, story telling kind of dragon
Otherwise it’s currently ~~translated as~~ referring to a kite
For dragons, like you’d name the ones in Game of Thrones, the word is ‘dragon’
But yes, there’s an uncanny resemblance between German and Romanian
> In hungarian, "üveg" means the same material, but also means bottle
Same in romanian
"Sticlă" means both "glass" (material) and "bottle".
Not stupid, but it pissed me off
I met an elderly couple from the UK on a boat trip in Amsterdam
At first they seemed nice, but the old man tried at one point to pronounce the name of a Romanian band and he did a really bad job, so I said that I have no idea what he's trying to say
Then the old lady said "wow, we know more about your culture than you do".
I didn't think much of it, but then I realized what band he was talking about
Ciocârlia for anyone interested
As we were talking about this band he started confusing it to Goran Bregovic
When I tried to correct him, he said "no, trust me, I know more about it than you"
They were both laughing, but I thought it was very unfunny and it kind of pissed me off
In Poland, a bunch of English tourists got drunk af and one of them pissed next to a pool table, because he was too lazy to walk 20 meters til the bathroom
He also tried "making it ok" by shouting "I'll pay for iiit"
Romanian, my mother says she saw somebody trying to haggle down the price in a marketplace
There isn't any coffee
Lol I thought they were also selling coffee
Yes it does, provincia/provincial(from the countryside)
Basically means you are low class
But in actually the biger cities in the wester part are cleaner and have a better standard of living imo than the capital
Pretty much the same in Romania
The word is "provincie".
Same in Romania ("provincia")
Another large town in Romania however "patented" another word for people outside of that town: "vinitură"
Same word in Romanian
"provincie" is almost always used derogatoriu
Bucharest is a big city so there are a lot more poor areas than in cities like Oradea, Timisoara or Cluj, but make no mistake, Bucharest is much richer than all of those
The GDP per capita is twice as high than any other region
“Provincie” means “province”, which in turn refers to the “outside of the capital city”. Definitely not “countryside”. I know Bucharesters like to think Bucharest is the only city in Romania, the others being just larger villages, but let’s not forget that a lot of them folks in Bucharest are in fact _provinciali_.
The standard of living takes more info account that the gdp
purchasing power, safety, healthcare, cost of living, property price to income ratio, traffic, pollution
This all count more for a person's overall confort .
Don't get me wrong when taking into account the property price to income ratio Cluj has become hell
Was working in Marrakech , me and my friends were at McDs, the girls stayed outside while me and my friend went to order
He is a pervert ,talking sexual things all the time
Many girls  in line, infront  of us there is a girl really good looking
He begins  (ofcourse we're talking romanian) "man look at this girls ass, suck a beautiful ass, imagine you play a bit with it, give it some kisses then stick your dick in it" to wich the girl turned around and gave me a short look
( i found it a bit strange but in the many years working there i've never seen romanian tourists)
My friend continues with " look at the other one ,how big her ass is, it's  alot of work an ass like that ,you get tired fast" . The poor girl infront couldn't take it anymore and turned around and started talking in romanian to us how we should be ashamed and how we are giving romania a bad name
We wore both mouth open speech less and we stayed like that  until we  went back to the girls and told them what happened
They laughted their asses off
Since then i never talk anything  bad in public doesn't matter wich country i'm in
add romania to that list
Germans have no sense of style
Sorry
I moved to Germany and my first thought was "oh, wow, they're very free and comfortable over here", but then I realized that they just don't have any interest in clothes other than the obvious need to cover their bodies
Even the "stylish" Germans look shaggy and disheveled
Even during nice/fancy events they wear hiking shoes
Or ugly ill-fitting pants
There's no sense of what works for what body type, it's just "I like red and this is red".
And of course, all the teenagers in my town dress the exact same
Like not the same style
The same clothes
I put very little effort into my clothes/style, but there *is* an effort
As in I think about what works and what doesn't beforehand
Also I buy specific clothes that work for my body type
And the Germans at my work think I'm super stylish
The eastern Europeans do not think I'm stylish, btw
The easterners think I'm normal
Edit: in all fairness, I had some German students that had really lovely styles
And they looked comfortable too
Visited Iceland a couple of years ago in February and it coincided with the most massive snowfall in the past 70 years
It was also really cold and windy and I kept gawking at people wearing tennis shoes, skinny jeans that barely reached the ankles and light jackets
Meanwhile, I was all bundled up with about three layers underneath my thick jacket
(before corona) i was on the beach and i just walked in bulgary to get better tobacco
sometimes life is like that
Yeah before corona, once a month I'd get a cheap plane ticket to wherever
Milan, Berlin, anything that was on offer at the time
Spent the weekend then came back home on Sunday night
Also I live in Bucharest, I know a really great fish restaurant on the Bulgarian side of the Danube, takes me an hour and a half to get there by car (because of traffic not distance)
I'd go because I love fish
Before Corona I went to other countries in the EU pretty often
For holidays and also for work
I think maybe 4 times a year
I live now in Germany, pretty close to the Czech border (about 3h drive)
So I would go there pretty often
Edit: as a practical example, I used to go once a year to some Czech city to get a haircut, because haircuts are stupid expensive in Germany and because the Czech are more artistic and have better customer service
I'd say I don't go as often since I don't live close to the border, but at least 3-4 times a year
It's also really common to live in a country and work in another, my parents are Romanian but they work in Italy, they come back home for holidays sometimes if their jobs allow it
There are also people that live in Italy and every morning cross the border to Switzerland to go to work
Yeah, in terms of borders it's actually pretty easy( you only need your ID) but a lot changed from country to country, not even the Slavic countries have the same exact culture and tradition or even language
It's actually pretty nice knowing you can experience a completely different culture in just a few hours
>18€ best of big Mac in Geneva
My poor ass had a heart attack reading this
See you in the afterlife, guys
I'm afraid to ask, but
What's wrong with Perth
Not French, not in France, but there's an Arc de Triomphe in Bucharest and I see it regularly enough
I wouldn't drive in Bucharest if I had the choice though the monument itself is nice
Bucharest is just something else
The only rule is that the bigger car has right of way
I dont like going down there
I don't remember Corsica being that crazy when I visited (2x) but this is exactly how some friends described driving in Sardinia :))
Shout-out to people that don't care about the color of the traffic light and pass nonetheless
Is the only place I saw people doing this, to such an extension
Sounds like Pissaladière
Until very recently I wasnt aware that the word *cizma* (long boots) is loaned from Hungarian *csizma*.
wow am învățat ceva nou astăzi
Seriously
Ive learned something new today
Thanks
Exactly
I never thought about that until we talked about your long high-heeled boots
:-)
Hungarian
Hungarians ate the largest ethnic minority in romania (about 6%)
Excluding English,it might be French in Romania
Or Russian/Serbian for the fossils
Hungarian because of Hungarian minorities
Or Gypsy language if thats a thing
If you mean minoraty leanguage, then magyar, rromani and german
If you mean studied the french and secound german
I think more people speak French and German as a second language than Hungarian due to them being extensively thought in schools all across the country
Also for the Szekelys, Hungarian can be considered a first language not second
That's like saying Portuguese is mutually intelligible with French
Being part of the same language family doesn't make the languages mutually intelligible
I understood the question as the second most popular native language spoken
As a second language, probably french then
They're taught extensively in schools, but they're also taught badly all across the country
It's extremely rare for someone to have learned French or German in school
Maybe mostly the people who study philology in college
damn hungarians
I remember I watched a docuseries a while ago with a guy traveling around Ireland trying to use only Irish, facing day to day situations such as grocery shopping, checking in a hotel, renting a car and so on
Needless to say he had a lot of trouble
Not really
Firstly Romanian is a romance language, it's very similar to Italian and Spanish and that makes it quite easy to learn, especially for the age group that emigrated there (mostly unqualified people in their 30s and 40s in the early 2000s)
The number of Romanians in Spain went down significantly due to a mix of economic issues post 2008 crash and the fact that most of them were only there for seasonal work
In Italy things were a bit different because more people had permanently emigrated there leading to a stable, larger expat community
More and more Romanians are choosing countries like Austria and Germany these days for economic reasons
I guess you're no longer Hungary
I'm sorry
Wow I had quite a bit of trouble googling it, but then I just entered the magic term tg4 and there it was, first video result
[Here is the first episode
I know but it's more of a convenience thing than a language one since most of them work in the tourism sector
TL;DR: Skip to 3rd section, first and second are somewhat offtopic
> into Year 7 (so, they've just finished primary school)
*insert "do you even know how little that narrows it down
" meme here*
Different countries use entirely different school systems
In Romania, if someone is in Year 7 of school, they are typically 13-14 years old
It vastly depends on where and who, if they had computer experience and so on
People assume that knowing how to tap a squircle shaped icon and playing with a game = universal computer knowledge
That comparison is basically identical to equating someone's knowledge of using Windows Calculator to knowing how to use Visual Basic for Applications macros in Microsoft Excel
They're entirely different things
On an iPad, you tap on the App Store blue icon, you click on the Games text or rocket icon at the bottom, you tap a game, and you click the big blue "INSTALL" button
After that, some magic happens, and a new icon appears on the Home Screen
There is no concept of files involved, no installer, everything is hidden away
Meanwhile, switching to Microsoft Windows, you first have the concept of the Start Menu, which is like the Home Screen but not really
What you would expect to be the Home Screen is actually the Desktop, and then you must know about files to understand how to use that
On mobile devices, especially on iOS ones, each app manages its own container of files
When you open Microsoft Excel on an iPad, you don't get a file picker where you must navigate folders to get to your desired file
Instead, the app presents you with the files its managing
Furthermore, on mobile operating systems, you share things
On desktop operating systems, you have to deal again with folders and file types
While all the desktop stuff seems trivial, it is only because we're used to it
I am often helping people without computing experience, especially old people, and I get to see how it is from the perspective of the unknowledgeable
To finally answer the original question, not a whole lot
Kids in the city are likely to own a computer
For kids in the countryside, it's highly unlikely
Kids in rich families are almost guaranteed to have computers
Kids in poor families, only if the family makes some sacrifices
Kids in **very** poor families, they have to worry about food first
And owning a computer is a pretty big prerequisite to being computer literate
Once you own a computer, hopefully also have an Internet connection, a cracked version of Microsoft Office 2007 and hopefully some curiousity, it's pretty easy to get going simply by experimenting
I am 14 (when school starts I'll be in year 8) and I'm still not confident in my computer skills; I never used a pc, I do have a laptop, but I don't use it that much
I can kinda do basic stuff like create a word document or using PowerPoint, however I still have  *a lot* to learn, I'm also rlly concerned about the fact that I don't know how to properly use the laptop or pc, since I know very well I will need it in the future
I'm sure I can find some tutorials on yt, but I'd like to learn more
I am now trying to teach myself, I hope it will turn out ok
I would give you an award, but I don't have reddit coins
There was actually a whole study/interview thing, which stated that Romania's youth, aged 16-24, mostly dont know how to use a computer for basics
Only 54% answered that they can
And basics are browsing internet, browsing files and using apps like word, zoom etc
Its sad :( we are among the leaders of internet power and quality, yet half of our young dont know how to use it
It was kind of popular among people younger than 40 about 5 years ago, but people got bored of it, and you barely hear of it now
That may be because ecstasy has become the most consumed drug here, especially at music festivals
Fairly popular amongst teenagers, still very taboo amongst older people( even medical marijuana )
It is very popular, but it's illegal
People who are afraid of law don't want to have anything to do with it
If you try it your family will call you a degenerate and will shame you for it until you die
I lived in Birmingham for a while and I could smell weed more than I did cigarettes in Romania
Literally every bus stop and park smells of weed there
it gets annoying
Romanian is mostly pronounced exactly like it's written so different spellings are uncommon or not very dramatic
Examples: Andreea/Andreia, Teodor/Theodor, Elisa/Eliza, Mihael/Mihail
Basically if two diphtongs can sound similar, or if the "s" sound tends to morph into a "z", or if there can be a silent "h" somewhere
With modern or foreign-inspired names, the sky is the limit haha
Mălina/Alina/Arina/Aruna - they're essentially different names
I’d also add Isabela/Izabela
Daiana is a legit Romanian name, and if it's an Italian school the probability for that girl to be Romanian is pretty high
Yes, that's exactly how Polish looks to most other countries
How are you supposed to pronounce "szczy"?
I’ve been learning English since 6’th grade, through high school and again some specialized courses in college
I’m now close to 40 year old and I just realized something
You know those spelling competitions
I sometimes see kids on TV or in a movie doing their best at spelling unusual words
Without any relation to the post, my brain decided that now is the time to ask ‘are those contests a thing in English native speaking countries
Are they real
Do they really exist
Did any of you non native speakers go through a spelling class
I don’t remember such a thing happening in all my learning experience
Agreed
Please excuse my english
Such poetry, much amaze
Thine language be excused
my parents & I left Romania, and everyone leaves Romania really
we live in the US now but honestly after I finish school here I’d like to move back to Europe
maybe not Romania (beautiful country just corrupt)
It a actually is quite simillar
Word by word, “Cale ferată” means ironed way
Same in Romanian
We add "feroviar". Although we use Cale Ferată (ironed way) to mean a railway
Yeah the Carpathian mountains
There are some areas that are inaccessible so there are no villages close
Yes, plenty of wilderness left, although it is threatened and reducing by the day
Logging, development etc
If you want to see a cool documentary on it watch Untamed Romania on Netflix
I think it wouldn't shock anyone anymore
And tbf, if we were to elect someone born somewhere else that *can actually speak the language correctly*, would be so nice
I'm honestly tired of politicians that could barely finish high school
Yes, because we are racist
He is
He’s German
Coaie sunt atat de multi handicapati care il injura pt numele sau dar in principiu nu cred ca majoritatea are o problema cu el avand in vedere ca e deja la al doilea mandat
We don't have that sort of paper, but Digi24 (TV channel) pre 2017 was the only halfway decent one
Maybe not that much
I mean "The Duck in Chains" might refer to the fact that they want to enchain the fake news and make solid ones instead
Now probably Recorder
Wow, I am surprised that someone outside of Romania knows about Recorder
Yes, it's true that they have some fantastic stuff out there, but at the moment, they are mainly focused on local governments, outside the occasional documentary
But they are definetely my favorite Channel
I am Romanian but living in the Netherlands
Tried to add both tags but only one is being displayed
Scuze de confuzie :D
Sorry for misinterpreting your flair
Iti urez o zi a prajiturii buna
Probably Serbia
We’ve been neighbours since forever now and we never fought against each other
Not so relevant now, but for the 19th and 20th century I would also say France
Modern Romania wouldn’t exist as we know it today without the French
Probably Moldova because we used to be a country and most of Moldova's population wants us to be a country back
I guess our Serbian and fellow Yugoslavian brothers (not counting Moldavians because they are blood related)
Just like with Czechoslovakia we were very emotionally affected by what happened there and, regardless of our regime or allies, we supported them in anyway we could
I don't know the reasons but I can tell you we truly like all of them
In the middle ages we were surrounded by three major nations: the Habsburgs, the Ottomen and the Russians
Habsburgs took our Transylvania, the Ottoman Empire vassaled us, that leaves us only with Russia, as our oldest friend
Definetely not best one, but one indeed
I think they helped us unite
Our current best friends are Moldova and Bulgaria
Moldova, because, well
and Bulgaria because we share a lot of similarities, we both entered the EU at the same time, we are neighbours etc
Germany is the guy that fucked his crushes Austria and Czechoslovakia, but he also wanted to fuck Poland
She didn't want that, so he raped her and Poland told that to the headmaster Mr
Allies
We like you too :) I am from Timisoara and during the weekends (such as today), you can hear more Serbian than Romanian in the central area of the city
Good to see more Serbs come visit here and I hope the reverse is also true
There's a saying: Romanians have fought woth all their neighbours, except Serbs and the Black Sea
No Russia for us :)
Russia
Our friend
What did you smoke bro
I mean if it was WW2, then it should be Romania since we not only wanted to respect our alliance and provide military help despite being already rather pro-German, but we also helped the Polish govt and army escape Poland through Romania and we kept the Polish national treasure safe during the war
I would probably see that coming somehow, as more and more Moldovans come to Romania
Not unless there are made major reforms, our economy grows and we convert into €.
They helped us unite
We can relate to that
Pretty shocking we get along so well for being in the Balkans :) cheers to that
We love you too\~
Uhm no, Russia opposed the union between Moldova and Wallachia, France helped us unite
Well we know who else isnt Slav and you really dislike them a lot
It depends
for some there are 2 such countries, for some only 1
Well yes because they are cheap and the fabric is good
I mostly don't care about t-shirts
i think yes
I would say
Stupid
As in we joke about ourselves being stupid, others being stupid, stupid situations, stupid outcomes, stupid solutions to difficult problems, difficult solutions to stupid problems, etc
Maybe this is self-deprecating
But it's mostly about lack of intelligence or knowledge
Also we're smart asses
We're the guy that goes "well, can you
" when someone asks if they can have whatever
Dark and nihilistic
Sometimes I wonder if people are joking or are just criticizing themselves
I’m kind of positive guy so the balance it’s hard to see for me
A lot of insults and attacks
Intonation and pronounciation play a big role in how funny the joke is gonna be
I think Romania is one of the funniest country ever we make fun of everything
We have some words like "haz de necaz" which translates to make din of a bad situation
"Misto" making fun of someone and others I think we have the most curse words too
We have a saying in Romanian: "a face haz de necaz", which roughly translates as "make fun of misfortune". Most of the time is self misfortune
I think that perfectly describes the kind of humour that exists in Romania
Miserable life in Sweden
Wow
Couldn't have described it better myself
I understand
I was about to say I didn't recall such things happening here but then I remembered our national treasure, Vadim Tudor, ex MEP and senator, when he was alive (until 2015) he would frequently yell and curse out people in public disputes, often calling them really weird insults (like crazy chicken, hell midget, rabid bitch, cattle with shoes, vomited crow
these don't really make much sense in english but oh god the dude was comedy gold) or even straight up swearing on live TV (typical romanian swears like fuck your mother's dead relatives, calling people handicapped as an insult), [here] are some of his best moments of this kind, he and his weird insults became a very well known meme for us
He probably sounds awful but he was actually a really well read and knowledgeable person, much more than most of our actual politicians, he actually came really close to becoming president in 2000 (2nd place) and he's pretty well liked within the country
Well Ceaușescu had another kind of breakdown live in broadcast
In Romania, we had Corneliu Vadim Tudor, but I'm sure you can count it as a nervous breakdown or just Vadim being Vadim
Here is a sample: [
Ah yes, there was this political debate and a politician (?) got mad and throwed his water in the face of a woman who took part at debate
And people judge you for not having better performance than other politicians before the pandemics time
While I agree he was an excellent meme, he was a terrible politician
A bit of a fascist if you ask me
I was also thinking about Vadim, but can you really call that a mental breakdown or just Vadim being Vadim
Usually, a mental breakdown implies a change in behavior
there was no change with Vadim :)))
He wasn't a terrible politician, but let's just say glad he didn't get to dictate the foreign policy and declare war on Hungary
That Iliescu, a corupt politician that grabed power at the 89 revolution, is older then earth and will never die
Also the Dacians created the time machine
Dacians invented TVs, math, the internet, Space travel, etc
There is a group of people (small and pseudo-intellectual/idiotic) that claims that dacians invented the Latin language
So the meme is that dacians invented everything
There's also a joke that goes:
In France archeologists found cave paintings and determined that the French invented art
In England archeologists found metal arrow heads and determined that the English invented metallurgy
In Romania archeologists found nothing and determined that the Romanians invented the wifi
I sell Golf 4
The Gouvernment
The Szekelyland
Iliescu never dies
Jesus, does he live at the Palace of Versailles
Sadly for you, we exist

This is *killing* me
I've been laughing for waaay too long
Different spellings in different languages
English says ‘Bucharest’, Romanian says ‘București’.
*raises hand*
I apologize for my ignorance but is a chocolate bread the same thing as a croissant
I mean, i love garlic, but to each his own, right
I'm not interested even in the politics of my country
[Hoia Baciu Forest] this place is not only haunted but paranormal activities of each kind are reported every year like ghosts, portals to other dimensions, UFO activity, gravitational anomalies and even witches that uses the forest for special rituals using the high mystical aura of the place
Its a very popular spot for tourists, ghost hunters and alien hunters but most locals would prefer to keep distance from that place
In Romania we have the famous [Hoia-Baciu forest]
Hoia Baciu Forest
It's a haunted forest where people seen ufo's, ghosts, witches and different paranormal things
It is right outside Cluj-Napoca so it can be visited while visiting the city, which is absolutely superb
How popular is underage drinking in your country
Here, in Romania, once you get into highschool (around 15) the drinking parties start and once you hit actual legal age, you already have countless drunk experiences, or, at least, that was(is, as I'm not 18 yet) experience
About the buying of alcohol, at any shop which is not part of a chain, I'm sure they would give any alcohol to a 5 year old
How about your countries
Edit: Thanks for all the answers
This is my first post on reddit and I'm on vacation right now and it makes me happy to see my notifications overflow, although I can't answer to everything
I'll try to upvote everything :)
Let’s be honest, we Europeans love our alcohol
I think it’s pretty hard to not had tasted it at least once before 18
my dad used to give me sips of beer when i was 4
In Ireland they take it really serious
If you're under 18 it is against the law to purchase alcohol, drink in a public space, pretend to be 18+ in order to buy it, be in a pub after 9 or 10pm
At home alcohol cannot be served to <18 without the consent of a parent or guardian
I spend my adolescence in Romania, so I can relate to most romanian opinions
I got drunk for the first time at 13, my dad used to give some (5-10ml) before dinner to prevent food poisoning, quit drinking at 25
I was a social drinker, didn't like to get drunk and I hated in the morning after
Don't like the beer, hate the taste of vodka but I wouldn't say no to a glass of nice dry wine from time to time
I'm 16 and I have never tasted alcohol and I never will because personally I've seen how it can ruin peoples lives when misused
I might have an unpopular opinion but F Alcohol
here just say "i buy this drink for my father" and that's it
Excluding supermarkets
That's 100% accurate,(I live in Salaj,which is an average region,so I can't really talk about other parts), but just going at night around the city you can see the problem
Even some of the 'most enlightened' among highschool students get shitface drunk so much they are barely able to move
I used to drink a lot too, but I've been 100% sober for the past 6 months
As for the 5 year old buying alcohol,I was at a  Carrefour once and a kid was in front of me, he had all types of shit on the conveyor belt like cheese and milk and a yes, a 2
5L bottle of Beer
The cashier was a young girl and she had a sticker saying that she was new so I thought she would say something,a few seconds pass and an older chasier comes and looks,I look at her,she looks at the boy and comes to help the girl
I thought, "Something is gonna happen".She scans the beer like it's no big deal and let's him go like he just bought water
meirl :)))
18 is the legal purchasing age, not drinking at home age
You can drink at home if you are 15 and your parents are dumb enough or ignorant enough to buy you alcohol
Though, I don't like underage drinking, and the only time I ever drank alcohol was a small sip when I was 14
Damn, had no idea there was a country in Europe where there is no drinking age
Haven't actually thought it would be like that in countries more towards the west of Europe
You are kinda explaining more in detail the situation here with this comment with a few exceptions
Ironically enough, right now, I'm with another 7 people(family and friends) at a tavern, in Greece, having a mythos :)
Yeah, I'm always mindblown in a way when I hear Americans talk about drinking before 21 like a crime
It's kind of the same here, but i feel like it also depends much on your group of friends
I also have friends in my group who don't drink at all
Didn't mean anywhere specific but I guess at home it's even earlier, as was in my case
Field
That doesn't seem a friendly environment for a teen to experience the effects of alcohol
When you just want the experience u don't even give a shit anymore
First time I was curious about drinking was at 13 I drank at home alone a quarter of a jack bottle among some other booze taken from my parents
I hated Jack and I hate it now but I just wanted the experience
And why change it, like ppl say, it's just part of our identity seems like
I don't think it's such a big problem since drinking  is part of the culture in many places of the world, but drinking as much as going into a comma, yea,  that's not quite ok
It's a constant surprise reading these comments :O
Had no idea so many countries had their drinking age down at 16
Same for me
I started drinking at like 13 from leftover alcohol in the house
I was stunned to find out my parents had noticed but didn't say anything :)
It's nice to have someone teach you as most parents, as I'm noticing, just let you go with the flow but I liked to experience it myself
Smoking problem is here too
I have not and will never smoke
I haven't even tried a puff but 75% of my mates had already started or tried to snake at around 14
Your own opinion and people should respect it
I am the same with tobacco
Well, I wouldn't know
My reddit age is 2 days
I think u can figure out my region from my name :) Its the same here, I'm in arguably the 2nd best highschool in the city
About the kid, I would've thought he was shopping for his parents since he had all kinds of products
Yea, I'm leaving Scotts alone :)
Have never heard of such thing as drinking at 15
The only thing I hear in Romania is 18, 18 and 18
Same here, smoking is a big problem as well
Maybe you should go outside more (:
No he didn't
I omitted this part because it didn't fit in
He didn't have enough money so he runs out of the store,I went to a different cashier and got out before he came back,if he did
I will if I'll find it anywhere
Thanks :)
Waaaait, so you are telling me that if I go to a store and put a beer on the counter, the cashier is allowed to call the cops on me
Mad shit
The main parties are the following:
PSD (Social Democrat Party) - the party that is essentially the descendent of the Romanian Communist Party
They are known to appease old people by promising to raise their pensions (and sometimes actually doing it)
After they get in power, they do close to nothing related to any of their promises or political spectrum alignment and instead put their family in state jobs and inflate contracts to pocket the difference
PNL (National Liberal Party) - the party that publicly supports the free market, small businesses, cutting pensions and not raising the minimum wage
Apart from that, when they come in power they kick the people from PSD out of state jobs and put their family in those jobs
They essentially do a switcheroo
As I like to describe them - _personal opinion_ - they're PSD but they don't even raise pensions
USR and PLUS (Save Romania Union and Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party) - two new parties founded to essentially take on the old corrupt parties and finally do something for the country
They had a decent success at the European elections and, despite having some internal struggles, - _personal opinion_ - they're the best we have for now
They are in the process of merging into one party named USRPLUS
PMP (People's Movement Party) - after spending two terms (10 years) as a president and seeing his former party - PDL (Democratic Liberal Party) - disintegrate and then reform as PNL, Traian Băsescu created his new party
I don't know much about their policies
ALDE (The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats) - same as PMP except instead of Traian Băsescu it was Călin Popescu Tăriceanu after being kicked out of the party he was formerly in
Until PSD lost the government a couple of years ago, ALDE was in alliance with PSD
UDMR (The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) - a party that represents the Hungarian minority in Romania
Many people informally say - _their personal opinion_ - that they are an internal terrorist organisation because they frequently demand that a region in the centre of Romania where Hungarians are the majority needs to become an autonomous region, a thing that is unconstitutional
I would also add that PSD has been quite ultranationalist in the last years and also anti-LGBT
Not to mention they had some anti-EU speeches last year
Italians wear clothes to hide strings of spaghetti growing out through their skin, like hair on normal humans
When they need to cook pasta they just lift their shirt and cut the amount they need
True story
In Romanian the standard one i would say is "fie", but in my (Transylvanian) dialect, I'd say "no binie", "no" being a filler word being used the same way as its equivalent in Hungarian or Polish or even German, "binie" being a dialectal version of "bine" meaning "good"
"În fine" could also count, even if as translation it works more as "Whatever", at least around Bucharest its more of a "fair enough", same systematic usage, at the end of arguments or discussions
"În" means "in", "fine" i think refers to final, so kinda means "in final".
i think "treaba ta" works in this context
I'm not even from Transylcania and I often use 'na'.
Given names ("prenume") and family name ("nume de familie" or simply "nume")
When a marriage takes place, the spouses choose which will be the family name out of their two
Except in rare occasions, both spouses will take the chosen name
Children will then have that family name
At divorce, the person who changed their family name at marriage can choose to keep the current family name or revert to the pre-marriage one
The given name can be any name, as long as the letters used are part of the Romanian alphabet
The - (dash) symbol is also allowed
An example of a commonly given name that uses the dash is "Ana-Maria".
Although people with multiple (commonly only two) given names almost always choose one they prefer and call the others "middle names", the concept of middle name doesn't exist legally
In formal communication, the family name is always written first, which is the opposite to most English-like countries
When someone presents themselves as "Datcu Ion" (random name chosen), "Datcu" would be the last name and "Ion" the first name
We don't really have the concept of "middle names". The family name is the last name
All your given names are considered "first names".
In school and other official scenarios, the last name is used first, which doesn't make sense since the word for last name in Romanian is "**pre**nume" which literally translates to "before name".
We usually get one or two first names
If you're my father, you'd ask around what name to give me, settle on 3, but can't decide on which, and have everyone who sees your son's full name say something like "Wait
You have 3 first names
WTF
The wife traditionally gets her husband's last name, and so do the offspring
Though there is nothing legal preventing other arrangements, it's just not common
The most extreme Romanian name I can think of is of a former Prime-Minister, who has 3 first names (Călin Constantin Anton) and a hyphenated last name (Popescu-Tăriceanu)
Some very outdated institutions may ask you to write your name with your father's initials between the first name(s) and the last
At most, that could be considered a sort of middle name
There are some common-sense rules on names you *can't* give to children, like you can't use obscene words, but other than that you can name them anything you want
Well first it's your surname (usually it's your father surname) + name + your middle name (if u have one)
Exemple: Grigorescu Ioana Maria
Grigorescu is the surname, Ioana is the name and Maria the middle name ;-;

I'd go pet me some fishies at the bottom of the black sea
i would probably be a tailor, making dresses for the rich and dreaming of wearing them some day
Based on my family linage I would be a farmer living under the Austrian Emprie, probably married (21) with somebody as poor as me, with a child
Married working on some farm with 4 kids at age 20
Probably a blacksmith,mostly because my grand-grandfather and grandfather were blacksmiths
How patriotic
Accurate
Well, aren't you fancy
And alive
Unless you try really hard and believe in yourself
Get well
Long live the Emperor
I support the Republic of China strongly, yes
The communist territory is illegitimate, and should be known to be illegitimate on a global scale
I know it's a typo, but "Easter Europe" brings me a smile
Sadly, that's the only thing about your comment that makes me smile, since you seem to be right
In romania we say he lives in Lapland(Laponia) and sometimes at the North Pole
The North Pole of course
He hunts the Coca Cola Polar bear with a rifle that shoots candy canes
Basically, wherever he wants, isn't he super rich to be able to give away gifts for every child on the planet
But for now, I think he's in Laponia
Probably in a sauna, chillin'.
Ok, I don't really know the details as I'm not Christian and I haven't been raised in a family as such, but here in Romania we celebrate both Christmas and Saint Nicholas
On the eve of 6th of December kids are instructed to clean their boots and in the morning St Nicholas would have left sweets amd oranges in them
If they are not clean, it would be a stick
And on the Christmas itself they celebrate the birth of Christ and the Christmas with the usual gifts
Roma culture still has some
First time
This does not sound very "german" are you using Italian/ Spanish or Romanian project managers
That's hilarious
In Romanian, we have "dor", which is used when you want to express the feeling of missing something
It could be another human being, an object, another emotion
It can express nostalgy, love, melancholy
It is a very porwerful word
It is a noun however, we have a different proper verb for "to miss smth".
E.g. Mi-e dor de zilele cu soare
(Rough translation: I miss the sunny days)
2nd e.g. Am așa un dor să te sărut
(Rough translation: I have such a desire to kiss you)
There is a saying we use quite often, "Spor la treabă!" or its abbreviated version, just "Spor
" whenever someone says they're gonna do something that requires time or patience or hard work or all of them
It could roughly be translated to "may you be productive" but it's quite a loose equivalence and it always frustrates me that I can't find a better alternative
I'm including an example for clarity
A: I'm gonna start working on my essay
B: Spor
“Aoleu”. Like a more urgent and dramatic version of “Alas”.
Sisu is ‘Grit’.
Uimahalli is ‘Poolhall’.
Update: Uimahalli is not ‘Poolhall’, but ‘Poolhall’ should totally be uimahalli
I love architecture so I wouldn’t name any building a “monstrosity”, however the obvious answer is the Palace of Parliament
That think is unnecessary big, opulent and in general it’s existence seems pointless
The Former house of the people
The nowadays  palace of parliament ( Romania)
[Catedrala Mântuirii Neamului (Romania)]
Oh god i so hate those communist blocks everywhere
1947-1989 was just the worst for romania
Yeah, and a priest usually teaches
Although in my high school we had at one point a guy that wasn't a priest, but had a PhD in religious studies or something
In my experience religion class is so-so
I had crazy bigots and I had normal individuals teach it
Most of the priests that came to my class were pretty normal and we would talk about random stuff
Mostly about our issues as teenagers, like popularity, how to be an individual, how to prepare for adulthood
We had a priest teach us about bureaucracy (how to get your first ID)
It was basically just an hour of random discussions
They do but it's optional and at least in my highschool u can choose between orthodox and Catholic
They teach it for people who ar religious and are interested in learning stuff about it
yes, it's a dandy time to do your homework for the math class that follows
Yes, but only Orthodox Christianity in most schools and most teachers are dumbasses that deny the existence of science and medicine
Luckily religion is optional but most kids take it because it improves their grade average and you can get a max grade by just showing up
Yes, but not sure why
It's not mandatory, but if you don't want to do it there are papers to be filed (i.e. you don't opt to do it, you only have the option to request not doing it; it's not mandatory in the sense that you don't need to give a reason for why you don't want it)
Most students do it though, since those classes are usually a joke (no tests or time consuming assignments) and it's basically a guaranteed full mark course that pumps up a bit your semester average score (pe, music and visual arts are also guaranteed 10, but those are mandatory)
Yeah, Romanian schools have 1 hour per week which parents can opt-out their kids from
It’s the same as Italy, though depending on your luck, if your parents don’t opt you out and you get a nice, indifferent teacher, you can skip the class and only come at the end of the year
Yeah
They do
Idk why they teach it
Perhaps to  teach kids about god
If thats the case,they are kinda failing
In my school we do, and i think almost all of romanian schools do
Because religion is a big part of Romania
I'm not religious but i go to the religion classes
Yes, unfortunately
And it's because the church has a lot of power here, and there's *a lot* of religious parents who would go berserk about religion being removed from schools
The power of the church isn't as in-your-face as in say, Russia, but it's definitely there, in more subtle ways
To give you an idea, the Romanian Orthodox Church ordered a huge mural to be painted over because it depicted St George in some random non-religious context
The mural was in a plaza with the same name, where there is also a church with that name
They deemed it to be offensive to the orthodox Church and blasphemous
Now, the mural was fucking ugly if you ask me, but the point is not my personal taste, but the meaning behind this action
Yes, we don’t know why
Probably so the priest/teachers get some money
They should teach religion history, that would be something else, even useful
They do
And you can choose whether you want to do it or not, (but your mother, grandmother and other relatives will try and shove the religion down your throat if you dont want to anyway)
Same system in Romania as far as I know
I don't approve
Haha here if you debate the teachers they get angry because you don't accept the word of God
At my highschool we mostly went to visit a church and got a 10 for it
The teacher was indeed bonkers and I've argued with them on at least one occassion but we didn't do anything in depth
Priest teachers are aboslutely insane
I had one tell me we shouldn't believe in medicine cus it's just doctors being selfish and wanting your money, so you should give that money to the church
Some other priest asked one of my classmates, who didn't learn her prayer for that day, if the reason she didn't prepare for the lesson was because she was busy s***ing her boyfriend's d. Obviously, nothing happened to him
From what i know religion is optional
Man, in high-school (and I went to an art high school, N. Tonitza) we had a teacher one year who was fucking insane
She was this old witch who did not want to hear anything against God, ever
She made us watch a graphic documentary about why abortion is a sin and we would go to hell if we did it
Most of us were extremely outraged, a girl got a panic attack from seeing upclose videos of dead fetuses
Being the type of high school this is, you can imagine how this went down
We made a scene and went to the principal and she got kicked out, thankfully
But the sheer fact that this crazy old lady was hired baffles me to this day
Our religion teacher tells us in every class that evolution is not real
Fun times
They do teach about history of religion and other big religions, but just in 11th and 12th grade
>It's optional in terms of "everyone is signed up by default but you can opt out of it if your parents sign a huge stack of papers and get to reason with the religion teacher and principal, both of whom will try to advise against dropping out and convince them that they're wrong and the school knows what it's doing".
It's like this in many other European countries, like Italy, Poland, etc
Look around this thread
But you are exaggerating a bit
It is optional in the sense that you only need one paper signed by a parent and no reason or explanation beyond that
Sure, like 10 years or so ago, it was a bit more difficult, but this is history today
In my highschool u sign up for it at the beginning of any year like any other optional subject
Now you have to sign up for it
Exactly
Why are some people exaggerating in order to prove that Romania is bad and is the only one that does these stuff
Your parents sign one paper
No big deal
Might be an isolated case
I graduated almost 5 years ago and all my parents had to do was sign a paper
I took religion though most of the years because that's just another easy maximum grade to add to the overall average
Well, the right to not do the class is assured
I don't deny though that some schools/teachers ignore this right (though nowadays it is rare, since they might lose their job)
It seems to me that the priest is maybe doing this because he is afraid of everyone quiting and losing the extra money from teaching
It is illegal though to force the kids to do it and not accept those papers
Forcing kids who don't have the religion corresponding to the class is even more so
The parents of the children at that school are free to seek a lawyer and sue the school
tell him to watch [eurotrip] in preparation for his trip
Is it not in Spain
We even have this in Romania
Huh
This is a weird habit I have too
I wonder if it has anything to do with interacting with a lot of Germans as a kid and basically growing up on your media
Not all clothes tho, just socks and underwear
Not so much, it just gets strangers to strike up random conversations with me a lot
Cluj Napoca, Iasi, Timișoara something else but not Bucharest listen to me NO BUCHAREST
Brașov - big city, central position, a good example of multiculturality
I would make Romania have 3 capitals
Each for the three historical regions
Bucharest for Wallachia, Iași for Moldova and Cluj-Napoca for Transylvania
Build a new one on the ruins of Sarmizegetusa
It’s the oldest recorded capital we have
Hahah but imagine tourists trying to pronounce Székesfehérvár lmao
Why on Earth would we move our capital to a city even closer to the border like Timisoara or Iasi
From a defensive point of view it would be awful to defend
We would want a city in the center of the country, so something like Brasov would be the best option
Move it to Constanta for the lulz
All of Bucharest seems to move here for the summer anyway so why not make it a permanent move
Look at cities like Berlin, Vienna and Bratislava they are all on the border
It is a nice city actually
That's a cool name then haha
One thing is for sure, if Romania and Hungary changed capitals nobody would ever confuse Bucharest and Budapest again lol which happens a lot
Hahah a former hungarian city have you ever heard of Napoca pr Napocaum
In Alba Iulia are no hungarians
Yeah, so what's your point
Look at Brazil for example
The former capital of Brazil was Rio de Janeiro and it was a coastal city
It was then changed to Brasilia which is in the center of the country
This has a number of advantages, from defensive to administration
It would be therefore more beneficial to have a city like Brasov as our capital rather than say a border city, which could be more developed, but harder to defend and run the country from
Yes, it's still an argument
There's an obvious advantage to having your capital at a considerable distance from the border, as opposed to having it right next to it
If it was at the border it would be in a significantly more dangerous situation, as it would quickly become a war zone and if the enemy takes it, the entire command of the country would be crippled
Why risk it all when you could put your capital in the center of your country from where you could better run it from and also defend it better
Read my reply again
The answer is yes and I explained why
You don't want your capital city to become a warzone and endanger the entire command structure by having it there
Every country it's important in its own way
We are important because of the cheap labor mostly
Also Eu imports our wood, which is good for EU, but not so much for us because the high demand makes som business people from here to cut our forest illegally
Having one of the best internet speed in the world brings a lot of IT companies
We have a port on the Black Sea connecting europe to Middle East and even more meaning that a lot of trade goes through Romania
Not to forget our landscapes, Danube Delta ([second biggest delta in Europe and the best preserved on the continent] ),and so much more
You can watch a documentary on Netflix named [Flavours of Romania] if you're interested in seeing more about Romania
So important that if we would not be in it no other country in EU would notice
Eh, I'm pretty sure there are more than 1 black sheep
I recently watched a video about an incredible underwater tunnel project between Helsinki and Tallinn
It seems some already use the freedom of movement to commute
Please explain how it's EU's battery
It sound extremely intriguing
9th place
In the current system, our guarantee is that we can veto EU decisions on foreign policy
That being the case, I like that we have someone that actually leads us at the moment
The unanimity thing is a double edged sword
On the one hand  it risks blocking EU, as it does on sanctioning Hungry and Poland (we can't take theirs voting rights)
On the other hand, I do believe it helps in assuring small countries that theirs priorities are EU's priorities
I thought you had something like UK's lake-battery (they have two connected lakes that are used to provide energy when demand is high and store it when demand is low)
They are generating electricity, not storing it
When I read battery i thought about storing
The British pump the water back to store it
[There is a great video by Tom Scott about it
Well over here it is free, but not really cus we have to bribe the doctors
It is not uncommon for people to bring wads of cash to the public doctor
The downside, in my opinion, is having all these tax money in governement's hands, trusting it to organize an efficient healthcare system for everybody
If corruption is high, you end up with a weak medical system that eats alot of money and having to also pay for private healthcare, more expensive for you
I still believe "free" healtcare is the way to go, just making sure corruption level in your country is low
Well, in Romania there's this capitalist mentality of squeezing as much money out of you as possible
So when you need to get some analysis done you have 2 options: you go with a note from your primary care physician and get it for free, but in a month or 2 (at worst), OR you pay for it completely out of pocket and get it done right away
This happens because getting back the money from the government (for the medical center that did the analysis) takes some time
You have to submit the paperwork once a month and you get the money back in another month or something like this
So that capital is basically "blocked" for a couple of months
And if you love €€€, you'll prefer "clients" that pay out of pocket and you'll prioritize them
In some situations this can happen with a doctor's visit as well
But it's never been more than a month's wait for me
Ever
In Germany, one issue I noticed is that "people keep going to the doctor". Because most medical things are free if you have a doctors note and insurance, people go to the doctor for anything at any time
So in a small town, for a specialty like gynecology it will be super difficult to find a "free spot". When I arrived in my small German town it took me about 24 phone calls to find a gynecologist that could take me as a patient
And I have a friend that had some dermatological issue and all the dermatologists in our town were booked for the next several months
So she had to go to the next town (20 min by train) for a dermatologist that could see her the next week
So here, in Germany, it's pretty difficult to get an appointment with a specialist in a small town, but not that difficult in a bigger city
And this disadvantage is not that much of a problem, when you have so many other advantages that can help you overcome it
Like in Germany you get 30 days of paid vacation, so if it's a dramatic situation, you can just take a day off and go to another town and then move to a doctor in your city
And the public transportation system is great (compared to Romania) so you can even go to the next town over and come back before lunch
Edit: the "people going to the doctor all the time" was how a German dude explained to me why I can't find a specialist that can see me in a week
Nobody middle class and above uses the public healthcare system bc it’s so shit
At least in Bucharest, most people use private clinics - no waiting times, excellent care, hospital chains all over the city
Or gifts, like expensive wines, flowers, or even food
I'd youre in a big town, like Bucharest, but have a family farm somewhere, doctors will prefer to have some natural eggs and meat from that farm rather than the hormone filled ones you'd find in super markets
Sauce: we did that with my grandpa's oncologist
Even if we already paid for treatments, we brought her foods from his farm
She helped him beat cancer once and live for 5 years more
We have only respect for her
Well my grandfather has a chicken farm in covasna, maybe I could bring down some eggs
It used to be common as putting on shoes, especially in the communist period and it's something that stuck with us
People used to do it to get better treatment, better beds/room and extra attention (especially as the staff was/is not enough to cover all patients)
The problem comes from both medical staff that expect/accept the bribe and the patients (or their family) who give and also insist on giving the bribe
Nowadays less and less are expecting money/gifts, as their income was increased and we had it covered by news, called out on social media and so on (it was always illegal, just overlooked and socially accepted)
A relative of mine, that works in medical care, arrived at work one morning and all the staff was eating apples
It was because the family of a patient couldn't accept the idea of not giving money to them and just came with approx
10 kg of apples and left them there
Heard the apples were really good
Wdym shit
What are you referring to
But ask first
We asked before giving her things like that
This is a good idea if youre accustomed to that doctor and they know you
Considering they'd need special ways to take those home and store them, so if you bring eggs at 10am and rhey leave at 10pm, the eggs may go bad or things like that
Ask first, they'll mostly be happy to receive good food
Heard a story of someone who received a whole live chicken in a bag and had to keep it in the office somehow the whole day
Ah, well
sadly, yeah
Romania is very corrupt and people are always greedy
A lot of doctors are also crazy
health care here isn't great, at least public
Private is worlds apart, but it's also extremely expensive
It's not all bad, just don't get sick
Polish words are like babies invented it
Other languages: “Why can’t you just be normal
Polish: *Czscréamsz
Every European language has it's own lovable quirks
But Hungarian, oh boy
Luxembourgish sounds like a failed fusion of German and French
When Finns speak Finnish it nearly sounds like a robot to me
Hungarian is weird, but I’m Romanian so I only know
“Kurtoskalacs” “Basz meg” and “gyere ide”
What is Basque
Nobody knows
Sometimes Swedish pronouncinations are really weird
(One time someone said Det är -> De-e)
Dutch
It makes NO sense sometimes
I often ask my friends if I said something correctly or not and they are actually unsure sometimes
(Especially with de/het)
It also sounds like the drunken child of german and english
The german counting system really fucked my mind during the first years
Literally every other language: one hundred twenty three
German: one hundred three and twenty
Is there any other european language that does this
(apart from austrian or other german dialects)
I've been living in germany for 7 years now and still can't use the cases correctly lol
We are 90% Latin
I knew Romanian was gonna be in this thread but damn didn't think it would be the second top comment
As someone who learned German (Hochdeutsch) as a second language, I find Swiss German much easier to understand than the gibberish spoken in Bavaria
The north regions are pretty weird too
Hochdeutsch is a hoax
- Hey Romania, are you a latin country
- Da
This is the most accurate description and it makes sense
I think it's due to the low amount of vocals they use
Hahah, you're right
It's like toddler babble before they learn to talk
Imagine learning an entire language,master it like a god to then travel to that country and get slammed in the face with the slang

First name is the family name
Ugh,it's so weird
Well "Romanian:the forgotten romance language" doesn't exist for nothing
Two events,and both have to do with USSR and Romania,during and after WW2
The white fountain massacre
1940,a good couple of thousand romanians tried to escape after the soviets annexed Bassarabia
Right before they crossed the now installed border into Romania,soviet border guards caught them and opened fire
Men,women,children,elder,sick
It didn't matter
They shot them and buried them in a mass grave
And it was denied it ever happened untill 30 years ago
You know
To add insult to injury
The other is the russian deportations from Bessarabia into Siberia
That's even more personal for me,because I lost a big part of my family because of those
Long story short,my great-grandmother was deported with her parents and all 6 of her siblings
She was the only one to return
Why were they deported
Because they were rich peasants(not Jeff Bezos rich,they just had land or bred farm animals),who had their wealth because they worked hard for generations
And the fact that they existed was an ideological challenge to the communist party
So them and others in their position were deported
How many
Nobody knows for sure
Most modern estimates place the death toll around 250
000 people dead in the span of 15 years(1940-1955)
Civilians,not combatants
All because they worked their asses off for generations
The fact that me and others lile me who don't know much about these things is somewhere between our fault and the fact that we couldn't learn this information anywhere
Most of the information was either expunged from records when the deportations stopped or was never recorder at all
Add to that the fact that the communist regime in Romania and the soviet regime in Moldavia made it illegal to research this for almost 60 years,and it will be a subject that few know about enough to start research it
As of today,Russia denies either incident happened and that researching the topic will bring nothing but "unnecessary tension between the two states"(in Voronin's words)
The geo-political version gaslighting
Bold of you to assume that I know anything about history
April 1986 - 3
6/10
the 50's were tough for Romania
the regim started a process of geting rid of the "enemies of the state". this is the time in which most of the upper/higher class, intelectuals and thinkers were wipet out , sent to political prisons or forced labour ( from which most did not return), because the commies wanted to create the "new man". This period of time did alot of damage to our future society , we lost our informal leaders and the echoes of this period are stil felt today in the way our society behaves and what kind of values it cherishes
School starts at 8 am, lessons are 50 minutes long, with 10 minute breaks except for the one at 11 am which is a 20 min lunch break
Most days end at around 1 pm or 2 pm, but it's not uncommon to have longer days especially in highschool or if you have an extracurricular activity
Usually each group of students of a certain grade/year (the average school has like 4-5 classes of \~30 students of the same grade) spends the whole day in one room that's assigned to them, and each teacher would go there for their lesson
There are exceptions like chemistry which can be held at the laboratory instead of the usual room, or English where the class is divided in 2 groups and one group might move to a different room
Sometimes classes are divided on certain subjects like third language, for example one kid might study French but his deskmate studies German, therefore language lessons are synced so that each student can go to his lesson of choice
I'm not sure if the afternoon shift still a thing, certain schools have or used to have some students start at 8 am and other students start at 2 pm
I think it was due to the high number of students and not enough rooms, but many people were against this system
Here, it varied from school to school
I can't remember exact numbers, but I think it was similar: 45 or 50 minutes "school hours" with 5 or 10 minutes break
If breaks were just 5 minutes, there usually would have been a "big recess" of 10 or 15 minutes
When I was in high school, the school had enough room for all the students, so we would all start at the same time (8 or 9 AM, I think)
In primary and middle, at a different school, we shared the classroom with another grade, but one would use it in the morning, while the other in the afternoon
(e.g, 1st graders could use it in the morning, from 7:30 AM, 6th graders could use the same room from 1:30 PM)
Wake up at 6:00 cause my school was in the other side of the city from where I lived, freeze to death in an overcrowded bus station (if it's winter), take the bus to a metro station, then take the metro, which is somehow even more overcrowded than the bus, then take another bus, then smoke 3 cigarettes on an empty stomach cause you were too lazy to cook breakfast, start school at 8:00, get bullied and called names by teachers so old they could die any minute, sneak out of school to smoke a cigarette every break (10 minutes after 50 minutes of class), maybe skip the last hour of class and go have brunch, go home, get yelled at by your parents
Fun times
In Romania we have 6-7 hours of school per day:
Classes start at 8 and they last for 50 minutes, and a 10 minute break after
This cycle repeats for the rest of the day
Afternoon classes are very much still a thing
But some start even at 10-11 am
Ill give you the example of my highschool, which is grades 5-12
(CNB George Cosbuc in Bucharest)
Morning shift starts at 7
30 and ends the latest at 13
45 minute class, 5 minute break, two 10 minute breaks every 3 hrs
Afternoon classes start around lunch, but there are exeptions, like some classes starting at 10
Classes end the latest at 18
Same break system
Biology classes are mostly done in the labs, we dont have a chemistry lab, Computer science and Computer tech classes are done in the computer labs
For English, we are divided into 2 groups, one group stays in the class, the other group uses the demi-sol rooms
We also have English/American natives, as we are a bilingual highschool, grade 9 and 10 have two groups, grade 11 and 12 the whole class
Same would happen if the class is split on third language, my class is all German, but the other classes are half n half usually, so they combine with other half n half classes
We have 6 total 'groups' per year, of around 30 people per class
3 "Real" (maths, computer science), 3 "Uman" (literature, writing, language)
Its a strange system in Romania with these, you have set classes you cant choose, unlike USA or Brittish systems
The "profile" you choose dictates what exams you take
For example, "Uman" students  dont take a maths exam, but they have to take geography or history exam
"Real" students have the hardest math exam, along with computer science and computer tech (unless you take the ECDLs, then its the same as getting a perfect on the tech exam)
All profiles take a Romanian Language and Literature exam
Only difference is that Uman peeps have a few extra books to read (which is unfair since Real peeps still have to know 30+ books by heart, but our system is far from good)
> Morning shift starts at 7
30 and ends the latest at 13
45 minute class, 5 minute break, two 10 minute breaks every 3 hrs
Damn bro that's a tight schedule
And super early too
Is this a recent system
Also, regarding your last paragraph, I gotta add that aside from the theoretical-oriented highschool (which has the Real/Math and Uman/Humanities profiles and sometimes a Stiinte/Sciences one too, focused on biology, chemistry etc), there are schools with other profiles available: arts, sports, economics or certain professions/crafts
Yeah, every group of 30 students has a code like "IX C" (grade 9, third group) and a "homebase", a certain classroom where most lessons are held and it's the teachers who move around from classroom to classroom
Some teachers have their own specialized classroom or laboratory, mostly chemistry, physics and biology but also geography or history, and that's when students are moving around
It's not the norm in Romania, but my high school actually did it the same way as yours
No clue why
At first we thought it was just because the teachers were lazy and would rather have us walk around than them, but it still doesn't make sense, cause the teachers have to go to the lounge every break to switch registers (like the notebook they use for every class to keep track of attendance and grades) with the other teachers that would have to teach to the class they just finished teaching to
Again, no idea why they did this
I was quite the heavy smoker in the last few years of high school, so I'm actually quite surprised that every break I managed to switch classes, drop off my stuff at the new class, sneak out of the school grounds (we were not allowed to leave until the day was over), smoke a cigarette, sneak back in and make it to class before the teacher did (otherwise there would be trouble)
Yes, what u/Sector3_Bucuresti said
Interesting about Moldova though
Does this mean that every student has their own different schedule
Is there more freedom to choose which subjects you take
Its tight but we finish really early, and it goes by fast since youre still half asleep in the morning
Its basically the winter program, but we use it all year
Also its not that bad to be this early, i got used to it
Im a lot more active and attentive in the morning, even if im sleepy
The afternoon program just ruins your whole day
You have to leave home at 10-11 am and you get home at 8pm
Whole day, gone
Yes, im sorry i didnt mention the other profiles
I was mostly reffering to Cosbuc, which is purely theoretic with only Filo ans Maths-CS and next year were getting a Sociology and a Natural Sciences class
Anything is better than the afternoon shift
Yes I forgot about the Sociology profile too
There are so many of them lol
Hah, interesting
I don't think they would have trusted us with the registers, knowing my classmates, some grades would suddenly "improve" and some absence marks would suddenly "disappear". We were not allowed to touch those registers
So the same group of people but a different classroom for every lesson
Similar to faculty groups, right
This is interesting, I've never heard of this system at highschool level before
Hehe, the time when the Drawing (Desen) teacher left the classroom for a smoke and left the register (catalog) in there
We didn't touch the grades, as the teachers had them written in their personal notebook as well, but we did some work on the absemces
The army tried to stage a coup against Ceaușescu in 1984, but it failed because the military unit who was supposed to carry out the plan was sent to harvest corn
In 1989, the dictator at the time and his wife got sentenced to death for economic sabotage and genocide
They were both executed by a military firing squad on Christmas Day
Autumn, 1984, masterminded by the general Nicolae Militaru, who would later support Iliescu
It's also in 1984 when the basis of the future FSN was created, it was just called different back then (the Committee of the National Salvation)
Militaru admitted this in a BBC interview in 1994
Also, The 1989 Revolution was supposed to start in Iasi, but was nipped in the bud, then it broke out in Timisoara
It's pretty documented, but not really mainstream knowledge
Do you have any source for that
Burned the shorts or the people
>which is similar in several romance languages (finestra, fenêtre)
Similar in Romanian, but not quite
Here it's "fereastră"
Easiest answer for a Romanian - 1st of May (Labour Day)
But only when the weather doesn't suck
It's almost illegal **not** to have a barbecue either in someone's back yard, or if you're more working class, in the nearby "spot" (meaning near a forest, lake or any open meadow somewhere)
For example where I grew up, it's near [Ceala Forest]
[Here's what the peak of a normal 1 Mai looks like] It truly is massive
Supermarkets will literally *run out of meats* in the morning, on several occasions I had to go to 2-3 before finding what we needed
By noon, city streets will be empty, everyone's settled down somewhere
We usually have [mici and other stuff like sausages and chicken thighs] on the grill
Or [frigărui] if you're not as lazy as most people (including myself)
The day we move to a foreign country
Jokes aside, it’s probably May 1st
On the one hand it’s Labor Day and the grill-loving people have barbecues
On the other hand it marks the beginning of the summer season, so the other folks head over to the seaside (oftentimes for barbecuing, indeed)
It really is an experience
I always say that barbecue is my favorite meal in the world, not only because of the food itself, but because of the atmosphere around it
Some of my fondest memories are barbecue-adjacent
Whether it was Ceala forest with my classmates, day-drinking and popping sunflower seeds, or on 1st of May on a friend's "shack" in the middle of an field
Football, badminton, huge car speakers providing the soundtrack
> Also every year there's an article in the local news outlets that takes a couple of photos of empty streets of cities that look like ghost towns because everyone is barbecuing somewhere
That's better than we get, here *every single year* there's articles about cops giving out fines to dumbasses who start fires on the ground like [this]
But I love that we have this holiday tradition in common with you guys
I really really hope this year it won't rain, because Orthodox Easter is on May 2nd, so we get a 4-day-weekend that includes May 1st
Damn, she really *did* hate the working class, huh
My father is romanian orthodox and celebrates Christmas on the 25th of december
My mother is russian orthodox and celebrates on the 7th of january
Me and my brothers get to have two christmases and not in the depressing way of saying that
Romanian here
24 th of December is the period when you have Christmas carolers coming over and singing all the cool carols
Usually it is the busiest day, things sorted out in the morning all the stress as it is in a way the finishing touches of all the work with food and stuff like that
Present are also given in the evening
The following day it is more relaxed and you spend time with family
I m from the north in monastery central so quite religious area so people go to all the religious celebrations in the night
I don't really
In highschool we used to go caroling with my highschool mates, so we would go to everyone's house and the houses of teachers we liked
And of course get really really drunk and eat a ton of food
Past years after uni, i assist some of the carolers that my mom receives as a teacher and with former classmates go to a certain amount of houses and see if our livers are still competent ( no they are not )
Also winters in the past 20 years have been complete and utter crap in my area

Can you find a picture of someone who, if you saw them on the street, you would instantly recognize as your co-national based on their features
Inspired by the [facial features thread] that u/wojic posted
I looked for pictures of men and women until I found the most instantly recognizable pictures
I figured that logically, the easier it is to spot someone who belongs to your nationality, the more "typical" features they have
For women I found this [girl] and for men, I found this [footballer] If I would have seen them on the street, I would not doubt for a second that they're Romanian
That guy you use as an example for Romanian men looks like he's related to me
Try to find someone who you'd be 100% sure is Norwegian
What helped me when I searched (at least for finding the footballer) was entering first names + cities
If you try out combinations of Norwegian name + a Norwegian city you get plenty of pictures of regular people
> As for a face I would instantly recognize as Spanish: here
Wow, amazing example lol
> but every once in a while you do see a face that makes you say "that guy is 100% German for sure"
I get that feeling from [our president] It's normal, he's Saxon, but his facial features are a world apart from your average Romanian
I hope others agree with me lol
My idea of what the "typical" Romanian might be different than that of someone from another place
In the southern part of Romania (Wallachia) you'll sometimes meet people with jet-black hair and that look half-Turkish/half-Romanian, probably from mixing during Ottoman days
It's much rarer that you find the same features in Moldova or in Transylvania
I found an [example here] (although it's very low quality)
Edit: [Much better example]
It's not crazy to say that people from certain regions have more typical facial features
Areas around the Bran Castle, the cities of Brasov, Sibiu and Constanta
Compared to countries in the west we don't get that much tourism, so it's not that bad
I really dislike 'tourist traps'.
The beaches I think, but we have many castles were tourists go too
Went to Galicia, had an amazing time, and not very touristy
Hope it stays that way
Next on my list is the mudejar architecture in Aragon
Which is so completely different from the rest of France
I hate Paris but love the rest of France
Thessaloniki is awesome
Very lively and fun place
I sometimes go to spend the weekend there
There aren't that many tourists outside of the high season
I hope it stays that way so people in the know can enjoy it
Don't skip the museums
They are underrrated
Out of curiosity, is visiting the Hungarian-speaking areas of Transylvania a relatively popular thing to do among Hungary Hungarians
Your loss tbh, Oradea is super close to you guys, it is a wonderful town, and is included in a circuit of Art Noveau cities in Europe
It's really quite nice
Also try Alba Iulia and Bucharest
While I'd love for tourism to develop more, because it brings in money, I actually prefer it this way
I do not want my favorite places in my country constantly swarmed with tourists
Some of the most beautiful, relaxing interesting spots are so because there aren't that many people
I'd argue for the inclusion of Bucharest's Old Town in the list
Constanta sort of of sucks if you want to go the seaside
Imo go to Neptun-Olimp or Vama Veche
Honestly I dislike it, and while there are a lot of tourists in the summer, it's mostly us going there not foreigners
I'd not skip Bucharest it has some top notch museums, and really good night life (Coronavirus not withstanding) Also don't be a tourist and stick to the super touristy Old Town
There are so many more old parts worth visiting
Totally understand you
I really don't get how Venetians tolerate such mass tourism
It's super crowded even in low season
Interesting
On a tangential note, I wonder, does the Transylvanian Hungarian dialect differ much from the Hungarian spoken in Hungary
Are there any linguistic differences
Also, for what it’s worth, I think I understand why most Hungarians opt to visit Transylvania over other areas in Romania
a) compared to other areas in Romania, it’s geographically closer to Hungary
b) visiting areas that have a significant percentage of Hungarian speakers probably feels a lot closer to home than visiting, say, Bucharest
c) Transylvania is architecturally prettier
I imagine that, for the same reasons, visiting Southern Slovakia is probably a lot more popular than visiting Bratislava
Well we know the names, but if you ask to locate them on a map we won't probably know
I definitely recognize all the names
I know some random info about some of them
I could even point out 4-5 of them on the map
But of course I keep confusing cities with states (I though Pennsylvania was a city and Philadelphia a state)
And I have zero idea where the desert ends and where the mountains begin
I also had a conversation earlier this week with my mom and we literally couldn't think of another river in the US except for Mississippi
People here don't know them because they don't really care,as for myself
just don't ask me about capitals
Yeah but it's not taught in school or anything, at least where I'm from
We hear about them in movies, so I'm guessing most are familiar with the names
I for one have a keen interest in the American southwest and know quite a lot about those states
Also know a lot about Florida because I've family there and visit often

Ah, the power of context and, in case of the first word, accents
If Non-Europeans countries count then either Japanese or Korean, those makes Romanian grammar seems simple
French
I hate it
It has some words that have no equivalent in romanian at all
I know 3 languages
English, German (not that good) and Romanian
Out of these, Romanian is the hardest
Romance mixed with slavic plus some dacic origins
Ah yes, don't forget our Turkic, German and Hungarian influences
Second is German, mostly because I have a shit teacher that only comes for 15 minutes out of our 50 weekly minutes
Hungarian, i dont wanna be an asshole, but everytime i hear someone speaking it i just start to laugh
Totally
It's like an alien language
Nothing sounds similar with what you expect
it is a very difficult to learn
Well England was conquered by the normans and they ruled it for a while so English is close to French at some degree
Scotch
Lol
1066 at Hastings, William the Bastard who was norman defeated Harold Godwinson and conquered England
Richard Lionheart for example didnt even speak English and spent very little time in England
>You're forgetting that William invited his Barons from Normandy to settle Britain and impose the feudal system, and that most serfs that served these Barons were still English and spoke Old English which has very little, if any, French influence
First of all, I agree with you that William brought with him his norman nobility and that the peasantry spoke the old English but the nobility spoke Norman which in time evolved to an Anglo-Norman dialect of English
Because of that a lot of words relating to ruling comes from french like government, castle, judge, crown
Also there are words like chamber and room, buy or purchase, shirt or blouse that are synonyms but originate from different languages
You can watch Oversimplified video of the battle of Hastings in which he explains in more detail
>Focus, we're not discussing legendary characters that likely didn't even exist, we're discussing linguistics
Very little correlation between the two
I strongly disagree with this
Richard the Lionheart was a real king, Richard I who ruled England from 1189-1199
He was known as the Lionheart because of his bravery and prowess in battle in the crusades, he is a real character, maybe some stories about him are not entirely true but he was a real person
>On a similar note, do you agree that Romanian is close to Russian to some degree
I mean after all, more of Romanian vocab and phonology is of Slavic origin than English is of French
About this, Romanian has slavic and germanic influences but it is not close to Russian, we have a saying "Romania is a latin island surrounded by a slavic sea". Romanian is closer to latin than to any slavic language because the majority of the fundamental vocabulary, which we use every day, is almost 60% coming from latin
I may be wrong here about the procent but the idea is that the majority comes from latin
Yes
It made the continent safer by diminishing tensions between member states
It also gives my homeland opportunities to develop in many domains by offering us european funds to use (but this depends on whether our politicians want to take them or not)
EU has it’s part
It’s not just schengen and not all european countries are in schengen
Romania is not in schengen but is in EU since 2007, and since then, we don’t really need a passport, just our ID Cards, because of EU
And this makes it much easier to travel
Seems like the appropriate Australian way
We have a tax on magic
Do I need to tell more ?
These are some: -vaccines cause autism
-our German-born President is a Nazi
-We are not accepted into Schengen area because The Netherlands want the port of Constanta
We are having a permit for using magic xD
Although not that popular, in Hungary there are some people who deny the existence of Lake Balaton
Some people believe the revolution was entirely orchestrated by the cia and that they used psychotronic mind control machines to tell people what to do, my former history teacher believed this
Another thing is the idea that the dacians where the ultimate civilisation, people say that they created lasers and invented writing, that the Atlantis was in Transylvania and that they actually taught the romans their culture and language, these people also claim they built huge underground cities populated by giants, an entry to such a city they say is the entirely natural rock formation known as [The Sphinx] which they claim is man made and not shaped by the wind
That the 1989 revolution to overtrow the communist regime was a coup organised by the United States
Also that the mosquito spray that they drop in cities to kill mosquitos and other bugs actually gives you cancer because for some reason the government wants you to get cancer
Also a lot of things regarding the Carphatian mountains
From Aliens to Hidden Nuclear bombs lef there by the Ceausescu Regime
Wait what
I had no idea about this
It's a tax rageted towards gypsy "witches" that can read the future in card or a crystal globe, or heal you or curse somebody you don't like or lift curses(all that kind of bullshit)
There are many superstitious people here that use their services, so the govermant said why not tax it because money is good
Plus: i think that you have to register yourself as a witch, if you don't you can be charged whit tax fraud i think
Plus Plus: they wanted to pass a law that if your prediction din't came true you could face 3-6 mounths in PRISON
I don't think it passed tho
Edit: to make it clear they pay taxes to the state like a normal business
If they get paid 100 lei for a prediction the state gets somthing like 20%(i don't know the percentage)
witches pay 16% income tax
That's all I know about this "magic taxation law".
It is a law sience 2010
No, it's not your fault, only some Romanians try to blame the other European countries for what is going wrong
You learn something new every day

I don't think I've ever used the English wikipedia
I use english wikipedia for almost everything
I use romanian wikipedia when I'm looking for stuff about Romania, like touristic objectives, or when I want to compare the info available or check for translation (though the english-romanian pages aren't properly linked
For example I was looking for brown bear in romanian and the wiki page is "ursul" -simply "the bear", the info was about the bears in romania which are brown bears and when I switched to the english version it was about bears in general, not just brown bears
Also the brown bear english wiki had more information than the "ursul" romanian wiki
I use Romanian Wiki for local stuff or translation (Google translate has no idea most times, but searching something on Romanian wiki and changing to the English article is incredibly good)
Everything else, English Wiki
Once you have a good enough comprehension of English you will gradually stop using your country's media and other things
For me it's the other way around
I find the English one so much more complete
I only use the Romanian one when I need to read something that's Romanian related
It’s normal
The water in cities is usually good despite what some might believe about the one in Bucharest
idk
opinions are mixed in here
I know some people that drink tap water and some who dont
I personally choose bottled water because tap water gives me some pretty bad burning sensations in the stomach
Tap water is not  good everywhere in my country
We don't trust local authorities to give us clean water
Most romanians don't drink tap water
But the tap water is good in most cities
Bucharest, Romania
Level of pollution is through the roof (well higher than usually) caused by multiple things, people burning trash outside the city, residue pond from a pig farm was set ablaze, and other sources of pollution even though traffic is extremely low in the city
The rest of the issues are Corona related and tired of that topic to be honest
- Abandoned houses
Idk if anyone else in my city really cares about them but thay really bother me, they're so ugly and filthy, they make the whole city look worse than it already does
- stray dogs
You can't even go outside at night without fearing a herd if those stinkers
All jokes aside, having a Moldavian accent can disadvantage you if you want to find a job in Bucharest
Mostly, it is rather funny hearing someone speaking with an accent
A stereotype goes like this: "Moldavians are considered lazy and uneducated people or even farmers who can't write
". It is a problem for people who want to move in Transylvania, Muntenia, Dobruja etc
All the dogs are nice during the day, during the night tho
that changes
Well its damned Scandinavia, of course it s shit cold lol
What do you mean by "don't let them use it"?
They will switch the conversations to English, they will turn their backs on me and leave or they will punch me in the face at "hej"?
I've heard of all of them
But a couple of years ago Bydgoszcz, Szczecin, Essen or Wuppertal were unknown to me
Bydgoszcz, Poland was the city for me
Never heard of it before
I'll go look it up right now :) Edit: Don't know a lot about polish cities since I have the most knowledge of this kind from football and they don't have the best teams
Edit 2: Actually it was the only city I hadn't heard of
i know all of them , probable because people know the west Europe cities by default and as i live in east Europe i know eastern Europe as well . Bochum was the first city i don't know where it is exactly .
PS: when i was a kid i used to read geography books so i know Europe by heart , mostly .
[Bydgoszcz] the first and only from that list I never heard of
I'm not sure if I heard of Malaga before
I definitely didn't know about Bochum
Murcia
To my shame, I'd always thought it's a region, not a city
Yesss come, it's good for a roadtrip
Cheap food, cheap hotels, good sights
What more does one need
well Iasi has it's flavour as it's more or less the cultural capital of Romania even if this is probably a big overstatement .My point is Iasi used to most important city in Romania after the capital . But due to lack of development it's not prospering as fast as western part of RO . But you can find a lot of nice sites like palace of culture or the omni-present churches of Romania .(Also it was the capital during the occupation of Bucharest during WW1) .
Galati it's a industrial city , i mean it has it perks , you can go near the Danube , see some architecture but nothing so special to worth coming to visit it from Czechia .
Craiova idk what to say , never been there .But from what i heard it's not the best turist spot in our country
If you want to visit i recomand the monasteries as they are something completely different from what you have seen probably ( a lot of people will recomand cities like Brasov , Sibiu , Oradea , Cluj but they are like the daily middle-age->modern age central european cities) .Or maybe if you like nature you can go to Danube Delta
For car trips Transfagarasan Road it's a must ( Top Gear said it's the best route , probably an overstatement but not by much)
idk about Espoo but i can bet there is a bigger suburb in Paris that isn't counted here even if i might be wrong .
Roughly half of Romania is West of the Carpathians, which is considered Central Europe
Eastern Europe is only from a political point of view, geographically it is quite central, given that Europe goes all the way to Ural and Caucasus
Nah it’s like the sound of a whip
What is written is exactly what you read, it's a phonetic language
It seems most people can't understand that
Also, you'll be annoying if you will keep repeating the subject in the sentence
In Romanian, you don't need a subject for the sentence to be grammatically correct
If you keep saying "I" and "You" you'll only annoy people
We say "raining" instead of "it's raining" because nobody **is** raining, it just is
If you get these you'll be mostly fine
The order of words can be easily changed, it's not a big deal
You can say both "big sea" and "sea big", it sounds different and you may imply something different, but people will be understanding
Don't trust a Romanian man to tell you the real words for example Hello = Salut they might replace Salut with dick head or many other obscene words :3
We dont really use pronouns like I or You (Eu and voi)
Never pronounce the I at the end of a word
It's quite easy to learn the basics (especially the reading part), don't worry for the complicated grammar, others can understand you even without mastering it
And please, try to firstly learn how to pronounce ă, î/â, ș and ț.
Hello nu insemna Sug pula
Eu asa am inteles
I hate that so much
[Pro-drop language]
Actually Romanian still has five of the  cases  "nominativ", "acuzativ", "genitiv","dativ", "vocativ".  And depsite having those the language still has plenty of rule exceptions
We also use a lot of contractions, even in formal writing,  as some of them became the norm
Despite this using the non contracted form is just not a custom, but it's not grammatically incorrect

When you yawn "put your hand at your mouth or you are gonna swallow me"
When you ask what we are going to eat and the food is not ready "roasted patience"
When you forget the door open "do you have the house on a slope
/do you have a rock at your entrance
When you dropped something on the floor "it's down cause I looked up and it wasn't there"
When you hit your pinkie toe into the table "God is up and is watching all of us" (this happened literally 1 minute ago in reverse,feeling great)
When someone's crying : Stop pissing your eyes;
When youre drinking too much water : Youre gonna have frogs in your stomach;
When you forgot the door open : Is your house on the side of the hill
Some funny phrases utilised by Romanian mothers:
If you get hit "That's going to be ok  until you get married
If you have a powerful headache "Cineva te-a deochiat"(which means that you were admired by someone, expression which I have never supported)
If you don't salute "Hello, hat, cause the master does not have mouth"
If you forget the light on" Your mother doesn't work at Enel" (Enel is the company for electric current)
If you forget what you want to say" That's means that it wasn't important"
If you did something idiotic "That doesn't matter, you're my kid all the time, even if you're idiot"
If you get out in the city with a girl, the first question of your mother will probably be "Did you kiss her
"( So cringe)
When standing in front of the tv: Have you eaten glass
When not closing the door: Don't you have a door at your home
When not eating enough: Eat more, look at how skinny you are
When you leave the door and the window open or god forbid TWO WINDOWS OPEN: Do you want to make us all sick
HUH
Our mothers tend to be ironic
Also:
When you walk barefoot on cold tiles: "Put socks/slippers on or your stomach will catch a cold
When you leave both a window and a door opened or, God forbid, two windows opened at the same time: "Close the window or else "te trage curentul" (also a way of saying you'll catch some cold)
If you cry: "Do you want me to hit you to give you a reason to cry
If you have a stomach bug or any kind of ache: "Drink some pălincă "and it goes away"."
If you tell her you're bored: "Grab your behind with your hands and jump
If you do something really, really bad: "I made you, so I'll be the one who'll kill you
I literally never heard #4
In Transylvania we have a lot like:
When you don't finish eating everything on your plate: _"The only reason you're not finishing your food is because you don't want to do the dishes
Whenever you yawn: _"Put your hand on your mouth,  you nearly swallowed me"_
Whenever you're standing in front of the TV my mom would say: _" Look who just got out of the glass fabric and thinks he's transparent"_
Whenever you try to make a point against her: _"You'll understand  once you have kids"_
And one from my dad, when my mom left the window open for too long: _"Honey I think the neighbors have their own heating too_"
For us is: "Am I speaking in Russian
/Am I speaking to the Turks
We also use the chinese one
And i thought this was a romanian thing
You can't say no to Nana
you just can't
The sugar one is amazing, never heard of it before
I do not understand the lift one

Oh yeah,the crying one is pure Romanian,forgot about that one
Also when you have an ache: "It will go off by the time you' ll marry
Also if you stand in front of the television while they’re trying to watch something: “Do you work at the glass factory
As in your house is tilted and the door is hanging
Yep ..that's exactly what it is . Especially old women are crazy about it
Oh yeah
Or "Did you eat crushed glass
> Gaia
In Romanian culture Gaia is diurnal bird of prey and when children misbehave parents will tell them "Lua-te-ar Gaia" or  "Vine Gaia si te ia" ("May Gaia take you" respectively "The Gaia will come and take you)
We also have the expressions "Se tine de tine ca gaia" ("He/she follows you like a gaia") when talking about a person that you cannot get rid of, or "M-a luat gaia" - "The gaia took me"/"I fucked up".
We banned Mickey Mouse in 1935 because they said it terrorized children (not in use today)
We banned scrabble in 1980 because our dictator thought it was “overly intellectual” and “a subversive evil
” (not in use today)
I can't think of any weird laws that are still in use sorry
If grandma gives you food, it's mandatory to eat it
It's not official law but everybody knows it
In 1935 Mickey Mouse cartoons were banned in Romania because they were so badly drawn they scared children who watched them
Well of course a dictatorship is gonna be scared of smart people, poor dumb people are a hell lot easier to manipulate and keep under control
Well ours preferred us dumb because no smart person would ever side with that dumbass (his wife had like 4 classes, but called herself a "teacher to the romanians", held a big position in the parliament, basically collected faked college diplomas from every place in the world they visited, claimed that "she had a phd in chemistry", all "her scientific papers" were written by other people and a lot more + he wasn't much better, he had like 4 classes too I think, when he went hunting he had other people shoot the prey because he couldn't event do that, he thought a poem roasting the shit out of him was actually praising him and showed it to the whole country, thought that paying back government debt was like paying debt back to a friend and, also, much more) I'm glad they were killed, people like them don't deserve to live
ai mei tot sunt de parere ca ceausescu a fost ultimul cel mai bun conducator al romaniei,aceleasi argumente: 'eram cea mai bogata tara' si 'nu iti era frica sa umbli pe strazi noaptea'.
Da, sunt multe persoane mai batrane care inca cred chestiile astea din pacate
Acum poate ar trebui sa-i intelegem si noi ca asa au fost crescuti sa creada, dar e periculos daca isi cresc si ei copii cu aceleasi opinii ca, doamne fereste, ne trezim ca de maine in 5 ani o sa protesteze reintoarcerea comunismului in loc de coronavirus =))))
Sper ca tu nu ai cazut in capcana asta totusi, exista multe dovezi care ne arata ca era doar un prost, nimic mai mult
El incepuse sa contruiasca Palatul Poporului de azi pentru cand o sa-l vizteze regina Elizabeta a Angliei, da' la saraca femeie ii era sila de el
Cand au fost Ceausescu cu Elena in vizita la palat regina s-a si ascuns a doua zi de ei cand ea isi plimba cainii in gradina doar ca sa nu trebuiasca sa mai aiba o conversatie cu ei si faptul ca a primit un telefon de la presedintele franteti sa-i zica sa inchida toate bijuteriile si lucrurile de valoare pe care nu le vrea disparute cand vin ei pentru ca pe el l-au furat nu le-a ajutat imaginea
wow,dintre ce povesteau ai mei intelesem ca el avea o imagine destul de buna in afara
sincer sa fiu cand eram mai mic ma convinsesera ca a fost un conducator bun,ma bucur totusi ca am reusit macar de unul singur sa invat ca nu a fost chiar asa
Yes, apart from some groups of letters, every word its spelled as it sounds
For the most part
Recent loan words are usually pronounced and spelled as in their original language
E.g. laptop, pizza
Among older words, I can think of "kilo", which if you never saw written, you may write it "chilo".
Romanian too
I sometimes say the word slowly out loud if I ever get confused about how to write it
This is how children are taught to write
They learn the letters and the sounds they represent and then "here you go, Timmy, say the word and then write it".
In romanian it's almostf 100% phonetical,except for a few words such as "eu" which is pronounced as "ieu", "este-ieste",  "ea-ia", "ele-iele"
Same for Romanian
We have a few exceptions, but other than that you spell it how you hear it
>French is a nightmare for that
As someone that struggled to learn French, it warms my heart to see French people acknowledge that it isn't an easy language
The throne (tronul)
The library [Romania]
I always ask them to pronounce "Oaia aia e a ei
O iau eu". These are 2 valid sentences in Romanian, they mean "That sheep is hers
I will take it". But, as you can see, there are only vowels so it does sound like someone is having a stroke
Anything with â (phonetically  /ɨ/, if that helps)
Native English speakers look like they're choking when they're trying to do that
It also hurts their throat so it's funny
But for people from other countries I go for "oaie" (sheep) cuz it's a lot of vowels and it confuses people
Also words with triphtongs (3 vowels into one syllable) like "leoaica" (lioness)
Or I try to get them to say "copi", "copii" and "copiii" (copies, children, the children)
It's not difficult, it's just funny cuz the people tend to fuck up the first one, which is also the easiest
None,we have like 5 foreigners that speak Romanian
A classic romanian tongue-twister is "Capra crapă piatra-n patru". It means the goat cracks the rock in four (pieces)
> sorry to any Romanians here if the spelling makes your eyes bleed
It doesn't have a correct spelling because the words are made up for the song
Frate/fra - brother/bro
Coaie - literally means testicles lol
Definitely have more, these are the most common ones in Bucharest
In Romania we call eachother testicles (coaie), it's not offensive whatsoever between friends, but I'd never call my mom or older people that
"Frate" and "fra" are also some common modalities to address to your friends
That could be something specific for latin languages
:)))
In Romania we use fra too, short for frate (brother)
Frate is another common one to use
Some people use a more vulgar one coaie meaning balls
Hmmm
well "frate" , "coaie" , "ba
(usually continues with smth or not)"
Yes
Frate is the Romanian word for brother
However, since we have a lot of Italian influences, fratello became a thing in the past (maybe) 20 years
Til that fratello comes from italy, i always tought it is the gipsy version of "frate".
According to Romanian folklore, Armenia is home to dragons which can produce precious stones from their saliva
Romania hates a lot turky because their empire tried to conquest the for 800 years
In Romania, besides the normal New Year fireworks, there's the Sumedru Fire (  - sorry, on mobile, I can't format the message properly
The problem is that some fuckers also put car tyres on the fire
They don't do it in cities, but the rubber smoke smell is felt in the middle of Bucharest
Between January 2018 and November 2019 our prime minister was basically a Karen that could barely speak the language
Although nobody admited it, she was basically a puppet for the leader of the Social Democrat Party, who could not be prime minister since he was accused of corruption in an on-going process
She was previously a member of the EU parliament but before that she was a teacher in some village
[she was not very good at maths either]
Hungarian king Luis II drowned in a creek after losing the battle of Mohács
Let's not forget the Finnish soldier who overdosed on meth and skied 400km
I already knew about this , but I tought that there were only 4 , not 14
yup, the same happened to us lmao
I remember when she went to Montenegro,she confused the capital Podgorica with Prishtina
Also the way she said 2020 was hilarious
[Neither at English]
"Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ? Yeah this Carol guy looks legit , let's just put him on throne"
Or when she was asked what the area of the circle is, that was pretty awkward, or when she went to the US amd was literally ignored by everyone
Well we did not really have any ridiculous moments in our history before 1989, so I thought I would include something interesting that happened in the last 30 years, since there is enough to write about  :)))
Yes , she did xD
I haven't heard about his until now
Care to share some info
The circle one was a good piece of comedy
Didn't know she went to the US tho since I don't watch the news often lol
It was barely covered by TV outlets because it was painful :)))
I read about it online
"Dracula"( Vlad the Impaler ) was never imprisioned in Dracula's castle ( Bran Castle ) is just a thing to attract tourists, he was imprisoned in Buda (Budapest
Don't know if you did know , but we have a cemetery called ["The merry cemetery"]
It is famous for its brightly colored tombstones with naïve paintings describing, in an original and poetic manner, the people who are buried there in addition to scenes from their lives
The Merry Cemetery became an open-air museum and a national tourist attraction
Here's an epitaph in English :
Under this heavy cross
Lies my poor mother-in-law
Three more days should she have lived
I would lie, and she would read (this cross)
You, who here are passing by
Not to wake her up please try
Cause' if she comes back home
She'll scold me more
But I will surely behave
So she'll not return from grave
Stay here, my dear mother in-law
Most history books will tell you the Romanian people are a mix of Roman colonists and Dacian local people of old
That's probably right – but when you look up the reason why the Romans occupied Dacia, you generally learn the Romans were expansionist and they wanted the Dacian gold
In truth, they ended up occupying Dacia because the Dacians kept pillaging territories in the Roman empire (in today's Bulgaria)
Who does that
That's a really intresting fun fact, thank you for sharing it
Czechoslovak Legion
More like Chadoslovak Legion
There are coffee plantations in the Canary Islands as well
I visited both a tea plantation in the Azores and a coffee one in the Canary Islands and I have very nice memories from both
I know that thing, but i didn't want to explain at questions like "where is buda" "it was a prison or a city"
And things like that, so i said Budapest instead
I suggest to go instead of Brasov to Rasnov and Sighisoara
Brasov is an intresting and beautiful city but i am in love with Sighisoara bcs is the only medieval fortress/city who is still lived in this part of Europe, i think it would be nice to walk on the norrowest streats in Romania just like in Medieval era and to see the walls still surrounding the city
Brasov is an amazing city and i suggest it for its medieval style and arhitecture and Rasnov is a old fortress which was built by the Teutonic Knights
Also Rasnov is only 20 km from Brasov and Sighisoara is like 100km further you can see this site if you want to go to this places and rent a hotel room [Trivago
ro]
That's interesting and you are right , I didn't knew it
I don't think we have or I don't saw anything like that here in Romania
We have but there is just one troop for both boys and girls, i'm new in the troop so I don't know everything but it's cool
They organise camps and I heard everyone talking about a really important one in Arad where most of the scouts make the promise because in this camp there's a day-long hike
But it's cool
In Romania there are lots of forteresses called  'castre'(singular:'castru') and they are not in very good condition since,you know,2000 years ago,but they are there
And you can visit many of them as museums
There's too many to count, but the one I find most interesting is this one:
The foot of the bridge on our side of the river can be visited, along with what remains of the Roman town and garrison that was meant to guard it
They are found in the city of Drobeta-Turnu Severin
It was a marvel of Roman engineering
There is a scale replica to be seen in the city's center, very nicely done, I think it's quite new
Romania has the ruins of [Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Dacica Sarmizegetusa] I think the biggest reason people don’t know about it is because of the name
In Romania a lot of them are in poor condition
Mainly because the peasants "borrowed" materials from them
But it's also because nobody gives a shit about them
One of the pillars from the bridge that went over Danubius is in the poorest shape ever
Even the walls that are supposed to protect it are cracked
While in Bulgaria,it's so preserved that you can mistake it's age
Don't believe me
Our history teacher told us that when building 2 supermarkets they found a Roman burial ground
You know what they did
They buried it back and built the supermarkets
While in Bulgaria,which is supposed to have a worse economy,they built glass domes to protect the ruins
This thing happened after the 2000
The supermarkets are still there
That’s not a ruin though
It’s still a functional building, just like how the Pantheon of Rome is not a ruin because it was never abandoned
Amazing that those buildings are almost 2000 years
[Current one] and a few from [this] and [this] playlist
Spotify must be really confused when I slide in System of a Down or Rammstein in between
Well
Manele here are associated with the Roma community and you know how Roma people are seen around these parts
But fuck that I will get down to [this ]   like there's no tomorrow
Omg my girlfriends and I were obsessed with that dude as teens
AHAHAHHA I was so hoping someone from Scotland would link that song
That's a good fkin song tho, no guilt there
100% listen to it on a monthly basis
It's more like a joke now but
"If you can fix it with wire it's a pity to use screws'
If it rains, something will get wet
On anything else, there's always someone who disagrees
Not really
It's just that most people that are unable to get a job (or too lazy to do it) go start begging in Western Europe, so people think we are all like that
The bigger cities in Romania (e.g. Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi, Constanta) are pretty much first world cities, and the others are pretty communist-influenced, but still on the right path and not as underdeveloped as most western people think
Yep, this entirely
And there are places like some villages where people live in the old ways, thought those are rare
Most villages have Internet now from what I know, but I live in the field area, I don't know how mountain areas are
It ever happened to you to speak few minutes with someone in English to find out they are actually from your country
Idk about you but I can spot a Romanian talking English from the first sentence
A few times on the internet
IRL it happens sometimes in Greece or Bulgaria when the waiter know Romanian but they were not from Romania
LOL yes
I once called customer support for a problem I had with the warranty of a device
The agent introduced herself, the name sounded really Romanian, I didn't think of if initially and initiated the conversation in English, then after a few lines I asked her if she's Romanian, she said yes; and that she worked for a callcenter in Greece that offered customer support for Apple in SE Europe
Posted this one before:
>I was living in China
While I was paying my rent another white guy walked in and was trying to settle an issue with the building administrator
I helped him as much as I could in my broken Chinese
Between the broken chinese of 2 white guys and the broken english of the building administrator we managed to settle the issue
After that I chatted with the other white guy in english about what are the best chinese translation apps
Before I left I asked him where he's from
Romania
Romania
Romania
Romania too
Cue laughter (in romanian)
What about an online conversation
Let me guess,you are working as a spy
Months or years,wow
Plot twist,he was just a drunk English man who touched that level of drunkenness where you know all the languages from the world and you can read someone thoughts,so you know in what language to speak with them cause you hear in what language they are thinking
by their profile picture
No, because packages aren't left on the porch
If you're not at home they take it to the post office and leave you a note with which to pick it up
UK here
Depends on where you live in town to be honest
I lived in a place where I wouldn't dare have a package delivered if I were not at home some years ago
Where I live now, I order shit when I'm on a two week holiday away
Delivery man leaves it by the door and that's where it grows cobwebs till I'm back
Or If I'm away for too long one of my neighbours would take it into their home and hand it over when I'm back
I do the same for my neighbours
Chișinău maybe
Ploiești, Romania
Probably Târgoviște, apart from the small tower of the old city,  it’s only 5 to 10 story “communist flats” which are bland gray flats designed to as many people as possible
The town itself is very polluted with trash everywhere
My mother says: Warsaw
Alternatively, Bratislava
It's hard to call it bland or boring though
Bucharest is anything but bland boring or souless
You could call it ugly, eclectic or messy but it's a city that never sleeps and there's always something happening
Sorry you had bad weather
We have a lot of words that change meaning because of a misplaced letter, but they're not exactly common
You won't hear anyone talk about them on a daily basis because these are extremely formal words that belong in a specific type of vocabulary
However, we have some pair of words that people always get wrong and they stir a lot of confusion
- literar = referring to literature, literary
- literal = basically spelling a word
- reflexie = your reflection in a body of water, for example
- reflecție = a meditative state where you think about your life or problems idk
These meanings aren't as shocking as those in another languages, but people still can't tell them apart to this day
In Moldova I hear people mixing up these:
* orar (schedule or timetable)
* oral (same as English, both meanings: "in speaking out loud" like an oral exam and "with the mouth")
But I want to point out that we have what seems like an unusually large number of homonyms:
* copíi = children, but cópii = copies
* masă = "mass" (in kilograms), but also "table"
* sare = "salt", but also "he/she jumps"
Pray tell then, what's a homonym
Hint:
Definition of homonym
1 grammar : homophone: the homonyms there and their
2 grammar : homograph: The words lead, as in the metal, and lead, as in the verb, are homonyms
3 grammar : one of two or more words spelled and pronounced alike but different in meaning (such as the noun quail and the verb quail)
Source:
Conclusion: all of the above actually fall under the definition of homonym
Edit: also, stop being a pedant
the students with good grades go to uni for free here (covered by the state)
most people fall in this category
you need to pay a tax if you either:
-go to a private uni
-dont get on the state covered spaces
to those the cost varies from about 600€ to 800€ a year
it's pretty good I'd say
Most state owned universities have a set amount of no pay spots available
Out if everyone applying, the top students are chosen to fill those in
If you need a place to live, if I'm not wrong, there are some unis with the rent equivalent to around $10/month, but you need to share the room and conditions aren't the best in general
i assume this is only for Danish citizens
i think so, though you should google it to be sure
Fruit and vegetables are very cheap during the season, it can be as little as 15 €cents for a kilo
In general food is quite cheap in South-Eastern Europe
Edit: Depending on the operator, with 3-8€ you have unlimited mobile data, messages and minutes
Internet
Fixed broadband - 8€  for 1Gbps
Mobile data - 2€ for 50GB
Everything
humans are cheaper here
Internet
Good food
Lots of stuff if you know how to look for it
Lots of software that shouldn't be free, but it is
At least we have these
~~Also in romania that's the case
I personally do not have unlimited data, but at least 100gb of 4g traffic every month for 6 euros~~
&#x200B;
Wrong thread
Also in romania that's the case
I personally do not have unlimited data, but at least 100gb of 4g traffic every month for 6 euros
I have unlimited mobile data for 5€.
In what country exactly
I definetly want to know where this is happening
More like 18€ for the fastest one (Fiberlink 1000 from Digi,corect me it i’m wrong)
Food is cheaper and better in Germany
So how much does a good pizza cost
Why
Edit: I ask because I have friends who visit Switzerland specifically to buy laptops or other electronics
They say it's cheaper even when you factor in the travel
God damn that's terrible
I'm on a monthly subscription and I pay 10€ for 6gb
There's been a lot of random offers so got now I have around 100gb though
My boyfriend who's on a prepaid sim has a way better deal, 4€ for over 60-100gb
I have "unlimited data" (but actually limited to 50gb in 4G) with Digi for 2€
Why would you say that
Isn't the average salary/living standard the same as in Romania
It feels like the food in Romania is better quality than in western europe
They are called eurocents so I improvised an abbreviation
As of [here] it's 40 lei  ≈  8
People keep saying this but whenever I go to a store in a german city the food is expensive and bad
If you are talking about the locally farmed fruits/veggies, then I agree
But imported food, not so much
What store
I have tested Kaufland and a few smaller ones like netto
Oh, I see the prices are the same in Romania
A pizza is also between 4-6€ in a good but common restaurant which is not located in one of the big cities
This sounds terrible
I personally have been to Bulgaria and everything seemed reasonably priced, perhaps just a little more expensive
I hope just a few doctors quitted and that the situation can be managed
Netto is especially terrible
You can't even find a good non-sweetened yogurt in most of them
You have no idea what you are talking about apparently
Yes, if I am inside
Yes, but when I'm inside
They are great in Minecraft, but not that safe/convenient irl
I love the sound of thunder, if that's what ya mean lol
Nah
I dont
I hate them always make the ground so wet
I live in countryside and its annoing
No doubt in that
They're even worst in BOTW
Don’t know if it was mentioned already but roumanian has this thing:
untdelemn = butter of wood(it is an old name for sunflower oil)
More like an expression: Am futut o câcare din-aia urâtă = *literally* I have fucked a shit of that ugly = I took a massive shit
You also have ‘handshoes’ for gloves
Green-thing
Salut, numele meu este Ioan,  este o plăcere să te cunosc
De unde ești
Hi, name mine is John, is a pleasure to you meet
From where are
Buna ziua,numele meu este Radu și va urez o zi buna și sanatate tuturor
Good day name my is Radu and i wish one day good and health all
Buna, ma cheama John
Incantat de cunostinta
De unde vii
Good, John’s calling me
Delighted by meeting
From where coming
(I specifically picked the most stupid yet correct translations)
Bună, numele meu este Ion, este o plăcere să te cunosc
De unde ești
Salut ma numesc Ionuț, este o placere sa te întâlnesc
De unde ești
HI my name John, it is pleasure to you meet, where from you
Salut
Numele meu este Ion,îmi face plăcere să te cunosc
De unde vi
Hello
The name mine is Ion,it makes me pleasure to meet
From where come
Edit:In Romanian,we also use "mă cheamă",simillar to italian
Well, if I don't care about your feelings, I can say that "it hurts in my dick".
you can also : ma cheama Ioan-they call me Ioan
Should be name my*
You didn't translate every word literally
Vă = unto you (pl
) - hard to translate, English doesn't have the dative case
Tuturor = all (there is no "to" in the Romanian sentence)
It should be "myself call John", since the pronoun is omitted and the word order is different
>ma cheama Ioan-they call me Ioan
There's no "they" in the sentence
It's "myself called Ioan"
Thank you
I tried to keep the words 1-1                                                                                                              Edit:Thanks
Yea it's a pain to translate it literally into English because some cases simply don't exist and it's really hard for me to even explain them to English speakers
Humans
They are numerous, known to prey on other animals like boars, bears, and are far more damaging to the environment than any other pest
There’s a saying: Romania is a fine place, too bad it’s populated
The brown bear, by force
By sheer agressiveness, probably the boar
Ocelots loves to play with snakes, but the three types of snakes: naked, solid and liquid are proven to be stronger
I am quite surprised that you have adders in Denmark, here in Romania they are kind of associated with warmer places, as far as I know you only have to really think about them in places like southern facing low sub-mountaneous rocky spots
tho I guess your winters might be somewhat milder
Edit: Nevermind me, I'm stupid, I was thinking about the horned viper which is much more dangerous
Adders seem to go way up north
Yeah, I looked it up afterwards, and realised I was thinking about a different thing
We have both adders (according to Wikipedia everywhere in Romania) and horned vipers(more in Southern and Western Romania) and I think many of us forget they are different species, especially since there is a lot more "hype" shall we say about horned vipers as they are much more likely to kill you
Thinking about it tho, I do remember my dad telling me when I was maybe 10 years old that adders are nowhere near as dangerous but should be avoided too
TIL they formed EU to keep the invasion numbers low
Well in Romania the head of the government is called the Prime Minister (now Ludovic Orban), he is the one the communicates with the every other part of the state as the representative of the government
He is named by the President (now Klaus Iohannis) after consulting with the party that holds the majority in the goverment if it exists else  with every party in the government
The President has the power to accept or reject laws proposed by the government, in addition, he representes the countries intrestes abroad, is tasked with upholding the constitution, and he is also in charge of the military
Counter-question: is it common to own a flag (of whatever) in the EU
There's an Europe Day
And they fly flags
First I've heard of it
I guess at least in my area they don't to it
When I was a kid, I remember looots of people would fly flags on National Day (like literally every window)
Recently though, when you see one it stands out, because it's rare
But again, this is mostly about what I see in my town/area
I'm not sure about the rest of the country
Tbf I know about this just because we always had an assignment at English and French classes in school about Europe
I think the EU flag is anyway on almost all public buildings next to the Romanian one, so I don't know if anything special happens tomorrow
Ooopsie
I had no idea there was an Europe Day and definitely didn't know about flying the flag
I have no idea if people do it here tbh I never noticed
There are definitely EU flags on public buildings along with the local flag tho, but that's all the time
Filantropica for Romania

I will just raid my supermarket for "German beer", have my friends over at my place and call it "Oktoberpoorfest"

That's when Half Life 2 was released
Makes sense to do it then
Whoever's running the Swiss and Norwegian government would probably do wonders for us
Merkel for Johannis (our president is German so it would be a German exchange)
Mostly because she's an engineer (I think, in any case she has some higher education) and right now in Ro there is this wave of anti intellectualism
And I hate it
I doubt it would change or help things
But I just wish we would have educated people in power
And not the kind of education where they paid x money for the diploma
Incoming treaty for Finland to join the Russian Federation in 3
Even better
I'll take all of them
No, no, no
We give you a German, you give us the competent one
That's how this exchange works by the rules that I just made up
Take our Orban
I think anybody would be better than the curent leaders
I love how you can make an entire sentence sound either latin or slavic
We got a phrase made up of only vowels:
Oaia aia e a ei
(that sheep is hers)
And I think in check there is a phrase made only of consonants
Edit: Czech
i love the swear words, one of my favourites is "go back into your mum's coochie"
We can curse about everything i mean we have a lot of curses and is easy for everyone to be original when they curse
A lot of compatriots hate it, but I like how much we use diminutives, they're absolutely everywhere, I think they're funny, heartwarming, sometimes over-used and condescending, but I still like that we have them
It's so common that not only people use them without realizing it (even the ones who hate the usage of diminutives), but in some instance the diminutive is used exclusively
For example egg white is "albuș de ou", where "albuș" is the diminutive form of "alb" (white), but no one says "alb de ou", it doesn't exist in the language
Or like, "grădiniţă (de copii)" = kindergarten which is the diminutive of "grădină" (garden), but no one says "grădină de copii".
Same for furculiţă (fork), lănţişor cu cruciuliţă (necklace with a cross), minciunele (little lies, it's a [desert] cuişoare (cloves, literal translated to "little nails"), scorţişoară (cinnamon, comes from the word "scoarță" = (tree) bark), şerveţele (napkins), periuţă de dinţi (small brush for the teeth/toothbrush), pufuleţi (corn puffs, small puffs)
We do that to names as well: Maria, Mărioara; Ion, Ionel, Ionică, Ioniță; Angela, Angelica; Marin, Marinel; Gherghe, Gheorghiță.
I'm from Romania and we speak Romanian (Română) here
What I like about this language:
-its musicality
Romanian has a great deal of musicality and it is very easy to write poetry in it, because of this
We can easily make rhymes that sound really good in a poem
Also, the Romanian music sounds really good, even for a stranger
You probably know the "Numa Numa" song
That song is in Romanian and it's really catchy
-the cussing words
Romanians have some inovative ideas when it comes to cussing
That's why you'll hear a Romanian say : "f*ck your mother's onion", "you are so dumb that you smell" or "f*ck your mother's cookie". I know this sounds terrible in English, but trust me, in Romanian has a lot of sense and every word can be connected with cussing
-the dialects
Romanian has some dialects that sound really pretty and I love them
-the way it reassembles Turkish and Russian at the same time
I speak a bit of Turkish and some Russian and I've realized that it is very easy for a Romanian to learn the both of them, because this language, even if it is a Latin one, has some Russian and Turkish influences
Some of our most complicated words to pronounce (especially for foreigners) are the number between 11-19
Words that, if you were to learn the language, would be used very often
They're so long that even we have short, casual words for them
In fact, optsprezece (18) is the word in the Romanian language with the most consecutive consonants
I don't get why we made them so complicated
Not interesting but rather useful is the Latin root which helps a native Romanian to learn easier romance languages
On the fun side, we are super inventive (and as a side bad side effect grose) when cussing
And I’m not speaking about adding a single word like f*ck in front of substantives, but rather developing entire processes and adding random stuff to the cuss words
I love our cuss words/sentences
We have a cuss for almost every possible word
You meant Czech, right
It doesn't have to stop there though
Oaia aia e a ei, eu i-o iau
(that sheep is hers, I'm taking it away from her)
Baba dăruieste hrană viteazului războinic
- only words with slavic origins
It means: The old woman gifts food to the brave warrior
Lol, yeah :P
Bătrâna oferă mâncare curajosului cavaler
This is the same sentence written only in words of latin origin
Fascinating indeed
razboinic=/=cavaler
But it's close enough
Croatia has an awful lot of words for which I found some interesting coincidences in Romania
For example I remember that the word for boulevard (or highway) was something along the lines of “cale larga”. That means “wide path” in Romanian
The accent in the eastern part of the country sounds very slavic so they can do it with almost any sentence, regardless of word origin
The south of the country has a lot of turkic influences
From accent to food and to some extent culture
They have a way of talking which to a non-speaker would sound almost like a turk faking an accent
The western part has Hungarian and German influences
This can be seen again in the language, food and culture
Disclaimer: the cultural differences are very small, and are a result of the 3 regions being ruled by various empires throughout history
You could use "luptător" instead of "cavaler"
the words are synonyms of one another and they can all be used in everyday speech interchangeably
Well kinda
Cavaler=knight, but it comes from cavalerie
So in a way cavaler=cavarly but cavarly=/=cavaler
[Aspic (Piftie or Răcitură)]
[Porc drum ]
Back in the day, at the begining of December, rural families would sacrifice a pig and since there were tying times they would try to use up every piece of that pig
So you can imagen that there are all sorts of tasty recipies
For Aspic they use some of the meat but most importantly pig’s feet that when boiled they create a lot of gelatin, which causes the dish to thicken like a jello when cold
For Pork drum it’s basically a mixture of selected pork parts such as meat with some fat on, liver, tongue and rind, in aspic with spices and garlic
It’s normally cooked using pork stomach as casing (thoroughly cleaned and boiled)
I find them both very tasty and I think that at least Aspic is present in a lot of other Balkan countries as well
But I think people find them disgusting because of how they look and the ingredients but I advice everyone to at least try them
At Easter traditionally we slaughter a lamb and you make all sorts of food from all parts of the lamb
You have lamb steak, there's a sort of mince meat dish from the organs
all good so far
But one of my grandmas used to make also a lamb soup which contained the lamb's head
The whole head
With the eyes and the tongue and everything
Which my grandpa used to eat with a lot of delight
I still retch when I remember him eating the eyes
I find anything meat related kinda gross and I can barely eat chicken and pig
And tuna for fish
But only canned
So I find pretty much anything animal related gross, but if I had to choose one that's eaten in my country it would be "ciorba de burta" which is tripe soup
My mother tried to feed me that lots of times and I tried it once and never again no matter how angry she got
It's fuckin disgusting
Just the sight of it makes me want to throw up
And ugh the smell
Nasty
I was thinking about salata de boeuf initially but fuck it, you win
I've eaten pork drum before but I'm not fucking touching piftie
I hate răcituri so much
The texture is just disgusting to me and makes me wanna barf
Everyone around me loves it and they always tease me for not eating it
Rabbit meat doesn't sound that disgusting, don't get me wrong it's kinda weird but it isn't disgusting, on the other side I can't say the same for birordo
Loved Haggis back in Scotland
I also enjoyed Scottish Eggs
Haha,  you find salata de boeuf disgusting
I have to admit that that is a first
because up until this point every time I said that everyone was like whaaat
I personally don’t like it because I  find mayonnaise disgusting knowing it has raw eggs in it, and since we not only use mayonnaise in the mixture but we also glaze it with it, is what makes me a bit sick to my stomach
I know what you mean and I feel you and since it is more like a holiday dish I think thats we are safe
They look like big meat balls
Pretty much boiled eggs covered in haggis
They sell them at Tesco
Delicious
No, it's an entirely different thing I think
Edit: I think I might be in the wrong here
Could you explain what this lamp does, please
Nepotism in Iceland
Thanks for explaining
We messed up after 1945 but now we are good, not much architecture remained in Bucharest tho
Communism happened
Lost some territory to the North, East and South
Oh, and our trains run slower than they did 100 years ago
Buuuuuut, we have the best Internet (long story, just think of it as magic) in Europe
And we’re (barely just) part of a loving family called the EU
Also, communism sucked ass
(Romanian
World War 2 came, communism came, they took a part of the country, (Moldavia,) and we’re still waiting for them to come back
Now let’s march on Chisinau
Also, don't ask about Bessarabia and Northern Bucovina
Yeah, better not mention about them
I live in Bucharest, and I love it’s architecture
But a lot of it’s interwar and prewar architecture was destroyed by Ceausescu to build its commieblocks, Palace of Parliament and Unirii Avenue
Romania definitely Pipera has Offices and a lot of modern buildings, soon the Area around Romexpo will be turned into a center of commerce with huge modern buildings lol
We don't really have something like that, apart from some office buildings in Bucharest
Communism still prevails
Yeah we do, what are you on about
Cluj Napoca and Bucharest are prime examples of modern architecture (while still preserving the historical architecture of the city of course)
What is the shortest place name in your country
For example, pretty sure in Sweden it's Å, and in Romania it's Ip

Understood everything french, guess i have that going for me
Opened the Spanish one,I was able to understand like 80%.The rest of 20% I was able to understand from the context,but not really recognizing the words
I will try to translate the first sentence into english, I will put a questionmark after the words I'm not sure about

As Romanian, I was exposed to foreign languages from a young age from movies and TV
Growing up, I was watching Cartoon Network in English, even if I didn't understand much of it
Then, my grandma was watching South American Telenovelas, so I picked up some Spanish
Now, English is the only foreign language I truly know
But if I focus, I can understand other Romance languages
Italian and Spanish are the easiest
French is the hardest for me, but maybe not for other Romanians who learned it in school
It's really hard for me to grasp how Romanian is the hardest for so many people
It's almost like Italian
From a Romanian perspective, Portuguese is the weirdest (as in can barely understand anything)
Spanish&Italian are easy to understand
French has a lot of useless letters, but ignore them and it gets easy too
For spoken languages, I guess Spanish is the easiest, then Italian and French just sounds weird
I surprisingly understood a lot, maybe it's because there were common words that are used in most of the languages or because I can easily understand the meaning without understanding the words
I opened up one of each except for Romanian(mother tongue) and french( which i speak as a foregin language)
I had no trouble with the italian page, understood about 97% of it (page about Roger Federer), again not much trouble with the spanish one, i'd say i understood 85% (article about Eithne Ni Bhraonain) I struggled a bit with the Portuguese one, I understood say 60% (It was about Marinha bizantina, the navy of the biazntine empire) and I barely got any word from the catalan page about Blairsville
Read the first paragraph of the article about Europe, here's what I found:
Spanish was the easiest one, though I should mention that it's harder to understand spoken Spanish than written Spanish for me
Italian came in on number 2, most Romanians would tell you this is the closest language to Romanian but I don't entirely agree with that, as I stated above I think written Spanish is easier to understand but spoken Italian is easier than spoken Spanish
French and Portuguese came in a tie on number 3, I do have to say that this wasn't completely fair as I studied French at school so I still remember some of the words
Lastly, Catalan was the hardest one to understand, it's an interesting language but I had the hardest time trying to understand what was written
I'm a Romanian with pretty much no exposure to other Romance languages, and as opposed to other Romanians, I learned German in school instead of French
French I understood around 10-20% (and also mostly due to my English vocabulary)
Spanish around 50-60%. Italian, I was actually quite surprised, 80%. Portuguese 50%. Catalan 40-50% and Galician 50-60%. Poor Romansh feels left out
This was the first time I've read Catalan and I can't believe how similar it is to Romanian
In French, it was an article about a Canadian hockey player
Quite easy to understand as I had French classes at school
Spanish a small article about a town in Utah, except for the word *ubicado* it was understandable, also the first Spanish article was a very small article about the Letonian football cup(2 rows)
Italian the article was about a Roman arc in Verona
Harder to understand than Spanish
Portuguese it was an article about the Olympic games, I could understand most of it considering the topic
Catalan: An article about the movie Before I go to sleep
Interesting language
Galician: About the chemical element Oxygen, understandable
I understood pretty much everything about their Old smuggler whisky in spanish
I kinda understood most of everything other than the Portuguese and the Galician ones
I understand more in spanish than italian somehow
did someone even open the romanian link tho
Italian and spanish are pretty easy to understand too
I think Portuguese is the hardest one for Romanians
All you need now is a cigarette and a chunk of cheese and you're all set
Because Romanian also borrows from slavic languages
>  până la moartea ei în 1050 când era căsătorită cu Constantin al IX-lea
Until her death in 1050 when she was married to Constantin al IX-lea
It's a shorter way of saying: She died in 1050 and she was married to Constantin at the time
I can understand written Italian really well (no prior contact to Italian otherwise)
We have a similar word for most words in Italian
If you ignore all the useless letters that produce no sounds in French it becomes really easy to understand
Isn't romansh Germanic
Even Romanian
We have *patrimoniu* in Romanian, but I wasn't sure if heritage was the correct word for that in english
I had no idea what *bairro* means, in Romanian the word for neighborhood is *cartier*. Also we do have *comună*, but it's a little different, it's a rural area, made up of one or more villages with the same mayor
I kinda knew that *caballito* must be something related to horses, because in Romanian we have *cal* which means horse, and *cavaler* which means knight, and I know the spanish word for that is *caballero*, which is close to caballito, but I wasn't exactly sure what it is so I left it
Not at all
It's a Rhaeto-Romance language, closely related to Friulian and Ladin
>volumului prezent este o continuare a Hobbitului
means this volume is a continuation of the Hobbit
So you were really close
lucrări indeed it means works and in this context, it can mean books as well
&#x200B;
>**fantezie** înaltă
I've never heard inalta being used like this
Usually it means tall, here it means high
&#x200B;
>în timpul celui de-al doilea război **mondial**
it means during the second world war
Telenovelas
If you don't watch them, your grandma/aunt/sibling watches them
My girlfriend got kind of fluent in Spanish that way
The thing with Romanian is that we have many ways to say the same thing
Kind of like German but not that exaggerated
For example:
"Me encanta"
Normally translated to : "Îmi place/Ador" BUT one can also say "Mă încântă". When you read the second one it sounds almost exactly as in spanish
It also has kind of the same meaning
The "Îmi place" looks very similar to Italian
They have "Mi piace".
Thanks man
Yup, people are (or at least used to be) crazy about those
We even produced Romanian ones and they were really successful
The older ladies are especially interested in telenovelas
Would rather not eat for a day than miss an episode (old people use cable TV)
I just found it weird when they kept all the transformers names except for Bumblebee which was translated as Bondar
In Romanian they translate "Death Eater" from the Harry Potter series as Mortivor, mort = dead, -ivor  as in carnivore or herbivore
I find that translation pretty weird
That's why i never read the books in my native language
Urzeala Tronurior for Game of Thrones
Yes since I’m passionate of architecture, it’s a big lose culturally and as a simbol of resistance of human creations over the time, it being built in the 13th century
But it also can be rebuild
Not with the same materials, but there are projects in recent history that made it seems like the destruction never happened, like the old town in Warsaw
I am from Romania and my mom barely slept last night because she kept thinking about the fire
We were all very affected because France is a really big part of our lives (my dad used to work there and we went there a couple of times) because it’s such an important country for Europe
Never been in France, but this was so hard to watch
I know that it can and will be rebuilt, but the sadness remains
Meh
Personally, I am saddened by the news
However, since Romania is orthodox, I don't think other Romanians would really care
Shut up man
You are the like some news agency :"your house in on fire beyound salvation, how do you feel
All great things when destroyed literally become history
They should rename it to *Notre Gone* and collect the tourism money
I've had both German and British teachers as a child
None could keep a class quiet for more than  2-5minutes
They were way to well behaved and we weren't picking up that they were angry
One of the German teachers broke down once though, so we got to hear an authentic "NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
". The 2 british teachers I had for 3 weeks in third grade are in my top 5 favorite teachers
We call it claxon too
From my perspective as a linguist who specializes in Germanic languages:
Dutch and Flemish are *not* the same thing, but they do have a very common recent ancestor
Depending on what dialect the speaker knows mutual intelligibility could be close to 100% or just partially mutually intelligible
Afrikaans descended from Dutch (from the Hollandic dialect) and retains some mutual intelligibility with it (and with Flemish to a lesser extent)
Since Afrikaans has a more regular and simplified morphology/grammar etc Dutch speakers can understand it better than vice-versa
You'd think Dutch and Flemish (and even Afrikaans) should be close to Luxembourgish since all 4 of these are considered Franconian languages, but Luxembourgish descended from the same branch of Germanic languages as Central and Upper German languages (Elbe Germanic), and because of that it retains way more mutual intelligibility with German, but not that much with Dutch
Now Low German and Frisian (and English too) are considered North sea Germanic, however all of these underwent influences from other languages
Low German ( or Low Saxon) was influenced by German and Frisian by Dutch, so mutual intelligibility is held at a lower percentage
Now I'll give approximate grades of mutual intelligibility from A - very high to E - very low, assuming that we're mostly talking about monolinguals
For:
Dutch speakers: Flemish - A/B, Afrikaans - B, Frisian (assuming we mean West Frisian) - C, Luxembourgish - D (or if they're from a more Germanized area - B), Low German - C
Flemish speakers: Dutch - A or B, Afrikaans - B or C, Frisian - C/ D, Luxembourgish - D (due to similar French influences), Low German - D
Afrikaans speakers: Dutch - B/C, Flemish - C, Frisian -D/E, Luxembourgish - D, Low German - D
Frisian speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C/B, Afrikaans - D, Luxembourgish - C/D, Low German - D
Luxembourgish speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C, Frisian - C/D, Afrikaans - D/E, Low German - B/C
Low German speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C/D, Frisian - C, Afrikaans - D/E, Luxembourgish - B/C
Transylvanian Saxons speak another Moselle Franconian language, just like Luxembourgish
They were brought over by King Géza II of Hungary from Luxembourg and The Moselle river region (and then some others from other regions in Germany), and if I remember correctly, they were called Saxons as it was a sort of common term for Germans as most German miners in the Kingdom of Hungary were from Saxony
Now for the language
Since I'm from Transylvania I had the opportunity to hear some bits of it and phonetically speaking I would say it's closer to Dutch than to Luxembourgish, even though lexically speaking it's very similar to Luxembourgish
Same goes for German across Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; they speak German officially, however the spoken languages are quite different
In the case of Dutch and Flemish, there's been a lot of convergence going on in the sense that regional languages have been fading into mere dialects, which understandably will make the urban class not really see the distinction between the two, however rural areas still retain much stronger differences
Some native speakers will claim "it's just a dialect/accent", but linguistically there's more to that
Native speakers don't necessarily posses scientific knowledge, which is why, in the case of Hungary for example, people will claim the most outrageous things about the language, despite them being native speakers
Many would claim that Hungarian is Hunnic/Turkic/Mongolic/Sumerian/Scythian/language isolate and would deny the scientific researched fact that it's a Finno-Ugric language
Think about it this way: a mechanic will understand the ins and outs of a car better than a racecar driver
Your last point is pretty much what I meant actually, West Flemish being a different language for Hollandic Dutch, because of course there's a dialect continuum across these Low Franconian languages, wherein two cities next to each other will mostly speak the same languages, but the more you travel the more the differences result in different languages
I go hyperactive and spontaneous when in an English speaking environment
I'm usually a quiet and chill guy

Bucuresti is pretty hated by other romanians as far as i know
I moved to Groningen 2 months ago and just visited Amsterdam
At this moment, Amsterdam is so cool and beautiful and with excellent public transport, I regret that I have chosen Groningen and not Amsterdam
Does that indifference change when you find out that Bern is your capital
^(/s)
The people, not the city
The city too
Exactly
The only thing I don't like about my city is that it seems that most of the people from the rest of the country move here and I would get past that if the people that move here would adopt the urban lifestyle and not continue to live here like they are still in a rural region
And on top of that, they make the city unnecessarily crowded
>m quite passionate about my city, so if you need any more info or tips about what to do in Groningen and/or why it is one of the
I would live in Amsterdam, I like big cities
And yes, I hate the touristic streets around the main station and redlight district, they are like a Disney Land for ***chavs*** from England and ***cocălari*** from Romania
But Amsterdam is not just the city center
I pay a huge rent in Groningen too because I could not come earlier to find a  cheaper room so I had to rent an expensive student room from SSH
Yes, the good part of Groningen is that everything is reachable with the bike in a short time, however, the sad part is that the city can become pretty boring
I understand that you love your city and you may feel like the city has a very good amount of events, but for me is not the case, I find it to be a provincial city with some crazy students that like to party in the same 3-4 clubs (sunny beach, COPAS, Oost and Kokomo)
So yes, I kinda regret choosing this city to study, even though the University is very good and it is good that I reach the Uni very fast, so this is the good part, but as a lifestyle, city life and so on is a huge turn off for me
Please do not take this too personal, is just my opinion and probably I am just incompatible with the lifestyle from here and I am probably more compatible with bigger cities
&#x200B;
Edit: Yes I know this CNN article, but this top can be pretty subjective, for example, I do not understand why they consider Apuseni mountains to be the best place to visit from Romania
Yes, Apuseni are beautiful, but IMHO we have more beautiful mountains and regions in Romania
Can confirm, both
They are shitty for my taste too, there are few underground clubs in Groningen that offers a better healthier scene, as you remarked
Oh, we've kind of lost count of the number of Cabinets that have collapsed over the past 30+ years, since Communism fell *facepalms*.
In recent years, the most
I don't even know how to call it, famous
Popular
Also painful as hell was in the aftermath of the [Colectiv nightclub fire] that happened on October 30th, 2015
Only in the previous legislature (2016-2020) 3 governments fell by no confidence votes, which is more motion of no confidence passed than in some countries’ democratic history :))))
Thank you, I kept looking for a good word and this one simply eluded me
Fun fact: One of the governments was brought down by it's own party with a motion of no confidence
Which is both tragic and hilarious :))
I don't really watch the news
What happened
Happened a few years ago, PSD mate a motion of no confidence agains the Grindeanu or Tudose governments, i dont remember which one
The one before Dancila
The situation here is weird with the wealth gap
Somewhere around 30%-70% (educated guess, so don't hold me to that number) where the first group lives a normal life at 2020 QoL standards and the rest live either in poverty or in rural areas like in the medieval ages
When you visit, you usually only see the top 30% of the people
If you are in that top 30% you are expected to speak at least English
A lot of people also know French or German
If you are in the bottom 70%, speaking correct and fluent Romanian is seen as a win
Fun fact: A lot of our politicians come from the bottom 70%. Easily corruptible and uneducated
Most of my friends *think* they can speak English fluently
When I visited Croatia, I had an easier time speaking German than English
italian is also a pretty popular language among romanians, due to its resemblance to romanian and the immigration/emigration wave to italy
so a lot of the not-so-educated-romanians that emigrate to italy don’t know english, but they know italian, which imo is a very interesting thing
also hungarian is popular in the west, as well as romani
so i’d say that it’s kinda like this: (keep in mind it’s my personal assumption)
-well educated people know at least three languages, romanian, english and another one of choice
and it’s seen as “lazy” to not know at least b2 english
well educated in romania would probably mean someone with more than a bachelor’s degree (for people in their thirties, as people in their forties studied for five years, not three in college) so bachelor for 40+ years, master’s for 30 and younger
-well educated old people (60+), don’t know english, but know russian and/or french
-normally educated people, with or without a degree (i think here it matters what degree they have, like someone who goes to business school just to have a degree, no offense though) or they dropped out of uni, or they never went to university in the first place
i think it’s expected of them to know english, at least b2, too
especially if they’re younger than 50
-normally or highly educated people that are born in the west, they’re much more likely to know german and/or hungarian, depends a lot on their upbringing, their parent’s origins though
-some normally educated roma people know romani
they can know any of the languages above, depends on where they live and their income
a lot of them don’t know romani though, because they’re forced to dislike their origins and hide (romania is extremely racist when it comes to them)
it’s expected of them to try their best to be “white”-passing, so some don’t even identify as roma
-normally educated young adults and teenagers know english, mostly b1-b2
it’s also expected of them to know english, since it’s taught in school, from the first grade to the second year of university, also it’s far easier for them to learn it, since it’s “the language of the internet”
-less educated people probably know a little english, a1-a2
-a lot of less educated people can’t get a stable job that would give them enough money to not live in poverty, so they emigrate to italy, germany, spain or england
thus, they’re forced to learn a little of the language spoken in the country they emigrate to, a1-a2 level mostly
it’s not unknown to become fluent though, especially in italian, and especially if they plan on staying there more than a few years
-uneducated people, sadly, barely know romanian
it’s also a matter of privilege, poverty and racial segregation
someone born in a middle class family is expected to know english
someone born in poverty is either expected to know nothing or be a mastermind
i think there’s stigma around most things in this country, and it’s not taken for granted to know english, but it’s expected in most cases
knowing more than english is never expected, it’s a bonus that a lot of us would love to have, it’s not as rare as one would think, though
there’s also the idea that we know more than we actually know, a lot of people that think they are fluent in english when they actually are not
or fluent in romanian, but can’t write an academically correct paper on a subject of choice
notes: read this as education=scholarly
it’s a comment on romania, which has extremely affordable and easily accessible higher education
those unable to go to university, excluding personal exceptions, don’t go due to poverty
so they’re still under the category of uneducated, but it’s no longer a personal choice, it becomes forced by the state
There is a large group of people who are hating on the language mixers
Was to lazy to put it into this much detail, thank you for the additional insight
I considered a1-a2 level as not knowing the language when I made my assumptions about percentages
It's still probably off by a lot
i know exactly what you mean
Someone could monologue in french for hours and i'd understand 99% of it, but if i had to reply back, words don't come to me
I would be offended
Unless you're a really good friend and you came by several times
Or if it's like a child under 10 yo
But if you're some person coming to my house for the first time and you opened my fridge, I'd be offended
I don't bring my guests on the kitchen, so why did you go there
What are you looking for
Can't you just tell me what you need instead of going around looking for it
Depends
For family, good friends, etc, they _know_ when they're friends enough with me that I wouldn't mind
For anybody else, it's odd
if the person is not a close friend and or relatives, I’d think it’s weird
Say I host a party and friend of a friend or partners whatever, they go through my fridge, that would be annoying I guess
Bulgaria - their beaches and the whole touristic culture there
myself because i would like to see other countries as well
We'd actually like it if Serbia gave us back all politicians, businessmen and pieces of shit that got political asylum there so we can throw them in prison, we'll keep our garbage cans here where we can watch them
*"so no child could be named Leo Messi
And what if Leo Messi wants to name his child Leo
To be totally opposite with the Spanish rules, you can name your child whatever you want
I’m sure there must be some rules but as far as I know those doesn’t seem to stop anyone
So you are not limited to choose only Romanian names as foreign names are extremely popular among parents now
There is also very common with Roma people to name their kids after celebrities, especially the football player so no rule here
The gender thing is not a rule also, there is a distinction between female and male names (female ones usually end with “a”) but as I said, foreign names are popular so there are names quite a few female names that don’t end with “a”.
And I really think you can’t use offensive names but I also saw someone online who’s name was “Vaca Grasa Verginica” which means “Fat Cow Vergin” (yes with e)
I live in Spain and had no idea about any of these
As long as when i have kids they allow me to use super uncommon names and middle names it will be fine for me lol
If not I would just give birth in Romania where from what I've read there's not a huge criteria
The Germans specifically are screwed
My neighbor's name is basically John John
I can't imagine how he was made fun of while in school, but now he says no matter who's calling him (in a formal context or not) it sounds like they're friends and he likes that
Also, I've met many people while in school with awful names they were made fun of, so there isn't any rule or nobody is enforcing them
I'm kinda glad that's the case with romania bc my name list is full of very uncommon and old names lol I think like half of europe wouldn't allow me to use them
And I might even use 2 middle names depending on how much freedom I would get from my partner for names hahahah
From what I've heard tho they review each case by its own and decide if they allow the name or not if it could be offensive or cause tons of hardships for the child
I assume his favorite song is “Ion Ionule”.
I assume Its Grigore Antipa museum in Bucharest but we have some really good natural museums
People will probably say MNAC (contemporary art museum in Bucharest) or something, but my favourite museum EVER is the Pharmaceutical Museum in Cluj Napoca
I loved it, it's located in the first pharmacy ever opened in the city - something like the 1500s if I remember correctly
Its beautiful and super interesting
That one is my favorite
No but I have Tatar neighbors and when they don’t want their girls to understand what they are arguing about they speak either Tatar or English
From what I get their kids understand Tatar so it might actually be for neighbors, we live on the ground floor and you can hear them up to the 5th one
No,but they do speak other languages when they're drunk
My grandparents used to speak a mix of Bulgarian and Serbian when they didn't want us or my parents to understand
I think it might even be helpful when speaking with older generations as chances are they don't speak English
And I think most of them will appreciate the effort
The same thing goes for younger generations that speak English
We know that not many people speak Romanian and that it is pretty hard to learn so trying to speak it might give you some extra points
I'm yet to see someone who gets visibly annoyed by a non-native trying to speak Romanian
The only non natives I've heard speaking good Romanian were some Italians
Also a few Africans, of all people, which I don't know exactly why but it's always cool to hear them speak
Pronounciation wise, it is a pretty easy language to speak if you're familiar with the latin way of reading letters (the grammar is the hard part) ,  so for people who speak Spanish, for example, it isn't hard to memorate some phrases and say them when needed
For English speakers, it is a little more difficult
"Scuză-mă,  știi unde este hotelul Continental
" (Escuse me, do you know where Continental hotel is
Would be said the same as if written "Scuhzahmah, shty uhndeh esteh hohteluhl Continentahl
" in English
So if you're ever lost and really need directions, just go to some groups of teenagers or people in their 20s and say "Sorry, do you speak English, I need some help" . That's a sentance that virtually everyone born after 1990 will understand so it shouldn't annoy anyone
It should take at most 3 tries before you meet someone who speaks decent English
I am extremely sorry to have to say that, but when doing that please try to avoid the Roma population
I'm not racist trust me, but generally speaking you have to know how to talk with those people if you don't want to be hurt
I'm  one milion percent sure it is this [mesmerizing] smell
[Mici/mititei] good stuff
As a guy who lives and likes to go cycling in the rural areas, I would say there is a lot of horse shit smell
That was a joke, please don't feel offended
Or pastramă. Either would work well
I was about to suggest onion, but you're right
Most of Romania's counties (or județe) have a decrease of their population
The only regions that increase in population are Bucharest, Ilfov County (which is surrounding Bucharest) Cluj County and Timis County
Romania is decreasing quite a lot but people will return eventually i think and i may do as well
In the summers we visit Moldova for some relatives and the village are very empty and its like a ghost town which is really depressing
Moldova has it worse i think then Romania because big cities are increasing in population whereas Moldova does not
Just to piggyback on this comment, Romania has lost around 5 million people to emmigration since the 90’s. A couple of years ago, there were more Romanians moving to Germany than Syrians
You can definitely tell that all these people are gone, especially in the rural area
In my grandma’s village, somewhere in Eastern Romania, there’s basically only old people left
4 million more like
property prices are quite high in the areas I've mentioned (especially in my city Cluj-Napoca) but idk about other areas probably the prices are lower
In Brasov the prices are also rising
Brasov starts to be atractive from what I've seen and the city is getting a better look imo
Cluj and Bucharest are major IT centres
Cotinous growth for over a decade, shit top of it jobs etc
The cities are becoming quite pricy but there are a lot of oportunities in IT
Yeah the city is investing more into the turism stuff and it got a facelift compared to 10 years ago
Yes, the life is comfortable
Right now i still work(from home) decen salary, even though Bucharest is expensive af, but life is good
If you plan to come beware of the salary
Negotiate it after taxes, since we pay about 45% to the state, from gross salary
What is your opinion on cannabis
Should it be legalized
Yes, I have no problem with that, but there should be restrictions of how much you can buy, Romanians are big consumers of anything (mostly because during communism they didn't had much) and, of course, not allowed in public spaces
Personally, I will never try it but I'm fine with those that want
definetly yes
for Romania it would be a massive source of income, which would help a lot:)))
Yes, i am in favor of it
To be honest I think it should be legalized, it is just that it has a lot of medical value and it's better then alcohol which is already heavly consumed, cannabis is actually consumed a lot ilegally and It is also "criminalized" in Romanian, in fact I belive they tried to take the punishment for possesing it to up to 10 years imprisonment a few months ago, which seems very dramatic
If properly regulated it could even be an interesting
I couldn't find the differance between Hungary (Ungaria) and Bulgaria (same in romanian) because they sounded the same
* I taught Finland was Germanic
* I taught that England, Scotland and Wales are all separate countries
* I taught that the Netherlands are part of the UK
* I taught that Germany is bordering Romania
* I taught that Belgians speak Belgian, Swiss speak Swiss and Austrians speak Austrian
* I taught that Switzerland and Poland are Nordic countries
* I taught Czechia is Germanic
* I taught Hungary and Albania were Slavic
* I taught that Greece was somewhere in Western Europe near France
* I taught Moldova is the whole Moldavia
* I taught that Bosnia and Lithuania are fictional countries
* I taught that Russia is in Western Europe
Also Hungary (Ungaria) and Ukraine (Ucraina)
Same here
I always mixed them up as a kid
Pffft
I thought it was the second coming of Persia
Same
London, Paris, Prague, Budapest, Istanbul
Or alternatively, some smaller less touristic places:
Bergen, Delft, Como, Dubrovnik, Sighișoara
The most touristy cities are popular for a reason
You should see the classics:
Rome Paris London Barcelona Istanbul Vienna Amsterdam Venice Moscow
This is a route that I've done and liked it a lot: Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna
Or a southern one:
Lisbon, Barcelona, Venice, Heraklion, Istanbul
True, was thinking the same when I mentioned it
But compared to Paris or London it's still ok
I mean first list is quite mainstream, but if you haven't seen them before then you cannot miss them
The others are just little gems I have uncovered while travelling
There's plenty more, but I was trying to provide some variety (like Como is next to a lake, Dubrovnik next to the sea, Sighișoara is a medieval fortress, etc)
Personal preference
Not even in dates all the time
It’s the formal way but probably most write them without 0
I have been in Dubrovnik in mid July 2 years ago and I didn't find it that "wrecked" with tourists
It was actually quite alright to visit
Of course I was talking about the London attractions, everytime I went there it was very crowded and suffocated with tourists
I don't remember standing in line in Dubrovnik for a single thing, while in London this was a common occurrence
Here in Romania a decent cheap coffee is Fortuna
Otherwise I get at least Delhaize brand single origin coffee - favourite is Costa Rica
Obviously I'd prefer getting my coffee from a local roastery/coffeeshop I like but I just can't afford it
I'm currently in a relationship with a Syrian man ( he is half circasian)
We met in my international highschool
He's travelled so much and lived in loads of places so he hasn't been really raised in Syria
He loves food and introduced me to wonderful middle eastern dishes
He ans his family are incredibly kind hearted and i was quite in awe at the level of community bonding that exists in Syrian (and middle eastern) society
His  stories are simply mesmeriaing and seem surreal
We definitely care about family in romania but it seems like for them community means family and i find that very beautiful
I am romanian and my boyfriend is british
Never thought that I will have a relationship, ever
but here we are, after one year and a couple of months
We’ve been together thru ups and downs, and I am not giving up on us so easily
We have a saying “ ce-i al tau, e pus deoparte” which means that what is yours, is set aside
I found what I need on earth, without even searching .
He’s stubborness is on the highest level of all and I am the sensitive one
Even when he is wrong, he is still right
at least I let him live thinking like this
I didn’t cooked him a romanian dish, because he is very picky with the food, but I will find something that will be suitable with him
He learned a few words in romanian and he is very proud about it ( this makes my heart melt)
Is very hard for him to be surrounded by romanians, especially at a party, when we completely forget about the fact that he is English ( it happened once, I still feel like shit about it)
I am very happy when he is correcting me, even if I still try to find arguments in my defence
My family is more than thrilled to meet him, they start learning english so they can have a conversation with more than 5 words
He never made me feel like I am foreign, even when I made mistakes, and for me this means a lot
I love him to bits
In my opinion, I think we have to love that person  for who it is not what is is
And love means a lot
saying "panaramă" (slut) instead of "panoramă" (landscape)
I've only heard it once but it was the only funny language mistake I've heard so far
One guy at the French section at our university got me laughing really hard
He was in the Romanian section in the 1st year, despite speaking a very very basic Romanian and he kept making translations from French into Romanian in his head, he would always pronounce Romanian words in a very French way
He was clever because he managed to make some really good associations between Romanian words and French ones and could find out the meaning, even when the words weren't so obviously connected
One funny time was the word "fut". He heard us saying it a lot and in Romanian it's the conjugated form of the verb "a fute" (to fuck), but he associated it with the "fut" from French which is the past simple version of the verb to be
So he got confindent enough to use the word and came up sentences like "Eu fut la secretariat, dar era inchis" (I fucked the secretary, but it was closed" :D We actually laughed our asses off, but only after 2-3 days we decided to tell him what it actually meant
Same in Romanian
I don't think we have any words containing "nb" unless they're compound words somehow
So writing "Istambul" is a frequent mistake
A lot of people also say "imbus" and it's acceptable haha
I think it's mostly an american thing
The naming of an age group (like the "millenials" or stuff like that) is quite a very recent thing (and not a very popular one, I hear it more often on TV)
It’s an American thing mostly
But I can say (from my experience of observing people) that in ex-communist countries there is a big  difference in mentality between those that lived in communism and those that were born after that
no and yes
In here we have 5 generations:
Old people that most people believe that they shouldn't vote
Not so old people, some are cool, some are not
Middle aged people who are your average joe
Teens that either are the downfall of romanian society or their salvation
Kids too young to care about this crap
The Hoia Baciu forest is one of the creepiest places in Romania
The trees grow in a weird way, there is a zone in the middle of the forest without any trees at all and photos of UFO sightings were taken there in the 1960s. Really weird place indeed
As someone who has lived a few kilometres from the forest for most of his life, I can say that the most disturbing thing that I ever witnessed there was an old couple banging in their car
I think people hearing or seeing things in Hoia might be closely tied with the fact that the oldest techno / EDM festival in Romania has been held there since the 90s. I hear there’s a ghost called Molly roaming the forest
Isn't it like the Most haunted forest în the world
Cam dap
liiykmma balls
Ive heard about it
its a suicide forest not haunted
Can't speak for Denmark, but here it feels more acceptable to say "fuck" and "shit" than the Romanian translation
* a. *A* *ei* = hers, belong to hers
* e. Short form of *este* = it is, is
* o. Feminine form used in a lot of phrases
*O* *femeie* = a woman
For masculine it's used *un*. *Un* *barbat* = a man
EDITED
O (female form of "a"/ "an")
E (official but informal short for "is")
There aren't a lot though
Silly question there, but interesting nontheless
Well,tehnically no,but yes
e-  the short form for "este" - is
Not really a word
"A" can mean "Oh"
O (one) in romanian
‘A’, which translates to ‘Ah’, ‘E’ is ‘is’, and ‘o’ is ‘an’.
We sometimes use "e" instead of "este" which means "it is"
> Czech has a couple
More like four couples
:-)
No wonder since I think in Transnistria Ukrainians are the plurality or at least second numerous ethnic group
Russians are the third
Of course
Having Ukrainians as a third of the population and being located in Ukraine in a way - you're on their part of the Dnister- does that
Are you mixed too or part of one of those three ethnicities
Of course if you want to answer
:-)
Here it's not really taboo if, let's say, a friend gets a new job and you ask what his salary will be
Bringing it up out of nowhere is just weird
It's not rude if you're close
However teachers are surprisingly secretive about their salaries
Well, I'm an airforce pilot
Given the fact that I am 21, I get paid a lot more than all my friends
I've once made the mistake of telling them my salary, and it only led to some really awkward moments of 'I'm really tight on money, would you mind paying for me
' like every week
Since then, when I am being asked, the only answer I give is 'enough'.
Older generations are still uncomfortable talking about these things (in our case because of the secrete police and how they hurt people without explaining why, so everyone just keeps to themselves every kind of information)
Younger generations are super comfortable about this
I had a conversation at work once with my other coworkers and a manager about our salaries and she tried to explain why corporate made certain decisions and why I (with less experience) had the same salary as one of my coworkers (that had more experience and had started with a smaller salary)
IMO it is
The same amount of money has different worth to different people
Focusing on some numbers can be misleading
I may have mortgage, while you don't. You may have other responsibilities that I don't.
If you are not happy with your wage, take it up with your manager and/or look for another job that pays better
It's a pretty common thing here, like small talk
Since 45% of our pay goes directly to the government, it's a common subject
It is rude
Black olives
I rarely see green ones around here
We (me and my family) prefer green ones in Romania
Black olives so far, because people always use them on pizza
When i was little i was very fond of black olives that my granpa would get from the market
Now i realize they were the cheap stuff full of iron gluconate
While black ones are predominantly available in supermarkets, there are also green ones, at least 2-3 types along with the black
Green ones are also preferred when filled up with other stuff, cheese, hot peppers, etc
But traditionally in Romania, as a kid I remember large tin cans with black olives from Greece, those were the norm in the 80’s and 90’s
Romania also, but we prefer green ones
In Romania, the president can just agree or disagree to some decisions the government, parliament and senate make
So the president acts like a watchdog and keeps some powers in check to not let them abuse their power (sometimes)
There are a lot of cases when the government or the senate try to pass shitty laws that would negate some of the progress Romania has done, and the president stepped in and rejected/challenged the laws they wanted to pass
This is possible because the president comes from a party that is in opposition, and it's kind of a good thing
But if the president comes from the same party as the majority party, it seems like a useless position because then he/she would just agree to whatever they pass, so his/her power is nullified
The president is ***supposed*** to make sure there is balance
When I was 12 I would get my bike and go to literally other cities with my friends,and I was one of the anitsocial kids,you can imagine the rest
Neacșu's Letter is the oldest known text written in old Romanian, dating back to 1521
It was written in Cyrillic, but it was late transcribed in the Latin alphabet which makes it readable by romainian speakers nowadays
I remember when we first saw this text in high school and were absolutely baffled by it
There are many words we don't understand today and the majority of it sounds very strange, but I think most people could understand at least half of it and get a raugh idea of its contents
Letopisețul Țării Moldovei is also a big headache
In Romanian we use the expression "are sens" (literal eng translation is "has sense")
Well, instead of using our saying, we use a literal translation of the English saying "makes sense"... the meaning is the same but it's sounds quite weird when you are aware of it
exactly same thing in romanian .
It completely makes sense to me
Also I never heard anyone say has sense instead of makes sense
same in romanian: actualmente

H-hewwo senpai OwO
Weeeeeeell
It happens a lot that I hear people speaking in Romanian in construction sites in Germany
So when I found myself lost in Amsterdam's outskirts, I walk by a construction site and yelled "does anybody speak Romanian
". A guy that looked like an engineer, that was a few meters away from says "you don't have to shout" in Ro
I asked for directions, thank the dude and that's how you get around foreignen cities
I was living in China
While I was paying my rent another white guy walked in and was trying to settle an issue with the building administrator
I helped him as much as I could in my broken Chinese
Between the broken chinese of 2 white guys and the broken english of the building administrator we managed to settle the issue
After that I chatted with the other white guy in english about what are the best chinese translation apps
Before I left I asked him where he's from
Romania
Romania
Romania
Romania too
Cue laughter (in romanian)
This is the complete opposite but still relevant to the title
I was on a flight from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur by myself
I just so happened to be sat in a section with a massive tourist group coming from Russia
Everyone else on the plane was either Middle Eastern or Malaysian
Everyone around me for like 5-6 rows was from this group
And I looked just like them
The Russians were very talkative to each other and friendly and there was a lot of cross group communication, people walking back and forth
Every so often someone would walk down the aisle, stop, talk to the people around me, but I never said anything cause I don't speak Russian
So they must have thought I am not friendly or something
All of them had at least another person they knew, like family or friends
I was there all by myself and it was a really strange atmosphere
At some point some very friendly guy just outright extended his hand to me and saluted me in Russian
I shook back and said "I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian". At that point I heard two girls behind him exclaim a very loud "oohhhh". None of them spoke English though, weirdly enough, so I never found out what kind of group it was
Yes we have [this] and I think they're planning to change it in the following years with something with a chip in it to work with electronic systems
In Romania we have something like [this] Which is ok but the main disadvantages it has are the fact it's fairly large(roughly 8 by 10 cm) and that it dosen't have your birthday written on it
It has the "CNP" or personal numeric code and your  date is written in it
That's a real problem when you leave the country since people abroad don't know how to translate that code and get your birthday
Also I should mention there is a photo of you in the left empty spot and some numbers in the lower area
You get it at 14
You have to got to a police station and register
They take an unflattering picture of you and some days later you can pick it up
[It's bigger than most European IDs
Yes, and it is required by law to make one when you turn 14 and renew it when it expires
You can see an image of it [here]
As to what it contains, the latest one has:
- series and no
of the ID Card
- personal numerical code (_CNP_)
- the photo of the person
- last name and first name
- nationality
- birth place
- home address
- the office where the ID Card was issues
- validity date
- machine readable code at the bottom
Didnt they want to also make it the size of a normal bank card
so it can FIT in wallets
Mine just hangs out, stored with the cash (men's wallet, very small)
Please, PLEASE have them actually do that
>Joacă-Bine Mirel
What a name
_Kowalski - Brzeczyszczykiewicz
Analysis
Yeah I just renewed mine some weeks ago
But I don't think it'll be done very soon
Our "elite" are against chips because it's the devil's work and they will steal your soul or whatever
So it might not even happen, who knows
I wouldn't be able to say, but I'd like that very much
The man, the myth, the legend
Yes, now that I think about it it's pretty inconvenient that it's not clearly written
It is really cute I agree and I hate that I lost all my stickers now
It does look more readable to my Romanian (so like, quarter-Slav
) eyes
It uses the 5G waves to give you Corona and enslave you to the overlord Bill Gates
Hah I know, right
Every time I see one of those cool cardholders I'm like "hmm this thing is cool but my id
I second this
Wallet shopping (and gift giving) with a Romanian ID is a real pain
There's a trend currently that's popular amongst the more uneducated people that this corona virus is fake, that 5G is dangerous, that Bill gates wants to steal their temperature and shit like that
It was the same with our national health insurance cards that got a chip so you can scan them, people were like "Uh no, muh soul, muh health, you're the devil" and stuff
Basically it's brainwashing of the masses but it just seems like they're brainwashing themselves
I can see where they come from, it’s about the size of a passport, but the sluggishness to switch to a one size fits all ID + driving license + medical insurance card is absolutely dreadful
Speaking of which, can anyone ELI5 why the name changed from Pozsony to Bratislava
The Slovak name for Pozsony used to be 'Prešporok'. The name only changed to Bratislava in 1919 iirc
Interesting
Of note is that this rarely occurred in Romania, with big cities like Oradea, Cluj, Timisoara, Arad etc
all keeping their original names
I started to learn English at school in 5th grade ( so at about 11 years old ) . This combined with the fact I used to watch a lot of movies ( all of them subbed, none was dubbed ) helped me to make rapid progress
I always considered English the simplest foreign language
In high school I had 4 English classes per week which helped a lot
Today I can understand English perfectly, I watch YouTube videos in English without the need of subtitles, if I watch an American movie I watch it without subtitles or with English subtitles, I do not need Romanian subtitles
I am at a point where I understand the language perfectly, I don't translate the words in my head or something like that, I understand almost as well as my native language
My pronunciation is good but not that good, I cannot imitate an American accent or any accent
My native accent is not very pronounced when I speak but you can still hear it .
From the age of 4
English classes in school, probably around the age of 12, maybe earlier, continued through high school and then college (more technical and applied to the field I was studying)
In high school I was already able to read, speak and understand, read a novel, do an essay, watch a movie without subtitles
Probably one of the most important factors for me was that we didn’t have dubbing in television in our country
It was always subtitles
Hearing the original language during the movies, or in general in any TV show, even extending to other languages, was really a boon
Dubbing was a thing only present on movie tapes, but video died quickly after 1989 and capitalism with cable TV took over
I picked French as my second language in high school (although I studied Russian for two years before) just because I was able to watch French TV, I liked it and was constantly having the TV on a French TV station
To my surprise, I only lagged behind in writing (the accents and a bit of grammar, which I was supposed to have studied already) but I was way ahead in reading, speaking and comprehension when compared to my class as high school freshmen
I learned it from TV when I was very young
I Romania all shows have subtitles
And when I was a kid, cartoons and kids shows were most of the time left unaltered, so no dubbing, no subtitles, nothing to explain what's going on in Romanian
Since I watched mostly English cartoons, I learned English
I have a friend that watched only French cartoons and she speaks French fluently now
I learned spelling mostly from video games (GTA cheat codes were a good start)
And around high school I started reading books in English
In our high school there was this little "bookshop" organized by the English teachers, where they would bring books that weren't translated into Romanian yet
The first book I bought was some Lovecraft story
i became fluent at 12, honestly i don't remember how i learnt it, i don't remember ever studying english
i guess it's from the Internet idk
I started watching TV (mainly Discovery) before entering school and then I mostly used the internet and movies
I'm a native Romanian speaker so my language is not even close to English, which  made it hard for me to understand (never had great teachers at school either, so I was pretty much on my own)
I remember the hardest thing to understand was that things are not pronounced as they are written
I started learning English because of the internet
My family got a laptop when I was 8 and from there I started watching a lot of YouTube since I was really interested in video games and it just spiralled from there
At 13 I got into anime and other TV shows that had only English subtitles so that helped
At first I wasn't able to understand anything but with time and a lot of perseverance I became pretty good at it
Now I'm 18, should've had my IELTS exam this spring but due to Covid-19 it got cancelled
It all started in the autumn of 2010 (more or less)
I was pretty young and my dad made me learn this language  without my consent
In the sixth grade i've reached a point in my english studies where i could listen to english youtubers and acctually understand like 40% of what they were saying
Therefore i started to wach youtube and after 100 episodes of Xcom enemy unknown , i started to understand english well enough to play any game and wach any movie in english
THE END
As a guy living in Netherlands, it's usually the white sneakers, jeans and wet hair that always gives it away for the Dutch girls
For the guys is the amount of industrial gel or wax in their hair
Edit: sneakers instead of snickers
Mmm, depends on what you consider an educated guess
Here in Romania we can tell with like 90-95% accuracy who is German among a group of tourists
Especially if they're old
Idk why, but my confirmation bias says that old German people's skin sags in a very distinct way haha
Interesting, I live in the Netherlands and I am pretty good at spotting Romanians
I once noticed 2 couples in Amsterdam from 20-30 meters away and was willing to bet they are Romanians
When I got close and heard the language, my guess was confirmed
I think it's partly the way they look, the way they dress and something that tells me they look Romanian, but I am having troubles pinpointing exactly what is the distinctive feature
Strippers eh
My new year's resolution will be to eliminate all activism from my life and not give a fuck in general
We have a lot in Romania
One that is mildly close to yours would  literally translate to " don't turn a mosquito into a stallion ". Basically it means don't over react, don't exagerate, don't make a big deal out of something that is not important
in romania we have "nu te uita ca mâța in calendar" which translates to "dont stare like the cat to the calendar" and roughly means "dont stare too long/dont be too shocked"
my favourite one is "a da cu mucii in fasole" -> "to put the boogers in the beans" and means to mess up but its really funny
we have "a freca menta", to rub mint, which means to waste time
i heard it comes from the ancient greek tradition of rubbing mint on tables to make them smell nice, which some romanian boyars adopted
do other Balkan countries have this as well
Well, we have
* Go walk the bear
* Don't turn the mosquito into a stallion
* Toyota
(Go away fast)
* And many more I can't remember right now
You're turning shit into a whip - Faci din cacat bici
Used whenever you make something way better than expected
Ok so we got:
A tăia frunze la câini = to cut leaves to the dogs meaning to waste time
Nu are toate țiglele pe casă = he doesn't have all the tiles on the house (roof) meaning he's crazy
I s-au înecat corăbiile = his ships have sunk meaning he's feeling down
A freca menta = To rub the mint meaning to waste time
A da la rațe/boboci = to give to the ducks/ducklings meaning to throw up(puke)
A face din rahat bici = to make a whip from shit meaning trying to do something impossible
And there's a lot more but I'm too lazy to write more
In Romania when you fuck up something we say "a face cacatul prastie" translated as to make the shit into a slingshot
"Ca nuca în perete" means "like a walnut in a wall". It means something that doesn't match/fit in with its surroundings
I also heard "Don't make an ox out of an egg".
A few others with insects / horses:
"Te-ai bagat ca musca-n lapte" = "You got in like a fly in milk"
And the more extreme one:
"Te-ai bagat ca musca-n cur la cal" = "You got in like a fly got inside a horse's ass"
Both mean something along the lines of "sticking your nose where it doesn't belong". Another way to say that is:
"Iti bagi nasul unde nu-ti fierbe oala
" = "You stick your nose where your pot is not boiling".
The Romanian equivalent of the first one is "they don't have all the bulls home".
Momentan lerne ich Deutsch, und das ist unglaublich hilfreich
Danke sehr, Mann (:
This one is so cool
We also have the first one
Our version of that is "Din lac în puț" which translates kinda like "out of the lake into the well".
the first one means to act confused in Eastern Romania/Moldova
How would it look written
I guess we have it like this because it rhymes
It's like "nu face din țânțar armăsar" Maybe for you "mosquito" rhymes with "elephant".
How did a camel saying land in your country
Also "doesn't have all the tiles on the house" or as my grandma used to say "doesn't have all the saturdays".
also "You get rid of the devil and you get his father".
i've also never heard the first one
funky
yes
it was on the tip of my tongue
The Romanian Academy (Academia Română) is a cultural forum founded in 1866
It covers the scientific, artistic and literary domains
The academy has 181 acting members who are elected for life
the academy's main goals are the cultivation of Romanian language and Romanian literature, the study of the national history of Romania and research into major scientific domains
Yes there is one, but I forgot the name of it, maybe someone can help me remember the name
It was the Institue of Romanian language, I think
Academia Română! they deal with more than just language, researching the history of the Romanian people, among other things, as well
but they are most well known for the DEX, perhaps our most important Romanian dictionary
honestly, that makes it really fun for us second language speakers
i love discovering silly old idioms online and comparing dialects from around the world
you never get that much diversity with other languages
also, you're all so lucky for not having to deal with grammatical gender and godforsaken noun cases in school
the adjective order, though
'ESASCOM' was my teacher's. still terrified of it
Ah, that's the one of course, they are mostly occupied with definitions and other grammar/dictionary rules, they are also responsible for editing grammar textbooks in schools if needed
I met a guy who thought kind of the reverse
He was convinced that except UK and USA everyone speaks at least a little bit of French
It's the lingua franca right
It's just those pesky english holding out
I think Mamaia it’s nice but it’s overcrowded and have too many bad songs so I prefer somewhere where there are less people
Mamaia is quite known in our country as the "upper middle and high class" beach resort with clubs and music and other "luxurious" stuff that you can find on every beach here, but people still pay thousands for one single location
I prefer the south though, Mangalia and its other resorts like Venus and Saturn (yes, named after planets) are very nice and has the same venues with cheaper prices
Some romanians go to bulgaria though
Romania doesn’t have a vast shoreline, but we have Plaja de la Olimp
I also find that it's too expensive for what it has to offer and it's also super overrated
The prices doesn’t seems higher than in Bucharest but I agree with the quality being low, tho there are quite a few restaurants with good food if you search for them
If you like minimal techno, i think Romania has some of the greatest DJs and producers: Priku, Charlie, Marcu Rares, Arapu and many others
Here are some youtube channels with minimal techno from romanian producers:
I totally recommend **Subcarpați**. They combine folk and techno in an amazing way
It’s probably not exactly what you wanted to hear, but after listening to the anthems of some other nations, such as those of Canada and Australia especially, I will say that they do not hold a candle to that of Romania
Also Romanian, I don't really like that kind of stuff but I'm gonna attach myself to this comment cause it's fairly high up
IMO some of the best Romanian stuff is by [Robin and the Backstabbers] Subcarpați is also great stuff
Can I just hijack this comment to recommend 2 other artists (Djs / producers) :D
Nerub and Musai Soundworks
Also for a more mainstream one, Silent Strike
Can I also add that I think Belgium has an awesome doom/stoner rock scene
I discovered so many cool bands while living there
Cowboys & Aliens, Maudlin, Tangled Horns, Miava and so on
Yesss I know them, they're great
I had the chance to attend last year's Alcatraz Festival and they had a dedicated stage/tent for local underground bands, I chilled a lot in there and discovered lots of goodies
I also went to Desertfest in Antwerp and absolutely loved it
That's so cool
:D Nah I'm nowhere near knowledgeable haha, I just love music and concerts
I got the chance to see many of my favorite bands and discover lots more while staying in Antwerp
We don't get that many concerts in Romania, much less in my hometown, so of course I had to take advantage hahah
And I'd love to taste that beer next time I visit
The only two cities that actually have a serious rivalry are Galati and Braila
Bucharest and every other City that is not Bucharest
I'd say Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest
The two are among the most developed cities in the country and major economic centers
Cluj has the reputation of being more modern than Bucharest, but Bucharest is still more important being the capital and having higher GDP
Both cities have a superiority complex that is often quite hilarious
There are talks of Cluj getting a metro station which would take this feud to the next level since Romanians from Bucharest often make fun of Cluj for not having a metro just to put salt in the wound lol
Bucharest vs Cluj - centralism vs regionalism, Paris vs Vienna, significant cultural and dialect differences
Craiova could cut in that list too tbh
Bucharest x Cluj
Timișoara and Arad have a similar rivalry, in football at least
Well, no city comes close to Budapest, so naturally no city even thinks of competing or comparing with Budapest in thr first place because it's pointless from the get go
It would be hilarious to hear any city to try and compete/compare to Budapest
On the other hand, if you had two big, similar cities in the country, you bet there'd be rivalry
Who do they have a rivalry with
That's a one-way rivalry
Cluj thinks Bucharest is its rival, Bucharest doesn't even know Cluj exists for most of the year, until Untold comes around
Not really
Braila , from my pov the swords and the clans from both the cities are some next level shit , at least imo
Local dialects are pretty much dying down
You can only hear them at the countryside nowadays
"Transylvanians have a weird accent"
Hmm
I sure do wonder why
You don't know what I mean huh
I am sorry if I seemed racist
But come on, hungarian influence clearly influenced them a lot
Oof, sorry man
Though it is true that romanian transylvanians sound weird as well
so we have something in common lmao
That Numa Numa song everyone asks Romanians to sing
It was made by Moldavians
They have a thing for meme songs, eurovision is proof
Being Slavic
(I’m Romanian
Wait, people blame Poland for those
We have latin as a mandatory subject in a year or two
Had to learn Latin as well in Romania
God I hated it
In Romania, that is 30% of our Baccalaureate grade, except it’s not easy and you don’t really have a choice but to memorize around 15 essays, 6 pages each, of text analysis
At the exam, you get one essay randomly assigned and you need to write it all down from memory
It’s usually narrating the story, adding a few examples from the book (you need to be able to write down the exact words that the author wrote), literary critiques’ words, and finally, some actual analysis (that you gotta memorize from home too)
With poetry it gets a bit trickier because you get less chances of covering those 6 pages with examples from the text and you need to add more text analysis :(
For instance, we need to talk about the ideation of death and suicide in one of the books we study for baccalaureate, along with the character traits and background (the building up part from the first part of the novel) that brought them to the breaking point
With poetry you end up analyzing just the title “Blue Flower” in 300-400 words
Basically, text analysis is all we do in high school in Romanian classes
At the exam itself you also get to answer some grammar questions, prove you have non-literary text understanding (you get a science text and need to extract data from it), and write down a 2 page long opinion essay where you talk about a randomly assigned subject (like the importance of wearing traditional clothes on a daily basis) - but these are things you should be able to do from Y5 to Y8 of middle school
We also get an oral examination part in the Romanian Baccalaureate, which you can’t fail, but you wouldn’t want to get marked with “low level” either
There, they test your smoothness in Romanian, like how easily you’re able to express yourself
Afaik you get asked about one of the books that you need to be able to talk about for the written part itself + an opinion on something
Edit: typos
Latin is mandatory in 8th grade (1h/ week) and then, if you choose “filologie” as your high school path (the branch where you study literature, foreign languages and social sciences), you end up taking Latin classes until you graduate, with 1h/ week during Y9-Y10 and 2h/ week during Y11-Y12
It’s also a subject for semestral finals once you choose “filologie”, and the methodology of the class itself sucks, so don’t expect to understand anything
You either get an understanding teacher that lets everyone pass with 10/10 (maximum grade) or some evil mummy that makes you repeat the whole year
Lucky you
We have mandatory religion classes that are entirely centered around Christian Orthodoxy, and other religions are shunned
It's, in my opinion, just religious propaganda force-fed to you from first grade until your last year of high school
And the only way to not have to attend the Indoctrination Class, as I like to call it, is to get some documents from your local religious organization (if you're Muslim, for example, you need papers from the mosque you go to) or have your parents sign some papers when you first start school
All we did in Latin was learn some verb tenses, *declinări* and adjectives
Also read and translate sometimes
Such a waste of time honestly
Damn, you got quite lucky
Our waste of time is different because our professor is very *nefutută* and she really enjoys torturing us with her useless subject (and grading us accordingly)
Guess I'm tired or sth, but even though I know of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I first thought that you mentioned a clothing store
Pretty sure Romania doesn't have any
They were never the same city to begin with plus the 2 cities are divided by a natural border, the Danube, not by a man made border
Yes, but if you look at Gorizia for example, it was once a single city but then got divided when the borders changed, in the case of Giurgiu and Ruse, they were never a unified city, they were always separated
Romanians have beef with Hungarians over Transylvania
I honestly know people from all sides, and decent people usually don't argue over it
There are some crap people who want that piece of land just for their country and hate the other country's guts
It goes both ways
Romanians have a lot of that
Of course, our narrative is the correct one, but plenty of people will say we’re oppressive slavs who never owned Transylvania and shouldn’t own Moldavia
Anyone up to a fight then
Same goes with everyone from trianon apart from hungary
Fool
You bringed a knife to a sword fight
Same here with the banat region, ofc is not known who was first but hungarians dissapeard from the region and appeard agaun during the late 18th century, till then te regions was mostly ingabited by romanians,serbs and germans(small but considerable numbers of jews and bulgarians too)
Definitely
They do call it “the CONFORT of your own home” for a reason
Yeah, mostly old clothes and those that I bought (mostly because they were cheap) but don’t really like anymore
I'm lazy
I stay only in pijamas
Yes I do, doesn't everyone
You inadvertently stumbled upon a great conundrum in language
In romanian it's spelled coNfort because it's imported directly from french
In english it's spelled coMfort because english doesn't import words, it lurks in dark alleys, beats up other languages and rifles through their pockets for spare vocabulary
Seriously though it's not known exactly why english has a different spelling but it causes a lot of problems for Romanians and especially autocorrect will freak out trying to decide which one you're trying to spell
Some theories say english imported it through other languages or that it was transmitted only orally leading to a misspelling
[I found a discussion that points out how the COMF prefix is very rare in English too so
>because english doesn't import words, it lurks in dark alleys, beats up other languages and rifles through their pockets for spare vocabulary
This is hilarious
Generally speaking, Hungarians are sensitive about everything to do with Romania and WWI so they might be offended by the "Treceti batalioane romane Carpatii" (Romanian troops, cross The Carpathian Mountains) song
Welp, we have a Romanian version of Katiusha that is
questionable
There is a song called "Sus pe malul Nistrului" that means "Up on the shore of the Nistru" and it's basically telling Russians that Moldavia isn't theirs
Also, a lot of other patriotic Romanian songs, especially those about Ardeal do piss off some Hungarians
Romanian here
Our national anthem refers to the Ottoman Empire as the ‘Barbaric Crescent’. It’s not wrong, though
[Or this]
I propose that song to be the new National Anthem
Crusader Kings: I tried Romania from different starts, also went for some others such as England and Saxony
I also play much with mods
Europa Universalis: Isn’t working right now
Hearts of Iron: Romania, many times, with repeated failure
Guatemala, many times, with repeated failure
France, many times, with repeated failure
Ethiopia, many times, with repeated failure
It seems like in Romania, Streisângeorgiu is the longest but I'm not sure
Drobeta Turnul Severin  and Câmpulung Moldovenesc both with 20 letters
Let's hope I get into an exchange program I've been trying to get into
im thinking of visiting the baltic states, do them all in like 2 weeks or so, always met nice people from those countries and im curious how they developed after the fall of communism
I have that problem too
Erasmus+? I was supposed to leave in September but it got cancelled :(
I am trying with the Flex program but I really hope you'll leave next year
Are you going to America
I wish you the best too
It's really cool exchange program for European and Asian high school students
They offer the opportunity to study one year of high school in USA
I knew I didn’t have to scroll too much to see Porto Cervo mentioned
:))
i was in a holiday trip in Greece and near Metsovo on Ignatia Odos ( Ionian Island-Thessaloniki) i have seen a truck with Iran license plate
2 American ones: one from Florida and one from New Jersey
Damn it can't we get people from more normal US states to visit us
a bright red sports car with a plate from an arab-speaking country (can’t tell which one since in don’t know what the plate said), all the way lost in some little town in Brittany, France
Two ways:
"arond" = literally "rounded a"
"coadă de maimuță" = "monkey tail", it was used back in the 90s and early 2000s, and only informally
Arond in Romanian, can’t really translate it in English
Now that you put it like this, it really makes sense :))
In football I usually cheer for Croatia or Iceland
My country is knocked out almost every time, so I will always cheer for another country
Everyone except Hungary
I would rather die than cheer for them
Any Balkan Country> Any European Country except Hungary> Anyone playing against Hungary
I always cheer for the underdogs
We are by default knocked out of any major international sports tournament, so we cheer for other countries by default
Romanian here
We’ll cheer for the other Latin countries
I second this ^
About your comment on the UK, haven't even been there or something but I just always thought if u aren't like that in a country like the UK, u end up smashing your head against the wall every day
The weather and overall atmosphere always has an impact on people
No, you cannot take the 'black sheep of the Latin family' title away from us like that
use bunq
They definitely can, but who would want to
You don't ?I thought that's quite common
Annoying little Roaming traps
Over the last few years, I've been spoiled by the Roaming system in Europe: you can use your data plan from home with no extra cost, as long as you are in another EU or EEA country (European Economic Area)
Problem is these little states don't bother
In Andorra, just checking Google Maps costed me €50
I would have spent more, but my carrier locked my Roaming at that point
When I visited Monaco, I knew about it, but by the time I realized the train entered the station, my phone already used €30 worth of data
The same will be when I visit San Marino
Lichtenstein should be different, since I believe they are in EEA
Vatican I believe uses the Italian carrier networks
Lichtenstein (and Swiss as a matter of fact) aren't different
Albeit depending on the carrier they might be cheaper
Since you are also from Romania, I just looked at Vodafone, Orange, and Telekom
Liechtenstein should have European Roaming, while Switzerland doesn't.
Not according to the carriers in my country at least
As Roaming goes, it's cheaper to go to Africa than San Marino
There's no [European Roaming]
This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I view Iran as the aggresor here
Iran attacked the US embacy in Baghdad
The only thing the US did was protect it's embassy and rightfully so
In the end Iran got what it deserved
There are no words to describe my thoughts
I just HOPE it was not random and US had a SOLID and well thought backup plan for this measure
Otherwise I PRAY iranians are wiser than Trump and will stick to a decent war not affecting all of us
What can I say
America back at it again
I don't know why they like having conflicts with everyone like this, but they better resolve it peacefuly
I get the same feeling because that would explain the whole discussion about an "european army" that we recently had
Russia
Hungary
They want transylvania again =))) (in reality there is no real dispute anymore)
Russia
Russia (or Hungary)
Russia
Russia
Hungary, Turkey, or Russia
(Romanian
Russia definitely
Unfortunately by proxy that also includes Hungary presently
We're in a bit of a pickle
Mader Rasha
Ukraine
Russia
Russia closely followed by those sneaky Hungarians
It's a pretty obvious choice
Crazy nation with a crazy leader armed to the teeth
Nah Russia is too busy dealing with Russia
Also you have a huge history in invading your neighbour s. This is hiatory is not that far if I think of it
In Bucharest the student cafeterias should accept only students technically
But since it's Romania, they accept almost everybody
Except for homeless people and obvious trouble makers (people who come in screaming for instance)
The food is cheap, usually decent
And the cafeteria from the Politehnică even has a cool futuro-soviet look to it and it's worth visiting
Edit: politehnica = physics, math, that sort of thing
[I can't find better pictures :(]
It's the last 3 pics in the slideshow
The song "Dragostea din tei"(Numa numa) is written in romanian, but is played by a moldavian(Dan Bălan), in fact a romanian(because Moldova is Romania basically)
The lyrics are so catchy and the melody is so cool, I strongly recommend to listen this    song
:)))
Being written in my native language surely didn't stop "Dragostea din tei" from becoming famous worldwide
Most of my favourite songs come from the 2011-2012 period when a rennasiance of Romanian music kind of happened
They are quite famous here but didn't go abroad
"Dragoste de inchiriat" by Akcent
High pitch voice dudes makes it so catchy
Not my native language, but Molchat Doma
They're a post-punk band from Belarus and I absolutely love their music
Oddly, they're known more around Europe than in their own country
Here's a link to my personal favorite:
In Romanian it's "copiuță" and it means "little copy".
Or "fițuică", which is an old word used in a derogatory way for newspapers that weren't serious (i.e. tabloids)
Also worth mentioning that the verb we use for cheating at a test is "to copy".
Yeah, you're right, that's another definition, I should've mentioned it, too
No lockers when I was in school, but we could leave our books in our classroom either on our desks or on some shelves at the back of the classroom
Nobody really did though cause we needed those books for homework most of the time anyway
But, to spare our backs we would share the load of books between deskmates (two people usually share a desk in the classroom)
For coats we had wall hangers at the back of the classroom
I used to have lockers in high school, but I don't think it's a common practice
We don't have lockers
We have PE changing rooms(without lockers)
It's very school dependent, both schools that I went to had lockers but since in my city most schools split classrooms and there aren't enough lockers, the kids in the the lower grade used them (cause their backs are more fragile or something), so I used the lockers in 1st through 4th grade but then never used them again
I try to make it easier on my back by only carrying the 5-6 notebooks, some pens and a bottle of water and make a photo of the books I need to use
Yeah,but they are only some wooden cabinets that we share . 2 people per cabinet
Nah we don't have those things
we are more old school
We have those in private schools
Even so , I don't see how they can be that useful
Yes, some schools have them but in poorer areas of the country you have to carry your backpack everywhere with ~5kg of books
Srsly
La mine dacă îți uiți cartea la școală îți iei scandal monstru
Sau dacă te înțelegi cu colegul de Banca sa ia unul carte azi altul cartea mâine, iar scandal că de ce nu ai carte
The only time I had lockers was when I was in kindergarten lmao
"poorer areas"- I live in Bucharest, and me and all of my friends break our backs for those useless books that we didn't even use most of the time
Also in my class a lot of people didn't bring the manuels for useless clasess(music, french, religion, etc)
Same :(
I also live in Bucharest and have to carry my backpack to school every day :))
Mann, I weight mine last year and it was 14kg
Million - Milion
Billion - Miliard
Trillion - Trilion
And I think we stop here
I think
We also have *catralion*. Which is 10^(6) trillions
Wow
In Romanian it's the same as in Danish, just that we use only one "L": Milion and Miliard
> 1012 = trillion = trliarde
Mistake here, it's [trilion] actually
Sounded off to me, so I looked it up
Fair enough though, it's not very commonly used :)
You actually sent me to DEX, lol
Well, truth is I too went to DEX, because I wasn't sure how much that word meant
I just knew it existed rofl
I swear I'd thought it's a made up word to describe a huuuge amount of money, so thanks for the TIL :D
Bucharest have underground tunnels around the city since the WWII (or WWI if I’m not mistaken)
The palace of parliament also have some big tunnels under it and it’s only speculated that those extend throughout the city and connects with the airport in case Ceausescu wanted to escape in a nuclear attacks
I...dont thunk we have
But we had a conspiracy thpry about some  secret tunnels under the parliment in bucharest that would lead outside the city
What makes your country stand out
Bad economy, oh wait that's like most of eastern europe, nvm
We are a fish on the map
Maybe Italy is a boot and has good fashion, but things are definitely fishy here most of the times
Bitch our country is shaped like a fucking fish
Fastest interet in Europe and one of the best in the world
And our culture is so mixed due to all the bois that wanted our precious land, that it became unique
Fuck (still with respecc) the other countries, Romania uber älles
Geography !!! In Romania you can go from seaside to plains to hills to  mountains all in the span of a couple of hours (in theory at least)
This is not considered such a big thing but for people who live in countries that only have plains, or only hills, might find this very interesting
For the other folks browsing the comments: The only Latin nation in Eastern Europe
The only reason Romania is nr 7 is that we treat beer like a nonalcoholic  drink
Men drink beer when they can't afford to drink something over 40°. Women drink other soft drinks which taste better (generally, eg I love apple cider and am not a woman, don't jump me)
We are still in the early stages of this, but they are multiplying like crazy
There are TONS of ads for videochat jobs for girls and people are even handing out flyers in universities
How do you heat the saunas
Also any statistic about how much finnish people (I want to say fins, but those are also fish flaps
) spend for sauna heating per year
Really curious
Swimming in a sea of slavs
Fast internet hi5
Finland and Sweden combined look like a floppy dick on most of the maps, not just the coin one
Let's not be so hasty about this
We almost got rid of corruption by fucking legalizing it
Good thing most people are not 100% dumb and protested
You guys scared us shitless
I am in the second biggest city here and there are no hand sanitizers left anywhere
Can confirm
I learned german grammar between 2002-2012
What I learner in the first half decade about ß changed in the last half
Now I can't always remember which one is correct so I just use "ss" instead of ß. (Eg I know Spaß has the ß but am really not sure about muss/muß)
Also your mercenaries were really good during the 14-15th century
Together with romanian, serbian and sometimes szekely mercenaries, Mihai the Brave  almost got into Constantinople and also formed something similar to modern Romania (which sadly only lasted 1 year)
Very debatable
Technically yes, but by a very little margin
We are in a political crisis which has already lasted >3 years
People are tired of it
Really hope to get rid of those snakes in power soon
Pretty much
People who lived during communism tend to also be bad at living in a capitalist society
Communism fell only 30 years ago, so still a lot of them
Isn't that what happened in the Netherlands
Dutch sounds like a German having a seizure and most words look like they were written by a person with dyslexia
Good thing they (still) have affordable healthcare to treat that sick burn
It's way less expensive than I have thought
Is this per year or per month
Yup, I think only Hungary can dream to even come close
I have seen news about lightbulbs in schools being supplied by the mayor's nephew and costing €7K per piece
This was just one example but man they are robbing the state (and, by extension, the taxpayers) blind
The only highway from Arad (western Romania, bordering Hungary) to Costinesti (our part of the Black Sea) is more than 80% in Bulgaria
Times change
Liberalism levels stay the same
I had an Austrian professor (at a German school) and besides of the accent, nothing was different
Might be he was deliberately trying to speak Hochdeutsch
Yeah, Hochdeutsch is a big fat lie I studied for 20 years
They use it on TV shows too, but it's all just a myth
Went to Germany and I couldn't understand shit
After 3 years of working closely with Germans, I still find it hard to understand them sometimes if they don't deliberately speak to me like I'm some sort of disabled donkey
Yup, I work with a certain Porsche subsidiary, with the HQ in Ludwigsburg, but they are open in München and also have offices in Romania too
I have other projects with people from Berlin (which speak differently)
The easiest to understand are people from western Germany and people who speak German as a 2nd language
We have some dialects too, but most people use the official language with few variations, which are mostly caused by illiteracy rather than culture/region
I don't think that's even physically possible in Bucharest,
In my city it will be cosidered very weird if someone does it
I went to UNI in England for 3 years and I found it odd when people did this, but I got used to it quite fast and I started doing it as well
But in Romania it would be so weird
We have multiple exits for the inner city buses and it would practically be impossible
That and the fact that people will look at you like you're some kind of a maniac if you wish some stranger a good day
We don't show empathy to one another
Only private buses
Nope, not really
Exactly the same in Romania
I am romanian working in China currently
I keep my mouth shut and I will never touch blizzard games ever again unless they do something
The reason that I keep my mouth shut is that here you can end up in prison quite easily if you have a stance against the CCP
Even my colleagues are brainwashed
Blizzard fucked up, and this is gonna affect them in the long run for sure
They tried to control the damage and it turned against them
What is "full centrism retardism"? It's the first time I hear this expression
Taking ALL the prize money
No other contestant got any money because of this
They had a very generic "catch all" rule that stated that if you do anything that offends Blizzard customers, Blizzard has the right to reduce the prize pool to 0 and take any decision they want
Still fucked up and very wrong
Because they would tell me .
France, Japan and Romania (because I'm biased)
I like how Estonia look
Romania because fish
Romania looks like a fish, aye
Lock on on the Tranzistria and Rp
Moldova Border
Ours just looks like a fish
Romania is a fish
Haha, fish go blublub
Why did you comment this
Feel free to have a look at a map
Are you seriously going to tell me that I've been looking at my *own country's map* my whole childhood and didn't see a [fish]
Do you even know which country Romania is on the map
Is this fish-shape envy
Is this what is all about
You know there can be more fish shaped countries in the world, right
It's not a competition
This will have huge impact on Europe since it will increase the refugee crisis and will guarantee more support for ISIS
It was a dick move by turkey
My opinion is that,like everyone here(except some turks),the kurds should have their own country,they deserve it because of their effectiveness in fighting ISIS
My country
right now no stance will be taken because the current goverment is likely to fall and a general election might happen
But in the future will be against Turkey
It's a very delicate issue here
Mostly is like trying to walk on eggs without breaking them - we need Turkey's military support here in the "neighbourhood" but at the same time we have been dealing with them for so long during history that we know "too much" of that force might turn wrong
90% of the "Turkish" people I met here in Bucharest are kurd refugees
Most of them don't talk about it and it's the type of topic they strongly avoid
Seems that Romania has given them asyle under some very strict terms and that's about it
Where is Vlad when you need him
We always were against Turkey
I meant in the region
But with an increase in both refugees in europe and support for isis there, we will also have more isis members on EU soil
With Americans I can absolutely every damn time tell that they're Americans
But I can't explain why
It's just something in how they speak that's just obvious
Maybe the volume
Or the attitude or the words they use
Idk
With other native speakers I can tell 80 % of the time, because there are some accents like the new Zeeland accent or some from the UK that I just assume they're Dutch or have a speech impediment
Most of the times I figure out someone is Brit/american, text-wise that is, by their complete disregard of the proper use of they're/their its/it's. Non-native speakers tend to be particularly careful of those, whilst most brits can't be arsed most of the time lol, even in office emails
In previous jobs seeing those mistakes in company emails/presentations drove me bonkers hahahaha
No biting in Romanian either
Instead, we most commonly say "a da colțul" (to turn around the corner, more or less), "a da ortul popii" (to give the coin to the priest, probably inspired from Greek mythology), "a întinde copita" (to stiffen your hoof - animal imagery, what can I say)
I don’t think we any expression with the verb to bite, not one that I can remember at least
We have “a da coltul” meaning to turn around the corner and “a-ti suna ceasul” meaning your clock has rang
+ “a-i suna ceasul” - “to have their clock alarm go off”
> a da ortul popii
Some more info: "ortul" which is the articulated form of "ort' comes from the German "ortstaler" - a quarter of an old leu or taler, and it referred to a Polish silver coin from 1600, like [this one printed by Sigismund III] in time "ortstaler" got shorted to just "ort".
When someone died you'd tie an ort to their right hand pinkie finger so they'll use it to pay their toll to the other side, it was also a symbolic payment (because an ort wasn't worth much) to the priest which would help you pass to the other side through the religious ritual that he performs
This pagan custom comes from Greek antiquity where they would place an "obol", a coin inside the dead person's mouth so they can use it to pay or bribe Charon, the ferryman who would pass them the Styx river into the world of the dead
Similar custom was done by Romans
Is the last word anapoda
We have that word in Romanian but I never thought about its origin
It means the opposite or the wrong way of doing something
The most slav of the latins
Our culture and language was mostly slavified during our time in the Bulgarian Empire, our people even using cyrillic until the 19th century, and we still share a nice amount of customs with the Bulgarians
Really our connection with the Bulgarians is underrated, our history is intertwined at so many points in time and it's a shame that our time in the Bulgarian Empires is so criminally unmentioned in our schools
We even got our independence in the same war (although we got full independence and Bulgaria only became a tribunary state)
A Romanian-Bulgarian state was actually proposed in the aftermath of the Russian-Turlish Liberation War, but the Great Powers went "no".
Clearly the handiness
If you give a Romanian guy some duck tape  and a hammer  he can probably build a car out of thin air
Also if you give a Romanian woman a potato and some onion she can feed 7 people out of it

Glad I chose to learn Norwegian and not Danish
Your language sounds sooooooo weird
I honestly found I was hearing an Italian guy mocking Arabs
Probably the cheapest on average
Here I get unlimited mobile data for 2€
I don't believe that's a real word and you can't convince me otherwise
I'd say this is a peculiarity of the germans
Very long compound words
I mean Bulgarian Empire although kind of incorrect just kind of stuck, same with how Romania (and even Moldova) is part of Balkans now
In our schools history entirely skips over the medieval era and some important parts like the Romans leaving Dacia and the Bulgarians taking over are barely mentioned
Its as if history just goes like "Romans take Dacia, Dacia is taken by Slavs, we fight Ottomans, Romania is formed". There was a thread too on r/askbalkans a while back about education systems and it seems that generally more is taught about the west than about us
It's pretty bad all around
The Bulghars were our main source of slavificstion and we also got along with them pretty well
Though I wouldn't consider myself a Bulghar fanboy
because we have big, untuaght history with it (hell, i just found out now and im 17 and in the last grade of school) and theyre our very similar neighbours
for example, a lot of dishes and foods share the same name such as musaka and ghiveci, dorada too (sea bream)
we arent too different, really, and its very important to appreciate them
I went to Crete 2 years ago, me and my brother rented a convertible to drive around the mountain roads for 1 day(bloody beautiful) and I noticed there are bullet holes in EVERY SINGLE ROADSIGN
Asked out tour guide the next day wtf is that and the answer we got was "Yeah they like shooting stuff in the mountains", we asked if gun control was that relaxed and she said "Nope but who's gonna go there and take them"
10/10 would visit again
Sarmale are a favourite in Bulgaria (though they arent named the same)
Truly our brothers
That's... long
For a second I forgot about other german speaking countries besides Germany, my bad for the generalisation
But now I'm curios, are there any other languages that do this or just the german language
I don't think that assimilating any language is a good thing, but since it happened for now we don't have much of a choice than to go with it and be proud of our language
Saying slavification didn't happen becaude we still speak a Romance language is like saying I didn't paint a wall because only a bit is actually with paint on, Slavs still had a major impact on Romanian
Early proto-Slavic groups were pretty similar as far as I understood, so there weren't many linguistic differences between say Bolghars and the other Southern Slavs at the time the migration happened
That explains why only 2% percent of the 11% of Slavic loan words we have
This is only talking about modern Romanian, which is after the big attempt to latinise our language after the 19th century when many slavic words were replaced
Previous to that an even bigger amount of slavic words were used, and Romanian was commonly regarded at that time as a Slavic language
And even if all of this were to be fake, Bolghars still had a huge impact on our history, calling me a fanboy of the Bolghars just for caring about that is really wrong
Ah yes, a worthy opponent
Yea, the people that tried to take us as slaves in the medieval age just because we didnt like the huge amount of taxes they inposed on us surely are our brothers
Nice strawman
Throwing out the fact that a food originates from one place and not from another doesn't really mean anything as to in what culture it can be traditional in
Saying "haha wine originated in phoenicia" can't contradict the fact that wine is a staple of Italy, France and Spain
Also the dishes do variate greatly across the cuisines they are popular in
Idk why you oppose the fact that we and the Bulgarians do have stuff in common, genuinely curious about that
Underrated thread of the day
A worthy oponent for the german language
We'll stay out of this one
How am I sucking their dick
Is simply acknowledging the fact that us and the Bulgarians interacted a lot during history and were most of the time on the same side sucking Bulgarian dick
And even so if it was why would sucking Bulgarian dick be bad
Either this  - old rap group who are still popular despite being way worse than their heyday in the late 90s - early 00s
or this  - old dance/ house group with a revolving door of featured female vocalists, still at it after 15 years
but my favorite is this  - new artist I first heard a few weeks ago, sounds pretty different compared to other pop singers here
According to YouTube trends, this shit:
Bine, asta in afara de dragostea din tei ofc
I came here for Înoată Cheluțu, I am disappointed
Păi aia nu mai e de actualitate, plus că ar sări moldovenii că le prezentăm artiștii drept români
Aș fi vrut să pun The Motans cu Alina Eremia - Din trecut, dar m-am abținut, pentru că e motanul din Moldova
Sorry to disappoint you
I didn't count Youtube meme songs
La mulți ani
In Romania it's definately Szekelyland,considering people there are mostly ethnic hungarians
Transylvania
Is easier to find people speaking hungarian than speaking romanian in some regions of it
Szekelyland - or Ținutul Secuiesc in Romanian
All people there are Hungarian
As a Romanian there are two regions that stick out
\-The  Szekelyland(Tinutul Secuiesc) an majority magyar region,with a seperatist movement and good food
Right now we don't get along to well,but we tolerate each other
\-Oltenia:This is definitly the Florida of Romania .It's culture is Romanian yes,but they have some weird atributes
They are known for being poor,speaking extremely fast and getting angry very easily,and when they get angry they get agressive
And well,there are numerous jokes about the fact that they always carry a knife/sword/machete/katana around from a very young age
This comes from the fact that the mafia is controlling large amount of the region,not even trying to hide it anymore
It has to be Vaslui,it's the Romanian version of Florida/Texas
Vaslui, that region is in another planet honestly
Oh and probably Harghita and Covasna as well, many hungarians live there and they are very odd to be honest
So it's not Moldova with all the grandma raping and medical alcohol drinking
Ah yes, Pula
Naww, it's not as alien
If anything I'd give the "crown" to Vaslui and environs
I'm glad to see the legend crossed international borders
Wow I see you have some pretty good skils of talking in Romanian i suggest you joining r/Romania a pot of fun and see what is happenig in here :)
You speak Romanian better than our former prime minister
In general "manele" which is more from the gypsy community but
[ this is a "disstrack" apparently
This guy is Morgz but 4 times worse
this one’s about the coronavirus:
this one’s literal propaganda for the social democratic party:
this one’s also a live performance
his name is dorel giurgiu and he was a eurovision contestant:
from the same man, we have a quick lesson in sex ed:
just a really yucky song
its title translates to “the streetwalker”.
this one’s about kendama:
this one is about fidget spinners:
this is
well, something
the video is a cinematografic masterpiece:  (title roughly translates to “i have too much money”)
this one isn’t outrageous or something, it’s just an anti-cop rap song, but the lyrics are reeeeally funny and you should look them up:
i can’t describe this song, honestly
look at the lyrics in the description:
again, it’s too much to explain
the title means “the pirate”:
funny song with funnier video:
You REALLY don't want to do this, but here  [
But if you meant 'worst' but more like catchy and viral, this was making waves around the internet the last years  [
Romanian Trap music
Its just bad
They copy trends from the US but do them shit
Romanian manele
It’s more annoying when someone blasts it from their cars at 2AM
From Spain reggaeton I would say, tho it's not really Spanish but we hear it way too much
And for Romania manele
Though I do like some songs
But most nope, most are like Romanian reggaeton lol
this is a mix between some kind of trap and cheap manele and it reassembles all the bad things in the country
Manele
Literally every song of that genre
Worse than anything in my entire opinion
Is this Backstreet Boys polish version
Oficial am murit înăuntru când am ascultat cântecul ala
We also have this artist called “Abi Talent”. He sings about almost the same things as in manele, but uses modern rap instrumental instead
I didn't know that
I only know them from eurovision and I remember liking them quite a lot lol
This is art
I think i was really lucky to not hear of any of those "singers" before
Aw but I liked them on eurovision
Würst music
Zdreanțo a venit Abi skrrr
Ik he's bad
Also Iron Maiden
Empire of The Clouds is one of my favourite songs
The whole album is so fucking good
Oh wow :))))
I have lived with my parents till 26 before I was able to save and buy my own apartment
I had a few girlfriends over many times
I have also slept at a couple of girlfriends places, who still lived with their parents
It's never been a problem, we would always exchange greetings, talk while eating after, or when running into each other
There is an unwritten rule that as long as the door is closed you don't bother one another
I guess, as long as you are polite and don't act rude, or like a dick, there shouldn't be any problems
Dude, just schedule it when your parents aren’t home, it’s not that hard and they’re mostly understanding
Neither I nor my brother brought back home a bf/gf
But for weeb virgin reasons mostly
In my hometown, in my friend group, most people were virgins before they went for university, or had some terrible sexual experiences, like a quick bj that didn't work, cuz the guy got nervous, or the guy missing the correct hole a few times, or the girl accidentally grazing the penis with her teeth, stuff like that
But after a certain age (like 16), parents just kind of understand that you want private time with your bf/friends in general and they don't really bother you
Lived with my parents until I was 30 and my girlfriend moved in with me when we were about 25
Even before moving in with me, she would spend a lot of nights there
Same thing for highschool/university years, there were two options: either my parents place or her parents place
Never had any issues
But you need to keep in mind, on average houses or apartments in Europe tend to be way better insulated than those in the US, so noise is not that huge of a concern
Sure, you need to keep it down a bit, but nothing that would impact your enjoyment
Also US folks  are way more prude when it comes to sex than Europeans
The only remarks I got from my mom were: "make sure you use condoms" or "do you have enough money for condoms
if not here is some to buy them".

When I visited Malta, I feared for my life a little bit because of how crazy the drivers are and how shitty the roads are
Plus, the hills make everything worse
"Deşteaptăte, Romăne
" mean "Wake up, Romanian
" and honestly i think it is one of the best anthems out there, not because it is my national anthem, but for its lyrics and its message
It just pumps me whenever i hear it
Here is a well done,rhyming english version on the Romanian one :3
Awaken thee, Romanian, shake off the deadly slumber
The scourge of inauspicious barbarian tyrannies
And now or never to a bright horizon clamber
That shall to shame put all your nocuous enemies
Its now or never to the world we readily proclaim
In our veins throbs and ancestry of Roman
And in our hearts for ever we glorify a name
Resounding of battle, the name of gallant Trajan
Do look imperial shadows, Michael, Stephen, Corvinus
At the Romanian nation, your mighty progeny
With arms like steel and hearts of fire impetuous
Its either free or dead, thats what they all decree
Priests, rise the cross, this Christian armys liberating
The word is freedom, no less sacred is the end
Wed rather die in battle, in elevated glory
Than live again enslaved on our ancestral land
Desteapta-te române or wake up Romanian, it's one of the best anthems in Europe honestly, also it's quote ironic seeing our current state and the government
Our anthem is not exactly about Romanian nationalism, it's about the individuals of us Romanians
My fav verses:
1) Că-n aste mâini mai curge un sânge de roman
Literally means "There's still Roman blood flowing in these hands". It reminds us of our Roman descent
2) "Viața-n libertate ori moarte
" strigă toti
Means : "Life in liberty or death
" all shout
Symbolic of our struggle for independence since we always were between some great powers: the Ottomen, the Russians and the Austrians
Similar to the Poles and how they were between the Germans, Austrians and Russians
Its the most fitting anthem in the world
In Romania we have "Deșteaptă-te române
" (Wake up Romanian
It sounds really cool
Kinda sad
Bloody amazing
Read ‘Deșteaptă-te, Române’ and tell me those aren’t the most beautiful lyrics you’ve read
OHMYGOD thank you for the metal anthem idea
And the title is fitting as well since we're all vampires
Yeah
I like our national anthem
Honestly I don't know anyone from Romania who hates our national anthem
The message is that we are eternal victims, opressed by enemies or by the circusmtances
It also says that the army is Christian and led by priests
I believe it perpetuates a defeatist/defensive mentality and it doesn’t speak to me at all
Edit: the melody is great, though
Maybe we should just update the lyrics
It sounds a bit sad to me
Agree ..we'll never wake up this way
Bruh i think the message is to stay strong and to provo the world that we are not "gyspies", or worthless, and yea, we've been under many empires, but we stood strong, and today most of romanians are under on flag
Besarabia and diaspora are missing, but its okay
At least we are no vassal, and we got Ardeal too :)
We have to start thinking positive if we want to wake up
But why
Mostly have my own in the countryside  [ .
And the Polish apples arrived
*Punga cu pungi* \- a bunch of plastic bags stored in another plastic bag
You keep saying you'll grab a bag from there next time you need to go to the store, but you always forget and end up buying another plastic bag which will be added to the collection
container for cookies that is actually filled with sewing supplies
definitely an old cross, or a painting of Virgin Mary, whether it be very old, or gifted; almost every damn person i know has those on the wall
[This] the beloved golden wall watch
In Romania every household has this kind of pot to cook "sarmale" in :
Also this bowl:
A big cast iron pot known as [tuci] mainly reserved for making polenta
Hmm barbecues maybe
Pretty much everyone has a barbecue
I was looking for this
The bag with bags sounds so fun
Mortal
We have *Sacul cu pungi in pungi
* where you can find bags ranging from the oldest textile bags from the 1970s to yesterday's "fuck I tought i had a bag" from Lidl
we have a nightlight, the type you plug into an electrical outlet, with jesus; it's kinda interesting how far it can go
A lot of our bird names are fucked up
Nightingale=privighetoare=overseer(feminine)
A ruff is literally called bully in Romanian (bătăuș),literally meaning the one giving the beatings
On top of that we have a bird called gypsy
La nani
Basically go to bed but it doesn't translate to anything childish
puf puf here
We sometimes call it fâs-fâs. :))
Hungarian has "csúszó-mászó" which basically translates as 'slider-climber'. Basically means any kind of insect or invertebrate (iirc)
I find the French word for peanuts hilarious: "cacahuètes"
>  On top of that we have a bird called gypsy
[This one ?]
Yep
one thing i've noticed about myself is that i use run-on sentences in writing
i think that gives me away as a non-native (had to stop myself from using a comma there)
in school we were taught the OSAShCOMP order of adjectives
opinion size age shape colour origin material purpose
romanian doesn't really have a set order to adjectives, so yeah, it was english
In my opinion in Romanian we "do sex"
same in romanian
a face sex can mean both to do/make sex
There's this Hungarian sweet roll (? idk if its the right term) that's pretty popular in my side of the country
It has a lot of poppy seeds and it's absolutely delicious
It's called [baigli]
As a food, used on pastries and as a nice wild flower
I have seen them in fields (where some other crops were planted) and people stoping to take pictures of them
Poppy fields are pretty widespread in Instagram photos
In Romania as well, I think it's probably shared in the Slavic/Baltic area (Romanian is Latin, but we have a lot of Slavic neologisms)
Wow, it's really funny to see how basically every country has something like this
Here we also have bird language (pasareasca)
After every syllable that ends in a vowel you add "p" and the vowel again
So "ce mai faci" (how are you) becomes "cepe maipi fapacipi"
Same in Romanian
I forgot what we called it
might've been 'bird language' like the OP
That’s the same in Romanian too
It’s called bird language
I'm literally from Romania and never heard of this ;-;
We have exactly the same thing in Romanian , we use letter P as well but the name is ... “bird language “.
Haha but how
Stii altfel de pasareasca
Ca alți oameni mi-au zis alte variante mai complicate (prima litera pusa la sfârșitu cuvantului și încă ceva)
N-am auzit de niciun fel de joc de genul lmao
Daca da, inseamna ca nu mai tin eu minte lol
Cred ca mai degrabă nu ții minte no se puedeee
Probabil lmao
Our neo-commies would let King Michael return home in 1990 and monarchy would be restored
Save Michael the Brave, so the 1600 unification of Romania would last longer, maybe even to this day
It would be interesting to see what this would mean for the europe of that time
We could've also advanced if Mutu wouldn't have missed the penalty or if Buffon wouldn't have saved it if you want , Italy got 2nd and we got 3rd they had 4 points and we had 2 if we would've won we would've had 4 points and Italy 3 ...
> I would make it so Michael the Brave wouldn't be betrayed and killed
That was one of my thoughts at first, but tbh I doubt that the regional powers in that time would have been fine with that
Thus the assassination
For Romania, it would probably be a "haiduc". Generally outlaws commiting robberies and other crimes, with a sort of "Robin Hood" attitude attributed to them, such as robbing the rich and giving to the poor, defending the lands from invaders and so on
Maybe Hajduci
Very popular in the Balkans, and are very different depending on the region
You can read more about it here:
The haiduci are outlaws who fought to protect the poor and the weak during medieval times and up untill the 19th century in the Romanian Principalities and later Romania
They used bows and later firearms,but the signature weapon was the baltag(a slightly larger hatchet with a hammer-like head as the blunt part of the weapon)
They were seen as excellent fighter,who would strive against tyranny and injustice
The "golden age" of the haiduci was during the fanariot rule(17th-18th century),when greek merchants were given the throne of either Moldavia or Wallachia by the ottoman sultan in exchange for large sums of money
To recover the money,they would place heavy taxes on the countries that were plagued by constant wars and civil strife
So many people became haiduci,robbing the lord and the boyars and givving the money back to the people
Even today,the word "haiduc" is often used to describe a rogue like individual,who fights with honor and is(to quote a popular play from my native area) "as beautifull as the sun".They were quickly romanticized,to the point where it was a common "fetish" for young romanian girls to sleep with haiduci(my great-grandma was proudly talking about her grandmother was apparently involved with such an individual)and some very famous would even bed the wife's of the boyars or even run away with them(and would only return them to their husbands after he would pay a hefty sum)
A haiduc from Wallachia was famous for the leaving the boyars with "empty pockets and a happy wife".
A remnant of those time is the tradition of "stealing the bride" at weddings
The friends of the groom would "steal" the bride(with her consent,obviously) and would not return her untill the groom would offer a reward
It's barbaric,I know,but if all consent to this,it can be pretty fun
The ransom is usually alcohol,but it's expected to be something expensive,like good wine,old cognac or even a crate of vodka
In Romania too (haiduc), but the stories about them have more like a Robin Hood vibe, outlaws liked by common people
I find it so surprising yet pretty cool that Hungary also has haiduc-types and sarmale (rolled cabbages) as a common-ish food
Maybe we’re more similar than either country likes to think
Eastern Europe was divided before Yalta, by Churchill and Stalin, no a napkin
They established which countries will fall in Soviet control and which In the UK sphere of influence
Greece was 90% western, Yugoslavia 50-50%. The rest (Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia) got fucked
It was made official in Yalta
In Romania, Yalta is seen in a negative light because of that
We think UK lives up to the name of perfidious Albion and we don't think positively of Churchill
He is seen as the villain, because he sold us to Stalin
In Romania it's kinda sad since we lost Besaarabia forever but people don't see it as a betrayal(even tho Britain said that Romania would be treated as winning nation,because it was forced to ally with the Axis,but the Soviet Union prevented this)
I think you need to read about the pre-war circumstances of Romania and how it was forced to get on the Axis side in the WW2, because before Sudetenland happened, we were in the Little Entante alliance with Czechoslovakia and Poland (the good guys, right
But after Poland was partitioned in 1939, there were territorial claims from Axis minor allies Hungary, Bulgaria AND at the same time the USSR requested Romania's eastern regions in 1940
At that point the Soviets were not allied with the West (and we didn't had Finland's winter) so the only chance of survival was to switch to a Axis aligned party and then go all against the Soviets hoping to get Bessarabia and Bukovina back when the Nazis declared war to USSR
Terrible things which are inexcusable happened in Romania's administered territories during WW2, but then, when Soviets 'liberated' Romania during 1944, Romania's army helped Allied effort until May 1945 with heavy losses in Slovakia's Tatra mountains and reaching as far as the outskirts of Vienna and Brno in Czechia, losing 167,000 soldiers in the process
Historians say that Romania switching sides shortened the war by 6 months
After the war, the eastern regions of Romania comprising about 3 million people were lost to USSR, some southern region to Bulgaria, 50 years lost to communist rule, other 15 in a 'transition' to democracy - so yeah, we feel like Yalta was a betrayal
The deal on the napkin was done before Romania was occupied by the soviets
Even if the UK could not stop it, it officially gave a free reign to Stalin
Would it have made a difference if the deal wasn't struck
Possibly no, but we will never know for sure
Anyways, the question was about Yalta and how we see it
If it is correct or not, it is another discussion
You are right about the chronology
I stand corrected
Trains from Japan
I would copy the low level of corruption form Denmark or Norway or Finland
I want swedish school
That would change a lot of things I think
German discipline
It would get us rid or corrupt politicians as well and maybe we would actually get to sell our oil reserves
That would make the country as rich as Norway
The education system of Finland
*Wealth and power,* from the United States of America
Id like to copy Germany's work force/working people
Me too
Honestly same
I feel you, buddy
Thank you
Indeed the tube is what saves us
I also liked the one in London a lot
Sorry for that
The Nordic gang wouldn't be complete without Sweden
I don't know how I forgot about you
Any sistem is better than ours to be fair, but I think you're right
We kinda use it we kinda don't? Really, no one knows
Nope
But our government doesn't care about LITERALLY EVERYONE cutting down our forests
We have a beer ad which says they'll plant a tree for every beer they sell
Ţuica-spirit made out of distiled fermented plums that can taste great or it can taste like gasoline
Rachiu-spirit made out of distiled fermented pears that can taste great or it can taste like gasoline
Romania here
We have țuică (aka pălincă, rachiu), which is a brandy distilled out of plums
We also have vișinată, which is made out of sour cherries, grade alcohol, rum, and sugar
It is quite possibly the best liqueur I’ve ever tasted
In Romania - țuică or palinca
It is a spirit drink made out of distilled plums
Guys I would need some help with the taste, can t describe it
We have țuică,it is made out of plums,but it can be made out of any fermantable fruit really
vişinată. very high in alcohol and tastes like sour cherries
Țuica mare Turkish but most popular in România its very powerful
You guys make a pretty good vodka
Tuica face pe desteapta,hopa 3 pasi la dreapta ..
Gin is one of those drinks that you can't leave it alone
Gin is very good, but only for cocktails
Imo ofc
Unicum is Hungarian
Wow
TIL
Im Romania we make pălincă out of quinces as well and it is very appreciated
Visinata done well is possibly the best tasting drink
Sa inteleg ca ai luat niste tuica in primire
Sau mai bine  zis, te-o luat ea pe tine :))
Yes I agree
It’s so smooth and flavourful despite being quite strong
Best drink for a mildly chilly fall evening on a terrace
I live in Canada now and I miss it
might have to try and DIY some
It is fairly available
It's not that popular (considering it's bitter taste that's not a surprise), but you can find it
Me, personally i think it's decent
Being bitter you can drink it when drunk without getting sick easily
Well,not that hard
I learned it easier than i learned my own language
And  i learned it from video  games and youtube videos
Right now I am trying to learn german and comparing german with english, I think english is the easiest language that you can learn, even though your native language is not related with english
(eg
My native language is romanian, some kind of romance language related with Italian French etc
, some would say that it is also related to some slavic languages)
BTW If you have any good resources for german please let me know :)))
It's kinda hard for me to speak it, but as a whole it was pretty easy to learn
Just play a fuck ton of videogames and you're set
I speak it better than Romanian tbh
Romanian is an mediocre language to learn as a native, so I guess it must be stupid hard to learn it
It's easy even coming from a romance first language (my case Romanian)
They have a lot of french influences
Much easier than German
Also all popular media is made in English and sounds so bad when dubbed
Nope, is kinda appreciated
Not really
No,i think french is a harder languagge
nah, as a romanian who lives and studies in italy, i learnt english by myself in like 3 weeks by basically youtube and videogames
I NEVER studied from an english book, still my grades were only 8-9-10 in middle school, (in italy you can get from 1 to 10 as grades, idk in other countries) and now in high school i keep it with 8 and 9, no more 10 tho lol, but its good, considering that i never even look at my book, i just do homework on it
My other classmates can barely keep a conversation in english (im not a genius tho, i dont wanna be mean or something) just because the system here sucks
Its just memorizing and rules over rules
They make it wayyy more complex than it really is
i still make mistakes, of course, but i think thats normal
Well
depends from where are you from
If you are from a country like france or italy or spain,it looks simmilar
Its definitely not the same,but its somewhat simmilar because of the latin origin
But we have the same ammount of grammar as the german language
So first, if you dont want to dive into grammar and want to use it for just some conversation,you should learn things like  how tonsay hello,how to ask  something
Honestly, even I dont  know
Im 14 ,so dont expect the advice a teacher  would give you
I spoke so much in english online that I forgot some words
My tip is to start slowly
As slow as possible
We have some new petters compared to the english alphabet like ă ,â,î ,ț,ș .
Il fut**:)))
You're right, French is worse than Spanish, even if I don't try so serious to learn Spanish
But this is an idea for this year, I could try to learn some basic stuff in Spanish
The English was a little bit harder to learn for me than French, because they are more similitudes between Romanian and French
However, the learning of English wasn't even difficult for me, at least the basics
But, as in every language, they are some difficult problems like: the accent, the different constructions, my incapacity to learn
At first I thought they were talking about windows that can literally swing or something
As others have said these only applies to western Europe
“Bucharest” is “București”. So far I think it is the only city with an English name but it is quite different
Not a city, but all I can think of is that we call Switzerland Elveția
Between 2nd Balkan War and 2WW we had the nowadays bulgarian part of Dobrogea (Dobrujha) including the town of Silistra .We used to call it  Dârstor  from the latin Durostorum . Right now everybody call it Silistra and the former romanian name is no more than just trivia .One of Bucharest's neighboor is called Dristor due to a street from that period ( 1918-1940) that was named Dristor's street ( or Dristor way) .
&#x200B;
Also Cetatea Alba(White Citadel)  ( East of nowadays Republic of Moldova , on the Black Sea shore) belongs to Ukraine and it's called Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi .I think we lost it during Crimean Wars (but i might be wrong )
Not huge differences, but a few that come to mind:
The Hague - Haga
Warsaw - Varşovia
Pyongyang - Phenian
Nice - Nisa
&#x200B;
For countries, on the other hand:
Netherlands - Olanda
Switzerland - Elveţia
Warsaw: Varşovia
London: Londra
Not that different, but it is interesting how London is ‘Londra’ while other western cities haven’t changed that much
**English** - **Romanian**:
London - Londra
Lisbon - Lisabona
Athens - Atena
Moscow - Moscova
Krakow - Cracovia
Warsaw - Varsovia
Budapest - Budapesta
Debrecen - Debretin
Munich - Munchen
Pyongyang - Fenian
Most of the rest are about the same lol
London - Londra
Moscow - Moscova
Bucharest - Bucuresti
Copenhagen - Copenhaga
Venice - Venetia
Athens - Atena
Prague - Praga
Budapest - Budapesta
Rome - Roma
Also basically every city in Transylvania and Partium
we have more names for former romanian cities that now belong to other countries ( Cernauti - Chernivtsi or Darstor-Silistra or Cetatea-alba - Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi)
They don't have to be Romanian cities only
For example, while the English people call it Pyongyang, in Romanian it is known as Phenian
Iași is also Jassy
We also have translations for Hungarian cities close to the border
Szeged is Seghedin, Debrecen-Debrețin,
Almost the same as in the romanian leanguage we say Varșovia "ș" is pronunced as "sh" in shape for exemple
Yes, we do
Most people refer to it as Cluj
Yes, but op asked especially for English names
>  (We have a **unique** Hungarian name for most Romanian cities
For the ones outside of Transylvania, Banat and Partium, not really
ovbiously most the of the cities/towns in Eastern Europe don't have a special english name and only the capital cities have a english-ed name Kyiv->Kiev , Moskva->Moscow , Athina->Athens .So i considered the local name instead as that is usally the international /english name .
Nope, no local one
Google maps and Waze are the most popular
Personally I use Apple Maps, somehow it finds shorter ways on some smaller roads
Why not Apple Maps if you want to get rid of Google
Why is that
You must be funny at the parties
So yeah, Google is selling your data, but why would Apple (or on the same note Microsoft) do that
The money from your data would be insignificant for them and not doing that also helps their image
British Empire is the correct term
1 leu: a pretzel
10 lei: 10 kg of potatoes
100 lei: full course meal at a fancy restaurant and a pack of ciggaretes OR 1 litre Jack Danies (+/- depending on type)
Oh fun game
I don't -give the best examples but it's honest work
1 LEU - 1 cheap bread / 1 small bunch of parsley / 1 pretzel
10 - 1 block of cheapest Lidl cheese / 1 head of broccoli / 1 carton of 10 nicer eggs
100 - a cheap electric countertop grill / about 3kg of locally made sheep cheese / a pair of decent pants
1 leu - A loaf of bread or a baguette
Or one bulk cigarette
A cheap energy drink
10 lei - A kebab
But here it depends, the price of a kebab ranges from 4 lei (0
8 euro) to 30 lei (6 euro)
Or 2 subway tickets of 2 validations
100 lei - 2g of weed
Or an hour with a hooker
A decent pair of jeans or a T-shirt
1 leu: used to be a cigarette but they bumped up the prices, probably 2 pieces of gum and thats it
Maybe a loaf of bread,
10 lei: some fast food,a bag of chips and a bottle of soda, that sorta thing
100 lei: a tshirt,5 packs of ciggys (almost,its like 105),a solid amount of beer(about 30l), 2 bottles of rum, usually nothing that huge
Two months in a gym
Like a nice gym or a random one
Here for a nicer gym (with access to swimming pool) it's 100€ for one month
1 leu can also get you 10 jam candies
10 lei about 2 bags of chips or a carton of 10 eggs
100 lei can get you about a week's worth of food or 5 packs of cigarettes
maybe a decent restaurant, not a fancy one
The restaurant one is definitely not true, at least for Bucharest
Lmao where do you live
It's nothing like the prices I'm used to :))
Oh for sure, if you go and buy directly from the manufacturer it's much cheaper
But since most of us can't access that, we go for small artisan type shops, where its about 30-33 lei / kg
They usually have produce from various small producers in the country, or even make their own
București
Which prices specifically
I'm genuinely looking through hoping to see for what it stands for in my language because I don't remember this episode
Romania: no idea cause I don't even think they ever showed it on TV here, and if they did they started showing it when I was too old to watch it (and I'm only 23)
Same :(
It was on Nickelodeon
I mean, it still is
Feels bad :(((
I'm pretty sure Nickelodeon was never broadcast in Romania
Or at least not until recently
The only cartoon channels me and everyone I knew got were Cartoon Network, Fox Kids (which became Jetix and then Disney Channel) and sometimes Minimax which was a weird Hungarian thing
May be a region thing, we always had Nickelodeon too and we had a weird one KidsCo or something like it for a limited amount of time
MiniMax was always in Romanian to us
However when I visited around Transilvania they only had MiniMax in Hungarian, so as I said, may be regional
Oh, I'm not saying Minimax was *in* Hungarian, just that it's *from* Hungary
I'm from Constanța
Ahh, my bad
We only learn cursive in school
I thought print handwriting is only practiced in the US
I first learned printed-like when i was like 5 or 6 and when i got in school i learned cursive
In Romania you learn cursive and use it instead of printed-like
But i know some people who have a beautiful handwriying, even if automatically you write a bit worse when in cursive
In Italy you learn first printed-like and then cursive
But they dont give any importance to how you write, as long is it understandable
Personally e have a mix of printed-like and cursive, and many people say that for being a boy i have amaizing handwriting
Of course, only when i actually want to write properly, otherwise i would write an illegible cursive that cant even be understood by me sometimes lol
Yeah I presume OP has the same since I could probably be in moldova on foot in like 30 mins
Our countries basically speak the same language except for some regional specific dialect
When was this
I started with cursive and then learned big printed
We never learned small printed in the 90s.
I haven't been taught printed in school, I kinda teached myself(obvsly with the help of parents, siblings)
- Taxi drivers overcharge tourists
Always use Uber or any other available app
- Avoid strip clubs / night clubs in the Old Town in Bucharest
- Bran (Dracula) Castle is so overrated, imo
Vlad Tepes never lived there
- Don't give money to beggers, there's a whole begger mafia going on, especially in the city centers
- Don't buy the roses if women come to your table selling them
Also, regarding the deaf mafia, did all of them move to Hungary
Haven't seen one of those in like 10 years lol
I wouldnt call Bran Castle overrated
Not worth the visit alone but if you're around Brasov they might aswell check it out
Looks like you aren't traveling by train (lucky you)
Because that's not a taxi, it's ride sharing
They pretend they'll give the rose for free to the women at the table, but then won't leave until you give them money
If you refuse, they basically start shaming you that are cheap and make a scene
They are basically forcing you to buy roses
It works like a taxi should work maybe
But in some cities around eastern Europe, like Bucharest, many of the taxi drivers are impolite, smoke in their cars, don't use AC, drive like crazy, overcharge (have fixed prices to go in different areas)
While the so called ride sharing drivers (uber, taxify etc) are more professional because they can get banned from the platform if their score drops below a certain level
So yes, we do differentiate the taxi drivers from the "ride sharing" ones because the services delivered by the two categories may be slightly different :)
Yes, but this is not the point people are making in the thread
'Traditional' taxis suck and will try to rip you off; ride sharing like Bolt and Uber attract better people (for now)
I mean it is uncommon in Romania, not all restaurants cook octopus, but I ate them with multiple occasions and they are very tasty
Very good if cooked
If you are talking about that strange Japanese habit of eating them alive, hell no
As long as it's not alive, I'm totally up for it
It tastes awesome
It's funny that you think americans know anything about tasty food
Unless it comes with fries,milkshake and a slice of freedom,most of them won't eat it
Vaslui, and Moldova in general, for being the drunk people region
Also teleorman for poorness and corruption
Vaslui is if Alabama and Florida fucked and it was raised by alcoholic russian parents
Vaslui is the Florida of România
You could literally replace Florida with Vaslui and all the stupid news are the same :P
For Romania that would be Vaslui, where drinking vodka or rubbing alcohol makes no difference to the average citizen
Vaslui for Romania
Vaslui here is getting memed for its really agressive people
Vaslui, just vaslui
Vaslui : Beating your wife, rape, murder and others
Transylvania/Ardeal : Slow
Moldova: Drunks
Bucharest: Assholes and bad drivers
Timisoara: Folk and exaggerated "youth life"
Cluj: Untold
Constanta: Invaded by people from Buchatest during summer
And cocaine
Brasov: Invaded by people from Bucharest during winter
Caracal: Nothing makes sense there
Covasna/Harghita: Hungarians, we make fun of the hungarians there
In Romania we have memes about the Vaslui county, here happens most of the crazy stuff :))
Like this one:
Vaslui for epic knife duels and drinking hand sanitazer
Definitely Vaslui
We call it romanian Florida now
And Oltenia for the PVP sword battles
Cluj for not having a metro and being the bEst CiTy eVEr
Moldova as a whole not so much but Vaslui definitely (drunk people, poor people, rapists etc
Also Teleorman like you said, and Brăila for the knife crime (disclaimer: I am from Galați)
Would also say Cluj because they are seen as stuck-up with exorbitant rent prices
Was looking for this comment
Aprob :))
I love Cluj, it's so cool, went there last month, they got the best buses ever, did I tell you its cool
It's awesome, I wanna fuck it
It's the best
It's THE city
Oh and it's cool too
Ah look a salty Bucharest person
Is the Galati-Braila beef still a thing
Romanian Moldova
No, mainly because of the healthcare system
Our public healthcare is shit, but at least it exists, and our private system is very affordable if you have a decent paying job
The gun culture is also scary
I think John Oliver put it very well: "You did a great job of selling yourself";
That's why most people that will go to the US are either from the high-class (which, indeed, if you are rich or highly educated in a productive field -- you're golden there) or from the lower-bottem (which simply have a hollywoodian interpretation of the US);
While 10 or 20 years ago people from my country moved there because we were shitty, it's surprising to see that some people from my country are still trying to illegally cross the Mexican-US border (it's even more surprising to see some get asylium in US or Canada)
Personally, I wouldn't since the country seems so divided and focused on the wrong issues it all feels you're entire system is hanging there on a thread
On the other hand maybe I just see it this way from the outside and if you're used to it then it feels normal and safe
I wouldn't, U.S.A land of the free if you're fithy rich, you get fucked even as middle class and the health system is just
let's say a bad joke
Plus with my personality i think i'll get shot by police at  a normal routine check
I could go for a few years for the sake of better pay so i can save some money
But don't see myself living there long term and would especially not start a family there
I find it a gross violation of human rights not giving mothers the right to have paid ( or at least unpaid) leave to care for a new child or recover after child birth, some women beeing expected to go back to work the next day after beeing discharged from the hospital
As far as I understood the bank credit system (which is similar to that of China's social credit system), Americans online use the saying ”It's better to have bad credit score than none at all
” What does this translate to me: in order to get a loan to (supposedly), buy your home, buy your furniture, buy your various homewares, you need to build up these invisible useless bank points to be eligible to receive a loan
What's worse from what I've understood, American banks use a more pervacious system in granting loans (personalisations) than what I know it's being done in Romania (which says something, given we have a corrupt *governor* & his team at the national bank working with foreign banks for their benefit)
I detest the federal system or anything related to federalism (including council bi-laws)
It is neo-feudalism + bureaucracy
I'd rather have a strong parliament (*congress*), executive, and presidency than empowered local barons (mayoral, county council, prefecture/governor, police commissioner
The healthcare system
Apparently, if you're stupidly wealthy, you're nearer to having your cancer cured (*obvious hyperbole*), but if you've been beaten by life, you might as well jump in front of an 18-wheeler
Joblessness and gigs
I never understood the obsession with Americans and ”having jobs” if a lot of them require a second or third job to get by in life
To me, that is madness mixed with social anarchy
None of them, not even their politicians, never suggested about well-paying jobs without having to require a second one (much less a third one)
I never understood their terrible condition with lack of industrial jobs (no, not gigs; for some reason they're often overlapped)
I see this in Romania as well, everything is based on services & import
All of those are [bullshit] jobs
The paying system
People are afraid to talk about salaries
What's worse, apparently, their mini-bosses & big bosses are stealing from their wallet, by paying some bigly than the rest
That is full-throttling discrimination, no matter who's being discriminated, using the ”pay by the hour” scam
University/College fraternal & sorority clubs
Those are festering the principle of consolidation (corruption) that you see in elevated orders & clubs (such as Freemasonry, Rotary, and others)
Then, you hear about ”networking”, which is an euphemism for corruption-related favourtism, nepotism
It isn't an accident that American elites & dynastic families form connections via those links
The speeding limit
Americans undoubtedly have better roads, highways, express than us
*but*... even when you drive on a highway or express road, *everybody* (including those in luxurious cars) drive at the same limit of 113 km/h - 120 km/h. That is madness, they have the infrastructure to drive but because of the federal system & bad legislature, everybody is confined to 113-120 km/h mark
I've acquaintances who visited the country after being ridiculed by the embassy with the temporary visas
They visited Las Vegas
They've sent me messages that a flamboyant rich driver in his Bugatti was driving at the same speed as the bus they were in, while on the highway/express road
I didn't believed them until they've sent me photos & clips
Afterwards, they found more about the traffic rules and later told me what they've been told
And no roundabouts in traffic intersections, *why*? You solve the human chain problem in cities by adding traffic lights, but you need roundabouts nonetheless
I can't forgive the US system for not engaging in purging (hanging) the communists, securocrats, with their families
Instead, they've accepted their money & their children in schools, only to replace their parents & relatives here
And people wonder why decommunisation failed
And now they're cynically lecturing about anti-corruption, when they've helped communists & securocrats (and their families) have an easy life
No justice
I would live for one year, and that's it, for experience
I would not move there for my entire life or for a long time because I consider that US has a lower quality of life than Western Europe
You know it's bad when not even romanians would go
I asked my mom and grandmothers numerous times about those things
They always talked openly about it within reason (they didn't tell me about certain things when I was younger)
In some families, it is a "taboo" thing, not to the extent that a young woman will be pregnant and not know what her mom's experience was, but more like her mom wouldn't give too many details
Women in Ro tend to "hide from men" when those kinds of conversations happen and so it becomes this very intimate exchange between generations that can't be viewed from the outside
The idea that pregnancy talk could be considered a private topic is a new concept to me
Most married women get pregnant, and most pregnant women seek advice and guidance from those that have experience with the thing
From my perspective at least (as a female), people tend to be really private about pregnancy here, and in my opinion it can be because of the education level, as people either don’t know what to say/ ask or because they fear what they say might sound wrong (Gica contra avem la tot pasul)
Personally I never heard an en detail story of anything from pregnancy to periods or w/e, and I’m pretty sure I won’t too soon
Nobody is gonna pull you aside and tell you everything
That's my experience at least
But when I asked older women (especially when I wasn't "too young" to know these things), they would look around, make sure it's a safe space and then blabber on about it
Maybe you're in a more religious environment, idk
Barbecue with beer for me my friends and most of relatives
Here in Romania is cheese with tomatoes and maybe some eggs with some salami
Just what you find in your fridge
> mizeria
Interesting, in Romanian this translates to squalor
So basically a cucumber salad according to Google
Netherlands= Olanda (tho it's close to Holland)
Switzerland= Elvetia
Latvia= Letonia
Frenchies say Allemagne for Germany, for some baguette reason
Poland - Polonia
The netherlands - Olanda
England - Anglia
Hungary - Ungaria
Norway - Norvegia
If you want to know how your country is called in romanian, leave a reply
We call Latvia "Letonia", I'm not really sure why though
I talk hungarish tho and every country is like 90% called different like some have orszag(country)
Mostly, just a lot of ‘ia’ on the end of things
Ungaria instead of Hungary, Turcia instead oh Turkey, Polonia instead of Poland, Anglia instead of England, Spania instead of Spain, Germania instead of Germany
We’re Latin like that
Switzerland - Elvetia
United Kingdom - Marea Britanie (Big Britain)
Netherlands - Olanda
A lot of people call german something along the lines of Nemtzi
We call them Germans, but we also call them Nemți (read as Nemtzi with the e not on the i)
The Russians do it too
I heard germans used to call the
French, Italians, Spanish and Romanians Welsches, but I don't know if that's a popular term or what
Edit: Fun story the Romanians back in the days used to be pretty uncultured so they weren't smart ebough to tell english from french from german, and whenever they saw a foreigner that looked european they'd call them"Neamț" , "Nemți".
But why do you say mogyor for peanuts
Similarly to how a region of Romania, another Latin nation, is ‘Walachia’, and we were formerly known as ‘Vlachs’. It’s from a Germanic word for the Romans
I wonder if it has any connection to why Romania was called Walachia by outsiders in the middle ages
How is the j pronounced
As in English or in German
And outside of Europe theres "Birmania" for Myanmar
Close, Bosnia si Herzegovina
No, I mean that Myanmar is outside Europe
Not really
I only know one from a Romanian speaking country, that being Mall Dova (pronounced the same as Moldova) in Chișinău.
Not a terrible pun, but I was once in Germany (I think I was in Stuttgart) and there was a barber shop called "Hair-o-mania". It drew my attention because "Hai Romania" is a phrase used often to encourage the Romanian national football team (means something like "let's go, Romania". I will never now if that barber shop was owned by a Romanian, but if it was, then that name was brilliant
For us it’s either Mihai Eminescu - Luceafarul (somehow Reddit doesn’t consider this a valid link:
Or Miorița -
We have a national poet - Mihai Eminescu
His most famous work is a 98-stanza love poem called Luceafărul - - which I am now finding out is considered the longest love poem in world literature
Teachers loved the shit out of Eminescu, we all hated him because of the Shakespeare-like way of writing that had such a weird flow to it
For Romania I'll have to go with "Luceafărul" or The Evening Star, by Mihai Eminescu
I don't know what to say about it tho, I haven't read it
I didn't think of Miorița. But it"a very good choice tho
We once had a monkey roam free in Bucharest for a while, you can thank the local mafia boss for that
We  have stray dogs witch are a big problem and foxes witch eat our chickens also wild ferrets witch eat our chickens and cats that wander around all day if you have a neighbour with like 7 around
Also in the mountain areas bears started to become a problem and are getting more and more active like trashing orchids and trash cans
Living in Bucharest
For a long long time in the past we had a major problem with stray dogs
Most of them were friendly and they were minding their life
well
most of them
Until one day when the gov approved a national "purge". All of the stray dogs would be captured by the animal control and sent to special zones where they will be either adopted or
eventually
*euthanized*.
You will still find a dog here and there but it's not a problem anymore
Now there are a lot of cats where the dogs used to live
tbh I would take the cats
In the countryside : a fox(I think) ate 5 of our little bunnies, We often find pheasants trying to eat our garbage
ferrets,squirrels, snakes,so many moles
managed to catch one last week
In the city ..cats,cats everywhere
Outside of some meats/sausages the problem for me is seasoning
I am more into aggresive flavors, spiciness and Northern European dishes, on average, are just bland
They're made to be hearty and use all available crops to cope with the colder and rougher climate so was more practical, I guess, whereas  Mediterannean cuisine for example has a more varried selection of spices and herbs
I don't know about others, but I simply don't like fish and most of their dishes are made with fish
Who considers northern European food bland
I am Romanian and when I went to England once, I loved their food
I like meatballs
Because the English colonised half of the world and *still* can’t cook a decent meal
Smells like it too
dang it
Cooked
We only use it in salads, thinly shredded, with a bit of vinegar and salt, tastes like a coleslaw variation without the sauce but with a different flavor than regular cabbage (which for salad receives a dose of salt, oil and pepper)
Both need some manhandling after shredding and adding salt (it softens it)
"Sfântul Imperiu Romano-German" (the Holy Romano-German Empire)
In Romanian we call it *Sfântul Imperiu Roman* (Holly Roman Empire), but another version that is not very used is *Sfantul Imperiu Roman de națiune germană* ( Holly Roman Empire of German nationality)
Sfântul Imperiu Roman, it's the same as in English but Empire and Roman are inversed
"Sfântul Imperiu Roman" (Holy Roman Empire)
"Sfântul Imperiu Romano-German" (Holy Romano-German Empire)
"Imperiul Romano-German" (Romano-German Empire)
I saw your username and bursted out laughing
Thanks for that :)
Or simply "Sfântul Imperiu Roman".
Well that's how I heard his name when he was on the news back in 2001
It means "A [sarma] Bin Laden" or "A Bin Laden sarma".
And here I thought it is "o sârmă" (wire), not "o sarma". :))
Me too, because I use/hear the term "gălușcă" more often than "sarma".
No, I would say that we actually use more and more loanwords from English
No, quite the opposite, there are many english words that became part of our vocabulary in the last 20 years
Well, it's not an organization per se, but you'll get a bunch of elitist "intellectuals" that will Wang their finger at you for using certain loan words
There is also a wave of romanticizing the countryside or the folklore that can go from wearing "traditional" clothes sometimes to flat out hating on anything modern
And tbf there are a bunch of uneducated idiots that don't even bother to speak the language properly so yeah
So much so that many people use them involuntarily
Tbf, there are bunch of technological advances that we are completely left out of and you learn of those things only from sources written in other languages
I'm talking about how in our universities they generally teach the "principle" of the method which generally means the super old method that all the new methods are built on
So when you go to the work place you have little to no vocabulary about certain stuff
(I'm mostly talking from experience with pharmacy school in Bucharest and biomolecular lab work in Germany)
While it’s true, you didn’t have a good example because you are talking about two different countries, of course the terminology is different
My point is that we aren't taught certain things and so we're forced to learn new techniques from other countries written in other languages
If our universities bothered to update their curriculum maybe we'd have a vocabulary for those methods
And my example was my personal experience transitioning from pharmacy in Ro to medical research (a field I was trained for in theory) in another (let's face it more advanced) country
And the terminology should be easy to translate
It's the same, just în 2 different languages
I am very good at English if I do say so myself, but I just can't remember the difference between lay/lie, especially in the past tenses
I just avoid them as much as possible
I constantly say "open/close the lights". Because to open and to turn on are the same in Ro
Also, I mix up leg and foot, because we have only one word for both
Store and magazine
(Magazin = store in Romanian)
Stationary shop and library (librarie = stationery shop)
Honestly, the ones I used to get mixed up, since I don't think I do anymore were learning and teaching since the same word is used for both in Romanian
That was back when I would translate Romanian to English in my head, now it's much simpler when I can actually think my sentences in English
The word “Pollution” , at first,I tought it meant “Poluție” , but that actually “Poluție” is when you have a...uhmm,sort of a wet dream
Romanian
Consistently and consistent (about food, like it's a highly dense meal)
In romanian we have a hole group of words that are similar to english we call false friends
They are almost the exact same words but have different meanings
I have a C1 level certificate in english so I don't get them mixed up but a beginner might
Here are some examples
The word magazine in english (a journal/publication ex
The forbes magazine) and the romanian word magazin( pulral magazine, which means store/market ex
Amazone or Tesco)
The word library in english( which is a place where you can read/rent books) and the romanian word librarie (which is a place where you buy books, notebooks, pens, etc .  Properly translated to book store, the romanian word for library is biblioteca)
I never mix up any words in English, oddly enough I mix up words in my native Language
Turtle vs tortoise is more of a biological difference, I'd say
A turtle is a more generic word that means all animals with a shell, etc
Tortoise is specially a land dwelling turtle
and terrapin is a turtle that lives both on land and in water
Source: Romanian doesn't have separate words either (we just call them 'lad turtle', 'freshwater turtle', etc), but I had to learn the English words when I got a terrapin and there were no Romanian websites about their care
Tbf, I didn't know "affect" was a word until recently
I just used "effect" for both
Actually, paid is the correct form
That's one brutal sentence
Wait
They're not supposed to sound the same
Stefan the Great - Ștefan cel Mare
Romanian criteria are:
A.) Be the ruling monarch of Romania or one of its provinces
B.) Fight the Turks, Hungarians, or Russians
Mostly the former two
It’s not particularly a narrow list
Other than that, we have Burebista and Decebal, two Dacian kings who unified the Dacian kingdoms at different points in History, the latter of whom fought the Romans to varying degrees of success
One of the most important is King Mihai the Brave, who unified Romania 3oo years before it was cool
Then he was almost immediately assassinated
Vlad Dracula is of international fame, but we Romanians certainly love him our fair share since he fought the turks and almost, *almost* managed to win strikingly
Ferdinand von Hohenzollern, although he came from a German noble house and was related to the King of Portugal I think, also unified Romania after the First World War, during which he became king
Unfortunately, his successors didn’t manage to keep it together, and now we’re split again
Do we have a guy with the the same name
I'm confused now
Arsenie Boca and Mihai Eminescu, as well
Yes, both our ministers have the same name
People are usually joking about this, as the prime-minister said himself
That's a real glitch in the Matrix
That, my friend, would be a real nightmare
My grandpa has a list of things he thinks the commies invented:
-aliens
-climate change
-atheism
And many more
Like a month ago there was a flat-earther meeting in Cluj-Napoca
Seven people were present and it was the biggest one ever on the territory of Romania
Does this answer ur question
That is actually true, it was present in almost every news source
I mean there's 2 groups
The older uneducated communist and corrupt generation that already is driving us insane
Then there's the young don't give a shit about anyone and anything generation
Though I should make myself clear, there are good apples and bad apples in all generations, but that's the observation i made
Anti Vaxx is a bit common here sadly
Well not really
There may be a few old people that are too christian to believe in this but they will go away in 30 years
No and that is a miracle, my country is full of dumb people
Totally, especially anti-vaxxers
Flat Earthers and climate change deniers are quite rare though, but all this anti-medicine movement is pretty popular unfortunately
Starts to gain momentum, especially in the western side of the country
You hear from time to time about antivaxxers and there are some antivaxx militants in the public space that get interviewed from time to time
I was not aware that there was a flat earth movement in Romania until I heard that this year took place the first flat earthers conference in Cluj-Napoca (Center-West)
But homeopathy more common from my personal experience (my mom used to medicate me with homeopathics when I was a kid and now when I have a medical problem, she pushes me to use it)
Our parents' generation (born 1960-1980) is generally Internet and technologically illiterate and believe everything they see on TV or on the web
Many follow weird conspiracy-themed facebook pages that say a lot of stupid things such as: the existence of a portal to another world in the Bucegi Mountains, the mysticism sorrounding Dacian society (ancient people living in the space of today's Romania), freemasons, antivaxx, etc
Another thing that is prevalent, mostly in the ranks of women, are those pseudo-new-age beliefs that combine every possible religion on our Earth and make a nonsensical soup that they take for granted, without any critical thinking
Also, essential oils
Romanian here, and can confirm, when I searched about Flat Earth belivers, I found a lot of articles about it, but when I searched about anti-vaxx all I found were articles disproving that they cause autism, not talking about them, haven't searched climat change deniers tho
WW1 really spiced up Romanian-Hungarian relations
We went from paprika to at least horseradish levels
Nowadays it's chill, except for extremists on both sides, but they are fairly low in number
WW2 lost us what is now the Republic of Moldova (again) and also made us a communist state for 40-something years
Overall, this made Romanians dislike Russia a lot, maybe even hate it
Oh yes
WW1 had good effects on Romania, and WW2 undid most of it
The relationship with Hungary is awkward at best, we don't know how to feel about Ukraine and Russia, there's Moldova with whom many romanians want to unite and others don't, which sucks alot
42 years of communist regime and the corrupt aftermath of a young re-established democracy by hardcore communists
How about Slovakia and Croatia
Hungarians still consider them "lost teritories"? Or just Transylvania is consider like that
Yes there are plenty of political parties, most of them are ruled by extremists and dont have any sort of power and everyone condiders them a joke but everytime an accident or a conflict between romanians and magyars starts Budapest starts to accuse romanian goverment and Bucharest starts to accuse hungarian goverment is still a difficult relationship
Huh
What genocide
Well
any English speaking medium will inevitably attract Americans since they're the largest English speaking country
This being by default an English speaking forum it automatically eliminates most of the people who don't speak it, as you can see in this subreddit we all communicate in English
I too feel isolated at times, but there isn't much you can do
I would love to discuss things and learn about South Americans, Asians, Arabs, Africans etc but here is why they are not and will never be pervasive on such a medium as reddit:
South Americans, Spanish and Portuguese speakers, there are enough of them to form their own Spanish/Portuguese internet bubble and probably have forums in their respective languages, too few have an interest to post on an English speaking forum when they simply can communicate in their languages
Asians, probably language barrier, and also there are enough of them to form their own internet bubble, plus China censors stuff
This aside from the fact that they are also very different from each other and language barriers abound
A thai and a south korean have next to nothing in common culturally
They are probably as curious about each other as we are of them
Arabs, except for those who live in western countries and a few very wealthy but tiny states, as a whole are not very proficient in English, hence they don't have a real presence as a culture on here
Africans, aside from the lack of internet access and education, they are also divided between English and French as a second language
There are African centric forums on the web but they don't seem to be very active
Also Africans are a very diverse bunch, and don't have that much in common with each other, and language barriers abound between them
Only ones who seem to have a big footprint are Indians because they speak English as a second language, are tech savvy and are huge in numbers so you'd inevitably bump into one every now and then
Americans and English speakers in general are by far the most common users of the internet and reddit simply because it is English speaking (most of it anyways, and this discourages other language speaker from joining or contributing)
I only think that Americans force us in believing that, mistaking the diversity of countries on purpose
I personally find my subteddits 60% European 40% american
Try r/autos seems a bit less American centric
They have concepts like 'race relations'. When I first heard of this I thought it was something related to motorsport
I always put garlic when I fry them, and eat with ketchup/mayoneese
So do we, but we get Americana instead
Joking
You're welcome to join us over here
>  Europe desperately needs its own social media
Amen
We are behind all other major powers
China and Russia have their own, while we rely on the US
This is terrible for our culture, security, privacy, economy etc
Clearly you've never been to the Balkans
Turkish cultural influence is still pervasive
As a Romanian I honestly feel our culture has more in common with Turkey than Scandinavia
That is a characteristic of their culture
They've been so American centric for their entire history and only recently woke up to the rest of the world and extrapolate their narratives and perceived issues as if they were a problem everywhere
IGNORANCE at its finest
Ridiculous
It gets to a whole new level of ridiculous when they start preaching to others
Give r/autos a try
Where are you from
I fully agree about flat-earthers, it's obviously just a meme and it's not like we have to constantly show how smart we are by pointing out that a meme is factually wrong
But anti-vaxxers are real as fuck
At least in Romania, there's **plenty** of them
Everytime a news website posts some news about vaccines (but also other "alternative medicine" stuff) on Facebook, the comments section is full of these people, and with real accounts
Also, I think everyone here more or less knows at least a person who opposes vaccines
And I say this from my more "science-based" bubble of friends/family
True
Media isn't doing much to challenge these morons either
Olivia Steer should be put in jail or declared 'persona non grata' and sent into exile somewhere far far away
Also 'plenty' doesn't mean they are a significant percentage, around 90% of children born do get vaccinated, which is kind of low compared to other Euro countries
There are fines now for refusing vaccinations, so the percentage should steadily rise
Maybe I didn't make myself clear, not in the sense that we are like the Turks far from it actually, however,  we have clear straightforward Turkish influences in our culture, certain customs, way of doing things and handling ourselves, foods, words, people's mentality etc are similar even if we don't like to admit it
Our freakin' national dish is turkish in origin and name
I feel more at home in Istanbul than in the west simply because the people are so similar, they are like us in many ways, even if they have a different language and religion
In school we are taught the Turks were the archenemy, in reality extensive geographic, cultural, historic, religious and trade ties bind us and have done so for centuries
Outside the times we did fight with them we cooperated, traded and had extensive diplomatic ties
If you look at paintings of Romanian boyars made before the middle of the 19th century, you will notice they dressed and groomed themselves after the fashion in the Ottoman empire
They had long beards some even wore turbans (even if they were Christian), wore salwars etc
They are indistinguishable from the Turkish aristocracy of the time
We don't talk about it but in any museum you go, you will notice it
Also we have quite a few family names that indicate Turkish origins, like for example Turcu or derivatives (literally means 'The Turk') its very common
We have a lot of Turkish words in Romanian as well but not half, perhaps 5% or so of common words (words used in regular day to day speech)
There used to be a lot more but during the 19th century the language changed a lot, and many words were replaced with italian, german, french neologisms
That woman sounds mentally deranged to me
Leave the Americans to themselves, many of them are brainwashed with their own culture and world view, and they think everyone should be like them
Also their 'white privilege' and all their gone mad, childish and ridiculous political correctness, they don't realize this stuff does not apply to all white people
Eastern Europe has no colonial past, quite the contrary
Yes, I become a bit friendlier
Actually yes, I think I become more extrovert when I speak English
But this may be because I have more courage talking online than in real life
no wtf
>An alternative explanation is that differences arise between native and foreign tongues because our childhood languages vibrate with greater emotional intensity than do those learned in more academic settings
As a result, moral judgments made in a foreign language are less laden with the emotional reactions that surface when we use a language learned in childhood
Hell, this happens to me when speaking Romanian outside of Bucharest
I think it's common to change style in different regions of a country though
I read your post in Schwarzenegger's voice
Probably because you learned your mother tongue naturally while English in a more formal setting, both at school and from media

Where do you see the EU in the next 20-30 years
Will more countries join the union
Or will there be more wishing to leave
The large expansion and the global crisis in the 2000's bassicaly guaranties that adding a new member is a no-go
Eastern Europe still hasn't caught up and not all of them are even trying
Eastern Europe sees EU membership as a ticket out of poverty and not something you also need to invest in
It's seen as a 3rd party thing from Brussel
And Romania and Bulgaria have shown why letting someone join with such a mentality is not the best thing
Thus their slow integration
Furthermore, EU works if everyone is treated as equal and Poland and Hungary have also shown the great weakness of such a policy and how it can be used in a negative way
Malta and Cyprus still sell citizenships affecting basically the power of EU sanctions
And finally Brexit has shown how populism can be used to shoot yourself in the foot
The only good news from Brexit is shuting down anti-EU nationalistic rethoric
Albeit, that's just one economic crisis from being reignited
Personally I hope North Macedonia and Georgia get to join
They are the only 2 countries which actively try to align and join EU and they are the 2 countries that should get the most help
I'd love to see Serbia and Moldova in the EU but realistically it's probably not going to happen
The rest of the balkans seem to be stuck in time
But they all now have great free-trade plans and all chances to change their countries if they truly want to
This is more then other similar countries in less fortunate parts of the world have
I also don't think much will change within the EU towards federalisation, nor the other way
I think the long-term-plan right now is to ensure EURO will be a global alternative to USD and further steps will be done towards this goal and more economic unity
This also means we'll see more FTA's in the next years
The EU is a slow build project that, due to external factors, found itself moving too fast for some
I think most will want to just let things settle and people getting used to how things are first
Honestly with the current state of it, the future seems a bit grim, unless something good happens
Though I think that it will either fall or have more members: North Macedonia and Albania preferably
> Why pay local workers more when you can get cheap labour from elsewhere
Don't forget the part where they wage wars for resources leading to the forced dislocation of millions of people from one country to another, which they again profit from through cheap wage labour and otherification of migrant groups in order to sew divide among the people and keep the focus on these folks that are running from bombs and environmental disasters or for a better chance in life
> wildly different cultures, politics and not even a unifying language or religion
Usually when people speak about unification of Europe they don't mean it in the sense of a single culture/language/religion
That will never happen and should never happen, our cultural and linguistic diversity is what brings us together
And in fact I'd want unification, through whatever form it may take, to empower these cultural differences
Sure, we could have and we already do kinda have a language (English or rather Euro-English to the dismay of native English speakers) that we use to communicate to Europeans from a different culture
But I think that's pretty much the extent it'll go
We'll always have our native language(s)
On this topic, can you lot start speaking Gaelic more often
It's such a beautiful language
Oh, my apologies
I in no way meant that, I was commenting on the previous person's post about neoliberals, which have both started and profited off wars
> Lack of shared language is among other things what will impede people from feeling united, and won't help create a shared European citizenship when certain languages will naturally beat out others at the top most levels
That's why I was thinking of English as lingua franca, it's already quite common and from where I'm standing more and more people are getting to speak it fluently, especially because of the internet
Is it really that unfeasible to have such a secondary language that'll help Europeans transcend the linguistic barrier
First names
hard to guess
You could only guess ethnicity maybe judging from it (Hungarian, Roma etc) but it’s never a rule
Last names
almost all matriarchal names formed with “a + mother’s declined first name/nickname in the village” are from eastern Romania (Aelenei, Aioanei, Amariei, Ageorginei etc)
Traditionally, names ending in -escu are from the south of Romania (Wallachia), but due to internal migrations, you can find them everywhere now
Names ending with 'ici' (Belodedici, Popovici) are usually from the West, as they were originally Serbian
I would say that in Transylvania it's more common to find first names of Latin origin (probably dating from when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and even before that), although that's not a rule anymore
As for last names, most people who live is Constanța county are able to recognise Aromanian ones
Agree with you and I would add this: usually when their last name starts with "Cara" they are aromanians (Caragiu, Caramitru, Caragiale, etc
Most surnames in my family and from people I know don't follow any of the rules lol but surnames like Gatin, Kovacs, Erdelyi, Gal, etc
And mine is even weirder
Some from west some from south
Dijkstra as well
Names ending in -schi are not too uncommon in eastern Romania and Moldova either, I wonder if there is any connection
(Seredinschi, Dembinschi, Dlujanschi)
Not necessarily, I’m from that area and there are many names like Lupulovici that are clearly Romanian, just adopted the Serbian name ending
Yes, but it has been adopted in that area
You would not hear someone in Moldova adopting the -ici termination
Either way, considering the internal migration in the past 100 years you are very likely to find a Popovici in Iași. So we're discussing more about the origins of the name
Took me a Google search to realise you were talking about The Witcher
I was thinking about the Dutch computer scientist who discovered the algorithm with the same name
Indeed, just like you can find names ending in -schi in eastern Romania and Moldova
Sounds pretty Polish to me
Hmm, historically Moldova is the principality with the most contact with Poland
In the middle ages the border along the Nistru had Poland on the other side (where Ukraine is now)
Then later it was the Russian empire they had a long border and lots of contact with
So it would make sense that Polish, Russian, Ukrainian influence to be greatest in Moldova
I've been in Germany for 4 years now
I work in scientific research so we use English at work all the time
And I can't practice my German too much
I kinda want to try living in a French speaking country next (I'm honestly thinking of Quebec)
Because I learned French in school
I'm also still young and I could probably manage the move to another environment
So I kinda want to try that
But I'll probably never go back home because everything I get to do here in a lab is Sci fi compared to what people do back home
Also, I kind of despise the attitude people from back home give me now
The whole "you left the country and you forgot the language
", "just cuz you got your diploma in Germany, you think you're better than me
" and all this shit
I don't think I want roots just yet
Romanian living in the UK for 8 years now
I couldn't stand the London area, so I tried Cambridge and then Newcastle, and so far Newcastle is my favourite
I don't see myself going back to Romania though
Not in my hometown at least, place is a shithole
However, as someone else said earlier in the comments, the British public service incompetence, the housing market that got out of control in the last 5 years, the xenophobia and whatnot makes it really difficult to be living here
And I ain't even obviously Romanian ( tall as a dutch, long blonde hair, no accent), so I'm kinda skippin past daily strangers' xenophobia)
Now with Brexit, there's no more EU protection/regulation for pensions, health insurance from your job, hours worked, worker's rights etc
They're gonna start chopping them one by one
So even if I'm working in highly skilled data driven job, I still feel a threat looming for my job security and quality of life
I'm planning on moving out to Hannover within 3 years max
Oh my God, I know, right
Worked 4 years for a company developing new tech in biosensors/blood gas analysing
Most fun I've ever had at work, working with robots worth 5 times more than the house I grew up in phahahaha
Tbh, i think the language part is also due to the people who left the country barely speaking proper romanian that went back home and used words in the second language just to look superior
I've been living in Spain for 2 years now, i only use english at work, but i am still able to speak romanian without inserting spanish or english words in everything i say
I absolutely hate the "romanization" of spanish words i see in romanians here, like saying "e castigat" insead of "pedepsit" (castigar is to punish in spanish) wtf is that
I once heard a romanian living in Canada saying "am rentat" an apartment
But anyways, kudos for your job in Germany, i wish you all the best in your endeavors
Or even worse:
"you should take advantage of every opportunity
*takes advantage of every opportunity and studies/works abroad *
"you think you're better than me now, huh
My partner is just starting her PhD at the institute there, it's a very nice culture centered city as far as I can tell ( which is paramount for me - despite being science and tech driven, I can't live without music, live shows, theatre, various forms of fresh art etc), plenty of greenery ( which is also what I like about Newcastle - forests, parks, fields, all accessible from the city, coming from a post-communist industrial town, you can figure I'd hate living in a concrete sprawl again)
Also, it would be good for my career too
I barely know any German at this point as I didn't study it in school, but in Hannover and its general area there are plenty of large companies either national/international where it's most likely that I won't need fluent german
Also, the wages - I've noticed around there that the avg
salary for a business intelligence developer/analyst is around 55K euro/yr, so for my age(27) in a generation of people screwed out of luck on career growth possibilities and salary to skill ratios, I'm liking those numbers quite a lot
Also, I'm hoping to find people to start a hobby stoner rock/industrial band with ( guitar + bass here, and learning synths)
Oh yeah, and the famous german clubbing/rave scene
Oh man, that gets me spidey sense tingling
*Kakte vez avout* or something like it is all I know in Russian

What does it really mean
That comment is so French you don't even need a flair anymore
Yes i like it because we already call it Cehia not Republica Cehă.
It highly deoends when i reffer to ot in english i say Czech republic but when i reffer to it in romanian i say Czechia
Well we call it "Cehia" in Romanian, almost the same pronunciation, so i guess its good
I prefer to say Czech Republic over Czechia, because i don t like how Czechia sound
We already called it czechia here
Well, since everyone here calls it "Cehia", which is the short, unofficial name, it wouldn't be weird at all if they kept "Czechia" as the official, short name of the country
I do like it
In Romanian it had always been "Cehia", which has the same pronouncion
The shortening just makes more sense for me when speaking English
Same in Romania: rarelly heard 'Republica Cehă' and usually just 'Cehia'. On the other hand, we usually call Moldova, the Republic of Moldova (the oficial name) when we want to specify the country and not the region that is part of Romania
For our Czech friends, we pronounce Cehia in a way that could be written as Čehija . So the English "Czechia" sounds very familiar for us

The flag with the hole:
Maybe not the most beautiful, but I feel like it's more for the people
The flag we had when we were called The kingdom of Romania
this looks kinda sad
Indonesia : why don't just copy
In Romanian we have "gelozie" and "invidie". They can be used interchangeably, but the former means when you want to keep something you already have (oftenly love related), while the latter when you desire something you don't have
Jealousy = gelozie
envy = invidie
Yea, they are pretty much the same thing in Romania, but different cases do fit different words better
Gelozie = jealousy
Invidie = envy
Being jealous can mean anything from the feeling in a romantic relationship to wishing you had as nice a car as someone else - but without super negative layers
Envy is used with a much more negative connotation
And never to refer to relationship jealousy
Envy harbours malicious feelings towards the person who has a nicer car than you
You're not just jealous, you wish they would end up totaling it so they don't have the nice thing anymore
We also have "ciudă" which a sort of envy mixed with spite
I disagree, to me it doesn't seem like they can be used interchangeably
"gelozie" - jealous is about love and romanticism while  "invidie" - envy is more about material things
Look, you cannot feel envy - "invidie" if your wife flirts with another guy, you'll be jealous (at least if you love her)
You can feel envy - "invidie" if a guy has a nicer car (or a more beautiful wife for example) but you can't be jealous about his wife (unless you have a relationship with her)
Side note for envy - my favorite is "pizmă" with the verb "a pizmui" and substantive "pizmaș".
We're taught in school that Romanian has 3 main dialects corresponding to the 3 historical kingdoms that now are part of the country - Moldova, Transylvania and Wallachia
The standard Romanian language is based on the Wallachian dialect and accent
So if you travel away from Bucharest you will start hearing different pronounciation, and different words
The different vocabulary is mostly for things that common people like farmers were talking about 150+ years ago before unification and public schools, so stuff like plants, foods or religious concepts
There are also many idioms and expressions which are different
It was recently pointed out to me by a foreign friend who is learning Romanian that we use very many idioms and 'indirect' expressions in everyday speech
The accents can get pretty strong though, to the point that some Wallachians may not understand a strong Moldovan accent
In the Republic of Moldova the accent is even stronger, and they have lots of Russian loanwords from Imperial and Soviet times
There also other "Romanian" languages spoken south of the Danube, in Serbia and Albania mostly, like Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian
These languages have diverged pretty significantly from standard Romanian and are not easily intelligible
We have 4 in Romanian
But they are either unspoken or spoken outside of the Country
Dacoromanian ( unspoken)2
Aromanian - spoken in Greece, Macedonia, south Albania and a bit in south of your country
Meglenoromanian - spoken in northern Greece& south Bg on the side of the Vardar River
Istroromanian, spoken in Istria peninsula of Croatia
A Romanian speaker will be able to discuss to a certain level with the last 3 but not complex phrases
Also, there are Subdialects ( Graiuri in Ro) but theese are forms of the language spoken in different parts of the country, Moldova, Wallachia, Transylvania
Evrybody cand understand them, but, there are areas where one has to pay a lot of attention to fully comprehend everything spoken
In general I think it's more of an age thing if we exclude touristic locations
Millenials are moving to cities such as Oradea or Cluj-Napoca and so modern industry goes there, such as Tech and start-ups
Cluj-Napoca has it's origins as Napoca, a city founded by the Romans after the Conquest of Dacia
Pretty sure it was destroyed in time and a new town just took it's name but it is something interesting
commonly reffered to as pfize casually, but in news they usually say Pfizer-BioNTech

I also know that the Irish have a very weird sounding "thank you". Something like "go ray math gat" (definatelly not that, but something weird like that)
When I first heard that,  was sure it was a joke, like we Romanians tell foreigners that "Pulan cur" means "Thank you" but it actually means "Di*k in ass" when we want to mess with them
Apparently tho it's not, that's really how they say it
English, American, Canadian, Australian etc
yeah I'm smart B)
Tbf, for Romanian and French is the same if you're informal
You could add romanian since we use 'mersi' as thank you, almost same pronunciation as 'merci'.
Edit: since the linguist nazis are after me
Multumesc is the official thank you in ro, it is to be used in any formal instance : banks,doctors,officials
Merci is more informal can be used between family, friends,coleagues
It's quite misleading to add that
The word is regarded as a "franțuzism", a word copy-pasted from French and then tweaked a little
While it's true that Romanians will highly likely understand "mersi", it's quite improper to suggest it since most Romanians will understand "bonjour" too but you don't count that as saying hello in Romanian
The proper way to say thanks and have it count as Romanian, not French that Romanians happen to understand, is "mulțumesc".
It is , mersi is  used more in an informal instance
> it's true that Romanians will highly likely understand "mersi",
Lol
"Highly likely to understand". Everyone says it
Everyone knows what it means and everyone spells it with an s.
The guy is right
Mersi is informal, mulțumesc is formal

Before the Romans conquered Dacia, the Dacians had a monotheistic religion with tenets such as moderation and an eternal paradise after life
It revolved around a god (Zalmoxis) who came to the Earth in human form, took the first kings of Dacia as his disciples, died, and then was resurrected
This was all before the birth of Christ
It is considered by some that the Dacians’ religious prohibition of wine was what eventually became the modern tradition of dietary restrictions around lent

No, I was talking about a religion with odd similarities to Abrahamic faiths, and you seem to be making this into a discussion of atheism versus faith
Complaining
We Romanians complain a lot
We would probably complain about having to go to the olympics
Drinking beer, but I’m not sure if we would win so a round of complaining would be perfect instead
Wait, LIDL is fast in your country
Unless there are 20 people waiting in the row here they don’t open another cashier
Nothing like a Romanian making a swear out of every word imaginable
Complaining Olympics would be just perfect for us
They are fast in my city too, they scan your stuff so fast they basically throw it at you
Then you have to move fast to take it, usually you don't have time to put in a bag because other people will be waiting so you do that outside
Yeah, I think that’s actually the problem
They don’t scan slow but out of 8-10 cash registers they only open 2-3, 4 if they are feeling very generous
Luxemburg or Vatican
Israel
They manage to defeat enemies who were overwhelming more numerous
Twice
We barely have trains
[Romanians be like]
Romania actually [ranks number 32 worldwide] by rail usage and while they're delayed all the time the trains have a high number of riders and good coverage
I know it was a joke but some people might actually believe you
And we rank 23 in rail length with 10
774km of which only 3
292km are electrified or 30
5%, so we have an extensive yet antiquated rail coverage
And the high number of passengers is mostly due to the lack of anything better (no highways and few air routes)
I have noticed that whatever foreigners find exciting and awesome, it is usually a nightmare for people who use trains for commuting or who travel by train a lot
Sorry we use comma (,) for decimals
I'd say Sighișoara, but the corrupt leadership has ruined it
The city has an old medieval clock tower with amazing hundreds years old houses and buildings
It's breathtaking visiting it every time
First time I went there was 15 years ago, and every time I come back, it's state is slowly but surely declining
Corruption sucks, people who support these corrupt people suck even more
Such a shame
And this situation is happening 99% of the country
The only time we see some things done is before elections
Makes me so sad
Brasov
Really enjoy the fact that it's surrounded by mountains, and the mix of beautiful old architecture in the center with communist-era brutalism of many of the neighborhoods
Also, the drive to Brasov is absolutely gorgeous
(Though I might just be biased because I love mountains)
It's not there specifically
It's in the capital and it affects the whole country
I will just say "măăăi,hâtz,BOABA BRO"
mostly normies
Fam, Romanian memes are legit trash, deadass 2016 memes ill rather watch a russian drink vodka than see on of our meme (The "E Miercuri Flacai" meme is actually funny dont kill me r/romania)
pretty good
Yeah we have our own formats
I prefer either
Of course, this year was full of political memes because of the presidential elections
There were memes before Veorica, she is just another one
Remember Emiluț :) ?
>lose the presidential
yeah also Barna didn't enter the second round so IDK what to expect from this country
Ok boomer
You guys really don't visit the r/romania subreddit
We get frog memes every Wednesday
>broscoiul de miercuri
We were taken to see the [Bran Castle] in 2nd or 3rd grade
It must have been a nightmare for the other tourists to see 30 children running around and yelling, but we didn't care at the time
And at the end of the 8th grade we were taken out by our "religion" teacher (he was a theology student) to a terrace to have a drink, and while the girls were given juice or soda, he got us beer
We were 14
Good times
Pornhub it’s the most popular, I don’t know about other sites
The internet, other friends that used the internet
We only got some sort of sex ed in highschool wayy after we knew what was going on
we sometimes have classes but i think they ngaver up
the number one source is now your classmates
Usually, it's done by the parents
Mine, however, didn't. God bless the internet, learned everything way sooner than I should've
Yeah pretty much and google searches, some people might ask their parents, and i guess i would have received a good response had i asked
Anyway at least in the public system there is no sexual eduaction course, idk if private education has it though
I'd say it should be added if you ask me
Really happens
Reddit - todayilearned - TIL Due to name confusion, staff of the Slovak and Slovenian embassies meet once a month to exchange wrongly addressed mail

The perfect dialogue
I'm half Hungarian and half Romanian but I grew up in Romania so I identify more with Romanian
I also now live in Canada but still identify as Romanian even though we moved here when i was 10 and am 29 now
I'm half Romanian, half German and I speak both languages fluently
It's a bit funny cause my romanian friends call me "the german" even though I technically grew up and studied in the same schools as them, while my family from Germany tells me that I'm nothing like my father (he's very close to the german stereotype) So I guess by that logic I'm either none or both lol
Now to answer your question, I identify as a romanian because Romania is the place I spent the majority of my life in and that's where I made friends and have memories
I like Germany, but I just don't see myself living there
The people there seem colder and more serious if that makes sense
Despite that, I do sometimes tell people I'm german if it's in my advantage (especially when it comes to jobs, people who can speak german have a higher chance of being hired, and will get paid more than their coworkers just for that alone) It's also useful when you want to get out of awkward conversations with strangers, just act like a foreigner and they'll leave you alone
Have you ever visited Romania
In your experience, does the Harghita/Covasna Hungarian accent widely differ from the Hungarian spoken in Hungary
Vlad Tepes narrowly missing Mehmet 2's tent in the night attack on his camp in 1462
Killing the sultan at that point would have wreaked havoc within the Ottoman Empire, with the resulting battles for the throne
When Romania won the war for Transilvania
Serb mercenaries were the shit though
Mihai the Great relied heavily on them
We even have a statue of Starina Novak (we call him Baba Novac) and he is regarded as a national hero
I was taught that a good way to ask a question in French is by using inversions
We were even taught stuff like “puis-je” when making inversions, only to learn that it is regarded as highly formal and pretty much outdated by most French speakers
Yeah, ideally you'd also have another way of getting exposure to the language, outside school
Unfortunately many teachers are also quick to correct anything that doesn't follow textbook rules
One of my classmates did an exchange with a French student and obviously picked up some casual language habits, our teacher would then complain how ungrammatical it was hahah
>Well, basically all of my French
8 years in school, no chance I can follow a conversation or participate
All the crazy grammar we learned and in the end the French don't even use it
Same
"Qu'est-ce que vous avez préparé pour aujourd'hui
" is forever etched into my brain though
Hahah it sounds so serious and dramatic
Especially when the action itself is super trivial
"I shall tie my shoelaces
It is
But as students it was one of the most dreaded questions
I can say it in my head and hear my teacher's voice haha
Lmao I especially love those random ass village/town names, a lot of really funny, dirty or plain nonsensical ones (for example some of the most famous, literal name meanings related to dick, balls or sperm: Spermezeu, Băicoi, Sculeni, Slobozia)
As for English versions, only Bucharest (București) is translated afaik
However some city names get translated in other languages, like Bulgarian or Serbian I think
And many cities in Transylvania with significant German and/or Hungarian ethnic populations also have German and Hungarian names :D
I am sure that in Romania there is only 1 city translated to English and that is Bucharest  București
Do I like it
Well it depends
For example its translation in French is Bucarest and it sounds cool when people say it like that, but when some English people say Bucharest like the starting of the word  "beautiful" I just wish there was never a translation of it
It makes Bucharest seem cute when they pronounce it like that
I think bucharest is a great translation for București ( the romanian name )
I love most city names
but not Vaslui
nobody talks about vaslui
>d Rouen, Reims, Nantes and Caen, only because it's funny to hear foreigners pronounce them badly)
However, a lot of cities and town have "sur" and "lès" in them, like all these towns: maizières-lès-me
I feel the same for Germany, I feel like germans had put all their efforts in having cool names for big cities, like Wolfsburg, Hannover, Frankfurt and then you have the little cities like Schloß Holte-Stukenbrock
Pretty much same for Romania, the only cities I know of that are translated into English are Bucharest (Bucureşti) and Jassy (Iaşi)
That being said, a lot of cities in Transylvania have German and Hungarian translations because of Transylvania's history
Let's not forget about Târgul de floci :D
Also neat thing imo, lots of stuff share the name of their place of origin
Like Făgăraș the candy bar and the city, and Măgura the cake and town, monastery, hotel and mountain
Well Köln is where Eau de Cologne comes from, it's one specific perfume but the word "cologne" kinda evolved to describe any perfume marketed towards men
So I also tend to use Köln to avoid any confusion lol
I've never seen that translation
I'm actually from there and I completely forgot about that translation :P
It sounds pretty in French but weird af in English haha
For me is how it sounds not if it is long, Frankfurt am Main sounds cool
Cucuiata
There's two of them
Cucuiata din Deal (on the hill) and Cucuiata din Vale (from the valley)
Though to be honest I'm not sure if they're real places
Well then you're talking with someone from the middle of nowhere
:-)
There is a village in my county that only has 5 old families left ..it's in valley surrounded by hills ..if it rains you need and suv to get at some of them . There are jokes that during the WW  the germans couldn't find the village cuz they ploughed the dirt road
I doubt we do unfortunately
It's a tropical plant
But we grow bell peppers though
;-)
Here people tend to move from smaller towns to other countries
Just skip the middle man
Nice one
Though in the interest of informing OP, vast numbers of young people move to big cities like Bucharest, Cluj, Iași, especially those working in stuff like IT, graphic design, marketing etc
Small towns are quite sleepy, for the most part it's middle aged people or older, and their kids who haven't finished school yet
I think that British Universities are one of the most popular choices here, along Dutch ones
I have no idea how Brexit's going to influence this tho
Hopefully not much
Also, it's just that overall, more young people choose to study abroad or at least go with Erasmus or other programs for a semester or a year
There's this idea engrained in Romania that makes Romanians want to study and move abroad
The warning signs on worn-down buildings that say ["Warning: Falling Plaster/Tiles"]
It's terrifying because apparently, it *isn't* illegal for street-front buildings to have potentially life-threatening shit falling off them, as long as they put up this stupid sign
I cannot imagine why the police doesn't sanction the fuck out of the owners and associations that let buildings get to that stage
It's a serious hazard for people on the sidewalk
If you decide to visit please pay attention to the bear signs
Not popular
We have rugby teams, but it's not popular
It is mildly popular in Romania, after football, tennis and probably handball
People watch the national team matches but are not very familiar with the clubs
I'm susprised at the amount of ppl that don't know about UHT milk
That's all we ever buy in Spain
Not just my family
I don't know anyone that uses any other type of milk lol
When I go to Romania they try to give me natural milk but I find it disgusting bc I got used to the UHT, and the natural ones taste way too strong for me
Also, my family never put the eggs in the fridge
Like
Never
And when it's Easter we boil the eggs and paint them and they last for like 4 days at least lol
Black magic
I'm glad we don't need to put all the milk and eggs in the fridge that would be a waste of space
I honestly don't even see non UHT milk in the supermarkets lol
Maybe there is one or two
But the most bought ones are the ones that come in a carton container and are UHT
Also, yes UHT is much cheaper and much more convinient bc it doesn't spoil easily and doesn't take more space in the fridge which in my family's case is already always too full lol
Also, apparently in Spain UHT milk is just called Normal Milk, the other one is Fresh Milk
Standard US layout most of the time
Add Romanian diacritics (ă, â, î, ș and ț) when writing a school paper or project
Most people I saw  have plain QWERTY, sometimes with the extras ă, â, î, ș, ț
I personally have the UK keyboard layout  ( £ instead of $ and other minor differences) on my laptop with the diacritics mapped to it
It was cheaper :))
I never thought about the 0 before, but your right
Sometimes it is in the wrong place
I use Romanian (Programmers)
Me too
Couldn't you write it without the diacritical mark
Like, if you write it without would Italians not understand
Would you write an important formal document in Romanian without the diacritical marks
I mean, dismiss as bullshit/spam any email I get in Romanian that doesn't have the diacritics
Oh my, that's quite bad
I mean I use diacritics in formal speech, but not in informal speech and I just thought the italian guy meant informal speech, sorry
I guess I came off too strong, oops :P.
Doar făceam o observație, n-am vrut să par nervoasă! Scuze
Este ok
We don't have many buildings left from Roman times, but we are very proud to be descendants of Rome
We even called our nation after it
I can say with 111% that among the last countries on the list is Romania
A lot of the ruins are getting ruined,either because of funding or because the guys in power just don't care enough for them
Also taking into consideration this verse of our national anthem: “Now or never let us give proof to the world
That in these veins a Roman blood still flows,
That in our chests we hold a name with pride,
Victorious in battles, the name of Trajan
TBH some Romanians are taking more pride in the muddy heritage of Dacia/Thrace
*edited to change a word
When we play online games me and my friends add "us" after every noun to make people think we speak latin (a lot of people are super racist towards romanians on some games)
In this case the Roman testimonies are the only ones available, apparently our Dacian ancestors did not use writing and there is nothing left of their language
Well yea
You're right
70% of the lexicon comes from latin but some slavic influence is also presented
I'd like to say 70% latin, 20% slavic influence and 10% turkish, german, hungarian influence
There's more Slavic influence than many Romanians care to admit (we don't like Russians), both in the culture and in the language
The language is based on Latin, but it gravitated towards Slavic before the 19th century
Then, many students went to Western universities, particularly French, and came back as educated scholars, introducing words that sometimes replaced Slavic words
Essentially, the language was re-Latinised through French
Those same scholars also brought back elements of the French culture
It isn't, but I think the average person thinks of Russians when they hear about something "Slavic".
Germans blow their nose SUPER LOUDLY
And they do it *everywhere*. Back home it's very impolite to blow your nose in the middle of a conversation for instance
If you really need to do it, you'll excuse yourself or find some discrete way of dealing with it, not whip out a tissue and blow your lungs out while making eye contact
After 3 years it doesn't disturb me anymore, but I still wish they would stop it with the eye contact
Romania is the most disorganized place in europe but how is noone else organizing their parties properly
Every party I have attended since high school had a fee (usually 15€) which would be less than having to buy booze yourself and that would cover renting the place, buying drinks and if we have enough alcohol to make everyone piss drunk (1st in the EU at alcohol consumption) sometimes we even buy food
The people who volunteer to do all that get a small part to I imagine, I never volunteered but knowing Romanians, they wouldn't have done it for free
The only downside is overcrowding (think 60-80 people in a place meant for 20)
But that's nice because you get to know a lot of people and don't really need the space at a party
My office colleagues eat pizza with mayonnaise
I hate when my friends do that
They eat pizza with anything
Ketchup, mayo, garlic sauce, tzatziki, anything
And I hate it
*Is this like a personal attack or something*
I never realised its uncommon
When I get to highschool I shake hands with all my classmates everyday
Would broadcasting the request to all participants turn the party into a Balkan one
Everybody sharing drinks with everybody
Savages
Italy sounds just about right
Happens to us all the time that's why as we got older we just got used to bring an "extra" bottle just to be sure the party gets right and we don't have to leave the party to buy more :)
>Taking someone's alcohol is like taking anything else from them
You take alcohol very seriously it seems
I have a colleague who enjoys fruits on pizza and I cannot eat looking at that sacrilege
Ketchup is fine, it's a poor man's habit, why pay 1€ for sauce when you can buy a bottle of roughly the same sauce for 1€ and use it the whole month
In fact, at my company there are bottles of ketchup and mayo in every kitchen and on every floor
I would be surprised if it were up to only you :P
No, it's an IT company
People order pizza for lunch and need the ketchup
I have used it yesterday on top of the pizza and it was delicious
Last year we had a full on lockdown for Covid until the 15th of May
In preparation of getting out of the lockdown and entering a so called 'alert state' the Parliament made a much debated law (the problems with it and constitutionality is another discussion, part of it got annulled and fixed afterwards)
Similar to how many other countries did, right
Well, wrong
every party in the Parliament apparently forgot how their laws get enacted
It takes a minimum of 3 days after they get published in something called the Official Monitor to take effect (if not specified otherwise but can't be less then 3 days)
And can take a day for it after being voted on to be published
Long story short when we exited the lockdown we had 3 days without any restriction whatsoever except the self isolation and quarantine for 14 days when entering the country since that was an executive emergency order based on an old law already in effect
A living person was declared dead in Romania
You just can't beat that
That's good
Now imagine this under Romanian law where by the Constitution any such changes go retroactively if in favor of the accused
As in anyone that up until then bought, sold or used drugs would have been doing it legally by a technicality
Te iubesc, scumpa mea iubită!
I love you, my dear lover
Az anyád picsája szájadra van csinálva
You are beautiful
Legalize corruption
Free criminals from prison (including rapists and murderers)
We had Nicolae Ceausescu, who ordered the military to fire upon civilian protesters in 1989
The general in charge refused the order, and he ‘committed suicide’ a few days later
And I mean this in the same way that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide
A little bit of polish land in my life
A little bit of polish money by my side
A little bit of territory is all I need
A little bit of profit is what I see
A little bit of polish workers out in the sun
A little bit of polish girls all night long
A little bit of Lebensraum, here I am
A little bit of Poland makes me German
I *am* the art institute
Not quite true
Skin gets tanned to protect itself from the sun, true
But it's not a reaction to DNA damage
Usually when the DNA damage has occurred, the cell goes naturally into apoptosis (programmed cell death) = flaky burnt skin
If the cell doesn't go into apoptosis it can turn into cancer
Most of the time it just becomes a dark spot
Tanned skin is literally the way your body protects itself from radiation, not being damaged by it
You didn't answer the question tho, so I'm gonna assume that you're not really German, because they wouldn't accept such inefficiency
Just a short FYI: the amount of melanin a person has is more or less fixed
And you get tanned because that melanin get "redistributed" throughout the cell's surface which blocks more sun and creates the aspect of tan skin
And that's why if you stay inside all winter you're gonna "reset" to whatever shade you were before
But of course, there will be some cells that will get damaged a little (not enough to be discarded by the body as flaky skin) or that won't change back
And that's why as you get older the skin just stays darker
If you get burn every time you step out into the sun
Well, you don't have enough melanin to protect yourself, so
Sorry
The sun's not good for you :(
>rammed people
Loooooool
They are quite normal I'd say, pretty much everyone has one, but they are stronger in rural areas
You can identify one's region from their accent
In TV news or documentaries, a sort of "unaccented"  Romanian is used, while in movies/shows the accents are typically from around the Bucharest area
We can mostly understand one another even if we have different accents, but sometimes it becomes difficult
For example, I have trouble with accents from Moldova (the country, not the region) and also with some accents from the southwest (Oltenia)
I am from Oltenia and I can confirm that people can be confused by our accent sometimes
I didn't have the pleasure to meet anyone from Oltenia, so I find it weird that their accent is somehow confusing
We speak in general with a very fast pace and because of that some don't understand us
We also have specific words like Brabete (male sparrow), bișag (Belșug,I don't remember the english word), boalcă or boare (heat), bobolani (gosling) etc that no one apart from us use and if used with someone else other than a Oltenian they will be confused
There is also this excessive use of the perfect simple we have and the -o ending for female names in vocative (Alino,Leano etc)
Saw many people eating alone in my country
Nobody seems to care
No one cares
Why would we care
Why would we bother someone who maybe just wants to eat
i don't think it's weird to go to a restaurant alone on a work break for example, if you don't have a lot of time and want a hot meal which isn't fast food
No, it’s illegal
But I have to recognize that it sounds quite interesting
In a fictional way not real one
Tochitura moldoveneasca
Pork and sausages cooked like a stew,but without any broth,served with polenta,cheese and one or two sunny side-up eggs
Serve with pickles as an optional garnish
It's the best thing to eat in winter
It actually sounds similar to a dish we have called "varză călită". It's cabbage cooked with meat
We eat it with pork, chicken or, personal favorite, duck
We have 8, 2 of which are natural
- Churches of Moldavia
- Dacian fortresses of the Orăștie Mountains
- Historic centre of Sighișoara
- Danube Delta
- Primeval beech forests of the Carpathians
- Monastery of Horezu
- Villages with fortified churches of Transylvania
- Wooden churches of Maramureș
More details and pictures:
Last time I checked, Romania had 7 (i see there is an 8th added now, shared with multiple countries)
The one I recommend the most is the Danube Delta
It's the largest one in Europe and its very well preserved
Not too touristic either, yet
Summer is coming which means the debate about what to call watermelons will start again
Is it better to call them "lebeniţă" or "harbuz". Do not try and came with its fancy name "pepene roşu" because both the users of "lebeniţă" and "harbuz" will fusion together and will burn you at the stake
*cough*
*cough*
Harbuz
onion but only red or spring kind
I love raisins and eat them by the handful, but in fucking cheesecake
Nasty
It's actually *Pepene verde
* Or just *Pepene
Intresting, never heard of this debate myself
This is a conversation we're having too
An extension of the conversation is talking about old ladies in the market
Should you buy your eggs/milk/etc from old ladies that sell it in the market from their garden or not
Is it even safe
Oddly enough, people that buy from random old ladies fall into the antivaxx category too
Totally agree
> we say "petit pain"
That's just wrong
> if u want it to be sweet just put sugar
That's just disgusting
'Romania' seems fine but i d change it so that it doesn't rhyme with roma or romani
Wallachia would sound cooler
I would give it a long ass name so it confuses people, like The United Principalities of Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia
Stealland
Why
Because politicians steal a lot from the people
I'd rename it just to Mania so that I can be called a Maniac officially
Dacia or Wallachia
Before trying to emphasize our connection to Rome, The region that is now my country was sometimes referred to as Dacia (yes, like the car)
In Romania we call your country "Țara Galilor" - The Country of the Gauls
To the point it would be too close with "Neanderthalic", there's no winning haha
Really
Portchugul ?
We need to teach foreigners how to say “România”
Same in Romanian
As far as I know, it's because Rumania ment only "Wallachia and Moldavia", in 1913 King Carol I of Hohenzollern renames it to Romania after gaining control over Northern Dobruja from Bulgaria
that one hurt just a little
We already call the Wales "Tara galilor" so the country of the Gauls
The "a" suffix is usually added to almost every country name in romanian so: Italy is Italia, France is Franța, Germany is Germania and so on
“Â” sounds like “e” in “ewwww”.
As far as I know there’s only one english word that has the sound
The “e” in ross**e**s is the closest to our “â”. Or similar to how the welsh call themselves in welsh, the “y” in C**y**mru
Huh, interesting
Agrippa
Carlos
If i name him so, he would get bullied all his life, or at least until he emigrates to a spanish speaking country
I really like Ethan or Nathaniel, but they're also hard to pronunce here
I’ve always liked Yukio
Hannibal and Tarquin; peak juxtaposition, I know
>Hapchetsut
Bless you
Why not, it's basically just an "old lady" name
Edit: referring to the Romanian version, Agripina
My name is Alex and I wish my parents had called me Sasha when I was a kid cause I really like that name
Unfortunately, as an adult it's pretty weird to ask people to suddenly call you by a different nickname
Spanish names for Romanian babies is a bit overdone now :(, it's impossible not to get bullied
I had a classmate in high school whose name was Carlos and he wasn’t actually bullied though
My sister has a classmate named Alejandro
Please god help our "wanna be unique" souls
Ee-tan Na-ta-niel
Could be the pronounciation, also I've seen people with English names here
Carol
Cornel
Carol
Cornel comes from the latin Cornelius
>kin
Fyi, it's "keen" (with a long "í")
"Kin" means relative
Of course we do
A lot of Romanians seems to love the ones with known brands but they are fake
I usually avoid them, not my style
My style is more fit for a movie if I think about it, simple colors or patterns
I know a lot of sneaker/streetwear hype people and they love plastering logos everywhere
And generally a looot of people wear clothes with logos because it makes them "look rich"
It is a generalization, but at least in Romania in most cases it is considered to have bad tastes and being arrogant to wear clothes with huge logo's on them
And   objectively is quite true, is hard to combine a t-shirt with a huge logo on it with some pants and a jacket
Here in Romania there are 2 types of people
The ones that buy clothing JUST because it has a logo on them (we call them "Bombardieri" and they typically wear fake Gucci and Vagabond) and the ones that just don't care that there's a logo on the clothing, what matters is that it looks good and fits
to give you a pov of someone that wears logos
Fuck yeah
Its not tacky if its not a tshirt with a HUGE Nike logo
Every teen here knows how to dress and throwing a logo piece in your outfit is something more people should do imo
Except pants
No one wears logo pants except people that wear fakes or actual fashion disasters
A nike cap with a small logo on the middle is subtle yet it looks good
Nothing wrong with wearing logos and you are not a walking billboard for doing that
I imagine that people that say that are the ones wearing a pair of blue jeans with a white/black tshirt, nothing else
There are very few things you could categorize as "typically European". I even find it hard to think about 1 thing tbh
That's right
Still, when the label of "European" is used, they are usually referring to 3-4 countries
I live in one, but Americans would probably consider even our portion size small
> war
That's not fair
I doubt that nations outside of Europe don't have a huge history of wars behind them
Definitely the UK
When I was a kid, I thought they were such polite and civilized people
Growing up, I found out about the hooliganism, excessive drinking, knife crimes and so on
Germany :(.
I was fascinated by it
Then I moved there and realized that people are people everywhere
I was really disappointed to find out that the "German efficiency" stereotype is just a myth
Monaco
Had this enchanting image of princes, wealth, the good life etc
In reality it's just a terribly overbuilt and overpriced strip of land, which in winter is more like a sleepy village with skyscrapers and during the summer is overrun by obnoxious tourists taking selfies
>Also the German efficiency stereotype is a myth
This completely disappointed me too
I work in a university and the lack organization is at the same level (or even lower) than in Romanian universities
How so
Do you think there were too few restrictions, too many, too broad or too specific
I think Germany did some of the best work in the region on the matter
From news and talking to people over there it seemed much more chill than say, France
I never said I was "believing". It was just a part that my childhood naivity wasn't aware of
We have the the suffix "-escu" which would mean "son of"(ex
Popescu,Ionescu etc
) or the surnames being just articulated nouns(eg
Galbenu meaning "the yellow one")
> (eg
Galbenu meaning "the yellow one")
You missed a golden opportunity there, my boy
These surnames are rarer and I wanted to use the more common ones(also I have never seen these names until now)
Negru, which has no racist connotation at all
I see them SO often, especially in university lists
There are even names starting with Aa (Aanei, Aanicai)
Oh no, the English language has taught me how grotesque (some of the many times) the Romanian language is
I never never thinked like that
it fits so well its easy to learn
I learned it at 7yo old
Ukraine: no, I think they're busy dealing with their other neighbours
Moldova: if I'm cherry picking I can find some things I don't like, but no
Bulgaria: no
Serbia: no
Hungary: barking, but not biting
still scared enough to cross to the other side of the street
Some of the best Romanian music is created by Moldovans so I’d say Moldova is Romania’s most dangerous neighbour
Bulgaria: we've had our fights in the past, but things are really ok now
Romanians probably are the majority of tourists so I don't think they want to jeopardize that
Not sure if stealing cars is still a thing or is now an urban myth
Romanians were afraid their cars will get stolen if they go to Bulgaria
Serbia: No
No conflicts in the past, probably Serbia and the Black Sea are our best neighbours
Hungary: They make a lot of noise and we squabble at a diplomatic level, but I don't think they would consider an actual attack
The difference in army size is substantial, plus we are both in NATO and EU
So we will continue to squabble, unless they change that wannabe Putin called Orban
Ukraine: Again, some rethoric from them, like a few months back
There is a romanian minority living in the Ukraine and the Ukrainian govt was afraid that Romania might fuel some kind of secesion, while Ukraine is busy with the Russians
No such thing and I don't see them as a threat
Moldova: These are basically Romanians, living in a separate state and kept like that by Russia
So I don't think there is any chance of Moldova being aggresive towards Romania
Russia: not a direct neighbour, but too close for comfort
With them you never now, since the 1800s we have had a hate-hate relarionship with Russia
They buzz our airspace, make threats about the NATO bases in Romania, especially the missile defense one
Yes, Hungary has scary goulash
Jokes aside, no, I don't think anybody around us has time or resources for that
Maybe Russia would want to exploit us, but then again, who doesn't Russia want to exploit
Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
Serbia  - no way
Hungary  - well
Transylvania
Ukraine  - probably over Northern Bukovina and the remaining parts of Bessarabia
Moldova  - a referendum would probably solve the conflict :)
Black Sea  - our best neighbor
Hungary
I'm worried they will try one of their shenanigans again
Ukraine: They got their fair share of problems
Moldova: Eyyyyy, buddy
Bulgaria: Apart from the constant competition for the poorest country in the EU, no problems
Serbia: They're pretty cool
Hungary: You will not steal Transylvania, now gtfo
To be fair, most Hungarians individually just got over the Transylvania thing and couldn't care less
Most
> Romania - tbf probably our best neighbour
We aren't culturally as similar as other EX-YU countries (obviously), but we didn't have any conflicts historically and I don't think we will in the near future
I visited Belgrad last summer and I almost felt like I was back home in Bucharest
I find them quite alike eachother
Maybe I’m wrong, I only spent one day there unfortunately
If he is not a doctor he is safe
Apparently only Russian doctors have a sudden urge to fly
Not sure why but I am sure it is just a coincidence this happens only in Russia
Hockey is a wonderfully brutal game
Eh, its almost a lake
Some nationalistic politicians 20 years ago were saying that "it is and will be romanian". Pretty cringe if you ask me
It used to be called little Paris up until the Second World War, then it got a severe and ugly makeover in the communist era, so the pretty parts are in the minority now
It’s very common for people born here in western Romania
Most of the people I know who were born here speak either Hungarian, German, Serbian or Bulgarian as a minority language
Edit: come to think of it, 100% of my friends who only speak Romanian have moved here from other parts of Romania
In Romania,gypsyes have a language of their own
It is simillar to the indian language,but,appart from that,I don't have much knowledge of it
Is there a big difference between Spanish and Galician
There are no French communities in this area, there is no reason for kids to grow up speaking French as a minority language
French and German are taught in school as a second foreign language, after English
Thx for the info
This one is for my fellow and beloved people from the grand city of Bucharest:
You want to know what is the main source of traffic and parking problems in Bucharest
Look in the mirror
Yes, the administration it’s incompetent and the big projects are moving as slow as they can be, but the biggest problem it’s you, you that are alone in a car meant for 5, you that owns more cars than you even need and don’t even considered ranting one instead of buying one, you that instead of walking or using public transportation choose to drive the car for a few km
It’s you, everything it’s because of you
Szekelyland still exists
NATO
I think Austria is not allowed to join NATO
Even when you were a superpower you were called “the sick man of Europe” because after 1800’s you were basically a superpower just in name
This is a nice sentiment
Just out of curiosity i've searched on google map
From estern side of Czech Republic to Syria (closest non Maghribian non european country) there are 2
800km
From the southern border of Czech republic to nord Tunisia there are 2
400 km so they are the closest non european neighbour
The independece war, when we got rid of the otoman influence
1877 war of Independence
Or better the Voievod era
17-16th century Romania around the time that Mihai Viteazu managed to unite for the first time all the provinces that form modern day Romania
Yeah, it has
In fact, I'm pretty sure they air all 3 on television every year
Yes, in Romania they air Home Alone, the Lord of the Rings and Die Hard every year, all the movies
Yes, you cant have Christmas in Romania without Home Alone
hell yeah
Each year PRO TV puts home alone 1,2 and 3 each saturday of december leading up to christmas
romania btw
I've seen it so many times I friking learned its plot
Of course
It's aired every year
Don't forget Lotr ...for some reason
Yup, this year were aired too
Cocalars (douchebags but gypsies and dresses only with adidas, just google)
Moldoveni
Gypsis, too many of them

So, eh, what does wallah mean, what's the origin of the term
Rock actually started to gain traction in the 60s, however being something very Western it was pretty controversial at that time
Some of the bands from this era are: Cometele, Uranus and Phoenix (which still exists today)
A lot changed in 1971 after the July Theses, the July Theses' objective was basically to put the Romanian culture above all others, along with it stuff like singing in English or wearing Western inspired clothing like jeans was banned
Naturally this change greatly influenced rock as more and more people were encouraged to sing traditional Romanian music
Despite this, it wasn't the end of rock in Romania, a new subgenre arose, etno rock which combined rock music with traditional Romanian themes and music
This one
I enjoy quite a bit Premiata Forneria Marconi
I would add Rodion G.A. as a great name of those years, there are lots of people who don't know his music
I'll link [The Lost Tapes] here, I like it a lot
Yeah the July thesis definitely influenced that song along with pretty much any other song from the 70s and 80s
Link it mate, for fame and karma
As a Romanian, I can understand like 20-30%of italian and spanish, and like 40% french
However, I don't think its the other way round as well
As a Romanian, can confirm that Spanish and Italian are the easiest for me to understand, at least in proportion of 70-75% or so, sometimes less, but that depends
As for French and Portuguese I kinda struggle there, at best, I'd probably understand around 10-15%, sometimes around 20%
I myself can understand most Italian words
but still
we are very different
We are the bestly preserved language from the ancient times I mean
. Our language is closer to latin than Italians are
I think some Scots are unintelligible to English-speakers
Type something in Aromanian, I'm curious to see how much I can understand it
unintelligible*
For me Spanish is easier, but I have a hunch it's because of all the telenovelas I was 'forced' to watch with my mom (we only had one TV back then)
I know some Irishmen are
The spear in the ass
We impaled ottomans here
Make em shish kebab
People used to get Impaled here
Pretty fun, just some people hanging out on some good ol' spikes
We had Vlad the impaler
Do i need to say anything else
Gravity after impaling their asses lmao
Impaling people on wooden sticks, Vlad Tepes Style
We have impaling from ma boi Vlad Tepes AKA Dracula
Ofc no one still uses it :))
It was not used since the 15th century, but impaling
Can you imagine, being put on a stake, and slowly being stabbed and you dying instantly
And then your fucking king will drink your blood because you were a bloody traitor
Giant wooden spear that goes up the ass of the victim
impaling (also how do i get the flag
Impalement
Our impaling used to be of high quality
Turkey was the biggest importer, so they can confirm it
People were Impaled here (Edit:Didn't meant to post as a comment)
Yes, sir
I would love a Turkish kebab with a little bit of blood
Ah I forgot about that
Can we bring back Vlad
#MakeRomaniaImpaleAgain
I am curious
How
But effective
Yes
#MakeRomaniaImpaleAgain
thank you
We'll impale your ass and rip your still beating heart out, but at least we'll look good while doing it
Effective
They keep screaming for half an hour sometimes dude
Not only does it take a while for them to die, but they keep making noise afterwards
I need sleep y'know
You're welcome
Romania has a region widely inhabited by Szekely people
They keep making noise about independence but nobody really takes them seriously
They do speak some sort of Hungarian though so people are associating them with Hungarians and now we have a lot of jokes about autonomy misdirected at Hungarians
But we also joke about the obsession of actual Hungarians with Transylvania and how they can't stop being so salty about a century old treaty
No, just one group that wants autonomy however they sometimes behave like separatists (and quite frankly the large scale autonomy they want would basically be a different country paid by us)
I think i might know who wants autonomy
Are there 2 words in English you use the same word for ?
For example in English you have Rifle and Shotgun
But in Romanian they're both "Pușcă".
Or Convent and Monestery which are both "Mănăstire" in Romanian
To do and to make are both "a face" in Romanian
But we have  "Mitralieră"  too for rifle
Same here
Even the word is similar, "Nepot".
Same here
We call both moon and month "Lună".
We do have "revolver" in our language but no one really uses it . We usually just say "fuck it
" and just call both of'em "pistol".
Same here, bancă
_"Poison and married are both gift"_
That's food for thought
Same
They're both "Pistol Mitralieră".
"Mitralieră" is machine gun not rifle
Nepot, nepoată, strănepot, strănepoată
Not the same
Thats because the ancient Romans didnt use the "months". They referred to a period of time of 30 or 31 days with "moon". Like, "see you next moon
" Instead of "see you next month
" This kept on being a part of some countries such as Czechia and Romania, in Italy you say "mese" for month and "luna" for moon tho
Idk about other latin or non-latin european countries
Hmm , I guess you're right
"Stranepot" and "stranepoata" is used for grand grandchildren so it s only "nepot" for male and" nepoata" for female in this case
Not really in Romanian
Pink is "Roz" and  Rose is "Trandafir" (which is also a type of sausage)
Altough we also have "Roză" for Rose but "Trandafir" is more common
it's funny because it's true
Oh well Russia had nothing to do with the Roman Empire tho
Its normal that there are differences
Yea, but i dont know if the Byzantium used the same method as the Roman empire to count months
I identify like myself like this
Wallachia/Hessen/Europe
Nation
I have many international friends, and it has become a trait
And I don't have friends from braşov or sinaia, only bucharest or other countries
For me it was always logical to view the identity as concentric circles, with my village in the center
If you're part of the diaspora (like me) than you probably have a somewhat separate identity
Also don't forget about the Székelys
Playing outside "in front of the block" as we call it
Going outside a lot, in the park, with friends
My legs and arms are full of scars from falling over while running
Fun times, man
I was organizing arenas where different household items were fighting each other
Watching tv on 2 channels that both dont exist anymore . Jetix and Animax . Those were the good ol' days
Back when the world made sense
The ones that have several L's and R's in close proximity
- *Literally* sounds like [Patrick from Spongebob]
- Particu*larly*, same issue
- *Rural*
"Wrath" is super difficult for me
And "world"... And "word"....
Basically anything that starts with a w is hard
I've lived in Canada for 20 years (from romania, left at 10 years old) and speak fluent English with very very little accent and I still have an impossible time saying rural
Also horror
I find it odd for Rural as it is part of our vocabulary, we say rural environment, mediu rural
For me things like Worcestershire sauce or names like Massachusetts are hard to say, they feel like such a rollercoaster for the tongue
I can't even pronounce rural properly in Romanian
It's a badly designed word
So like [this] scene from Psych haha
I mean, rural is just as part of our vocab as it is in English, as in - almost never used by anyone who's not a news anchor or giving a presentation
Regular people in conversation use "la sat" (in the countryside)
> Worldwide is my nightmare lmao
Pitbull would be [very disappointed in you]
> and we make it sound like f or d.
**D**ey and **F**ink respectively
I think he's saying that is is easier for the tongue to transition from one letter to another when he says "g**o**rl", rather than the short **i** in "girl".
Visually, România and the baltic states have a very similar vibe
Bucharest and riga (exclude
medieval parts)
From a.langiage perspective, portuguese can sound very similar to Romanian
In terms of story and old history România has a deep rooted balkan vibe
Now each part of România has similarities with their former occupier
The South more of a turkish influence
Transylvania more of a germanic, hungarian type vibe
Romanian moldavian area more of a.slavic vibe
South American countries, without a doubt
Probably Brazil or Argentina come closest
Weirdly enough lots of of things Koreans do and say remind me of Romania lol
Even my mom agreed
At least when I compare both to Spain, I feel like South Korea is more similar to Romania
People tend to have higher respect for elders, people are obsessed with what others think of them and do anything to appear better for others (aka, both Koreans and Romanians can be rlly fake lol)
Rarely see this in Spain
Here, we called even the teachers by their first name
Which was so hard for me to do when I moved here lmao
And they don't usually try to put up walls and masks to appear wealthier and nicer
Which I see constantly in Romania and Korea (haven't been there but I watch tons of videos on YouTube by Koreans hahah, plus the kdramas are somewhat true)
Also, even some foods remind me of Romanian foods
I keep thinking that mixing romanian and korean food together would be heaven lol
I think there's also a similar feeling due to being separated from our sibling
(North Korea and Moldova)
Obviously Korea's situation was and is much worse but still, lmao
I forgot to mention
That both Romania and Korea are pretty hardcore about their religion and beliefs
In Spain most people aren't very religious, if at all
And those who are, are pretty open minded and relaxed either way
In Romania and Korea people are still very close minded and traditionalist
Man we in Romania sure are suckers for all things French
Our architecture, our political and legal systems, our education and cultural institutions and even our language have so much French influence
One fun fact I noticed is that the street signs in Bucharest are exact copies of the Paris ones (the green border and blue background, like [this] I know not everything is the same, there are of course very strong Balkan influences
But when I made a French friend in university we would talk about things back home and every 5 minutes one of us would be like "hang on, we have that too
I'd add countries from South America
I've met people from Brazil and Argentine and their way of being and expressing themselves hit close to home, like I was conversing with just another Romanian, same levels of cynicism, very similar humour and a general openness towards life
We could even share similar stories of corruption from our politicians lol
It was weird how familiar these people seemed
Well, if you feel like driving for 2h, [The Mud Volcanoes] If not, there's the [Văcărești Nature Park] IN Bucharest
[Bear's Cave]  in Northern Romania
It's named like that because 140 bear skeletons were found there
The cave bear, also known as Ursus spelaeus, is a species of bear which became extinct during the Last Glacial Maximum, about 27,500 years ago
Very close to the place I was born: [Delta Văcărești] basically a Delta next to the city where Ceaușescu wanted to create a canal that would connect the city to the Danube
The project remained unfinished and nature slowly reclaimed the land
Not as beautiful or majestic as the Danube Delta, but quite unique in many ways
Close to the place I currently live: I guess also Wadden See or the sand dunes, but from the Dutch side
My school got us some nice G suite accounts so we're using Google Meet for online classes and Classroom for everything else
Our uni recently came up with institutional e-mail addresses for everyone, they are Gmail-based and we mostly use Google Classroom and Meet
Romanian lessons are done on Google Meet, Math on Skype and the rest on Cisco WebEx Meetings
Yeah school we use a bunch of apps
which are:zoom,skype and g classroom
Yes, we use Teams but there is one teacher that uses Discord and one that uses webex
Honestly, this online college is the worst
The implementation is not bad but the teachers have so much tests and homework now, I'm at the end now, I don't have any strength left
My university uses zoom but we don't have a balanced schedule
For example, on monday we have courses from 9am to 8pm but on tuesday we only have one course which is 2 hours long
It's really tiring
We have Math every few days, Romanian twice a week and English once a week
All on Zoom
Yes, we use Microsoft teams
All classes are also recorded which is super nice
They should have done this since long ago
We mainly use zoom and WhatsApp
WhatsApp for those teachers that don't really wanna do zoom meetings or don't have a good internet connection, they mainly just send us homework
I'm in 10th grade and yes
We use google classroom and google meet
All is going pretty well
My brother who is in 5th grade uses microsoft teams and let me tell you,some of his teachers have no idea what they are doing
One put an assigment like this "page 96 ex 1 2 3 4".It didn't state the subject,ms teams didn't show the name or anything
They asked what the subject was and nobody answered
Some children said it was history some said it was geography
In the end she still got mad at the kids who didn't know what to do
Not personally, but my boyfriend's mom is a teacher
She teaches through Google classroom I think it's called
Either way it's from Google and its for e learning
From skype to discord to google meet to messenger, zoom and an app called adservio that never works but my school continues to pay for
Teachers use whatever platform they want and it's so infuriating and stressful
Either Google Classroom and Google Meet or Zoom and custom e-learning platforms around here mostly
Same as my school
Oh boy there was a looong list somewhere online
One that comes to mind is Spermezeu - basically translates as sperm god

There is a brand of beer known as ‘Fucking Hell’.
We have a city named slobozia wich sloboz means sperm or other liquid like that
There's the classic example of Croatian city named Pula, which means The Dick in Romanian
In the country, we have:
* Băicoi - would translate to Hey nut (testicle)

* Amărăști - Poor people (common name used by several villages)
* Slobozia - Sperm city

There is also a bus going from Lungește (lengthen) to Măciuca
Haha, but that town is in your country, not in Romania
The question is about your own country

The Colectiv fire (30 oct 2015) when 64 people died and 186 were wounded
The Colectiv club fire
That club has been ignoring fire safety regulations
On 30 Oct
2015 there was a fire caused by some fireworks and a pillar had some sort of inflammable material on it
27 people died burning in that building because of non-working fire exit doors and some have been left physically mutilated
Colectiv club fire
A truck filled with amonium nitrate had a crash, the firemen and the EMTs got blown to bits because they didnt know about the truck load
The Caracal case of August 2019
Basically a girl who was abducted managed to call the police
The operator handled the situation very and i mean very poorly, it's like they couldn't realise she was in danger, and they hang up on her telling they have other calls
There was only one operator for a huge area of the country apparently
The next day police arrived but didn't enter the house until they got a warrant
They arrested the old man and investigated and found bones in the backyard
This man also abducted at least another girl in the spring
From the analysis of the bones they realised those were of the girl who called
It really is a shame the police is so unnefective here in critical cases
In recent history, in my opinion, there's the Colectiv Nightclub Fire in which 146 people were injured and 64 more died
It all started with when a show of a band went completely out of control when their firework system made the scene to catch on fire
The regulations in Romania had very permisive points for the approval of a fire safety permit, and proper exits didn't exist to allow everyone to get out in time
As all tragedies in Romania this would go further up to reveal that neither the hospitals, the authorities, nor the society were ready to handle a crisis of such scale
Our governmemt
I say that because we have chosen them and they were just some corrupt clowns
It was so shit we had prime ministers who could not properly speak our language
Thankfully our government fell down a week ago
We have chosen some really bad guys
Colectiv
A concert using fireworks in a highly flammable environment (a club which didn't even have the right emergency exit procedures put in place) ended up killing dozens of people and badly injuring over 150
(Club Colectiv, October 2015)
Colectiv
They didn't respect the fire safety rules and many people died
There was that whole nightclub fire a few years ago
... and nobody was held accountable for said deaths
64 people died because the club owner decided to mount cheap, flammable soundproofing sponge on the club walls  knowing that there are also indoor fireworks in the same room
Dumb
64 died, sorry
Unfortunately
the club owners were arrested  for negligent homicide, negligent bodily harm, and negligent destruction, but that's it
4 years since we lost 64 incredible people and nothing changed
Yeah, and shit fire regulations like not enough fire extinguishers and malfunctioning fire escape, for which they got authorisation anyway from the sector mayor
It was horrific
The hospitals weren't ready for this disaster
Lot's of burnt victims and not enough  medication or sanitary conditions, which are very important, staff was overwhelmed and overworked
Some lucky ones were able to be transported in other countries for treatment
The authorities also lied about the conditions in hospitals, telling everyone that everything was under control, which was absolutely not
It was horrible
We are still mourning the victims and we are still angry about the situation
yes
We have a shitton of traditions surrounding funerals (there's stuff you need to do even 7 years after someone dies)
And it honestly feels weird to ignore doing those stuff when the person that died was religious
While these traditions were designed with a very specific material meaning (like we have to give away some of the personal belongings of the dead person = distributing stuff within the community), nowadays it has a weird effect on people
It forces you to think about God and the afterlife so many times, most people that I know that are atheists turn agnostic when someone died
Just because it otherwise feels like a waste of time and effort to do all the traditions
I think people turn to religion as they grow in life, because they need a sense of purpose, wether they realise it or not
The church gives that
The elderly probably turn to it because
you know
death
the fear of death
"Romania
There is where Dracula is from, no
"Thief's and gypsy all around

Did it snow where you live this winter
I live in Bucharest and my city hasn't gotten any snow yet
We're approaching February so I'm kinda losing hope, given that the temperature today is around 10ºC. Anyways, I hope next year we'll have a white Christmas
Actually it did snow for about one hour in December, but very very weak and the snow just melted when it touched the ground
Today really feels like a spring day
I know this is bad for the environment, but I love Spring
haha :D
Techincally we did get some snow flakes around the end of December but it was very lite and too warm to actually get a layer of it
It is unusual however, we got used to having snow only in late January begining of feburary, sometimes even going until early april, that's how it's been in the last years
Normally though even without snow temperatures used to get even as low as -7 -10  in this period of the year, it hasn't been the case though, you can even get Snowdrops at this point in time despite them being supposed to bloom in early march as a symbol (in our culture) of spring
Adriatic sea side of Italy, and not even a snowflake spotted, just a bit of rain
And cold
Really cold
We had about a day of snow
Not a lot compared to other winters
I'm from Craiova btw
Like 3 days in Timisoara
Yes but not that much like in december started after december ended and again now we dont have snow
It snowed in Cluj
We still have a patches of actual snow here and there and there were some days of a snow layer right after New Year, but not enough to make it a decent winter
In Vâlcea it snowed a little mid-end November
We had one day of snow and that was it in Brasov
All the ski slopes had to rely on snow cannons
Honestly i think that for most including me this was just a harder autumn
Twice, the snow was gone in two days in both cases
Northen Romania here
We had a few weeks of snow
It was nice
I could even go ice skating one day
There was snow in Cluj-Napoca for a few days at the beginning of the month
Just enough to make your shoes a mess and maybe slip on the sidewalk
Nothing more
Maybe there still is some on roofs
I can't stop thinking that if all Europe is without snow that means we will have a serious issue with grains this year
I mean
yeah
snow is nice to play and everything but more than that it means the soil gets the right amount of water for the grains to grow
No snow - no water - no grains = higher food prices and more poor people
Higher prices + more poor people = riots most of the time
Still very much popular
Though it's not as much scam healthcare products like it was 10 years ago, it's mostly up-priced cooking/cleaning gimmicky gadgets that you can buy for 10% of the price on aliexpress
Sadly, very popular with old people, enough for them to buy 3+ minute ads in "prime-time" tv
Dormeoooo Noapteee bunaaaa

English translation:

If you call now, you won't recieve just one \[insert product name\], but two at the amazing price of just 99 lei
I don't know if anyone remembers many years ago but there was that Italian dude that was selling rings or something like that and kept yelling "CADO
" and kept adding rings to the offer
That was ridiculous
Yes, I remember my grandma watching this as if it was an Oscar nominated movie
Never quite understood why elders were so fascinated by teleshopping

What's that photo of the guy running from east to west
There's a mural in Berlin of it, I think
Edit: nervermind, someone else posted it :P
That's when he realised
He fucked up
Yeah, I watched the video and at one point he starts promising pay increases and other benefits, with no effect on the protestors
A hungry wolf doesn't care about what you promise to buy him if he spares your life
I really like the flow and sound of Russian, and in fact thet's the reason I started studying it
Im seriously surprised
With some turkish influences in the south, hungarian and german in transylvania and yes slavic ones in east and a lot of words are from french but modified so it's sounds a bit more romanian than french
A lot of people think that French is the only language Romanians usually learn at school other than English, but it's not uncommon at all for someone to never have had a French class in their lives and onlt German
Still president , on his 2nd term
Yeah, I am in Harghita and I learn French, but even as close as Mures there are people learning German in school
My cousin who lives in Targu Mures only has German classes
Shortly after the unification of Wallachia and Moldova in the 1850s, a branch of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family was placed on the throne of the new Romania
I think it was a compromise between some great European powers, some of which (the Ottomans and English) didn't want a united Romania, and others were for it
I think overall they did us good, as we gained full independence from the Ottomans in 1878, unified with Transylvania and Bessarabia in 1918 and industry, transportation, infrastructure, education greatly improved
Yes, [Carol I] the first Romanian King, was born in the German Empire
I think Romania is pretty much the most qualified country for this one
There was an entire century between around 1711 and 1821 when Wallachia and Moldavia had, with very few exceptions only foreign born rulers
It was called the Phanariote Era due to the fact that most rulers were Greeks who came from the Phanar district of Istanbul
After that part in 1866 King Charles I came to Romania from Germany as well as the next ruler, Ferdinand I, who was also born in Germany
Well, there was [this] guy, the first monarch of Romania, who was born in Germany
What's worse, his son, Ferdinand I, was also born in Germany and he was probably quite torn when Romania entered WWI fighting against his native country
Heh, thanks
I actually didn't knew this
To add, while being a tributary state the Ottomans gave the rulership of the Danube principalities to Greek families
Most of the 17th, 18th and 19th voievods were either Greek or with Greek ancestry
Read his name as Boner Law
Yes, you're right
For anyone interested, they were called the Phanariots, after the Phanar quarter of Instanbul where they were originally from
Interesting point
I was alluding to the 1856 Treaty of Paris
The Ottomans were opposed to the union because the two principalities were their vassals, and divide and conquer and all that
The British were allied with the Ottomans, so they were opposed too
France, Prussia and Russia were in favour, because it gave a stronger buffer between the Ottomans and everyone else, as had the role of the Principalities been for centuries
Thanks for adding that, did not know how to spell it in English
"Romania single-handedly helped the Entente win WWI because we joined the war"
Yeah I fucking bet
we were talking about neighboring countries for some reason and my history teacher told us that we are neighbors with russia
we all were like wtf no we’re neighbors with ukraine and moldova, and she then told the whole class that ukraine, moldova and russia are one and the same
this happened in 5th grade and after that we never saw her again lol
we also had a substitute teacher that firmly believed that romania was part of the ussr, and when we tried to correct him, he would say that we are dumb to believe “media propaganda”.
When we had the WW1 lesson in high school our teacher told us that the Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Serbia and that we had a general called Constantin Dragalina (when in reality whe had 2 generals named Constantin Prezan and Ion Dragalina)
Another one from the same teacher is that our independence day is on 9 may when in reality is 10 may
The whole "9 may" thing was taught during communism because 9 may is when the parliament signed the declaration of independence and on 10 may it was when the prince (later king) signed it thus declaring the country officially independent
That cellular data in cellular phones is dangerous because they use a nuclear cell
"Australia has 6 states
Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and NORTHERN Australia"
7th grade, had a quick geography lesson on Australia
I bet she just looked at a map of Australia and came to that conclusion
Tasmania is RIGHT THERE and on the map it said "Northern TERRITORY". Who let this women into the school
My class is divided in German learners and French learners, and I am studying German
One day, my german teacher was not at the school because she was sick, so I had to stay with the guys from my class who learn French
When I got there, I went on my desk and started to play on my phone, because I didnt have nothing else to do
That French teacher has seen me and said "You german learners should go down on your knees in front of french learners because the actions on WW2
I think she was just dumb and didn't know what happened to French
My classmates always say that their french teacher is dumb
My teacher tried to tell me that vaccines **don't** cause autism,such a fool
Yeah I mean when you get stomped you distract the enemy so the big guys can do stuff
The same with WWII when we switched sides
My history teacher: who knows how long WWII would have gone if we did not switch sides
PS: cute username ;)
..the fuck
When did the first thing happen and how old was the teacher
This reminds me of my philosophy teacher who said something along the lines of: "Humans are superior to animals because we dream" and when I told her that my dog dreams very often and asked for clarification she said she'd get back to me
She never brought it up again
Nope, just a few years ago actually
At the time I had an old man as a history teacher and he tried so hard to make us patriotic
He was nationalistic af
He told us that Hungarians are the scum of earth and that they shouldn't even dare request Transylvania and other shit like this
We got a new teacher who, on the other hand, simply told us the truth and he even made fun of our country
He restored my faith in history teachers and I'm glad that there are not many people like that old dude
Double that with Romanian school system,really,half of our teachers actually demand high respect and still believe that students should only listen to them,not even other teachers,so yeah,Austria is still good
almost four years ago, i think the teacher was in her fifties
What I said wasn t a joke, unfortunately
I mean,,, it was a joke
In Romania it's called "Boboteaza", Christ's Baptism in the Jordan River
Priests make holy water then visit people's homes and "baptize" them with it
They also leave a bit of holy water in a glass, that you'd traditionally drink in the morning to protect yourself from evil
There's a tradition for unmarried girls to put a sprig of basil under their pillows to see their future husband in their dreams
For those who live close to a river/lake/sea, the priest would throw a wooden cross into the water and young men would race each other swimming for it, the one who retrieves the cross will have good fortune the whole year
Also today we celebrate St John the Baptist and those who have his name or derivatives of his name
The first that comes to mind is “Descent to me, mild Lucifer" ( Ro:  "Cobori în jos Luceafăr blând")  from Mihai Eminescu's poem "Luceafărul" (Eng: Lucifer / Morningstar)
It's the most famous poem in our literature
The whole stanza goes like:
“Descent to me, mild Lucifer,
Thou canst glide on a beam,
Enter my dwelling and my mind
And over my life gleam
Sidenote: we never read this poem thinking it's about the devil, we interpret it as being a God of some sort who is a personification of the literal Morningstar
[Here's] the link if you fancy reading the whole thing
Evening Star ("Luceafărul") by Mihai Eminescu
I believe it's the longest piece of romantic poetry ever written in history
In Romanian, I would say there is the beginning of [Luceafărul] the masterpiece of our most famous poet, Mihai Eminescu
*A fost o dată ca-n povești,*
*A fost ca niciodată,*
*Din rude mari împărătești,*
*O prea frumoasă fată.*
&#x200B;
*Și era una la părinți,*
*Și mândră-n toate cele*
*Cum e fecioara între sfinți*
*Și luna între stele
&#x200B;
Which has been translated as:
*There was, as in the fairy tales,*
*As ne'er in the time's raid,*
*There was, of famous royal blood*
*A most beautiful maid
*She was her parents' only child,*
*Bright like the sun at noon,*
*Like the Virgin midst the saints*
*And among stars the moon
I would say probably every Romanian has heard those two stanzas and most of the people know them by heart
It's such an iconic poem
>“Descent to me, mild Lucifer"
This implies the existence of spicy Lucifer
No foreign films that I can think of, but one of the most internationally acclaimed Romanian films of the last 20 years portrayed us perfectly - [The Death of Mr Lazarescu]
It's a "slice of life" film about an old man who is trying to get correctly diagnosed (and treated) in our healthcare system
Won some fancy award at Cannes, was all over the news back in the day
None in my experience or that I'm aware off
Quite sad but I think that's the case for most countries
You rarely see a movie trying to portray another culture and done it right, though there are exceptions
In Romania we don't really discuss the trianon
A cool movie could come out on this topic especially if you focus on how entrenched beliefs lead to conflict
Cheers for the recommendation
Don't go to Vaslui(jk)
Seriously, try not to go outside at night
If you go to big cities it might not be as dangerous, but there are a loooot of stray dogs and creepy people so watch your step
I heard tons of tourists complaining about how many stray dogs there are around here and honestly, we're tired of them too, but no one has any idea what to do
Come to my country
Don't make fin of the gypsies/poverty
Keep it to yourself,and if they make you feel unconfortable,don't just say "ach damn deez dumb gyspies",avoid conflicts and ignore,they will get bored and let you be
idk if it was said before, but definitely don’t mention dracula/ vampires to us
it’s annoying and vampires aren’t even part of the romanian folklore
we have strigoi though
also don’t go hitchhiking,  it’s very dangerous and a girl was actually [murdered] quite recently
Think we’re Slavs, or Gypsies
I thought that would be Australia
Depends on the city, in Timișoara is really safe on night and there are no stray dogs
So you generalise
This is so true, my father and I literally walked around for an hour to find that thing and it was a huge dissapointment
Especially compared to the rest of amazing stuff we saw there
Wait, aren't you people a bit restrictive
Not if it's a sad clown
We had a German teacher once and the fact that she was speaking in a similar tone as the hitler speech in the movie didn't help at all
8th graders are ruthless
I don't know how they act in other places but here, if there is an opportunity to make fun of someone it is taken
No second thoughts
Unrelated to heil hitlering, one guy managed to make the math teacher leave the class crying from frustration after he argued for 20 minutes that she forgot to give us homework
Ruthless
I never said stray dogs are in every single city this wonderful country has to offer did I
We did, but it's kind of unethical
We wanted to euthanize for quite a while now( I mean, a couple of years ago a kid died eaten by stray dogs I think)
I don't know what happened with them but they disappeared all of a sudden from my city . Meanwhile in my parents town has like 4k people and they have a dog problem because of some stupid dude that keeps them around ..like 15 dogs ,they are cool during the day but the bark and try to chase you during the night ,someone had enough and gave them rat poison ..most of them died . Problem solved
I get a boner when the climate is hot, or in a sauna, I don't know why, and if I can't hide it, how do I not disrespect anyone in Finland in a sauna
Part of the Western corporations group involved in illegal deforestation scandals in Romania
They are very rare
Thats all
Ive never been to one
Several companies,civilians and other men in posisitions of power are engaging in illegal logging on state or private land and cut tree after tree after tree,so much so that we no longer have virgin,untouched forests
All the while,the ministry of the environment,of the waters and forests,and ROMSILVA,the romanian forest protection angency just sit there saying something along the lines of:'Idk man,we know how much they cut,but who knows,maybe they're just getting firewood for the winter,nd we can't prosecute that,can we
Doesn't matter that the wood is in such large quantities that it's clearly not firewood,and the tree trunk bases left behind can be seen from a plane as a hole in the forest,but we don't need to talk about that'
As for what companies do that,I have no idea,can't help
Here is a little clip about it, part of a larger documentary Netflix made
Usually anything about Transilvania, started either by a Romanian or a Hungarian
The thing is that almost every ex-communist country (Slovenia being the model out of all) are, in comparison with the "west" richer
So it does not surprise me when people associate being poor with being eastern European
We love to trash each other but we're also pretty united in a strange way
Since we're the closest NATO country to Crimea, it feels good having a military base to protect us from Russia
There's an air base near my city, and you can sometimes here distant *woosh*es from that direction
It's funny when they line up with jokes
As long as they keep Russia out I'm fine
The one at Deveselu is doing an amazing job
American soldiers are fucking teenage girls forced into prostitution
Police does nothing
Some of them are killed
Everything is great
You guys make very good matured cheese, yes, but fresh cheese is exquisite in Eastern Europe
(although it's mostly not brand cheese that I'm talking about, but still)
Exactly, just because they are not super marketed, cheese you find in eastern Europe is very underestimated
True, but when you think about it (at least IMHO), both elements - the fish and the fries (I'm not calling them chips lol) - are better in other dishes
Like, the fish is better prepared in Mediterranean dishes - beer batter is kinda boring - and the fries, idk, I just don't like the thick cut + semi-soggy consistency
Much prefer the belgian style: thin, crispy and served with mayo
Tbh I'm really really looking forward to being able to travel again, so my wife and I can visit the UK
Maybe I'll change my mind then
Basing this off the classic British passive-aggresiveness - why, what are they gonna do
Ring me up with a bit of an attitude
I mean, I'll take'em if nothing else
IMO thick cuts are only for patatas bravas - [these ones in Valencia] were amazing
Otherwise, my favorite kind is [these] super crispy thin cuts, with parmesan and chives optional
No, and would probably be unsuccessful
There were in the USA and I tried some kielbasa
Any Romanian sausage is better IMHO
When it comes to food, for me it's hard to choose from Turkish and Hungarian
Romanian would be 3rd and I also wouldn't mind having Italian or French food
No offense, your food is for me just like Czech or German or Austrian
I really like the norse mythlohy and greek mythology
So I like Sweden, Norway, Greece
Germany
It s just that they contributed so much to modern society as people
Japanese for sure
I started with the strongest god, and then with his children, his nephews etc
You'll learn
If I wanted a vacation, interwar period would be nice
If I wanted to learn more about the past (and didn't care about safety), I'd go either sometime in the Early Middle Ages, during Roman conquest or in prehistory
I would go back 20 years only if I can be a child again
Otherwise I would stay put
I prefer being alive and unharmed
1918, Banat Republic
It feels weird to have Banat independent (and with a socialist leader to top it all)
I would like to see that with my eyes
I jsut know like 5 wprds from the russian anthem cuz im a weird
I couldn't hum any of them (maybe besides the French one) to save my life, but the Slovakian and the Italian ones are my favorites
lmao people just FLEX, and when i say flex i mean FLEX, Big Houses, Super Cars, Everything outta gold
They are two different perspectives: the normal people, who don't have the same possibilities, but who are not interested because they realise the importance of the medium class and the rest of society who have the ideal of the wealth, so the society is divided
The majority is, however, sceptic and, even more(indifferent, malicious) with the rich people who are flexing on us
I can't say the same thing in the political context, they are some politicians, in Romania, who steal and who become rich just because of us
The society became so frustrated when the politicians had adapted an urgent ordinance who modified the laws of the justice
The people had protested and, the government fell 3 months ago, after two years of continual protests online and in the streets
So,  in Romania, the grandiosity of the rich people is not supported and encouraged, especially because we are a poor country reported to the European Union
And, in general, the mentality doesn't permit to praise himself because it's immoral in a society abounded by poor guys
Hope you understand the situation
Every kid nowadays tries to look like a rapper from the States
Just like Nobility during the Baroque, everything must be made of gold and have as many details as possible
nah they are mostly "gypsies" who are rich just because of their parents and their parents spoil them so hard, i was in a village last summer and i saw 4 identical houses for each family member
Normally gypsis flex the most, building themselfs castle like homes, that is for the 2% of them that are actually wealthy
And yes they are flat out A-holes
Super cars aren't that much of a thing here though, well at least not in the captial where I live, the richer people in here just have a mansion here and there, less opulant and better looking
Trăsniții (the crazies)
Originally a military themed sitcom called Trăsniți în NATO (crazies in NATO) staring a group of soldiers and their shenanigins and later it became a regular sitcom known simply as Trăsniții
It ended last year at season 34 ep 1847 after running for 20 years
I'm not sure, but I believe it's Trasnitii (also known as Trasniti in NATO/din NATO)
From the wiki page: number of episodes: 2157 and number of seasons: 54
Also, "La Bloc" - with 525 episodes and 13 seasons
When my gf visited my family in Moldova she said she couldn't understand my grandparents for a couple of days before she got used to how they spoke
That accent just sounds like a different language
We use older/different words and there's Russian influence in the pronunciation (even if we try not to use actual Russian words, which sometimes we do)
I'm told that I automatically switch to it when I'm talking to family, even on the phone, and my friends find it hilarious
Not really the case in Romania, but some regions have specific words (regionalisms)
In 2005 in Brasov(city in Carpathian mountains in Romania) it snowed pretty hard and pretty much .I remember coming from school on the "tracks" left by cars in the snow and pretending im some sort of a train (i was like 6 year old) and there was always plently of snow for snowmans , castles , anything .Right now it barely snows once a year and next day is already melting .Climate change is as real as it can get
When I was a kid, a lot
I remember neighborhood was white all winter and there where many days with heavy snow
Since like when I started high school, snow becams quite scarce
In one winter (11th grade), there was almost no snow in winter, but there were like 3 days of snow at the end of March
This is how it was in my hometown though
Different regions might be completely different in terms of weather, since Romania has a great variety of relief, and the mountains king of cut NS through the middle, so different global currents can influence some regions more than others
In London it’s rare if we see snow once a year, it used to snow WAY more though
In western Romania it can snow from November to April and the snow sticks for days when it happens
However in total I’d say we have around 20 days of snow / year
Currently living in Dublin where last winter we had just a few snowflakes once that didn’t stick anyway
Yes, some times even during spring/ early summer (this year it snowed in april)
When I was a kid I remember the first snow would fall somewhere in November and we'd have snow on the ground for weeks, maybe months
Now it's basically cycles: it snows now, we have snow for a week, then it gets hotter and it melts, then it snows again etc
It's insane when you think about it
When I was a kid it used to snow quite often every winter but in the last years I've barely seen any snow
Last year's winter was basically a colder autumn in my town
It's sad to hear kids these days getting excited for winter to play with snow and stuff but not getting the chance to experience it
No one has that  over here maybe some tattoos here and there but other than the occasional teen with 3 piercings in his lip you don't really see anyone wearing any
And in the workplace it depends but usually you don't even ask for permission to wear them you just don't wear them from the start
Depends on the workplace
I believe it's more strict the closer you get to direct public interaction and also on the prestige/class level of the job
In everyday life though I'd say they're fairly accepted especially in the educated youth bubble, but there are still plenty of conservative (usually elderly) people that might stare or comment on them
>women here tend to be on the more decorated side
This is how I'll describe myself from now on in English
I imagine this is true in our kind of countries
In Germany for instance, I was examined by doctors with neck tattoos
And almost everyone in my lab has a piercing somewhere other than the "normal" place
And I've been to science conferences in Belgium/Netherlands/Canada and a lot of people even older have a lot of piercings and/or tattoos
I guess that in some fields, in some places, it doesn't matter so much how someone decides to decorate themselves
Same in Romanian
This, here is the correct way
Not great
But there are more and more atheists/agnostics among younger generations
I was in a huge scandal back in my late teens because my cousin found out I'm an atheist that supports the pro-choice movement and then she told almost everyone in the family
That sucked
The younger generations are generally ok with it, but if an older person hears that you're an atheist, they'll either say that you are dumb and should reconsider your choices, or they outright say that you'll burn in hell
If I'm not mistaken, Romania has the smallest percentage of atheists in all of the countries from the European Union
My country is still super religious so claiming to be an atheist in looked down upon
However, there are quite a few people that are atheist/agnostic, but mentioning it will come with a lecture from any old lady that hears you
well i'm an agnostic
what i can say is that the younger people won't care about it and the older people will find it extremely weird
when i told my parents that i'm one they didn't say anything, since my dad is an atheist and my mom isn't religious at all, but i'd imagine that that wouldn't be the case in most families
Here in Romania Grandmothers act like Atheists are the bane of existance
spawn of the devil
mothers just don't accept it as a real thing
In the cities no one gives one
In the smaller towns or especially the countryside you are considered a little bit of a jerk, as there are very little atheists around here
People are ok with preferring Pepsi over Coca Cola in Norway
Oh same here, I bet those statistics are overly inflated because most Romanians are non-practising ot closeted atheists
In big cities people don’t really care (at least Bucharest)
I assume that most people of my age are not religious until it’s proven wrong
Most would probably identify as Orthodox but most probably don’t care
Or do we
I still believe those stats are overly inflated because it includes non practising, if they asked if they practised it would be a whole different fish food
I know that in bigger cities most people don't care because they are populated by more and more younger people
But in smaller cities like my hometown or villagers things are pretty bad
I live in Iasi most of the time so I don't have to deal with fanatics all the time like I used to
Two years ago, people forced the goverment to start a referendum in order to change the marriage definition in the Constitution because it was kinda "vague". The definition was something like:"marriage is the union between two people" so they wanted to be change to:"marriage is the union between man and a woman". LBGT marriages are not even legal here but people are crazy
Would that make LGBT marriages technically legal
Hmm
No, maybe, Idk
If you remember that referendum was a big circus
He ..... talks
like
this
We're not even sure he knows he won the november elections, probably preparing for his speech right now
He speaks way too slow
Like waaaaaaaaay too slow
We usually make fun on how slow he speaks and thats it
But jokes about our past and current prime ministers
Oh boy
Our last prime minister was a lady that she didn't know how to speak proper romanian, she said that Pristina was the capital of Montenegro, she though that the Pope was orthodox etc
Our current one is a guy who likes to dance veeeery weird (youtube
com/watch
v=fHScwoOHKrQ)
Sorry for my english
The fact that he speaks very very slowly, and his dumb looking grin
Talks
Like
This
Also a few years ago there was this popular meme with him eciting a plane with cool sunglasses on a national holiday and he looked badass
Now a days when dragnea was a leader everyone was saing m*ie dragnea
In Romania, our president, Klaus Iohannis, is named the "ficus" because he talks very very slow and he is quite inactive
But he have been having a lot of hilarious phrases like:"Ha Ha Ha"(told very slow and ironically for express a bad joke) or "Ghinion"(bad luck), as a response of a question about his houses(6 houses
In general, he is well-known for his slowness:)))
She said Pristina is the capital of Montenegro not Kosovo though
Hahah i made the same mistake
Damn
Fats*
Well, depends on the language around the word
In Romanian, the name is Budapesta, with an s sound
In English, I just pronounce it Budapest, also with an s sound
It's in the same way that București is Bucharest in English, which sounds very different, but I still use Bucharest when speaking in English
The rule I usually follow is to use the rules of the language I'm speaking when the name is translated, not the rules of the original language
For example, when speaking French, I would say Allemagne, not Deutschland or Germany
In Romanian we say Budapesta, Boo-da-pes-ta
The a are as in Mario
I mean, if this is instant magic we're talking about, then Russian, Japanese and some Scandinavian language or Chinese or hindi or Arabic
Cuz there's no way I'm learning all that without instant magic
I'd like Dutch because it's cool
Bulgarian because whenever I go through Bulgaria I have to argue with border guards that most of the time don't speak English
And Swedish to be able to understand some of the shit my mate sends to me
Vietnamese, an old man from the USA lives across the street
The second would be German bc I want to dress like Adolf, go to the center of Bucharest and yell Guess who is back traitors (Romania changed sides during ww2) and the final one would be ancient Chinese so I  can speak and the Eastern European security systems (Old ladies who spy on you ) could not conceive that the can not understand what I am saying
I'm surprised that not many people chose chinese(whichever one's spoken more, mandarin
) First of all it's incredibly hard to learn so you'd skip alot of effort, a huge fraction of the globe speaks it, and at the same time they don't speak english unlike india
Plus there's lots of business to be done there
Other than that probably Russian, due to the constant contact with russian people while playing video games, and their culture in general
They're also english averse
And i'm torn between either german or spanish or japanese
This comes with the caveat that i already know english french and romanian
We didnt have many monuments but those that were
Were destroyed and replaced with monumets of the heros of December 1989
Well, most of them were removed
Unfortunately, I was born 15 years after the Revolution, so I could only see them in photos
However, most of them were removed in '89, and other monumenrs were built in a hurry in their place
Now we have a statue of an impaled potato in the middle of Bucharest
Happy cake day
On the sub page, there should be 3 dots on the right upper side
Those open a menu, you would want to go to "Change user flair" and there choose what you want
That's it if you're using the app
You're welcome
they all sounds very good imo
How are you supposed to know which table is that
Going from uk pints to the small lab-like glasses people drink in Koln was really weird, it took me some time to get used to
I don't abandon my beers
All the police officers in Romania wear hand guns, when on duty
Machine guns and stuff only for special police forces
There's armed cops at airports and as response units in Romania, but that's about it
Even this much feels too much to me tbh
"Road is road" Cyclists are looked down on by drivers because they "didn't go to driving school, no license, they don't know the struggle of traffic". Drivers often yell at you to cycle on the sidewalk, most of them don't use the signal when turning and there are often collisions
Also hitting one of the many potholes at 30km/h on a city bike would send you walking to the nearest bike shop
In Romania we have paths on sidewalks built just in electoral campaign they promised a better bike infrastructure but i think we will never see a romanian go to work with his bike rather than his car
I start to see a little bit of movement in this area but i am not optimistic
I live in Netherlands and the infrastructure here is pretty good
Sure, there's always room for improvement, but the bike almost always has priority over cars and even pedestrians
On the other hand, in my native country the whole infrastructure is a joke
There are a few paths in the cities, but they look like they have been designed by people that never cycled before
Cycling in any Romanian major city is a very dangerous activity
In the smaller cities, there is no traffic so it's safe, the only problem is that the roads are full of potholes
My city keeps trying to promote cycling but it's not built with cycling in mind and on top of that there are a lot of people who leave their brain in the passenger seat when driving
Have heard the following way too much: "iF I sEe a bIKe On mY rOaD I kilL". This comes from otherwise mentally healthy people
Usually me and my brother lock ourselves in one room so we don’t have contact with them until the launch/dinner is ready
If my parents are not home when the rest of the family visits then I have to talk to them and make sure they don’t stare too much at everything in my house or garden
Those gatherings are quite fun in my opinion
We gather around every weekend or
every day because we live very close of each other  and are very close
We don't have family gatherings
My mom's side and dad's side don't even know each other
We've never gathered more then one family visiting another
We all live in the same city so idk, we've just never been close I guess
There is also the uncle who has to get carried home because he can't walk anymore from all the alcohol
At some nouns, the plural desinence, and the definite article are all "-i"s so, for the word "copil"(child) for example we have "copii" as the indefinite plural form and "copiii" as the definite plurar form
In the latter, the first "i" is the one from the singular root of the word, the second is the plural  desinence and the third is the definite article
To these three we can add a fourth one, but it will be considered a seperate word, but in pronounciation it will be pronounced as one, so we can have the sentence:
"Copiii-i făceau micul dejun
" which means
"His kids were making him breakfast
In this example, the last "i" is a pronominal adjective and means "his".
The swear words in Romanian
Let me give you a few examples
Futu-ți morții mă-tii
= Fuck your mother's dead relatives
Băgami-aș pula în rasa ta
= Introducing my dick into your race
Du-te dracu

•Double negatives: “Nu vreau nimic
” (I don’t want nothing)
•I don’t know the name for this, but we double the indirect object “complement indirect”: “I-am dat lui Andrei o ciocolată.” (I gave Andrew a chocolate to him
) instead of “Am dat lui Andrei o ciocolată.” (I gave Andrew a chocolate
•We don’t have a word for “nap”. Instead we use “un pui de somn” (a baby sleep) or simply say “somn de după-amiază” (afternoon sleep)
Not a sentance and not my first language, but in Hungarian 8
15 is “quarter nine” and 8
45 is “three quarters nine” and that makes no sense whatsoever in any other language as far as I know
Azi la prânz o să mă sinucid
Să-l ia dracu de viitor perfid
M-am săturat de lumea asta fără rimă;
O să fentez poeții, o să comit o crimă
Pe care n-o s-o ancheteze nimeni niciodată -
Cea mai proastă crimă comisă vreodată.
Today at lunch i'm going to kill myself
Fuck the perfidious future
I'm fed up with this rhymeless world;
I'm going to trick the poets, I'm going to commit a crime
That no one will never investigate -
The dumbest crime comitted ever
The dumb parts are: we put the adverb at the end of the sentence , we have the special characters (ă ,â, î , ş , ţ)
You should also add that the plural word "copii" with the accent placed differently (first syllable instead of last) is a different word, meaning 'copies' (i.e. photocopies)
Aren't we all copies of our parents
Yes, but by the logic of “half nine”, 8
45 should be “quarter nine” not the other way around
I get “half nine”, but the fact that the quarters are reversed is baffling to me
Fuck that's deep
I understand “half nine” as being half an hour before nine
As 8
45 is “quarter to nine” in most languages , as in “a quarter before nine”, by my logic 8
45 should be “quarter nine” not “three quarters nine”
Since no Romanian commented, I'll do it
Those are super basic, and almost everyone knows them

That's why I love danish culture !
it isnt like british council
it is just like a normal high school anyone with good enough grades can enter
you can go on the Italian section but it also has normal classes like every other high school

Donno but one of the funniest memories I have and keep involves a drunk Brit, a yellow chicken costume and rain
In Bucharest city centre
It was just
priceless
I could write a short novel describing the whole scene
The apogee was when he decided he should give up the costume and just walk naked
Do you think it is easy to remove a yellow chicken costume when you are drunk
IT IS NOT
It takes a lot of skills
Skills that are altered by alchool
All in all I don't know about the balconies but we do keep an eye on Brits just to be sure they don't die or hurt themselves
I read a couple of years ago that this is a very common cause of death for young american coeds during spring break
Yet it's not because they jump and fail to land in the pool, it's due to hanging over the window and waiving at all the other coeds hanging over the window right after checking in the hotel
Some go to far and fall to their deaths
Normal conversations: English > Romanian
Swearing: English <<< Romanian
English is OK, I'm happy I can speak it
The only thing that kind of bothers me is the "lack of expressions".
I think Romanian has a lot more expressions
And we have bigger and smaller ones too
I'm watching right now and American show and a Romanian one in parallel and it's just so striking how many small and big expressions the Romanian guys use and how little the Americans use
It's a little bit like in Romanian people make reference to things constantly, while in English you do you just sometimes
But I may be completely wrong
After all, I'm not native so maybe there's this big chunk of the language that I missed completely
That's exactly how I feel
English is fine most of the time, but I can express things in a much more interesting way in Romanian

It's viewed pretty badly from here
Ahh Romania
I love it and hate it
However the discrimination in Western Europe is so bad that you have to go to the point of saying your from Moldova and not Romania
I wish people would learn we are nice european brothers
From my country it's seen as corrupted
Oh yeah and our prime minister is literally illiterate
Man FUCK GYPSIES making us look bad >:(

It reminds me of a saying, we all use at some point
Beautiful country, shame it's inhabited
That is actually good to hear
We love you guys
Long live Serbia
Screw Albania
I'd love to hear both
both
Believe me we Romanians hate gypsies even more than other countryes
They stole my fucking bike when I was 9

"Be careful that romanians don't steal your stuff, keep it locked"
Sorry, but this is so lame and ignorant
Wait people do that
I'm shooketh
Holy shit besides the long hair this is exactly my friend’s story
His mom left to work there to help pay the house they bought with a loan in swiss francs(wich grew in value over the years so they were really screwed )
So after a couple months his mom left his romanian dad for a rich guy in the netherlands and then got my friend and his brother to live with her and their new stepbrother
He got so fat i didn t even recognised him when he came to visit
That s his life now smokes weed everyday :))
hahah
Us Romanians don't really got roads so I guess we'll have to give em to u
Well be glad you have someone to harvest your strawberries :))))
>they are only country that we border that we've never been to war with
Well
there was ww2
I really dont wanna ruin the fun but as much as we love you guys we kinda had some conflicts in the early 14th century when serbia as a vasal of ottoman empire fight alongside ottomans against wallachia,hungary and moldavia BUT THE LOVE IS STILL THERE
What about Agent 47 ?
about what
The parts about the language is true our language is mostly latin and slavic
The youth (this includes myself) is a mixed bag
On one hand you've got the people leaving the country (me ayyy) who are usually smart and worked to the bone in education
And on the other hand we've got the ones who smoke a lot, drink a lot, have parties and turn into cocalari later
Our youth right now is european and in the country non existant
It's shit here and if you ask a romanian immigrant in a higher sector they most certainly are going to tell you that we are not patreotic and it's a shit country lmao
God dag fra Romania btw :)
>we enevy you because we see how you are handling your government
I heard it is bad there in Serbia, but is it so bad that you are envious on US
I hate most of these things except for transylvania
A piece of advice, try the county of Sibiu and Brasov
Both of them have autro-hungarian/german influence :)
>and you have 24/7 stores everywhere

So that's why Pewdiepie was making all those Romanian jokes back then
Makes sense now
I have green eyes and no round cheeks :(
Your Labour doesn't feel great lately either :)
what's wrong with it
In Bucharest we have almost no stray dogs left
A child got killed by a pack of stray dogs so the goverment got them all
Not sure about rural areas tho
> gypsies come from there
I'm pretty sure they come from India, Hans
Soooo
who wants your land
Where does this come from
Because we are tired to help them
Keep giving them money
They come back here and build "nice looking" [houses]
We have a team
Never ever did i think about Romania having an ice hockey team
> 10% in Bulgaria vs 3% in Romania
If only
Gypsies are vastly undercounted on Romanian censuses; most independent observers estimate that they comprise 10% of the population in Romania as well, and roughly 20% of the youngest generation
omg
Fine with me, I can't say no to shots
Neat
Same
Oh and how do I add Romania to my name
They stole my phone when I was 8 lmao
No we don't. I don't hate them
Neither my friends or my family
I don't care if people call us gypsies
So be it
Whoever does that type of superficial racist comment is the one who should feel ashamed
Not me
You wrote really good
Shhhhhh, don't ruin this
I would prefer being called a vampire over a communist any day
You also hate world class gymnasts, football and tennis players
You forgot about central Europe as well(slovenia slovakia croatia)
People from the East are good as long they do the jobs the western don’t want to do
Yup
I was thinking the same
Yeah and this sounds racist, I dont understand why the westerns can be so racists and xenophobic towards romanians and romani people but at the same time they are fighting against racism
In West Europe there are a lot of hypocrite people
Aparent
Not really
I don't know a word in hungarian amd most of the people I know don't either
And you think that Bulgarian numbers are more precise
For what we know there could be as many as 18%.
Haha then the eternal city is full of gypsies haha so funny
Go to the subreddit main page, press on the 3dots in the top Right corner and press add flair
Still i dont blame him or serbia till his final moments at least he was a loyal vassal  ,it is not our role to judge if what he did was right or no, he believed in his actions and motives and fought for them and his country till the very end and that should make him a hero in my opinion
Damn
Nice
Buna idee, ii respect
When I said "US" I just capitalised the pronoun "us" but whatever
Ah shit I stopped reading after the first sentence
Whole Germany is full of Romanians workers because they work for shit salaries and because they are hardworking
Stop being xenophobic
I don't remember them but I think one of them was him breaking his 1mil play button and then saying "Here, take this Romanian
" or something like that
I get what you are saying
But most people don't care
We have a hockey team
Neah
they understand and speak Hungarian
It is just a matter of choice
My grandparents were fluent in Hungarian but they only used it ocasionally with Hungarian citizens who really can't speak our language :)
Thanks
It's not perfect, but it's pretty good
>westerns can be so racists and xenophobic towards romanians and romani people but at the same time they are fighting against racism
In West Europe there are a lot of hypocrite people
Dude, is like saying " Our country do not has a very good opinnion about USA, there are so many niggars there". This is pretty ignorant, xenophobic, racist and disgusting, I do not care that the people from West do not know much about Romania, being an ignorant is not an excuse
Yes, but at this point Pălincă has also become a romanian word
We have to be the best at something

Your Romanian is going great
Much better than my failed trying in learning Dutch :))
>majority of encounters people have with gypsies is negative can you really blame them for mistrusting and disliking that
Is not an excuse that they had negative encounters with the romani people
Saying that you have a bad perception of Romania because it is full of "gypsies" is racist, disgusting and ignorant, especially coming from a westerner
and counting
Felicitări pentru progrese
You are correct
People see Transilvania as a homogenous part when in reality it is very diverse both culturally and ethnically
I have seen people sitting at the same table speaking to eachother one in Romanian and the other replying in Hungarian very natural and fluent
As you can imagine it was crazy for an outsider like me
But it made me realize how beautiful a moment like that can be and how much it hurts when a small group of both Romanians and Hungarians are ruining this with hate speech
I suppose it is hard to be objective and we all have had different good or bad experiences with other nationalities or minorities
The easiest way is to put a label "good" or "bad" and ignore everything else
I am sad
I've read the comment thread and I was thinking *"should I label everyone as being racists towards gipsies and ignorants regarding us"*? It would be easier
But I know that one person's opinion does not reflect the majority
And even if the majority has a wrong opinion, that still doesn't matter because among them there are people worth more than the majority :)
>words in my mouth and embar
Why do you take this so personal
Jesus Christ, grow up
Just made a point on how the western people are hypocrite because they can be racist towards gypsies but at the same time they are fighting against racism towards other ethnical groups
Romania was given as an example, because this subject is about Romania
I haven’t seen a Romanian comment yet
but no I don’t think so for us
We are very different compared to Italian/Spaniards/Portuguese
I feel we’re closer to Slavs & Balkan people
I’m not fluent but all I know is that Italian, Spanish and Portuguese are the close ones and that the other two are a little bit more different
Really
Maybe depends on which area you're from
I've always seen cultural similarities mostly with Spaniards and Italians
Living abroad and having co-workers from other latin-based countries felt like an inner circle
Disagree completely with the Slavs part
Oh that’s cool
So do you know any Italian or Portuguese without actually studying it since the languages are similar
I’m not fluent in Italian, but I’m studying it :D
They are
Italian is the easiest Romance language for me to understand without actually knowing it
Slovenian is also beautiful
For me it was completely different
I didn't get along with Spaniards or the French
I'm in Germany now and most of my friends are Slavs
We don't like admitting it, but we are a profoundly Balkan culture
Yes we get along well with Spaniards and Italians because we do share some broad cultural traits, but that is true for all of southern Europe
Our culture is closer to Balkans and Turkey than it is to Western Europe
I grew up Romania (Brasov) but now live in the US
I hangout with a lot of Serbs and Russians and our cultures are very similar
I’ve met Italians and think our cultures are more similar but cant say the same about Spaniards and French
Me too, I also feel we are a lot like Italians, but we definitely have some common cultural ground with Serbs and Bulgarians
It is in in Eastern Europe though
As someone with an Italian dad and Romanian mum, you are right
I’ve lived in EU & US now and while in other European countries you see more of a mix of nations
In the US you’re more prone to meet Russians than Spaniards and if you lump those together of course Ro will be more similar to Ru than to US
The overall environment has a huge impact
When I lived in NL, it was very hard to see similarities with my Ru colleagues and that’s because in Europe you already have a big common foundation (which, if you have that with everyone, makes you go into cultural specifics, which is why I felt closer to Italians, for example)
You don’t have that in the US so it’s natural to see Slavs & Russians culturally closer here
Totally disagree
Im a romanian in the US as well and romanians here usually stay away from slavs as well as other romanians haha and mingle more with americans and hispanics
I think we'd like to stay in the east too
I mean, we got buddies over here
Câmpulung was one of the first capitals of Romania
My city of Buzău, Romania has more natural landmarks than historical, but:
Our city hall is a palace in the city downtown, called the Comunal Palace
Our coat of arms had a phoenix / dragon on it because the city was destroyed by fires multiple times but it was rebuild every time (like a phoenix, birth from its ashes)
Idk if Iași,,my city, has any ither landmarks that are older
Im pretty new in the city
But I think I can say we have the Culture Palace ,a building like a castle with some museums in it
It looks so cool on the outside
Here s a photo of it:
Here in Braşov we have the Black church wich is black because of a fire that ravaged the city a long time ago and the huge walls surrounding the city and the Tâmpa mountain with the big bold ***BRAŞOV***  sign
Hollywood style
And the big citadel on the hill overlooking the city .... Oh and the museum right next to the church etc ... etc

In romanian its "ciocan". Pretty hard sounting tbh
We have ciocan for a usual hammer, cio like the cho from chocolate and can like toucan
For sledgehammer we have baros
I doubt mine will pass: ciocan (pronounced ch-o-k-an)
Similar in Romanian - 'ciocan', would probably sound like 'chukan'.
Its molot not molotok
To me the kalapacs sounds way more badass
The other one sounds like food for people without teeth
About 15 euros
I make like 400 euros a month
It's not much, but I manage
I could go for 50 euros, but I'd have to give up some food
I pay a bunch for gluten free food because I have celiac
I bought myself a car 2 years ago with what I saved in 3 years
I can give my example
I earn about 650 € per month
That is the salary after tax
I live in Bucharest which is the country's capital
I fully support myself for a few years now without any money from my parents, friends or other family members
I save up on average 100 € per month
This is an average as sometimes I save more and sometimes due to unexpected expenses or expenses higher than usual, in some months I cannot save money
The northeners will eat leek, drink țuică, bake [mucenici] for 9 March, kill each other with Katanas and speak in perfect simple but otherwise standard Romanian
While the Southerners will eat [poale-n-brâu] drink horincă, bake [Sfințișori] for 9 march, kill each other with axes and speak in a  Ukrainian accent
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man
happens often, did it quite a bit after clubbing when i was younger lol (romania + uk)
I like it a bit softer
If it takes 9 minutes for it to be al dente I let it boil for 10
I prefer them soft, al dente seems a bit raw for me
Soft
It just tastes better to me
That we are not a third world communist country
The fact that there are other places besides Transylvania
Well, I have been a tour guide and most of the people that visit Romania are surprised that we are not a shithole like Somalia or something

In Romania homemade distilling is very popular, it's a tradition (unfortunately)
If it would become illigal probably we start a revolution
Maybe professionals, not average joggers
Romanian language it's as spanish on this matter
Each letter will always have same pronounciation (exception is C/G followed by I or E when we pronounce like ChanGe , otherwise like in CoGnitive) so such contest , as you figured out for spanish, wouldn't make much of a sense
I've only head of spelling bees from American TV shows
Never seen such a thing IRL
Answering the edit: When I was young, we would learn to write and read in the first year of school (age 7) and then have spelling tests ("dictări") until fourth year (age 10)
They've added another year of school at age 6 so I don't know how things have changed
I saw spelling bee american shows but i never knew what they were called
I found them really entertaining
In Romania we don't spelling bees because the language is phonetic
It can vary by accent though, depending on region, like the word "pe" (P eh) being spoken as "pi" (p ee) or "pă" ( the "ă" is spelled like the "u" in but) or the word "ceva" (tch eh-v  ah, v always spelled like in the word "vowel") spelled as "șieva" (sh ee eh - v ah) but once you recognize the accent it is easy to realize the proper spelling so it's rarely a problem unless you encounter a really heavy and regional accent with lots of regional words
But the language itself, when spoken properly, with no accent, is very exact with it's spelling, and even with an accent (because most accents aren't that heavy) it is quite easy to understand how someone speaks and change the consonants and vowels properly, because accents are quite regular in what sounds are pronounced different from the norm
We don't have such a thing
Even more, our language is so phonetic that we don't even have a word for 'spelling'. In the rare cases where we don't know how to spell something (a foreign name for example), we use the phrase "cum se scrie/how do you write it" or "spune pe litere/say it letter by letter"
>you always know how to write a word by listening to it
For all romance leanguages is the same rule
Look at the Word "lup" for exemple (wolf) even if you are an italian you knwo how to spell it
Same for Romania
Our language is phonetic, so there's really no point in spelling bees
Very few words are spelled weirdly and most of them aren't of Romanian origin
Mostly new foreign
Yeah probably Italian would be a better analogy for Romanian
Maybe with a tiny bit of room for confusion, for example some diphtongs might get confused with others ("ia" with "ea", "ie" with "e", "ua" with "oa" etc), but not spelling-bee-worthy in any way lol
I find all those variations you pointed out pretty interesting, funny how Spanish is always well known for the easy and consistent pronunciation, but then in the opposite direction it doesn't quite work the same
>is it the same for french though
I think so
I said that bcs when I was still in school a lot of french words were spelled similar like in romanian
It may by also because we barrowed an enormous amount of words from them, maybe a FRENCH PERSON  will be sweet and explain to us how really is
Popular vote, if in the first round of elections no candidate gets more than 50% of the votes, than a second round is held with only the 2 most voted candidates from the first round and the one who gets more than 50% of the votes win
Case 1: in the first round of voting:
•candidate A gets 53% of votes
•candidate B gets 24%
•candidate C gets 13%
• other candidates get the remaining 10%
In this case candidate A wins
No second round of elections is needed
Case 2: in the first round of voting:
•candidate A gets 42% of votes
• candidate B gets 28%
•candidate C gets 26%
• other candidates get the remaining 4%
In this case candidate A and B go into the second round of elections and whoever gets more than half the votes in that round is the winner
Same here but I don’t know if the more than 50% rule applies
To win from the first round, a candidate has to get 50% __of all registered voters__.
It does
You are correct, thanks for pointing it out, Til :)
Yes and no
Depends a lot on the family
In my case, my parents don't badger either me or my brother to settle down
I do have some relatives that "encourage" me to date/get married cuz I'm a girl
And in our larger family people sometimes say that my bro is a big hulky man so he'll be fine by himself and I, the cute tiny woman, will not
But my parents understand that I'll be fine, while he will not (big hulky crybaby that's what he is)
They only insisted for my brother to buy an apartment when it was cheaper, because it sounded like a good investment to them
I have a lot of friends my age (30) that recently married
I don't really feel any kind of pressure about this
Except from a small (unhappy) group of people
Romanians are in general opportunists
We have this mentality of "pushing through the crowd to get ahead". So I feel that most people understand that one person wants a family and another wants a career
As a woman I have been incuraged by family, friends and my friends' families to settle down, especially since I have been in a serious relationship for a few years now
I got comments such as "even if it doesn't work out, you have to try" to "What else would you do with your life" to "you will die sad and alone, none will want to take you when you are pass 30 and you will only have to choose from men with kids and an alcohol addiction". My grandma cried when she found out, because she "fears she doesn't know what will come of me".
So yeah, no pressure
I think my parents are still hopeful, but I am legit forbidden from telling some of my relatives about my plans, because they are very conservative and would go crazy
* Transylvania: Slow shepherds with an ubercomplex
* Banat: Rich and arrogant people who blame immigrants for all the problems
* Oltenia: Stupid peasants who talk fast
* Bucharest: Arrogant city people who consider everyone outside Bucharest a peasant
* Moldavia: Alcoholics with funny accents
* Vaslui: Axe totting,wife beating,alcoholic rednecks and rapists
* Szekelyland: Hungarian separatists
* Dobrogea: Fish eating beach muslims
*Stereotypes about Romanians from different regions:*
Transylvanians, Oltenians and Moldovans are probably the ones who get the most stereotypes and jokes:
**Moldovans** \- they drink too much, especially the ones in the Republic of Moldova, which is known for its wine
Also, they always pronounce E (‘’eh’’) as I (‘’ee’’), again, especially the ones in the Republic
There is also a joke about that
**Transylvanians** \- they talk too slowly and sometimes are also slow in general
Otherwise, they don’t really have stereotypes, they are seen rather well
**Oltenians** \- I’ve heard many say they’re stupid (that’s just a stereotype, ok
Also, some people say they think they are too *şmecheri* (I don’t think that word has got a proper English translation, but it means something like thinking you’re very cool or badass)
Other regions also have stereotypes, but are not being talked about so much:
**Muntenians** \- some say they are also *şmecheri*, maybe not quite as much as Oltenians
**Bucharesters** \- too arrogant
**Banatians** \- see themselves as the head of the country and don’t like being called Transylvanians
**Bucovinians** \- they don’t like being called Moldovans

Can confirm
Get out you peasants
Vaslui is like ultimate Moldavia
I agree from Transylvania
I hate being in a hurry
Can't confirm
Me and my bănățeni friends are poor
Person from bucharest: Oh you are from Clooojj, get away you filthy peasant
Of course we blame immigrants for all the problems when 5/10 people in Banat are from Oltenia (and , as you described them , are just stupid) .

True, Maramureş and Satu-Mare should be classified separately
Yes
But they are catholics and write in latin alphabet
Shit
I need to step my game up
In all seriousness though, your country is really not a backwards hellhole, it’s one of the most civilized countries in europe
Maramureş: the northern part of Transylvania, called Moroşeni (Morosheni), have a different aproach towards things
The Oseni are the best scythe workers in the country, one individual being able to manually cut a hilltop full of grass in a day
Hard working people, love *horincă and slănină.*
Well civilized can be looked at from two perspectives
Civilized compared to the others, or civilized compared to your own moral compass
Since I said “in europe” I compared it to the others
We should all aspire for something better, but it’s good consolation sometimes to remember that *it could be worse* .

So I live in the UK now and I know the reasons for having separate taps are mostly historical and don't apply any more
But damn i hate them so much
I can only wash my hands with freezing cold or boiling hot water
And even worse is that i have sensistive teeth on top of that, they don't like either of the two temperatures
I bought a thingy to connect the two taps and mix the water - best 15 quid ever spent
You can find those toilets in Romania as well, usually in older buildings
The only popular Romanian server i know of is called mc
gamster
org
Less cars parked on sidewalks
If think in Romania there is this super dumb mentality that if you can afford a car, you should buy one
And if your kids are grown up, they need cars too
And your wife needs a car
And you need a special car for work
You don't use all of them all the time
Some cars may be used only once or twice a year, but you need to own them
I just wished people used bicycles more and that we would have more bike lanes and less parked cars
A functional education system
Or at least slightly below average by Western EU standards
Many many Autobahns
Many roads with 0 potholes
I wish our Carpathian mountains would have the same good infrastructure as the Alps
Well kept beaches like in Spain, France or Portugal
The country has everything - 4 seasons, mountains, beaches but corruption is prevalent
I wish the vibrancy of London in big cities but I know that will never happen
Mortgage interest rates like in the west not 6%!!
Nice to have more atheism like in the nordics
I see english is pretty common in the UK
Would be nice to have it here as a second official language
If it’s your only option to recycle it becomes a PITA very quickly
I don't remember a time or a place where I didn't pay contactless in the city
IDK, in Bucharest some areas of high-density appartment blocks are quite nice because they have lots of greenery and the buildings are reasonably spaced out
Some of the newer built stuff is much more on the "concrete jungle" side
I pay 10% out of my gross income to healthcare and I have never been to a public hospital or take a day of medical leave in the last 12 years since I've been employed
If it were opional I would opt out in a heartbeat, especially since my employer ofers a premium private health insurance that is far superior to the public one
Edit for clarity: I am not against free access to healthcare for everyone
The healtcare system in my country is ineficient, corrupt and provides poor quality services so in dire need of restructuring
I have to pay for both the mandatory 10% to the public healt insurance and an additional 300 € to private health insurance because I cannot rely on the public one
I understand that my 10% does not go towards my healthcare, but it does go in a badly managed system that does not really ofer decent care even to the ones who need it most
There is no easy fix to this situation and I do not have a solution but it is frustrating to be paying twice for the same service knowing fully that part of your money go into a badly managed corrupt system where people who are in dire need of it have to slip an envelope into someone's pocked or wait months just to get an appointment
Damn, I pay more for the mandatory one in Romania than he does
It's 10% of gross salary
Healthcare is very much not free
Doctors and pills don't fall out of the sky and they don't work for free
It's not that I do not or will not have health issues, I cannot rely on the public health insurance because the services are so bad and the waiting lists are outrageously long
My mother needed a CT scan with contrast asap due to problems with her kidneys
The public hospital put her on a 6+ months waiting list and told here there's nothing to be done
If she would have waited that long without propper treatment she would have been in dialysis now
I put her on my private health insurence and everything got solved in less than a week
If the entire healtcare system would be restructured and I could confortably go into a hospital without expecting filth and having to handout bribes Ibwould be all for it but as it stands it's of minimal health to everyone
I'm not saying to scrap the public healthcare system entirely, but there should be caps based on income and risk
Besides the heltcare system in romania is dirty, corrupt and ineficient, most people who can afford to , avoid it like the plage and go to private clinics paying out of pocket or through private healt insurance
All things considered I don't think it's fair for me  to be paiying a masive amout of money every month
twice
Renovation can be hard and the roads small, but then the cities tend to be small so you don't need a car
But the build quality is very good on the buildings
Tourism can be a problem too if the city has some interesting historical monuments
Wait, do you guys have different arguments for it
I'm joking though but that is the case in Romania most of the time  when we are talking about an election between two candidates
EU didn't necessarily help you get out of poverty
It was the mere access that allowed more foreign investments into the country (I hope that's what you were hinting at)
Say it after me: the private sector
You have your multinationals in the big cities and factories in the industrial parks
If the governments of the last 30 years would have done their part, Romania would have easily been the economic powerhouse in this side of Europe
As it should be
According to the EU, we lose 15% of our gdp yearly on corruption
That's 38 billion euros annually
And to think we have actually been moving forward, developing further, every year
In spite of this shit
Imagine if that loss of 15% would be 3% like in Denmark, 4% like in Germany, or 6% like in Belgium
The first decent government we will get will show how much better we can get
Though I don't think this election will bring it, I can't but notice how little things show that we're actually heading there
It seems inevitable, almost unavoidable
One of those little things is the decent and/or very good mayors that were elected this year: in Resita, Tulcea, Alba Iulia, Targu Mures, Bacau, Oradea, Timisoara, Brasov, Bucharest, to name the big cities
About 50% are PNL and 50% from USRPLUS
They're good work will do on the long term what Bolojan did for years in Oradea
Except now there will be several Oradea-like examples
That's why my guess is that a greater change is bound for 2024
Meanwhile, yeah, like you say: I can only hope
I think that those mayors will in the future be seen as the sign of the times, as generations are changing anyway and now the ones born after 89 (people born in the year 1990 are gone through college and now are mariied or have kids; they're entering they're 30s, which is crazy), are starting to be more numerous and have a bigger say
Somebody born in 2002 who grew up in the social media age has the right to vote in 2020
That's crazy to me
Bribing police officers, no one seems to do it anymore :(
[Dragobete] it is similar to Valentine's Day but celebrated on 24th february
Sadly I don't know all the traditional stuff they do during this holiday but i'm planning to celebrate it again more or less since I never cared about Valentine's Day
This still happens here and it is called the same, but in Romanian
Girls know that they are going to be soaked and put their phones and watches on a table or somewhere else
Same thing here,only in leanguage that tradition remained, in order to salute a woman we say "saru'mâna" which means "i kiss the hand""
Dragobete was never a national tradition, but a very regional one
It actually took off when some wanted to find a local alternative to Valentine's day
"Reviving" Dragobete is more of an inovation than a tradition
Umm, where exactly
I've literally never heard of that in AR or TM
In Alba, more specifically Ciugud
But I do think it is a matter of the village community
We also have villages where this tradition is not more respected but we try not to forget too many
I think it's [Treceți batalioane române Carpații] a military song written in WW1
It's about the liberating of Transylvania and it's the song that the Army marches on and it's played on our National Day military parade
Also, it's that patriotic song we're all taught at school as 'every Romanian should know it'.
Hora Unirii - It's about Romanians coming to dance and celebrate the Union between the Romanian states
It also sounds amazing
&#x200B;
Here is a link - [
I am sure not everyone agrees but I think this [Made in Romania-Ionut Cercel] is the song that should represent Romania
We'd have loved to say a certain song by Ozone but it belongs to Moldova
> and actually meant to calls for the different German states/regions to unify and work together
That's the first time I've heard this interpretation although it makes sense if you're really into that mindset
I have to admit whenever I hear "Deutschland über alles" my mind immediately jumps to a whole different scenario
The Southern region of Romania is called Muntenia, which would translate to something like "Mountain Country" I guess but it's a big ass plain with some hills in the north as you approach the mountains
Satu Mare, which translates to "Big Village" the point is, it is no longer a village, and it's one of the 50 biggest cities in Romania
We have Baia Mare, which means “the big bath tube” which is one of the furthest cities from Black Sea
City of pubes (Orașul de Floci)
No one lives there anymore and the word initially refered to a type of wool, time changed its meaning to a specific type of human hair
Braşov
it should be named Stalin again
No Icelanders are allowed, but that still opens it up for Greenland
Maybe it was new at that time
So Porto is just port
Creative name
They are not hills, they are called highlands
Sure, call them as you will, but they're not mountains
I agree
Unpopular opinion here: in the grand scheme of things, culture doesn't matter so much
I mean compared to the well-being of the people
And cultures and languages always change, get lost, get modified
I mean, my country's culture got changed so many times, it's bullshit to claim that what we have now is similar to what we had some years ago
And this has to do with the changing political landscape *and* with the people
Expecting people to "preserve" their culture by using it is a fallacy
Just think of some of the batshit crazy things that existed in some cultures 2-300 years ago
It was culture that didn't allow women to be anything more than baby making machines
It was culture that suppressed the gays
Just to be clear, this doesn't exclude the fun parts of certain cultures, however if you want to keep all traditions alive then you have to keep the bad things too, and if you want to keep traditions alive, but exclude the bad things, then you're proving my point that the times and the people enforce change
Culture, music, art in general have everything to do with the times we're living and the people we are
Expecting this to never change is bullshit
My thinking is that whatever people choose in terms of politics should regard the well being of their people, not of their traditions
>What are the specific processes that would allow this to happen under a EU state but not without it
This will happen regardless if we're part of the EU or not
Because people move around, see what others in other countries do/have and bring that knowledge back
And this was the process back in the day as well, but now it's on steroids because of planes and the internet
And unless you cut off the internet and close down the border, you can't stop this from happening
*The future is now old man
It was never "just a trade union". It's direction was political from day 1

I actually started sleeping and eating so much better during the pandemic
Waking up at 7 to get ready for work ( started at 9, commute alone took 1h:20m) meant I only got around 5-6 hours of sleep, since I just can't fall asleep earlier than 1AM
It also meant that even though we had 1h lunch break, lunch was from a food court (so a lot of fast food) and breakfast was whatever I could get from a pastry shop
Dinner was something quick because by the time I got back home it was 19:30 and I just didn't have any energy anymore
But with work from home, I took my life back
My sleep, my healthy eating habits
If I fall asleep at 2, I wake up at 8:30-9:00 feeling so, so rested and jump to work immediately, juggling reading mails and updates with making breakfast - which is a fun multitask
I also have time to try so many fun, new recipes - I still get that 1h of lunch break, but you can do so much in 1h! Dinner is the same
I wrap things up at 18:00, I have two whole free hours before dinner
And, all this is done together with a hubby
Cooking together, eating together, sleeping well on a mattress and pillows we invested in
I have all the time in the world during this period but that starts to make me depressed
I work from home now so I'm lucky to have the comfort of my house at hand
I can wake up even 30 mins before work, I have food in the kitchen, I can take a break from the screen and go lie in bed for 5 mins lol
If I had to physically go to office, I'd probably sleep less because I'd need more time in the morning, maybe rush or even skip breakfast, have a shittier lunch or spend more money on it
Back when I was in uni I probably had the shittiest lifestyle though hahah
Either working or thinking about working, eating fast so I wouldn't waste too much time, lots of all-nighters
A consistent 8 hour workday had been a godsend comparatively
One downside of all this is that I slowed down in a negative way too
Kinda like I lost my sense of time and structure
I'm less punctual and productive, I finish 3 tasks and I'm already tired lol
I have more free time that I can spend
As a freelancer, sometimes I have time, sometimes I don't. Depends on how much work I have to do that day
Some days I work 12 hours straight running on a sandwich and a coffee at most
Others I get to clean around the house and cook something
When I worked full time, I didn't have proper time for anything, because I was always exhausted
I worked in a crappy workplace culture where overtime was considered "the right thing to do" and we had many weekends ruined because we had to come work
It sucked
I find it's quite a mix in terms of my friends, some are overworked and exhausted, some are doing alright
In moldova 2 villages develop this tradition around the 60' when once every year they meet in one place and beat the shit out of each other, ofc in the past years the police intervene and the tradition became the villagers getting beat by police
There are two innovations I can think of, although they are new elements of existing celebrations:
**1
Eating “[fasole cu ciolan] (beans and smoked pork hocks) on National Day**
When Communism fell, the authorities decided to change the national day, from 23 August, the “*Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day*”, a celebration heavily associated with Ceaușescu and the communist regime, to 1 December, „[*Great Union Day*]
The celebrations of this new day included military parades, and with it, free giveaway of food to the public
Since the military was deployed, they served bowl of “fasole cu ciolan”, the stereotypical high-caloric military food
Through repetition, this meal was so associated with the national day, that people started cooking it at home for 1 December
Thus a culinary tradition was born where 3 decades ago there was none
**2
Eating “[Panettone] around Christmas**
“Panettone” is a typical December sweatbread from Lombardy, northern Italy
Italy host the largest Romanian diaspora in the world, with over 1 million Romanians having moved there in the 2000’s, most of them to the richer North
Winter holidays are a time when many of these emigrants return home to spend Christmas with the family, and “panettone” is sort of an ideal gift (delicious, not too expensive and can withstand the journey)
So in no-time it became a staple winter sweet, expanding the choice of sweets during winter time (Romania has its own older sweat-bread, shared with Moldova and Bulgaria, called "[cozonac]
Did you stab yourself
Iohannis
Now that the police is involved is a three-way,free for all i think years ago the guy who was in charge regarding the police force got suspended for ordering his mans a full out charge at the villagers
Not really a city, but [Odorheiu Secuiesc] - with a population of 35k and [96% ethnic Hungarian population] it definitely fits the bill
I mean, if you'd show me some of the architecture there, I wouldn't recognize it as our own
[Sibiu] does not look Romanian at all, I would say it looks more Austrian/German than anything else
Typical Romanian city would be something like [Craiova] I guess, where you have a mix of Communist architecture and Interwar period monuments/buildings
Interesting choice
I would say of the big cities, Cluj feels the most 'foreign', in that it feels kind of Central European
Most towns are typical though, anywhere in Wallachia and Moldova especially
Put your finger on a map and you have it
Thanks, communist systematization
Quite most of the cities from Transylvania/Banat/Crișana are like Cluj, so for someone from there, it does not feel that foreign
That means half of the country, lol
I think it is hard in Romania to name the typical Romanian town because every region has a different typical town in terms of architecture and stuff like that
ClUg fOrEiGn, dar dacă te duci prin Mănăștur sau piața Mărăști, cumperi aceleași petarde și țigări pe care le cumperi în orice alt oraș.
Dar na, cineva trebuia să confirme mema
Yeah fair, valid point
I'm not from Transylvania as you can tell
I suppose cities in the south and east also have more communist architecture and apartment blocks as a percentange of the whole place, which makes them feel more samey
Like not just the residential neighborhoods, but also city halls, theatres, train stations and other notable public builds are like that
Whereas cities in Transylvania feel more different from each other, like they have more individuality
Pai normal, doar n-am zis ca chiar este in alta tara
Vorbeam de cum arata asa, la suprafata
> in the south and east also have more communist architecture and apartment blocks as a percentange of the whole place, which makes them feel more samey
Like not just
It is true, but at the same time, Iași is just a different thing compared with Constanța, Ploieișt for Bucharest for example
And for me, for someone from Timișoara, when I have been for the first time in Tulcea for example, I felt like in another country
But probably for someone from Constanța is not the same, he may feel like in another country when he comes in Turda
When I went to Turda it just feels like home, not another country
Romania is very diverse, we often do not realize that, just because over 90% of people living in Romania are Romanians lol
Romanian : easiest language on earth to spell , all letters have always same sound and we always say all letters in the world as clear as possible ( no rules like French or English or even Dutch ) .Only exception is C or G followed by I or E when instead of saying c like in *c*ar / g like in *g*orilla we say C like in *ch*ur*ch* / g like *g*ym
Vocabulary is easy for romance+ English speaker , somewhat common for Slavic and rather new for a pure Germanic ( pure Germanic aka Germanic but not English) and for the rest is probably as hard as for any other language
And then all hell breaks loose with grammar . We have all declinations of the verb ( like the French ) but we also have for noun . We don't add a generic prefixes/suffixes for the cases ( ***the*** house , Andy'***s***, car***s***, ***to*** Maria) we change the entire word and there are a lot of exceptions from the general rule(which is already very complicated considering genders, cases , number, etc
) . And in writing there is the short form (idk how to call it ) somewhat like the English it's vs its but we have way more words like this and probably more than half of the native speakers don't know how to use them properly .There is also a lot of freedom in the order of the words : the flower beautiful and the beautiful flower both make sense but the first is used to expess just the fact and the second form is used to emphasize the beauty of the flower .
&#x200B;
Basically Romanian is like French but the speaking vs writing is easier but grammar is harder .It's a easy language to average but very hard to master
The number of speakers is actually the main issue but i guess so it is for most of the languages
Our language is both latin and slav,so it will be easy to learn and speak,and the fact that everything is pronounced as it is written is just a bonus thing
We speak it and we
don't have the best reputation,so to speak
But it's *pickpockets your wallet* getting *pickpockets your phone* better
*doing a 100 pickpocket skyrim bs and stealing literally everything from you except your underwear*
Reason why Romanian should not be the next pan-European language:
-It's not taught in schools in foreign countries
-Its grammar is pretty hard compared to other languages
Reasons why it should be:
-Could be a bridge between the latin countries of Europe and the slavic ones
(but that's a long stretch)
You'd still have Hungarian people in Transylvania(/Erdély/Ardeal) who tenaciously preserve their language, therefore it won't become a dead langauge that fast
Part of me wants to learn Hungarian so I can know a couple of words that my Hungarian friends say
The other part of me only managed to learn "szia" from Duolingo before giving up because it was too hard
So we have grammatical genders and cases for nouns, and a ton of verbal tenses on top
And while the tenses themselves are similar to French/Spanish, the actual forms of the verbs are often irregular and kinda weird
Also, plurals of nouns are mostly irregular afaik
So hardest parts of Romance languages and German put together
But the best feature is of course that we have triple letters, such as in "copiii" = "the children". Can your language do that
Besides, in a sentence can have a word of Latin origin, one of Slavic origin, one of Turkish origin and one from some other language family right next to each other
For example:
>Veșnic mănânci ciorba încet
= You always eat soup slowly
Veșnic = always (slavic), mănânci = you eat (latin), ciorba = soup (Turkish), încet = slowly (???)
A friend of mine recently learned Romanian (he already knew French quite well and Spanish conversationally, so it was not very hard)
When he heard native people talk he said he couldn't understand because we use so many colloquial words, idioms, expressions and just filler stuff that it's nothing like "textbook" version of the language
> rational ... you end up with english and french
Oaia aia e a ei
Eu i-o iau
that is correct but i was thinking most of the languages have hardcore phonetic writing .German and Hungarian are good examples . Hard to read even if there are no rules to be followed but this might be an subjective opinion of mine
German has way more exceptions in pronounciation
Don't know about Hungarian
Well, there are pockets especially within Székely Land and near Oradea/Nagyvárad where they speak entirely Hungarian
Because Romania has a pretty nice attitude when it comes to minorities, in regions with a big minority population, that minority's language because another de facto official language
[Road signs] or [other official signs] contain both languages, the town hall and other official institutions are required to speak both Romanian and that other language
Even the state school system has a dedicated curriculum in Hungarian with special exams
Therefore, in regions with only Hungarians or very few Romanians, Romanian is almost not spoken at all
While there won't be as many speakers, the language will still be used enough to count it as still alive
While not equally comparable, you can view the situation the same as with Catalan in Spain
Lodz it's pronounced Wuch . No way  . Also you're language is impossible to read Grzegorz Brzeczyszczykiewicz . It should have been it's all polish to me , at least greek have some root words in every language
I've been born in hungarian minority region of Romania and so i was exposed to hungarian often enough and for many times i focused on trying to understand what people were saying but its totally helpless . Not even 1 word out of 100 .Maybe just loan words like goulash but no other
Gave our national treasure to the Russians when we entered ww1 so they'd protect it
All we got back was like 20kg of gold
Trusting Russia . Then trusting Germany . Then trusting Russia again
Then Trusting Germany again
Third time's the charm I guess
Voting for the heir of the communist party
Allowing the social democratic party, who is composed of former communist party members, exist
This predates the modern notion of "country", but I consider our biggest mistake to be our naïve friendliness; even when confronted with aggression and obvious malevolence we rarely took arms to defend ourselves
On the other hand perhaps this is also what allowed us to survive the millennia while other populations got assimilated
I can't believe we made such a stupid mistake
Almost all of the Eastern European countries have joined the chat

- **When exactly the language stopped being Latin and became Romanian
** The oldest text we have in Romanian is from the 1500s and is still easy to understand by a modern speaker
But before that
Almost no records and no information
- **Why Romania escaped the "slavification" of Eastern Europe
** There's a couple of theories, some of the main ones are:
\- We took refuge in the mountains and therefore escaped slavic assimilation (explains how geography might have played a role in this)
\- After/during the fall of the Byzantine empire, the latin people migrated north (explains why there's a strange absence of latin-speaking nations in the Balkans besides small isolated communities like Vlachs)
\- Instead of being assimilated, we were the ones who assimilated the Slavs coming here (explains why a few grammatical constructs like the vocative case in Romanian appear to be similar or inherited from Slavic languages)
For some reason, the Dacians (with a religion which was really lazily written, they just copied and pasted the Abrahamic faiths,) are hailed as the noble resistance to Roman invasion until the fall of the Dacian Empire to Emperor Traian under Decebalus
while, at the same time, we’re supposed to have national pride for being descended from the Romans, but still revere the Dacians
It’s a weird contradiction the writers really aught to make up their mind about
The ethnogenesis of the language and of the identity of Romanian as we now know is really vague
The Dark Ages left a big question mark on our history, and we know details about it only from about 1000 AD
To add to that, there's an immense gap of time, from the time when the romans left dacia to when the medieval romanian states formed, where we have very little knowledge of what happened
My theory is that the Carpathic Basin always worked as a roundabout for migratory populations, so they never stopped here but passed through, usually for the wealthier parts of the Byzantine Empire, which were way more attractive than a bunch of forests and some mountains
So basically no one can park in a roundabout, but everyone can pass
The Daco-Roman people, which were already settled, so "parked", managed to stood their ground pretty much because most of the guys that went through here didn't care so much about settling
Excepting of course, the Slavs, which influenced our history and culture quite a lot
Basically it's because this part of Europe was always seen as transitory, being the way that most of the people chose to reach other parts of the continent (aspect that can be observed even better in the rest of the history, when Romania was always between the Hungarians or the later A-H Empire, Ottomans and Russians
> The oldest text we have in Romanian is from the 1500s and is still easy to understand by a modern speaker
But before that
Almost no records and no information
Not a plot hole per se
Remember we were always surrounded enemies and it's plausible for them to have actively destroyed artifacts pertaining to our history (see the churches: Romanians in Transylvania weren't allowed to build stone churches precisely because they didn't degrade easily)
He called dibs
I meant in terms of language, not culture
Culturally we're obviously pretty similar to the neighboring countries
> During my studies this theory was the example used to illustrate made-up historical narratives in Eastern Europe, lol
I mean, it's a theory
Could certainly be wrong, but there's not a lot of information to really understand what happened
> During my studies this theory was the example used to illustrate made-up historical narratives
Interesting way to diss a theory
Almost everyone was illiterate back then, save the nobility and clergy, all across Europe
>At the end of the Middle Ages, the ability to write was restricted to less than 10% of men and hardly any women possessed it
The issue is that compared to Western Europe, the region was always in a state of war, with constant invasion and pillaging from all directions, particularly with the Golden Horde raiding from the North and the Ottoman Empire raiding from the South
Moldova and Wallachia had few geographical barriers to protect them, being basically open plains
This is why you'll see way more castles that survived the Middle Ages in WE compared to ours where [this sort of thing] is generally all that's left
With cities/towns being constantly burned to the ground, it's unlikely that many artifacts, scrolls or tablets survived from that period
But I'm optimistic and as archeology starts to pick up here with time, hopefully we find more clues
Oh yes, we know at least 50% of our history before the Dark Ages, more precisely before the 3rd century AD, but after the Romans evacuated Dacia, the place was overran by migratory populations which pretty much pillaged and ransacked the country so we literally have very few evidence of what happened here in the meantime, and even this few material evidence comes from more powerful or at least centralised neigbours
And that's why we also don't have a lot of old buildings, they were pretty much constantly destroyed during the history
So the answer is, yes, we know what happened before that and even, very generally speaking, during that 700-800 years timeframe, that was after the Roman Retreat, but we know very few specific details and we just have more questions
Dacian gold artifacts are [displayed] at the National Museum of History in Bucharest and I went to see them a few years ago
It's simply mind-boggling how much gold there is and that being only a tiny portion of what was found
You pretty much step into a huge room that's filled with thousands of golden artifacts from one end to the other, it's crazy
Go on, ask
lol, thought it was about what I said
I was doing a teaching internship and during an English class with a Spanish speaker we started talking about foreign languages and I said that the only thing I know in Spanish is "hombre de nieve"  and they were soo stoked about it
So I guess watching Handy Manny as a grown-up paid off
On a similar note i know the italian for "go get yourself fucked in the ass" but i wouldn't dare attempt to write it since i know it only phonetically
I like the one of [Rangers]
The Mandalorian theme fits for Bucharest,a wild place but civilised

I'd prefer to not have stray animals tho
While the optimist and the pessimist argue if the glass is half full or half empty, the opportunist drinks the water
It's behind on its own
"And then it got worse
for others"*
It's just
uncomfortable and strange
I never got used to it
If the stray animals are tiny and cute, sure
If you're talking about huge dogs with big teeth too, then I'm moving to Canada
"Rahați mici" Little shits for Children and"părinți fără educație " Parents without education
It can also be "copii de bani gata"
Understandable
But also: Tough, dough, through
Or "beizadele"
Actually, you, as a Portuguese speaker might find lots of similarities in Romanian
I am acquainted with someone from Portugal and she's understanding basic Romanian pretty easily
But unfortunately it doesn't work the other way around as smooth
I guess you can try our music
What, Romanian
We have some vocabulary in common, and both being latin descendant languages, we have somewhat similar verb structures, as in present past and future things, i don't know what they are called in English
But if you're talking about pronunciation, they are *completely* different
I've only visited the famous Palace of Parliament in Bucharest by means of the Modern Art Museum which is in one of the wings, and that only last summer
Still haven't taken the tour of the actual Parliament bit
I also lived in Cambridge (England) and I'm sure there are some museums or historic sites I haven't seen just because there are so many
I would say a Medical Degree
You will definitely have a job at the end of it, though it might not be paid well in some hospitals and you may be tempted to work in other European countries
Computer degrees are pretty much useless since you can learn pretty much anything online, and get a job at any level
None, only then you'll be prime minister or president because who needs education
The politicians here surely not
We eat soup or a sour soup with meat and vegetables almost everyday at lunch
Romania here - we have a food named “șorici” which is just pig skin, with salt
It may sound gross but it’s fucking delicious and it’s always made for Christmas in the rural zones
Yeah, turns other countries don’t really do that
Some people in Cyprus too
Wait, other Europeans don't do that
Same here
There is this very old joke which means 'take with bread' ('ia cu pâine') used in all kinds of things
I'm pretty sure we are one of the only nations that have this awesomeness called ciorbă. Russians have borsh but its different
Ciorbă is unique
Ciorbă is the best
Man, I'd love to go foraging in Berlin/Brandenburg, but couldn't find an active group to join and I've no idea where to start learning about edible mushrooms etc without getting a Darwin Award for the effort
:/ Do you happen to have any tips
Oh, the friends from other countries who I have said they never heard of anything even similar
Also it is not fried here, it’s raw
This was very helpful, thank you
I have to look that up as I don’t know what the term means, but I’ll edit once I do
EDIT: I guess it is kind of similar but not exactly, [here is a photo of some sorici, which I found out is called “salted pork rind” in english]
Ciorba is typically a sour soup and there are lots of variations: chicken, pork, beef, bean, potato, meatballs, tripe
We use [bran] or lemon juice to make it sour
It is indeed his actual name
His name is Alexandru Ciorbă, Sandu being an abbreviation
Actually if I think about it I've never heard a name being a kind of food before either
It's not common at all
Just a coincidence
Romania
That's it
Someone will always be bad in someone's perspective
I wholeheartedly agree
We had this very "delicate" form of extermination when the communists allowed only gypsy women to get abortions
Also encouraging doctors to give them abortions for "medical purposes".
Most people have no idea that we tried to "cleanse" ourselves
> arguably
We used to have "[Hungarian Autonomous Region] back in the 50s.
Yeah I heard some of them delude themselves with some nonsense about Romans or some such, but they spell it weird
> She would get angry if we kids borrowed them to cut anything else
Edit: also relevant
It wouldn’t
I think
nothing would change in territory  but politically it would be chaos

We have these in Romania too
They are usually filled with plums and we call them Gomboți.
Didnt know that was the name in english
i mean yes it is a thing tho here we use plums and plum gem
Not many people buy em,  but I like them
Yup, we have the plum ones as well
Bread crumbs on top
That's interesting
My grandmother used to smash biscuits into really small crumbs and would put that on top
I'm reading the comments saying "11:45
Pffffffffff, that's when I *start* drinking
" and I feel so old
I go to bed around 11 pm
If I had 4 beers by midnight, I'm in bed snoring in the next second
I don't have the time, energy or liver capacity to party anymore
I know, right
They're probably just students or they're exaggerating to seem cool
Well
Either the Parliament building or the useless church taller than it across the road
I don't know which one of these is the most popular but for Romania, the House of Parliament and Bran Castle are some of the most popular buildings that a foreigner would think of
For me is the palce of the parliament (palatul parlamentului) wich is the second biggest used construction in the world
It's taller than the parliament and built for the old guys with golden hats :-)
Nah bro, big church for golden hat people
Thank you for pointing out we have monuments which are actually intetesting and historically significant
Which is
That's oddly
on point
Well done
I currently own a Carrera Hellcat, had a Carrera Virtuoso before but I had to sell it because of the super thin wheels which were not suitable for the surrounding roads
I also had a Carrera Crossfire 2 that was stolen  (I live in UK)
> eat raw meat or meat with blood
never did it
Im internally screaming at myself to not say that would make you Chinese
Its not as popular in the east
Do unifications count
Because before the small unification there was no single Romanian entity
About Romania: before 1860, there was Wallachia and Moldova, then, after the unification, we kept existing
Now you can say "free" and mean a sovereing state, so basically from 1860-today and i hope even more
Instead if you mean democratic by saying "free" only from 1989 to today
Maybe we could count the monarchy years too, from 1860-1946, when the iron guard established in Romania, and then well, the commies came in
But in an overall we've been around from 1860 to modern days
So yea, we are relatively young nation
I don't like this topic
Romania (fully united ex
Moldova):
98 BC-105
1599-1600
1877-Present
Moldavia and the Republic of Moldova are not the same though, you are just a piece of Moldavia that was stolen from us by the Soviets
Rome because of the "YOU LOOK LIKE AFRICA" scamers
I dont know why they can't get rid of them
Braşov
Everyone was praising it when I told them I will go there, but when I went I didn't find anything special
It's just like the other Transylvanian cities, just, bigger
Prague
I had pretty high expectations for it for some reason, but it just ended up as a rather dirty tourist trap
Also Brașov is very praised, but for me it’s just another city in Transylvania
Napoli, it would be a beautiful city if it was cleaner
I didn't have any expectations when I first came to Munich (had some business there, otherwise wouldn't have went), left with a dislike of the place
To be fair, I've never considered Dublin for vacation :/
I did consider the countryside in Ireland, but not Dublin
It was cold, it's usually bigger when it's warm outside
Surprised Bucharest let you down
Sorry neighbour
Cluj Napoca and Brasov are also worth visiting since they are really beautiful
It has that tiny mountain top in the middle of it, that's what catches people's eye
Well clearly you didnt visit it in the Winter
It's too bad because, otherwise, it's very very beautiful
Some footage of what happens
In reality it's much more annoying as they really don't give you a break and come after you
As a side note, I'm caucasian and lots of them kept yelling "hey man, you look like Africa" which is quite funny
Another "pick-up line" they used was "Hey man, nice shoes". I fell for that a few times, my shoes were really nice
Being John Malkovik, Rome edition
We were there late March this year
I am not a big fan of pasta, so I didn't try it
But I did eat bad lasagna
Yes, and after all that I really had a horrible moment near the train station
I was having a beer outside a small bar when all of a sudden lots of these "bracelet guys" gathered
After a few more moments their leader came and picked up lots of money, I think he counted thousands of euros
They got in a fight with the owner and started picking on tourists (hit an English guy's chair because he didn't give them a cigarette)
But still, very nice place to visit, but just go to the popular places, and don't even look at the bracelet guys
Kürtos kalacs is life
Romanians have status anxiety
It’s not about what they are worth as much as it’s about what they are _perceived_ to worth
As a result you won’t hear anyone asking for “the cheapest beer”, but they will ask it by name
Actually they will more likely ask for the second cheapest beer [by name]
If the beer offer is varied and the cheapest is too cheap compared to the others, they’ll toss in a joke like “the best beer”, “the good kind”, “a true beer”, “a true Romanian beverage”, “the others are crap”(*) etc
In practice though it’s fairly easy: most places (hotels and large restaurants aside) have balanced menus, so you won’t find cheap beer in expensive bars or expensive beers in cheap bars
LE: I realized I hadn’t answered the actual question: no one will say a thing, nor raise their eyebrows
But servers, bartenders favor rich patrons, so there you go
(*) By crap they usually mean additives
What they don’t know is most beer has additives
Huh
seems to be only a London problem
I never experienced something like that anywhere and I asked for it both in my country and as a tourist in Germany and the Netherlands
Everyone here is looking for the cheapest anything
So you'd fit right in
Are people really choosing beer based on alcohol content
I mean I get it when it comes to cocktails and liquor, but why beer too
Rome, Dacia, Ancient Greece and Egypt along with Ancient Mesopotamia are the ones I learned about in school
Not that many
Unless you're in a special profile in high school
I was told about some cultures around the south east of Europe and even those I don't really know
I don't know how it is today but from what I can remember history was very greek and roman centered in 5th grade
Then in 6th grade we were already in the middle ages
7th grade everything after the Renaissance all the way to the Victorian Era I think and after that, in 8th grade, only Romanian history
High school history, I can't actually remember much of it because we barely did it
I actually started learning history myself on the internet at that point
All this is just what happened in my schools, can't talk about the whole country
Now that I think about it there might have been something about ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, but if it happened, then we went quick through them
Yeah
What did the Romans ever do for us
The language and the name
yes yes
But other than the aqueduct, the language and the name, what else have the Romans done for us
Yes yes
The aqueduct, but what else
Like in **H**onduras, **H**ungary, **h**orse
It's different from A, which always sounds like the sound you make at the dentist (i.e. c**a**r in English)
"hî" it's one of the sounds cartoon characters make when throwing punches
ah yes, the beaten minecraft villager sound
The best equivalent that I can find is the "h" in "hashish"
Ai dreptate frate
I can't think of any
I would like to visit all
It might take a lot of time to visit some like Scandinavian countries because of how expensive it is to explore the places
But I definitely want to go there
Belarus and Turkey, this is due because of their dictatorships and authoritarianism which scare me and i wouldnt feel safe but i would go to every other country
I would like to visit them all, if i only had the money
My mother says Slovakia
She was there before, and she hated it
Out of the official countries, there isn't any I wouldn't visit
I love all my European brothers and sisters, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have been born in a time and place as flourishing and progressive as 21st century Europe
I have some bad opinions about Russia, because of the instability they created and the agressive foreign policy that they are pursuing
In addition, they are challenging the boundries of democracy, and I don't like that either
So not sure if I'd visit Russia
Apart from that, I wouldn't visit Transnistria, unless I do so with a rifle in my hands and a helmet on my head
I wouldn't go to the Donbass Republics either, because why would I?
Edit: Oh Turkey too, not for any other reason apart from pretty much the same things I said about Russia
So it has to do with the current leadership and government
don't consider them Europeans though so not sure if they even count, just trowing my 2 cents in there
Nah
It would probably get difficult in the future with UK, but I would still visit if I had time & money
UK, Russia, Turkey, and Bielorusia
I have already been to Hungary and my guide was genuinely frightened for me calling its Prime Minister "Orban" instead of "Mister Orban".
I don't want to sponsor other dictators
Update 1: I forgot about Poland
The far right protests from a few years ago frightened me
Update 2: as many point out, UK is not technically a dictatorship
But with Brexit and the general hatred of immigrants, it is as appealing to me as Russia
You'd be fine in capitals and big cities of eastern european countries, it's mostly old people from small towns that are racist/homophobic
Yeah, we can't really see in the future
Well, getting a visa it's more difficult than just showing my ID at the customs, but I've never been outside EU so far so I don't know for sure how it is
I just expect it would be more difficult because paperwork is usually so bad to do here
Public display of affection
La mama dracului - At the devil's mother
Yeah, here the place we mention us Honolulu
Romanian
“In pulă cu satelitu’”  which word by word means in the dick with the satellite
In romanian we say this in many ways, but the most common is ,,La dracu-n praznic'' which roughly translates as ,,At the devil's burial table''
We say Patagonia
Or "the devil's corn field". Very similar :P
We use Honolulu, or at least used it :) i was in Honolulu when i once asked for direction to the toilet in a mall
It was pretty far and i said to my self “where did she send me
Honolulu
” Then realized i was actually in Honolulu
Then of course there is also “in pula cu satelitu’”
We say somewhere in "cuca macaii" wich is an imaginary place or "la naiba in prasnic" wich means somewhere near Satan
We use as well *Cuca Măcăii* means "a remote village or place, very difficult to reach" and I've personally heard/used Honolulu too
For time we use "La Pastele Cailor" - "The Easter of the horses"  which is a real holiday (but not so important or celebrated) 40 days apart from the Orthodox Easter
So it usually refers to "someday" or "never".
În Puleni = (approximately) in Dicksville
And also "Plaestina" or Palestine
We also say la mama naibii, which means the same thing
I've heard this one but i don't believe it's used too often
Either way, when I was a kid, I taught it was a made up name, not the capital of Hawaii
There is also Pulahara and Pulalela
Im so gonna use that one from now on
I was at the British history museum and I think this guy was Canadian
He looked at this mask from Africa and simply said "bruh"
Yes, we have a jandarmerie (we stole the word from you guys :D), it's the special police, but it operates in the same area as the normal police, but it responds to "tougher situations". I don't know how those tougher situations are determined tho
One that got my attention was the verb “a dezmierda” which means something along the lines of taking care of someone, fulfilling all of their wishes, excessively looking out for that person
Most often this applies in the context of parents and kids and the result would be a brat that always wants to get things done their way
The etymology of the word comes from Latin: des + merda (meaning shit), basically the act of cleaning poop
It’s associated with the mother cleaning her baby in old times and that’s how the current meaning came to be
Le mai spunem de șmecheri si bombardieri
:))
Well, we do have some of the history cut out, but essential we learn about the Daco-Roman precursors until the emperor Aurelian retreated the roman army from the Dacian region 271-274, after that we have well pretty much the void millenium, until about the year 1100 when we have the next documented history of our country and the medieval history starts all the way to the time of the 3 regions of Moldova, Transilvanya and wallachia then we study a bit of rennasiance, and then the napolean era/ the industrial revolution and then contine on to the 18-19  century and then the modern history
Here, in middle school we learn 3 years world history and 1 year Romanian history
Then in highschool is the same, another 3 years world history with 1 year Romanian, this time more in depth
Our way of learning history in schools is kinda shitty, at least in my opinion
We go over the basics in 4th grade, then do universal history from 5th to 7th grade, only to do the history of Romania in 8th grade
And the fact that educational systems change very frequently isn't too helpful either
In the 7th and 8th grade we do the simplified history of the world
We then go in depth in the 9th and 10th grade
History of Europe in 11th grade and history of Romania in 12th grade
In the first year we talk about general romanian History from the 1200s to the WW1
In our second year we talk about antiquity
In our 3rd year we talk about the Medieval times for all of Europe
In our 4th year we talk about the 20th century extensively
In our 5th and final year of ‘simple’ history we talk  about Romanian history but in greater detail
Unfortunately, life isn't EU4
Iam not totally sure, but I think is between 18-21 yo
In Romania high school graduates are usually 18-20
Catalonian Independence be like: WE ARE INDEPENDENT

# SIKE
Târgoviște, the name comes from the word târg which means market place, it's actually of slavic origin
It's unknown where exactly Bucharest or Bucureşti came from
The most common hypothesis is the name of a shephard named Bucur that founded the city but it is unconfirmed and it's more of a legend
What's interesting is that the name has the word for "happy" which is "bucurie"
"Târgoviște" , Romania
"Târg" is an old word for "Market Town" , and so that's where it comes from
It used to be the Capital of Wallachia, but Vlad the Impaler moved it down to București so he would have his supply lines shorter when fighting the Turks
There were some merchants who wanted to build a church in a market with no name,and they wanted to name the Market MITROPOLIA,Something to remind of the church,but then the guy who ruled over the country financed the building of the church,so the merchants decided to call the market that later became a city, ALEXANDRIA ,after the name of the ruler,to pay respect
The verb is "toarce" . It means "to spin wool" . It apparently makes a somewhat similar noise
The noise is "prrrrrrrrrrr" or just "rrrrrrrrrrr" .
In Romanian we say "miau" when reffering to the sound they make
It's very similar to the English "meow".
Mârrr in Romanian
Intrebarea se referea cum suna cand toarce pisica
Lol, you looking where to go
Babeș-Bolyai
I don't really know why just everyone says is the best and majority of students go there
Da chiar, care sunt
the coolest and weirdest thing about metu is that it has a forest
i never knew a campus could be so big
The closest thing to that is a story from Păcala (a peasant who is the protagonist of numerous stories) who fools some men to drown themselves
(For Romanians, "Razbunarea lui Pacala", vine dupa "Pacala nu vrea sa fie primar in sat")
Even to Romania
Do you also buy cars from Germany that were 'driven only by an old lady'?
Our fantasy old ladies used the car to go to the market, not church, but very close
Some of the cars are also "company cars, driven by professional and very careful drivers".
Yes it's possible that some people will switch to try and speak something more like literary Romanian (based on the Wallachian dialect) if the context requires it (i.e. a very formal setting like an exam, or speaking to someone who struggles to understand their accent, when you're in a different region)
I've never heard anyone ask for it though, like other people have said
People just "feel" when they need to switch
However, it's hard to get rid of an accent, and depending on how strong it is it may still show through but they may be avoiding regional words
An interesting feature i've noticed when people try too hard to hide their accent, they kind of overshoot and their "literary" speaking sounds kind of robotic and overly soft
In Romania we don't really have dialects, just accents (i.e. the words used are pretty much the same and are pronounced similarly, but there are certain words, some of them quite common, in which the accent is different)
That being said, people understand each other easily
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking a person with a strong accent to cool it down
More likely the person with the accent will be stopped once or twice and asked to repeat something, and they'll then try to avoid that in the future by changing it
But a lot of people from Moldova for example (the region in Romania, not the country, but it can apply to them too) try to fade out their accent when they come to Bucharest
I knew one guy from Piatra Neamț, who had this news presenter accent when talking to me, but the sweetest moldovan accent when talking to his relatives
I doubt anyone told him to change his accent, but maybe he thought it was a disadvantage when talking to clients
Gay marriage
phone chargers
And the rules
Like what goes where

I am a confused Romanian
Me too, too bad they don’t let us into Schengen already
Romania's economy and minimum salary would suffer immensely if we did the change, so maybe we won't, for now, until things get more stable with the corruption and everything
Same here brother
Romania had fulfilled the technical requirements for some time, but fulfilling the "political requirements" is very tricky when it's very convenient for western EU gov'ts to score political points by acting tough on the Schengen issue
In romania it's yellow for plastics, red or green for organic and blue for paper
Now I kinda see a flag pattern in it
One popular dumpling that I know is a [plum dumpling] They're actually made from potato dough and does not include any kind of flour dough
They are very delicious and easy to make and I highly recommend them
Money counting, there is even a game about that on App Store
In Romania when it's warm outside old men will sit in parks all day and play backgammon
Some games even attract spectators
The more "intellectual" ones will play chess
There are even tables with a chess board built-in in parks, [like so]
Edit: [here they are in the wild]
I would have thought they would allow for a 10 minute buffer in case of a queue
Alas, it would seem to not be the case
I don't see a point in the limit, unless the express purpose is to annoy people
the netherlands because of the general feeling, and for some reason hungary(although im only talking about budapest because thats thre only city i visited, but from pictures the others seem nice as well)
that is so cool oh my god what did you visit
You went to some interesting places, some of whjch i havent seen myself
I'm a bucharest local so here's some advice for being here:
Stay near the center if you can help it, or at least in sector 1 or 4
Those are the safer parts of the city
Avoid Piata Obor, that whole area is a bit of a mess
For the love of god, look for the Ferentari neighbourhood and avoid it like the plague
If you want some *scarily authentic* portuguese food there's a city in near Tei called Dancing Lobster, on the expensive side but it's the best food i have ever had, in the country or abroad
In most cities restaurants are a safe bet, I can't name 1 restaurant i have been to that was horrible, especially since better restaurants are next to tourist areas
since only the good ones tend to be near tourist attractions
Man hiking here is amazing(ly cheap too) if you're into that
There's a website and app called Munții Noștri (literally our mountains) that has all the trails in almost all of the hiking areas, makes it super easy to plan out your hike
You'll also meet crazy locals out hiking for sure
Had a guy tell me that this crucifix on a cliff we were walking to is the actual place Jesus was crucified and that Romania is actually the holy land but the Freemasons are hiding it from us
So not all good crazy
Can't wait for summer
Nothing like looking at a 1km tall cliff at sunset and saying to yourself "yeah we had lunch up there".
I would love an EU
Shows my continental pride
I know the reference
The Romanian one says for the glory of unification, and it also uses slava which is more of an archaic word
Pentru gloria uniunii is a better way to say it

Liviu dragnea, Viorica dancila
liviu dragnea is in jail now thank god
this is the type of politicians we have, thieves mostly :(
Viorica Dăncilă and Liviu Dragnea but he's in prison
Liviu Dragnea was a corrupt politician
He is currently serving his 3 and a half years sentence in prison
Viorica Dancila, fellow Romanians know why
I think on our part we agree on Dragnea
Is he the worst politician we've ever had though
People lived worse during Ceaușescu's period
I mean, we fucking killed the guy just to overthrow communism
Add on that list Ceausescu and Iliescu
Nixon got a lot of bad rap for obvious reasons but he lived for like 20 more years after that and did a lot of things that rehabilitated his image to a certain degree
I know someone else who won't be doing that
yeah but I wasn't born in Ceaușescu s period
so I share my experience not something I've been told
Iliescu almost died a few weeks ago and people were already opening champagne and celebrating the night before the news of his stable condition surfaced
Am not really into politics so this event took me by surprise
We aren't that lucky friend
He survived . I am starting to think he is a vampire
I remember a variant with a well
Instead of 3 objects you had 6, but I can't remember which those other two were and I've played it just a couple of times as a small kid
We normaly have the usual rock, paper, scissors (piatra, hartie, foarfece), but I remember that in primary school we used a few more like : gun, well and fishing net
I have no idea how popular this version is, it might've been just a thing my school did for all I know
Yes I remember the fishing net too
And we also used to say ”cio-că-ne-le-le” while counting/swinging fists
In my experience the mono-chain-industries were so powerful in some places that it trumped a highly developed need for young students to learn other fields
For example parts of Spain were hit so hard 11 years ago when the global crisis arose because a lot of the population worked in construction-chain which once collapsed left a lot of young people without any training/knowledge to do anything else
Worse of it went from a deep need for employees to employees fighting for a spot anywhere (something that, again, young ones were not used or taught to do)
On average, urban environment, money spent on food, 215€ per household member, as reported by our national statistics institute
Somewhat on par with my experience, about 400-500€ for 2 people
(Romania)
maybe 100 euros per person
I personally spend \~200€ per month on food alone
This includes lunch at a restaurant (sometimes) or at the mall food court almost daily plus groceries
But I have an income higher than the average in Romania
I only get this low if I cook a lot myself and bring foot at work, but most of the time I am between 220€ and 270€.
One bottle of vodka and you're all set
It is, I've been surprised to find roughly the same prices abroad (Italy, Greece, etc) when going shopping
I guess the only thing that's different is the income
Bernie Sanders on Twitter in 2016: "Today, people living in Bucharest, Romania have access to much faster Internet than most of the US
That’s unacceptable and must change
" I just saved a bit of Trump's reputation on this post lol
Hello Budapest or something like that :)))) maybe "it's nice to be here in Budapest"

Let's just pray that these 3 morons (Putin included) won't get us into a new WW
I'm tired of fighting with the hate that they are spreading everywhere :(
If they permanently live there, work there and pay their taxes there, they should be able to vote there
This also means they aren't able to vote in their home country anymore
I say they should be allowed to vote if they are residents and more importantly if they pay taxes in said country
Some older people say it was better back then
Everyone had a job, they had money to buy food, they were never starving, education was taken much more seriously
Everyone had shitty jobs, yes
They had money to buy food, only if food was available
They had ratios of certain amount for each basic produce, which was not enough
My mother used to tell me how she spent hours in line to buy milk for us, because milk was only available that day
They were never starving, but they ate industrially produced food of such bad quality (at least in the city, farmers were eating much better)
They never mention the power cuts and the lack of information, the restriction of movement, the lack of diversity in stores and the technology being decades behind other countries
I will agree with the education part though
Even when I was in school in the 90s and 00s you could see the old teachers were not giving a damn anymore, and the younger ones were sometimes ridiculed by students
I feel like that has gotten worse and worse over the years
In my experience, people who only graduated highscool pre 1989 and never went to university, are a bit more intelligent than university graduates from the 00s on
Back then it meant something to be a university graduate
Nowadays you can find idiots who finished 2 or 3
Oranges were so much of a luxury that children could only eat them once per year: as a Christmas gift
this question was asked 3 weeks ago already wtf
I'm stunned because there are so many people that think the communist era was so much better
"Everybody had a job and everybody had a house and food and money". A simple look on the [Wikipedia page] about the communist Romania would reveal just how bad was for some people, and what were the plans of Ceausescu for the future
There are still many politicians that come from that era and they hurt this country, but there are so many idiots that still praise the communism and those stupid politicians
Most of the people that praise communism are doing pretty good
In my opinion it's easier to say it was better back then if you get anxiety from having to make your own decisions today
Back then the party would give away houses and land, but no one questioned where they came from
No one had to make a decision about where to apply for work, because the party would give them work
No one had to really think about what to cook cuz there was barely any food
People that say it was better back think it was better because they didn't have to plan their own life, it was planned for them
They aren't aware of what possibilities they missed
Democracy for them it's like the Netflix issue of too many choices
My dad liked it there
He always had food and everything he needed but that was just because his dad was a military commander
My mum however hated it because she never had enough food and had to put in hard work everyday and her dad was a military engineer
My mum and dad both met from their dad's work so all went well
If you want a good picture of 80s Romania under Ceaușescu, there's a movie called Hawaii (2017) by Jesus del Cerro
Quit lying to yourself
The communists committed so many atrocities in Serbia
There are so many memorials and concentration camps left from back then and you say it was better back then
Yuck
I completely understand
By your flair, I'm only happy that you fucked off from here
Wow, looks great
I didn't even hear about it
Thanks
Oooooor, and hear me out on this one, because they were members of the party and actually had a good time
Or somehow involved with the party
I don't even bother
Nobody from that group of people is willing to have an actual argument, based on actual facts
I was mentioning Wikipedia because it's as easy as that to see how it was back then, especially for people who were born after '85
I'm talking about romanian communism
And I'm pretty sure I don't need to cherry pick anything in order to support my opinion
If wikipedia is too mainstream and "malleable", then I'll use Richard Wurmbrand's "In God's Underground" just to highlight the same things
Also, communism sucks wherever it comes from
The only way it works is when it's combined with capitalism
Cheers
Grenade throwing sounds fun
I visit every year:)
However, according to my grandparents, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was much different from Ceaușescu, and that life was better under Dej
What do you make of this
Romania is great when you visit it
I have a cousin in Spain that visits every year, and he doesn't see any problem with the country
I reminded him that he doesn't have any other bussiness with our country, apart from staying at home and drinking a beer
Yes, but back then you were the shit
People were afraid of you because you might get them in trouble with the security
Now they are just some old people that brag about this country and kids taking "their places" in the tram
He was a full on Stalinist who had no qualms about sending people to die from hard labor
The think about Dej is that he got the USSR army out and his economic policy made some sense(soviet sense mind you)
He was also a true believer in the socialist cause if that matters to you
(I personally don't care)
I don't do anything else apart from stay with family but that's still fun so guess you're right
Oh, now that I think about it, my grandparents position on Dej make sense
My grandfather served in the military under Dej, and became a middle-high ranking officer in the military
Nope, my grandparents are just really old
Yeah, could be true
And they were also kicked out of their house in 79 By Ceausescu and were moved into a Ploiesti flat
“imi bag picioarele” is a fairly common phrase
it literally means “i put my feet in” and is used to express frustration .
“s-a ales praful” is used when something like a plan doesn’t go the way you intended and is usually followed up by mentioning the said plan, or thing
it literally means “the dust was chosen”
Cu pula-n cur si sufletul in rai = with a dick in the ass, and the soul in heaven
Basically means that a person has contradictory feelings about a topic
Un şut in cur, un pas inainte = a kick in the ass, one step forward
This is mostly an encouragement for when things aren't going your way
You get hit, but now you're wiser kind of thing
A da la rațe = to give (don't know what) to the ducks
To puke
A da cu mucii in fasole = to drop your boogers in the beans
To make a mistake
"Unde fug câinii cu covrigi în coadă"
Where dogs run with bagels in their tail - a place that doesn't exist but it would be perfect, where there's enough food for everyone, everybody is happy etc
I just like to imagine dogs caring bagels around on their tails
**Took a spike**
*A luat țeapă*  — Got scammed / betrayed
^(This one is probably inspired by) [^(Vlad Țepeș)]
**Made a whip out of shit**
*A făcut din căcat bici* — Did a good job with few(or non-existing) resources
**Has a carrot up his/her ass**
*Are morcovul în cur* — To be afraid (in a situation)
**Like a deaf man hits a church bell**
*Ca surdu-n clopot* — Usually sexually,  thrusting / hitting very hard
**Rubbing a wooden leg**
*Frecție la picior de lemn* — Futile effort
These are the first I thought of, but there are much more in Romanian:
"I-a sărit muştarul/şi-a ieşit din sărite/e scos din pepeni"=one got mad
"trage mâța de coadă/toacă frunză la câini"=one is lazy and doesn't do anything productive
"dă la boboci"=one throws up
"se uită ca mâța în calendar/"se uită ca vițelul la poarta nouă"=one looks at something they don't understand
"când vor zbura porcii/la Paştele cailor"=it will never happen
"nu are toate țiglele pe casă/e dus cu pluta"=one is crazy
(a ajuns) "la spartul târgului"=(one arrived) very late
"a pus burta pe carte"=one started to study
"e tobă de carte"=one is very intelligent
There are also a lot of popular sayings, for example:
"scumpul mai mult păgubeşte, leneşul mai mult aleargă", lit
"the selfish spends more, the lazy runs more", it means that you make more effort trying *not to do* something than you would if you *did* it
I don't know how common this is, my family says it all the time tho
"Țâță de mâță" to say that something is great/perfect
It literally translates to "cat tiddie".
> Dzielić skórę na niedźwiedziu
> To divide the skin on a bear - to prematurely divide, think of spending profits, which you cannot know you're going to make
In Romania we have "A vinde blana ursului din pădure" (To sell the fur of the bear from the woods) whitch means the same thing
another one bites the dust
I haven t ever heard the first one
Honestly, WHAT THE FUCK
Pretty much, yeah
None of my neighbors are an option here (except Moldova but that’s another story), I think the easiest to understand would be Italian and Spanish and I know some French so I think would be fine with that too
Romanians are everywhere, so I may not even have to resort to an *intermediary language*.
Only to Moldova
Although I met some people in Prague that could speak Romanian
But I quickly realized they learned a bunch of phrases just to lure customers in their shop
I could easily get by in Italy, France, Hungary, Moldova
One of the benefits of speaking multiple languages
I was going to say about the same thing, I'd be fine with Italy Spain and maybe Portugal but French would be a challenge
Though I feel like Romanian is a bit hard to be understood by others
Well, me and some friends were trying to get to Vienna from east Germany by car and we took a wrong turn at some point and ended up in Czechia
We were in some rural part around 11 pm, we had no idea where we were exactly (Google maps for some reason was stupid), we saw some sings in Czech and then nothing
In one village the police stopped us and they started talking in German to my friend
Friend: oh, great, are we in Austria now
Police officer: no, this Germany
Apparently, we've been driving back to Germany for some time
Why didn’t you just, you know, used the GPS
The guy driving used Google maps, but the "destination" kept changing for whatever reason, without us doing anything

Lock screen: a picture of a green car
Wallpaper: the man united logo
I use this as my phone's wallpaper:
Default windows for my computer and one of CGP Grey's new backrounds for my phone
On my phone:
Lock screen is Samsung's dinamic lock screen with animals category, basically changes the wallpaper every time with nice pics of animals (mostly pets I think)
On desktop: big folder with dragons, reptiles, hammerhead sharks, dinosaurs (+ Jurassic World Evolution and from the movies), game wallpapers (like Monster Hunter World) all with great resolution, it cycles through them
For my phone's home screen, I just have a photo of some clouds, and for the lock-screen the painting "Wanderer above a sea of fog"
Can't link them rn but:
• phone wallpaper is an image from an upcoming game (the last of us part II)
• as my laptop backround I have an artwork by Kuvshinov Ilya, super talented artist, definitely check them out on ig

Magyarland
most of our jokes are about Hungary
they hate it
A Romanian, a Brit and an American jump in the devil's garden
The devil catches them and as punishment makes them put up their ass whatever they stole
And to do it in front of him for his enjoyment
First comes the Brit with a couple of cherries
The Brit cries in humiliation and pain
The devil is pleased
Then comes the Romanian with a couple of plums
He cries but also laughs
The devil is confused
"why are you also laughing
", asks the devil
"this must hurt you, right
The Romanian says "it hurts and it's humiliating, but I can't stop laughing when I think what the American is gonna do with the watermelon".
Hungary, even though I'm hungarian as well
We don't make jokes about other countries, we are the real joke and that is sad
Hungary :))))
We also joke about scots being cheap
And on a smaller scale Bulgarians
Which I'm certain have their own jokes about us
Not to be racist or anything
What do hungarians want
Autonomy
etc etc
Our jokes aren't for you
They are for the Hungarians in Romania
Neah
We joke
They take it seriously :))) we joke again
Next thing you know they fight and we are like: *duuude
wtf
We were just kidding
25C - it's sunny outside and my apartment is facing South so during the day it gets quite warm
I like around 23
5 since I can stay in shorts and a t-shirt
18 degrees but i prefer 22-25
This is because lots of parts of Romania still dont have gas supply(or sewage or water)
I'm not even in bumfuck middle of the mountains, i'm 40km from the center of Bucharest, the capital
And we have a "soba"(a sort of enclosed fireplace) in each room so i have to make a fire, which can go wrong a couple ways, conpletely my fault though
I either forget about it and it goes out, or the damn thing is so sensitive, 1-2 wood logs too many and you get 28-30 degrees instead of 25
4°C, I'm in the room with the biggest radiator and I know the temperature on point because my bearded dragon is also in this room
His "cool end" of the terrarium is 23
4, so room temperature that I would say it's just fine for us
His "warm side" is 40, 43 on the basking spot, so that's a bit too much for me but it makes him happy
That's awesome
Oh no, these soba are big, the size of a fridge made of brick or other ceramics and they are fixed in place because they have "chimneys". It's basically a fireplace thats not in a wall, usually in the corner of a room though with an airgap between it and a wall, and enclosed on all sides
They have a small and a big opening usually covered by metal doors
The big opening is for putting wood inside and the small one is for air, which you close after a while so that the fire doesnt burn out too fast, the wasted heat would just go out the chimney
After that they retain heat for a such a long time i usually only make a fire once every two days
[This] is a good example of what most soba look like
You'd usually have one per room, but it depends on means, you'd even find houses with only one
There's even ones with an horizontal metal plate that you can use to cook on
Damn, let me blow your mind a bit more then
These things used to be used for cooking as well, with a sort of ingenious system I would say
[Here's a large picture] of one similar to my grandma's house back in the day, but this one apparently is movable
The classic ones were built in
The different elements are:
- on the front, the 2 brown doors are for putting wood into the fire (top) and optionally, ventilation (bottom) to speed up the fire
- the hot plate has several round places to cook food on, controlling the heat/fire intensity by taking out the round elements and creating a larger hole beneath the pan (direct contact with the fire)
- the grey lateral door is basically an oven, for making [this kind of regional pastry especially]
Idk about the user above, but my grandma used to put like 2 larger pieces of wood in right before bed, and during the winter had to put more in around 4-5 AM
And this was in a really small room
Usually from our side when it's close to the election time one or two candidates will talk about this as there is a small percentage of people that really want this, our former president even offered some advantages for students from Moldova
But there is no real effort and my guess is there will never be
Moldova also has the Transitria issue and it seems that they keep electing presidents closer to Russia, not to EU
It’s more like a citizens initiative, most Romanians want to unite with Moldova but that is not a political topic, no politician discusses about that and, well, we have bigger problems now, like the fight anti-corruption and trying to collapse the corrupt political parties
Maybe after the elections in 2019 and 2020 there will be more time to talk about it
As for Moldova, there are people that opposes any union (mostly Russian) and there is the problem with Transnistria (what a pain in the ass)
I'm not really up to date with political developments or have any ties to that part of the country, but my general feeling (as a Romanian) is that it's not something that will happen
People don't really discuss it day to day, and I'm not aware of any politician taking a stance on the topic
Also, I'm  pretty sure Russia would have something to say about it
Well not really, there were efforts some years back but now it's just a SF idea in some people heads
A territorial unification is pretty pointless in my opinion given how many difficulties it presents
What would be beneficial is to streamline the citizenship acquisition process for moldavian citizens (possibly other romanians living near the border as well) . I know it is easier compared to other immigrants but it's still a bureaucratic nightmare
This would be like a symbolic invitation for the romanian people outside of the EU to join Romania
We are suffering from rapid population decline and if anything the people from moldavia (both inside and outside of Ro) I have interacted and worked with have an unbelievable grit and work ethic
We could use more of this kind of people
As a Romanian, I don't really care about this topic
BUT
Judging by the fact that the economical situation in Moldova is even worse than in Romania and the fact that their politics align more with the Russian side than with the EU, I would vote against the unification, if it will ever be the case
Moldavians, like other foreigners, are welcome to move to Romania
But unifying governments and parliament and absorb their economy
No thanks
Why did no one mentioned the stuff from last year
Last year we celebrated 100 years from the formation of Great Romania and the subject of reunification got a bit of traction in the media
There was even a declaration of union signed by the officials of many Moldavian villages/cities (including the birthplace of the actual pro-Russia, anti-union, Moldavian president) and there was a friendly response from our parliament, but there was no talk about technical matters or about actually holding a referendum for unification
The biggest effort is done by all those poor football fanatic with nationalistic views, who have painted the same message all over the country: Basarabia, pământ românesc
[Example] one that can be routinely seen on the side of the road
It has had as much success as their similar attempts to convince people to go out and vote Yes in the [2018 referendum] which can still be seen sprayed on walls all over Bucharest
Wait for the elections, you'll see at least some mention there
There have been some discussions about the unification in the past, especially around elections and such, but now Romania is far too busy with the fight against corruption to think about it
For now it is also impossible
Moldavia's president is pro Russia
Also, we need to put our economy back on it's feet and having Moldavia on our backs will be a drag, as they are doing worse than us
There will be more disadvantages than advantages for Romania if the unification takes place in the near future
Nope
Romania
The country always had this name since 1866 even if the teritory suffered modifications
We call it Moldova in romanian (both of them), but for the country we may call it Republica Moldova (The Moldovian republic) or Bassarabia (i think it comes from russian)
It's an English thing
In Romanian you have "Moldova" and "Republica Moldova". The former being, usually, the North-East of Romania, part of the former Principality
I'm from the historical region of Moldova and we still consider ourselves Moldovans (regional identity) and we refer to the citizens of the Republic of Moldova as "basarabeni" (people from the region of Bessarabia) to avoid confusion
It’s an English thing
They are both called Moldova, you can refer to Moldovians as: our brothers on the other side of the Prut (the river that separates Romania from Moldova)
There are very few differences in vocabulary and accent, almost negligible
The main thing that differentiates the two is the geography: Moldova is a region in Romania, Moldavia is a separate country
Oradea - It's the safest city in all of Romania
It's very rare you see a crime or something bad happening here
People here are very nice so, yeah
I live in a small place, like 2000 people or something
I am more scared of stray dogs than someone wanting to rob me
I live in Iasi
As long as you avoid *that* neighborhood(which every city in the world has,don't try to deny it) it's extremely safe
This goes for most cities in Romania,especially since the municipalities now have the stray dog population under control(it used to be a BIG problem in most cities)
Timișoara, Romania
I would say it's pretty safe
I don't think I ever heard of someone getting robbed at night
That said, if there aren't a lot of people around and the lighting is bad I start feeling uncomfortable
There are areas that I would comfortably walk through all night (ex: the city centre) and areas where I would turn back asap (ex: Botanic Park, where all the druggies and alcoholics spend their time and areas that look sketchy in general)
Bucharest
I would try to avoid poorly lighted alleyways (for precautionary reasons) but I definitely have no qualms about walking on the main streets and boulevards at night
I used to live in Bucharest for 20 years
I was never scared to walk around the city at night, although I never entered the really bad neighbourhoods at that time
In the city center and where I lived I was never robbed or assaulted
Târgu Mureș & Timișoara in Romania
You can walk anywhere, any time you'd like and nothing will ever happen to you
And I think this applies to all cities in Romania
Not sure about Craiova and some neighborhoods ( mostly Ferentari) from Bucharest, never had the chance
As a dude Bucharest most of the central part at night is ok, usually metro stops areas are quite safe as they are in densely populated area so they might seem unsafe but I never had a problem
Safety has increased considerably with time in Bucharest
Talking strictly as a dude up until 12 o'clock at night
Buzău is super fine at night
Except for one neighborhood
But even in that neighborhood it's not so bad
The only people I've seen on the streets at night were teenagers
And, yeah, they range from annoying to sort of aggressive, but if you literally don't pay attention to them they'll get bored and move on
Bucharest on the other hand, it has a lot more neighborhoods you would want to avoid, but even so it's pretty safe
Iași, Romania
Not dangerous per se, but you can run into annoying people (drunks, ghetto bois etc
I never had any problems in 7 years living here
Pretty much the same thing applies to Bucharest too
The only one I can really think of is the [Bucium] which is a very long horn made out of pinewood and a few other types of wood that was also used to alert soldiers during military conflicts
Nowadays it's only used by Shepherds
[Digi fonf] on a serious note, probably not or at least not that i know of
But this guy is a meme in Romania
Probably the pan flute
If you've ever watched Kill Bill, then you definitely know [this] song
The instrument heard there is the pan flute
The song is composed by the lates James Last and interpreted by Gheorghe Zamfir
I looked it up and Wikipedia says it was invented in Berlin but also mentions that it was first patented in Vienna by someone else almost a decade later
Târgoviște
That one time the Turks came and beat the hell out of us but we still fought harder than anyone expected
Also we killed our Communist dictator here in 1989
That's about it
It's a small city
The first thing that comes to mind is the Treaty of Bucharest, signed in 1913 after the conclusion of the Second Balkan War
Cluj Napoca is known for being founded by the romans, then after hundreds of years being in kingdom of Hungary and now part of România
I can't really a special event in time
Stephen III (the Great) won a great battle here against the Ottomans in 1475
I'd have said the 1918 battle of Helsinki but I guess it was a pretty small battle
About Bucharest there's a lot of more important things that happened
From the top of my head I can think of:
-The 1916 battle of Bucharest
-The 1944 coup
-Bucharest was the center of the 1989 revolution
I mean the 1913 Treaty basically only gave us Southern Dobrogea, which is mostly Bulgarian either way
Fun fact: The Winged hussars didn't do all that much
The "Charge of the winged hussars" was done at the end of the battle
It was the final routing of the Ottoman forces
And even then most of the horsemen were not the heavy Winged Hussars, but light German and Polish cavarly
It was the mostly German and Austrian Holy League infantry who won the battle, alongside the defenders of the city who held out for longer than the Turks expected
I read the style of fighting was more like what we see in WW1, with trench raids, dispersed infantry charges with no volley lines, extensive use of grenades and plenty of close quorters combat
I...Don't know if that actually happened
I know the battle of Târgoviste was in 1476
That night attack in which Dracula almost routed the ottomans but his officer who was supposed to attack alondside him in the 2 prone attack never showed up
It's unknown if he got bribed by the ottomans, got cold feet or was just so bad at leading the attack that he got halted by the ottoman patrols before he reached the base
Never heard anything about him burning the city though
I wasn't really thinking about what we got out of it, but rather that the city was chosen for the negotiations
Agreed with the 1916 battle, but the other two events were bound to happen in Bucharest, what with it being the capital
Moreover, you could argue that Timișoara was the heart of the Revolution because that's where it all started but since Ceaușescu's "HQ" was in Bucharest, the latter ended up being the epicentre
Lmao yeah I know about that anime
I just wanted to make sure you know that didn't actually happen
I mean you probably already knew it isn't supposed to be in any way a representation of history but still
And also that Târgoviște looked NOTHING like that back then
It was basically just a marketplace and some houses, a few dirt roads and a small fortress
Actually the name "Târgoviște" comes from "Târg" meaning "Market Square" .
Cum, in Romanian it means "How".
“Crap” is a type of fish here
“Fac” (pronounced “fuck”) is the verb for “I’m making”
Blanking out on non-offensive ones
Salt means jump in Romanian
Face
A face in Romanian means to do/make, but of course in english it means someone's face
"cum" means "how" but yeah I guess sometimes it's pretty funny
"curve" (hookers)
No is yes
Oh dear
Then again, we have ‘Eu’, pronounced similarly to ‘you’ to mean ‘I’.
In Romanian we have "da" which means yes, but in german it means there
There's a song named "Cum se face
" that has a lot of youtube comments from disappointed english speakers
Also fag means beech in English
FYI, constipation in English is the opposite of diarrhea
In case you end up at a doctor's office
Some non-offensive ones:
Sat = village
Pat = bed
Site = sieves
Gem = jam
Beautiful, thank you
“Salt” is the noun (the jump)
The verb is “a sări” - eu sar, tu sari, el sare etc
That song, but the comments were from 2016 or whenever it was released
Haven't checked it in a while
The corresponding verb is "a sălta".
Happy cake day
My boyfriend is Filipino, I'm Romanian
He eats sooooooooooooo many sweets and there are so many sweet dishes
Also the obsession with white/pale skin is unreal
Garlic crumpet
Do I have to say more
Same in Romania
Same i  Romanua, even is for dead, uneaven for the living
>Dinners being a big deal
I appreciate cooking once or twice per week but most of the times I just want to have a sandwich or yoghurt with fruit
Also, just tea or coffee for breakfast is sad
Truest truth
I hate sweet popcorn
***Ricardo Milos flashbacks***
I just imagine telling someone I'll meet them at half 3 and they arrive an hour earlier
I guess that would rub anyone in the wrong way
I can't talk about your wife, she probably went through some stuff completely different than me
But for me it's almost a trigger when someone tells me to be "the better man". Mostly because I was constantly told as a child that "women forgive, women are kind". And as an adult it feels like complete defeat and humiliation sometimes to give in and be kind
I wanna be like a man: have my cake *and* eat it
I understand your wife, in some situations I would rather burn everything down than forgive
Forgiving seems like weakness
I see no problem
r/suddenlyportuguese
But the story has a happy ending, right
All is fine now
Thinking that East European women are perfect, beautiful, easy to get and the best housewives on the planet
"Romanians are gypsies"
"Romania is dangerous"
Well maybe this isnt so much Europe but more Romania
\-Everyone assumes ALL Romanian people are gypsies when there are clear differences
Literally one of the worst stereotypes
\-We dont collect scrap metal (Our GDP is Higher then Portugal)
\-We dont pickpocket (Only Gypsies in Foreign Countries that dont have education or manners)
Its annoying because there are so many hardworking and law biding people from Romania that get stained by some idiots :(
Said the guy from the country famous for dungeon porn and nudism :P
I mean it's really common for girls to sunbathe topless in Europe
I don't think they do that in the US
"No Free speech" I have encountered a lot in the US
Having lived in the UK, people often ask me if you can badmouth the queen or if you get fined/arrested for it
I dislike this a lot too, mostly because I talked to a black person for the first time when I was 26, because there are literally no black people in some cities here
Like some people in Europe that want dark skinned black people around them to show how inclusive they are
Sounds romantic :D
Brilliant
Bucharest: Around 5 2-rooms (living room + bedroom) 50m² apartments in a commie block outside of the city center in a decent neighbourbood near the subway station (say Dristor)
In a small village in Romania probably a 600 sqm house
Something like this:
Probably taxi drivers in Bucharest, it's like they are born to scam you
Instead of 7 euros, they will ask you for 20 euros from the airport if you're foreign
Other than that, the Bran (Dracula) Castle is kinda overrated, it's just a normal castle somewhere near the mountains
At least that's how I remember it 5 years ago
The "Dracula" souvenirs near the Bran castle
We repeat
DRACULA
DOES
NOT
REPRESENT
ROMANIA
[This] "castle". No offense to the owners, it was a lot of hard work into this place, but it's just not representative of Romanian culture and history, plus it's kinda expensive to get in
I went to a basketball tournament in Ferragudo,near Portimão. Amazing place, close to a lot of beaches, 10/10 would go again
There are better palaces/castles even outside Transylvania, like [this]
"Pizda țigăncii" means "gypsy pussy" and I think it's the [iris flower
] but it might be a different flower
Stingray,translates to "pisică de mare",and it means sea cat
Jesus Christ I never made the connection
We also have "bășina porcului", glad someone else pointed out pizda țigăncii tho
Here in romania ladybug is gărgăriță/buburuză
God cow is a different bug here
How do you call that bug I am thinking of
We just write them in English
I don’t think there is an automatic translator in Reddit
By the way, what the fuck is english
What do you mean by English in schools
Noi scriem doar în engleză, înafară de submarinul țării noastre
O traducere probabil că va ajunge la câteva rezultate ciudate
The ground floor is called "Parter", the next is the first floor "etajul unu (1)"
In Moldova and other post-USSR countries I've visited, they start counting at 1
So the floor at street level is the 1st floor, then 2nd floor, etc
In Romania the street level floor is "parter", i.e. ground floor and the one above it is 1st floor
This will cause endless arguments and struggles if we ever unite with Moldova, maybe even a civil war
we have word parter (same pronunctiation as the french) meaning ground floor .

There's a metro station named after him
The pen, the jet engine (technically), and almost the aeroplane
The most famous of Coandă's discoveries is the Coandă Effect
After more than 20 years studying this phenomenon along with his colleagues, Coandă described what Albert Metral was later to name the "Coandă Effect". This effect has been utilized in many aeronautical inventions
[Coandă effect :-)]
The Jet Aircraft by Henri Coanda
It saves lives, man
Don't forget about the first jet engine
Even though those pesky canadians tried to steal it
Fountain pen*
To say the least we helped the world a lot
>3D cinema
What
How
Henri Coanda
Isn't it strange to claim someone "invented" a food and other countries can't claim that food
I mean, how can someone prove that a Chinese person sailed to Italy to teach them to make pasta
Didn't they, both Chinese and Italians, come out with pasta independently
And in all fairness, nowadays the Italian pasta is the one everyone knows
Thanks
We have a village/spa resort situated on the shore of a salted lake somewhere in the grassy, monotonous plain through which flows the lower Danube
Its name
Lacu Sărat -- Salted Lake
What about Amadora
Which literally means Amateur
It's like the EU wants us to hate them even more
Oh yesss, garlic sauce always
Yeah, ketchup/extra tomato sauce here
Pretty commonplace
Yes
Sweet or hot ketchup or garlic sauce
Hot tomato sauce one slice, spicy tomato sauce the next one
I love doing this
I love spicy stuff
Yes , most if not all pizza places have ..sweet/hot tomato sauce,garlic or barbeque sauces ,ketchup hot/sweet
See, we aren't vampires, if we were could we eat garlic sauce
Though we do have garlic sauce, but we don't use it on pizza
Pros:warm weather,great food,great cities
Cons:racist people,lack of xbox live (even tho they sell xbox here and  games for it),gypsies (sometimes theu are too many
Not all of them  are bad,but there are some who ruin the lives of everyone) , everything feels expensive
cons: Bad drivers and not a lot of highways
pros: cheap beer
Born in Romania, left in 1997 to USA, but I come back every year
I lived there with my then-boyfriend from 2009-2014
&#x200B;
Pros: The men are incredibly attractive, not sure why
Low cost of living
Nice people once you get to know them
Beautiful scenery everywhere
Pretty safe overall
&#x200B;
Cons: Superstitions are common, it has a very folky small village mentality in many areas
Very low wages
Architecture leaves a lot to be desired
Buildings/roads/cities are not well maintained, apartments are often really shitty
Racism and sexism and general hyper conservative beliefs are widespread and accepted
I think  "La Marseillaise"  is one of the most iconic ones
You hear the first few notes and you instantly recognize and hum along
I also like "Katiusa", from the USSR times, although I grew up hearing the romanian xxx version of it
But the melody is catchy
Russian stuff is pretty dope
Those guys really know how to make banger melodies
This [song from Serbia] and [this one from Bulgaria]
Personally like "Argonnenwaldlied" but I don't know if you can consider that a patriotic song
I also like Merck Toch Hoe Sterck and it's one of my favorite folk songs
Heil dir Im Siegerkranz is pretty cool
I think he went to Kyrgyzstan not Kazakhstan
The most famous natural disaster would be the 1977 earthquake
It destroyed a good part of our capital and killed around 1500 people while injuring almost 12 000
The psychological impact is even deeper as it created a general fear among the populace towards another potential earthquake that is still felt to this day
For those interested you can read more about it [here]
Adding to that is the Colectiv fire in 2015
aww i just saw the rendition of it on the last season of the crown
awful stuff
yet half of the historic center of Bucharest still lives in buildings that have been deemed a huge risk of collapse
We call them the Red Dots(Bulina Rosie) after the big red circle shaped warnings above their entraces
People that live in those gamble with their lives, and the sad thing is some might not afford moving
For what it's worth i've known people who had afternoon tea
When I was doing my Master's the people in my office and the professor would have a tea break with some pastries in the canteen at 4pm
Mostly because the canteen would close at 4 and sell anything they had left for pennies
(I know what my flair says btw, been in the UK for a few years now)
That thing is called Kürtőskalács here and it is very appreciated
Lol those are at literally every single market and tourist place in Romania
Even in places where no Hungarian has set foot for a generation, there will be a stand selling this stuff
They're pretty good though
Some would be :
- If you can easily break an apple in half, then your mother in law likes you
- During the wedding ceremony the groom and the bride should try to step on the others foot, to see who will be the head of the house
- You must never step on the threshold of a church door, it brings bad luck
- When you die you cannot be buried in clothes you got as a gift, because when you reach the other world those who gave you the clothes will take them back
- On New Years Eve you must wear red underwear and have some money in your pockets, for good luck in the year to come
The current pulls you
Romanians belive  that you can get sick if a breeze of air enters by the door and leaves by the window for example
Dude i tought these were romanian superstitions
If you rob a thief you have 100 years of good luck
Are you lucky enough to not go to prison
Does matter what belongings you steal of they have to be specifically the stolen ones
Does that make you a thief and someone who will steal from you will be lucky too
None
We used to cover our books and notebooks in primary school and label them with Name and Subject, but that was it
I had Notebooks :(, BUT:
Chemistry - blue
Biology - green
Physics - yellow (cuz I didn't like it)
Math - red
PS: you should make a bar graph for this now
You have the data, analyze it
Aren’t all folders yellow
Or turquoise if you use Mac
I came here expecting to see what color ppl use for windows folders
Maybe get some inspiration
This was disappointing and my day has been ruined
The disparity between the capital/large cities and the poor regions
I sometimes ride my bike outside Bucharest, it takes 30-40 kilometers to go 50 years back in time
My owl depressed ass wants to move to Sweden now
Meh, most people know about that
That’s a tricky question for countries like ours because people already sees only the worst parts
As an Eastern European I would say that the shockingly bad thing about Germany are the Healthcare services
Don't get me wrong, the system is generally good
However, if you're new in the city and you need a gynecologist, we'll, good fucking luck getting on the patient list of one
If you need some medical procedure, you might end up wanting half a year to get it and God knows how the disease will evolve by then
If you need a dental surgery, first you have to live with the pain like a real man for a couple of months and then maybe you'll get the surgery
And if you are rushed to the hospital, if you're unlucky enough, you might just get a pamphlet with the emergency surgery they'll do on you
Not a human being explaining to you what the hell is happening
There is nature too but plenty of Dutch
I have a holiday house next to Lake Tisza, a very remote part of Eastern Hungary and there are hundreds of Dutch people chilling there all summer long
Probably attracted by the cheapness of it too
Transylvania for the region
As for the city, I guess there's more than one, but maybe Brasov would be the most liked one
Maybe Brasov, or Iasi
Brasov for sure
Cluj
Cluj but its not my fav
Everyone says Bucharest is worst but i like it
Do you think Sibiu would count or is it not quite big enough
Timisoara and Oradea as well
I think Sibiu takes the cake, it's not about the size or population
I'm not taking it the wrong way
Transylvania is pretty much the only region in Romania apart from the Iași region that looks good and is developed
And that is because it was under Austro-hungarian rule for so long
If we had that since the beginning it would look like the gray depressing south
Honestly if you guys had it, it could be so much more
But eh
I feel somewhat of a local pride, thanks
I mean, it has an airport, a highway, good schools and universities (although probably not as good as Iaşi and Cluj)
It only lacks an Uber system
I always name them in English, it’s just the way it is
I write everything in English and mostly even think in English as well when programming (PS Stackoverflow is in English too
Everything in english , been doing it from highschool and university teachers were asking us to do it too
Some people prefer it over anything and there are always long lines but I find it lacking compared to kaufland
Still, no one makes jokes about it
It’s usually considered as high quality and everyone likes it
In Romania it's great, everyone loves it
In England it's so much more different than in continental Europe, but I still preffered it over Tesco or Sainsburys
It's cheap low variety here in Romania
I personally don't shop at Lidl unless I have no choice
It's the type of supermarket that serves a big high density residential zone, has everything, it's cheap but good quality for the money, families prefer to go to it because it's conveniently close and has a wide variety of products but not many brands to choose from
I myself prefer either Auchan or Kaufland
There are 3 categories of people
Those who preffer to buy a little bit cheaper and go to discounts like Lidl and those who don't care about discounts and go to Tesco
Others
it's good yea
They make the same jokes about Tesco
You're from Greece
You should be joking about your country, not about a supermarket
Romanian living in France here: not a problem in either country
I have friends of both sexes, and hang out with them even when my wife is not around, never was an issue, even with married friends
Of course, I always see a lot of kids in groups of boys and girls in equal number
As a kid I actually used to be friend with more girls than boys (but I’m strange so I don’t know if I’m a good example)
i think this applies to romania too
i think
That's just insecurities from her :(
Most cases of this kind of jealousy are coming from the fear that they alone would not be good enough to keep their boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever so anyone else is a liability
They already view their relationship as fragile and they already expect it to fall apart
Or I dunno, maybe you're friend had something else going on in her life that made her upset
Or some influence from someone toxic
They're all insecure
Certain things, and mentalities get perpetuated through behavior and become a cycle, until someone breaks the cycle
I say "alo
". Unless I'm at work in which case it's "strange_socks_, department of socks".
I swear if someone was to compile a list of everyday French behaivours and someone
else could just republish it as everyday Romanian behaviour,this is how much we love France
Romania was founded in 1859 so 161 years old
It depends what date you consider
As it is right now, 1918
There will be 102 years on 1st December
However, the country existed in different forms and under diverse powers way before of that
Well, the first Dacian Kingdoms were around since time immemorial, and we were the first humans in Europe
However, in terms of national unity, a few years come to mind:
61 B.C.: King Burebista starts campaign to unify Dacian kingdoms
(Later conquered by Romans
16o1: Mihai the Brave unifies the three principalities, shortly before his assassination
(At which point the three parts were again separated
1862: Alexandru Ioan Cuza become ‘Domnitor of Romania’. (But with only a fraction of the land
1878: Carol I secures proper independence for Romania
1918: Bucovina and Transylvania unite with Romania, in what is now celebrated as ‘Greater Union Day’ on the first day of December
In summary: Yes
It's actually 1877
>Well, the first Dacian Kingdoms were around since time immemorial, and we were the first humans in Europe
Source
For the latter are you talking about the Oase fossils,since there have since been older fossils of modern humans found in Europe
Yes
But Romania as a country was founded in 1859 after Wallachia united with Moldavia
As I said, depends on the date you consider
However we celebrate the 1st December 1918 union the national day, so it's the more widespread accepted one
Perhaps I was wrong, but I recall hearing that the oldest human fossils were found around Romania, Moldavia, and Ukraine
I’m not sure exactly where
...Forgot what
It makes very little sense to consider december 1st 1918 the Birth of Romania
That day was when Transilvania was incorporated into Romania,whereas may 22th  1877 is when the country declared independence from the Ottoman Empire,thus Romania is around 142 years old
The oldest human(Genus Homo)Fossils in Europe were found in Spain,and The oldest Modern Human (Species Homo Sapiens) Fossils in Europe were found in Greece
I know but I'm not the one deciding what people choose to celebrate
My point is that we’re old
Just because it's the national day does not mean that it has to be the countries birthday
France has it's national day on 14th july,the anniversary of the storming of the bastille of 1789,but France's birthday is August 843(or 3th of June 1944 if you want to count for how long the country has continously existed)
Ik, but again, I'm not the one choosing what people celebrate
Usually the stores that sell stuff like that (furniture or construction materials etc) offer you the option to deliver that to your home, for a small fee or for free, sometimes if you live in a village or very far they charge per km outside the city/town the store is located in
But people are inventive and I've seen lots who tie stuff on top of cars or borrow a bigger car from someone they know
Rental trucks are probably available, although I never heard of somebody doing that
From experience, it usually goes like this:
1- You think if it fits in the back of your car with the back seats folded
if not
2- Then you probably know someone who owns a van, or a friend or family member knows someone who owns a van
3- But if that also fails, then you ask the store to deliver it to your place , I assume there is a fee for this ( but idk for sure, never got this far)
> Just bought a grill in December, patio furniture earlier last fall
Fair enough on the other things, but usually here if you buy bulky stuff like that, the store/seller takes care of delivery
Either for a small fee (if the sale is under a certain value) or for free
[This massive bastard] for example would be like 22$ to deliver here
Tbh I'm very surprised it isn't free
If I were to build a bew house or completely re-do an old one and I was sure about what electronics would go where, I’d install cable runners and junction boxes and whatever else would be needed
But other than that, the cables are staying in view
The informal one would probably be "bonă" .Babysitter would be the formal one
In Romania the rich employ Filipinas as babysitters and/or housekeepers
As a result, oftentimes she’s referred simply as “filipineză” (“Filipina”)
we have *dădacă* in Romanian
I'm wondering if it's somehow related
Also, some older terms: ”dădacă” or ”doică”. "The Nanny" TV show was translated as ”Dădaca” :D
In Romanian too
From what I could find, it is
Nothing like that,only the teachers have something like an oven and a microwave in their office,and maybe a sink
Our country in general didn't have a budget
We literally had to turn the gym class in a classroom because we had no money to make another one
So, no, I didn't learn how to cook in my school but I can tell you the whole essay on Ion
It depends
If it's by naturalization (as in, first generation migrant) then language should be very important for aquiring a new citizenship
If it's by descendent/birth right (one parent of a certain citizenship) then language is of no importance
We actually still have romanians of hungarian ethnicity that don't speak romanian in our country ... It's simply bad for them if they leave their area but they're still romanian citizens
idgaf
This one right here
Sooner or later the poor fucker will find himself at a counter in front of an old and experienced Byzantine bureaucrat
Game over
drunk l ol
Is it better or worse than French
Impossible
Current or former art students, what's your university's policy on projects made while being a student
This question is mostly out of curiosity and because I'm pissed off for future students here
The art university here in Bucharest, where I graduated a few years ago, just passed legal terms saying that any work done during the study years in the university studios now legally belongs to the school, and they are allowed to sell it as well
Students are supposed to get 30% of that revenue (which I bet won't happen half the time)
The thing is, this university barely provides students with anything at all
You buy your own paper, your own art supplies, paints, etc
You even have to paint the walls and patch them up yourself before the final year exhibition
I initially did a year of a painting major and dropped out because I couldn't afford the huge costs and the teacher berating me for not using enough paint
I think this decision is awful and a gateway to a lot of teachers taking their students' work
I can't imagine not being able to take my work home if I want to because "it belongs to the school"....
What's it like where you are
That's really cool
Y'all northerners have really good school systems :(
We had Adobe CS 3 and the oldest slowest macs lol
Yeah it's definitely wrong
It's one thing doing stuff for work and another working on very personal projects in school only to have them taken away
My studio professor thought she was doing me a solid and sold literally all my work from the final uni project to random people who liked it
Even though she gave me the money, it was a measly sum I would never have agreed to
This is the kind of shit that goes on here lol
It was the same here for stuff that people didn't want to take home, or they just threw them away
That's fucked up
Considering a scientific discovery isn't exactly some random still life you've done 100 times before
Well that's crappy favoritism
That's really nice, and sounds like it should be the norm
But SAE also costs more than anyone I know can afford
She said it was all the money but like
I don't have any guarantees that she was honest
She asked like 10€ a piece
I didn't wanna sell it right away either, wanted to keep the pieces for participating in other exhibitions
Nah
We are antisocial
I can empathize soo much
I know the whole street XD
doesn't the cost come from registering it in Norway ? like a high percentage import tax depending on emissions or something like that ?
15 min walk to bus station, 25 min bus ride, 5 min from bus to work
20 minutes walk+ bus to my college
Bucharest, Romania: 35-40 minutes
I take the subway and a tram
To the office I have a 5 min walk to the tram station and a 25 minute ride on the tram
But I usually work from home
5 minutes by scooter, and I also know some backroads in case of heavy traffic
Professional driver POV:
It’s an unefficient brownian movement which takes 30 to 90 minutes per leg
Would benefit a lot from people using public transport or at least not sleeping behind their SUV’s steering wheel
I'm in Bucharest, Romania
Currently unemployed, but for my former job - it depends a lot on luck, can be anywhere from 25-40 minutes
Technically I had the option of a bus or a tram
I usually took the tram
Walked a couple of minutes to the station, waited - this is the luck part- between 1 and 15 minutes, rode the tram for 15-20 minutes, got off then walked for another 6/7 minutes
The way back usually took towards 40 min because I always waited ages for the tram and it was somehow always slow
This is a lucky commute in this city, most people commute between 40 min and 1 and 1/2 h
Enschede, Netherlands
15 to 20 minutes by bike
30 to 35 minutes by bus
Outside of London, 5 minutes walk
Can't complain tbh
By car: 15-30 mins in the morning, 30-45 in the evening
By public transport: 10 mins walk from home to the subway station, then 30-45 mins on the subway (switching line once)
On one of the lines, the train comes every 15 minutes, so the total time depends a lot on that
The subway station is right across the street from my office
20 min walk to get almost anywhere that I'm interested in ..work ,park,mall or city center
Same here
Except pants, underwear, or any kind of clothes are optional
Erin
I love it
Beatrice
I would have loved to name my daughter like that
Emily and Etienne
I dunno why I like em, but I do
Konrad sounds really cool to me
For a girl, I love the Hungarian name Timea
don't have one for a boy
M: Armin and Matteo
F: Cornelia and every other female greek name
Did my ancient ruler request me
It's great to see people talk about my country's history
> and stupid sexy Putin
Kek, ⅛ of the girls I know are named Ana-Maria
This is one of the most common names found in Romania :)
That's one of the most common name in my country
Alex/Alexandru for guys too
I know people who moved out when they were like 15, just because they lived too far out of the city and their parents, because of different reasons, couldn't get them to school or whatever since u kinda have to do it on ur own here
I also know ppl who live in the same house with their parents who are like in their forties but most of the time people move out when going to uni
Usually we move out when going to uni
Even if some of us don't, we still tend to move out, staying with your parents after 20 is not that common even though it's not looked down upon or something
Most of us move from the country side to more urban areas or we even leave the country
It all depends on the family's financial situation
It depends ..a lot of people move for school or university so can be anywhere from 14-18
If you happen to live in a city with an university there is a high chance you'll live with you're parents until you finish it
Here it depends, if you're from a small city and you have to move to a different town for university, that's probably when you'll move out of your parents house
In my case since I'm from Bucharest, I didn't move out until I was about 30 and only did it once i was getting married and had enough money to buy our own place
No point moving out earlier and wasting money on rent
And this is similar to all my friends who grew up in Bucharest
Idk if is strange but our royal crown is not made put of silver and from the steal of ottoman cannons captured during the indepence war
A huge part of our history from 1200s to the 1800s is showing the Ottomans the middle finger the best way we could
Stefan cel mare used music to lure attackers to one side of the kingdom so that they can ambush the attackers
Dude, Vlad the Impaler was child's play compared to this guy
Steel>gold
You do have Stefan The Great’s sword in your museum though
That is something at least
On the ATMs in Germany they have a sticker explaining that there's a dye bomb inside and it's written in Romanian, Bulgarian and Polish
Does this count
i was watching breaking bad and in one of the episodes i heard romanian in the background lol caught me by surprise
Such harsh graffiti people in Australia
You think so
Oh, yeah, of course, English as well, but you expect German and English
Vampires
Ffs we don't impale our enemies
Not anymore, that is
gypsies
Vampires
Totally
I've only seen 3 last year, and only one this year
They're pretty rare
How common are interracial couples in your region
You should get out more
Funny thing is that we don't have vampires in our folklore :P
Fair enough
I guess I used an American term
Not quite
They don't suck blood
They aren't afraid of sunlight, garlic or silver
They are undead tho
What I was told is that a strigoi is the soul of an stillborn baby, a vengeful person or the village witch that is coming from the dead at night to torture people and holy water does send them away
But they don't suck blood or kill, they just
Annoy
Haunt
Torture
Stuff like that
I feel so ashamed
Watch it every year, it's wonderful
Always been my dream to one day see it live
Live right now
During most of the 18th century, most of the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia were Greek nobles from the Phanar(Fener) district of Constatinople
I guess it's common knowledge that we had a medieval leader who impaled enemies (most of the time turks) and placed them around his castle walls
Or maybe those were the times it was actually measured in a fair way
> surrender his weapon, which was an air gun, in exchange for more beer
I approve and understand his dedication to the cause
> which would be around £30,000 today
Impressively cheap
Should we try to build one today I guess the project alone would be in the hundreds of thousands, with money from EU
I dont wanna be a dick, yes there were plenty of times when in Transylvania all these different groups of ppl manage to co-exist togheter (Timisoara and the banat region is such an example) but there a lot of occasions when vlachs,saxons revolted against the crown for vlachs the main reason was that after the schism between catholic and orthodox the position of vlachs became difficult this lead to some revolts and let's not forget about Unio Trium Natio in 1437 when even that vlachs represented a big part of Transylvania population they were considered "tolerated" from political point of view
Dont get me wrong i dont deny the fact that vlachs and magyars lived in harmony this happend especially during the early reign of Arpad dynasty and even later when vlachs were getting somewhat persecuted there were a lot of cases when vlachs and other orthodox ethnicities manage to get high ranked position
I completely understand
Yes i agree here a little missconception in our history is 1784 revolt is thst it was a vlach revolt against hungarian overlords when in fact it was a magyar,vlach,saxon etc revolt against the german,vlach,magyar overlords
Ha ha  pulla means dick in Romanian
They are eating pulă in Finland eh
Pula in Romanian means dick
it's also commonly eaten here
You people make the best decisions about food
Best food *and* best combinations
Indeed
You're being so delicate about
Just say it
*say it*!
Penis/dick/cock
That's what you're supposed to say
That Vlad the Impaler was King of Romania or that he ruled Transylvania
First of all he was a Prince/Voivode not a King
2nd of all Romania didn't exist as a unified entity at the time
And 3th of all
He ruled Wallachia not Transylvania
He was just born in Transylvania
Well, this might not be in Europe, but it's definitely a very interesting read
Well first of all the title
It's like calling Suleyman the Magnificent the Duke of Turkey
And 2nd of all the rules of succession
Unlike western Kings who were succeded by the eldest son, everyone could become a Wallachian/Moldavian voivode as long as they are related to the previous leader
Even if they were bastards
I'm not sure you can call salvation what happened before the Soviet Union took over
Let's remember that you carved up Poland and Romania at the beginning of the war alongside Germany, and deported and killed just as many civilians as Nazi Germany
The Germans hunted down the so called ,,undesirable'' minorities, while the Soviet Union didn't stop there and hunted down every minority, and sometimes even its own people
And let's not get started on the indirect victims of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the effects of poverty that came with the red plague
Did you ever run around and desert me
Tuborg Christmas Brew
It's a variation of a very popular brand of beer which for some reason is so much better
I always hunt for it in the supermarket as soon as December rolls in
No special beer here, but your glühwein
Oh yeah
that’s the preferred drink for the cold season
Edit: there’s also a variant of the homemade schapps (usually without syrup or herbal flavor, called țuica) made from distilled fruit that’s boiled and drank hot (add some sugar and pepper in the boiling process)
The more you know
Yes, very common here in villages and towns
In Romania's rural areas (people stash up on wood logs before winters) and in some mountain areas where it would be difficult to bring gas conducts all the way over there (slightly bigger sometimes touristic villages)
in the rural area here only
Actually not that common
A lot of Romania is heated using gas
Even the municipal heating systems of bigger towns use gas
Wood is for the countryside houses
And that exactly what I’ve said
That's a pretty good joke
Tokyo,Kyoto,Hiroshima,Nagasaki and Fukushima
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Saitama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki
Tokyo, Kyoto, yeah that's pretty much it
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Fukushima, Okinawa, Sapporo, Yokohama
Fukuokoa
Does that one exist
Without looking at other answers I will try my best:
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Fukushima, Kyoto,Nagoya, Kobe, Fukuoka and I can't remember now that northern island's name where there is a city that is colder than average
So 10 overall
Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nagoya
I obviously know more, but can't think of them off the top of my head
oh yeah Nagaski and Hiroshima too
For Romania, [Florian Pittis]
Not sure how aware the younger generations are of his documentary work for Teleenciclopedia, but he used to be THE voice for that
In Romania it has to be Telenciclopedia
Younger kids may not know her,but a few of us,who grew up in the 90's and  early 00's,got most of our useless facts from her sliky voice
Hell,I know a girl who went on to have her bachelor's degree in biology because Telenciclopedia had an episode on celular activity that she liked very much
This is the kind of impact that makes me call a show iconic
His voice brings back a lot of childhood memories
Sure we do, we have one of those tiny portable grills that we do the sandwiches on
No pickles
You've just made an enemy for life
Ion Iliescu
Our 2nd president
He tried to sell us to the Russians and refused union with Moldova
Are you sure these guys are not regarded as heroes
There's a special mouth of the Satan in the middle of hell for him
Fuck
Him
He was pro-Russian
In fact many suspect that he may have been a KGB agent
Exactly
If it wan't for CDR to steer us towards the pro-Western direction
We can safely say that we would have become Belarus 2
We tried the option of not being on either side in 1940 and you guys just claimed parts of the country that didn't belong to you
Romania can't fight Russia alone if that happens again
Also what kind of advantages would an alliance with Russia offer
Your economy is barely holding, you don't have any resources that Romania needs and can't buy from the west, and the Russian state is a corrupt apparatus that grinds people into poverty
Also Ukraine was allied to Russia and look how that turned out
If you consider "being a slave to Russia" better than "being a slave to western Europe" than it is nit better, but almost every eastern european would prefer being a "slave to the west"
It's rumored that Bonaparteb said that the Russians are a nation of devoted slaves ruled by a ruthless aristocracy
And quite frankly it still holds to this day
Yesterday
Our PM (de jure) said she teached maths, then she also said the circle's surface is the radius squared
Edit: ex- PM
De jure and de facto she's not our PM anymore
Parliament voted Orban
Ludovic Orban
But she's running for president
Our meme culture has material
Just that she isn't our PM anymore (not de jure, not de facto)
Maybe she ate the pi, it was a good pi
She was but now she’s running for president, and practically all the candidates suck tbh
She was literally an art teacher before becoming a PM
She can’t even speak romanian properly
And she’s running for president
It’s just sad at this point
Yeah lol
Thank god no
He's meme-y enough as it is
Hate fkr each other
r/technicallythetruth
all of these apply to Romania too other than being tall
Is it like the difference between Romanian and Moldovan
Like, just an accent difference and a few regional words
i went to Cluj and I thought I crossed the border /s
I have small "cultural" shocks everytime I travel +100 km around where I live
The greater the distance - the greater the differences
But I love it
I love to the bottom of my heart the diversity in people, the small language nuances, their habbits, their traditions and even the geographical differences
It makes me feel grateful we are not the same
It makes me understand better the background that connects us all and gets me out of my comfort zone
Once you live for too long in the same place surrounded by the same people you start thinking the whole world is or should be like that
And it isn't and won't be
We are different based on a countless number of variables: from the altitude to the family history
Even if some patterns exist, the more you travel the more you realise how fragile and unrelated to reality those patterns are
Once I realised this, I also realised same applies to any country in the world
Except maybe Luxemburg
Or Vatican
They really small :))
I had exactly the same shock
First time I was in Germany it was work related and it was in a small town in Bavaria
People told me to leave my bag hanging at the entrance
Imagine the shock I had, coming from Bucharest
I thought about it a lot and realized that I also grew up in a small town in Romania where it was perfectly ok to sleep with your door opened or leave your phone on the table without even thinking someone might steal it
I suppose small comunities protect themselves better from criminality due to the complete lack of events they have
After that, I went to Munich for a couple of times and though whole Germany is like that
Imagine my shock when I discovered Frankfurt
I was like: WTF
Next on the list is Berlin and hopefully it will not be work related so I can have a decent visiting and a better understanding of your culture
Well no shit, why would they
You never know when albania could suddenly conquer the world
Better be prepared
Hah, ler and crumpeni are used in Transylvania, but not in the rest of Romania
I learned most of my Hungarian from my Székely grandparents
I got loads of these
(When 3 words are given they mean "deep dialect" - "proper local speech" - "alien speech from Hungary")
Törö[k]buza - kukorica
Fuszulyka - paszúly - bab
Vinétta - padlizsán
Pityóka - krumpli - burgonya
Tészta - sütemény
Laska - tészta
Your accent sounds like the ones over the border in Partium (I grew up in Nagyvárad/Oradea)
In romanian it's called ***Ministerul Apărării Naționale*** ( Ministry of National Defence) but most people call it **MApN** (M-A-P-N) or **Ministerul Apărării**.
Ministerul Apărării Naționale - MApN - _Ministry of National Defense_
I am Romanian and never cooked sarmale
I'm an atheist
Hate slanină (smoked pig's fat) or any other greasy food for that matter
Can't stand Romanian music, other than indie/rock bands
I'm not at all traditional, which means I don't want to have kids or get married in a church (say that to the women in my familly, they are gonma flip), nor "taking care" of my "husband" like handwashing his dirty underpants or stinky socks
If I'm going to live with my future boyfriend/girlfriend, we are gonna share the household chores (say that to my dad, he will flip)
I don't know how to dance horă
I cant stand traditional music and dancing
But you enjoy eating them
Well who doesn't
Robin and the backstabbers, The monojacks, Cred ca sunt extraterestru, Aproape Unplugged, Nava Mama, Coma, Eyedrops, Purple dandies, Kryptonite sparks, Mr jurjack, vie daca
Of course, the classiscs Bucovina, Vita de Vie (I love Viţa de vie-Alungă tăcerea), Pheonix, Alternosfera (those are from Moldavia) There are more, I love discovering Romanian indie music, we have a beautiful melodic language that can transmit such emotion and imagery and yet, we are stuck  with shitty pop-electronic bullshit with simple minded lyrics and basic beat on the radio
It is pretty tough
Even some of my friends are pretty traditional and conservative
I'm more of a centrist myself, yet I still spark controversy among my peers
"Ce vii ca turcii
" - "Why are you rushing like turkish
" it is used in situations like: you want to get on a busy bus, and you accidently bump hard into someone
Bă, ești turc
Are you Turkish
(angry tone)
This comes from the Ottoman times, I guess
It translates to "Do you understand me
" Or "Are you deaf
" Or "Do you not know this language I speak in
Ca la americani
Like over at the Americans
Post - Cold war, usually interprets that America is a luxury land, the technology is booming etc
să te îneci ca țiganul la mal
to drown like the gypsy at the shore (that part with the depth not even a meter)
Not a nationality but I had to include it
It means roughly to fail at something terribly simple
Ești turc
"Are Turkish
" Do you not understand
Yeah, you can say "the Tatars are coming" when you are in a rush for no reason
"Are you Turk
" meaning you're
well, no offense Turkey, stupid
The last one might not be as popular, but my mom and grandmother uses them quite a lot
"Jewish soul" meaning you're a bad person
Also using the derogatory term for Jews in Romanian and not the standard one
Don't you guys use Wallachia as a metaphor for 'in the middle of nowhere' ?
We also have something similar
> S-a înecat ca țiganul la mal  ("He drowned like the gypsy on the shore", when you started working on something but you give up at the very end)
Which comes from a very disturbing and racist history: in the time when gypsies were enslaved, there were ones that tried to run away but were caught and brought back
For the ones not """lucky""" enough to be tortured as a form of punishment, the slave owners would pretend to give them the opportunity of winning their freedom, all they had to do is swim across a lake with their legs tied up
As soon as they would reach the shore they would be pulled back in the lake, again and again, until the slave, exhausted from the sheer effort, would end up drowning
Of course, this served not only as a punishment but as a means of entertainment for the slave owners as well as a warning for the other slaves, who were forced to watch
>Siedzieć jak na tireckim kazaniu
We also have a similar saying in Romanian: "Eşti turc
" (Are you turkish
) it's used when someone doesn't understand something
We also use that "Pampas"
Dark humor (including sexism, racism and the other things) seems to be common here, not so much in other countries
It's stigmatized here to not address yourself to another person in plural if they're a stranger/teacher/authority/etc
Same in France I believe
Hating gypsies I guess
In Romania 95% of them are very bad and 4% are bad
So we naturally hate them because they do bad things like shout like crazy at nights, don't wash, steal, mug, rape, beat, piss on the streets, shit on the streets, throw trash on the steets, bully or beg
On top of all that they go in other European countries and do those bad things and WE get the -rep
We hate them so much that we even associated the Romanian word for gypsy (țigan) with words like thief and homeless
I knew you are from Czechia when I saw the notification on my phone
Also well
saving this lol it's exactly the same in romanian
Popular in Germany, too
Fuck off, Jenny, I don't want to buy your novelty condoms, so take your drunk cohort wearing personalised t-shirts, and your miniature Kümmerlings, and gtfo
>:(
Yes
[30 years of democracy] is a 3 hour long story of the politics, economics and society of Romania since the fall of communism
It has interviews with presidents and prime ministers from these years, and tells a pretty interesting story of descent into chaos and the start of a return of better times
On a lighter note, Chuck Norris vs Communism is on Netflix and Amazon and tells the story of an underground operation to dub foreign (mostly American) movies in Romanian in the 80s. It was a huge operation to dub the movies, copy the dubs to VHS tapes, distribute the tapes as well as the cassette players
It even involved some members of the Securitate IIRC
I wholeheartedly recommend [Untamed Romania] (nature) and [Flavors of Romania] (food)
They’re both on Netflix or similar platforms e.g. iTunes, Vimeo, Prime etc
These german guys(i think) from DW documentary have endless documentaries that might just be the thing you are looking for
Nobody got love for [Flavours of Romania]
I've seen them and I wholeheartedly endorse this recommendation
It's very interesting to learn of the functioning of such an important global player
Exactly
You're right, it kind of stops in 2017 iirc
But if anything, really understanding how far our politics and economics fell in the 90s has made me more forgiving of the current situation, and more optimistic
Like
We're digging the way out of a really deep hole
[sigh] This is one of the things that gets on my nerves, some people not understanding how bad it really was and how far we've actually come
They think it maybe wasn't that bad compared to today
It was the bottom of the pit
I always recommend that doc to people, so that they see exactly why the last 30 years looked like this and not better
Giving towels to the priest and to other people at funerals
(I don’t know if it is all country thou)
Romanian 'Paparude'. This is a tradition older than christianity in Romania
It was practiced by the pagans as a rain dance
Children would make costumes out of vegetation and tree bark, dance barefoot and the boys splah girls with water
It is still practiced in the more remote countryside, even tho the people there are highly religious orthodox cristians
At funerals in Romania we give away towels, many towels
At my grandmother funeral we gave away 100 towels at least
As a foreigner that's the pinnacle of British culture to me
Same here
In Transylvania, the rose water thing is common, and on 6 December, children leave their boots by the door and St
Nicholas will bring them either candy if they're good, or a stick if they're bad(so the parents can beat them)
These sticks are sold in supermarkets around 6 December
Thanks for the copypasta
Isn't that a Spanish thing
Or is it in Portugal too
Hmm
not where I'm from
That looks quite nice
All of Romania does the exact same
But why tho
Whiping bitches, burning witches
I think this is a common thing in Europe
Romanians do it too
What witch culture
Never heard of such thing
There are indeed gypsy fortune tellers and I think they are also paid to curse people, but I am not sure how widespread you believe this is haha
I think I've heard about this topic at most 3-4 times in total
Vlad Tepes
I mean impaling people just to send a message was pretty bad
I'm a Ruthenian living in Romania, it's unfortunate that we got assimilated as Ukrainians everywhere
Harry Potter said we have dragons, was that a lie
Impale me daddy like I'm one of your ottomans demanding tribute
Yea I mean doing it to ottoman invaders
okay, different times yadda yadda
But he also did it to beggars or petty thieves, I think that was a little bit extreme no matter the period we talk about
Someone was paying attention at history class
Hmm, this gives me ideas
I'll make the equivalent of German porn dungeons, but wallachia inspired
Should be fun
Let's not forget that you could've also avoided invading Serbia, but you just had to do it
the font and spacing on ours looks better to me compared to most of the others
but i may be biased
i also like the shade of blue
I like ours
County code (2 letters, or 1 if it is the capital)
2 numbers
3 letters (can be custom or random)
Can be p versatile and rather easy to parse
Example combos: AG 47 GUY or IS 66 TIV or B 08 BIS
Also the fact that you can customize them makes it pretty cool
A lot of countries don't allow this or it costs a fortune to do it
Well here in Romania it would be Cluj, and Oradea would be the second
Cluj's growth is mainly due to the IT industry (sometimes refered to as the Silicon Valley of Romania) and all sorts of international companies like Emerson who just opened a new Appleton base last week, Bosch who expanded last year, as well as others
With Oradea I am not so familiar but from what I know they did really good with convincing companies to open bases through subventions and a very well thought out infrastructure suitable for industrial/logistical parks
Oradea
This city grew so much in the last 20 years
It's an example for all of Romania
Happiest people, most green space, safest place etc
We are lucky with our administration
One of the best in the whole country
Cluj in romania is by far the most flourishing  . Honorable mentions are Timisoara and Sibiu and maybe Iasi (but Iasi is developing because of the nearby areas which are very poor so naturally people are moving there , but it's not like Iasi is a very wealthy city , even for romanian standards) .Usually the west of the country is developing much faster due to proximity from rest of Europe
&#x200B;
Bucharest is also developing but that's because it's the capital (a lot of big companies from all around the world have the romanian headqurters in Bucharest) but not because the quality of live is getting better or something like this
Meh, out of 200 countries recognized by UN more than 3/4 have severe corruption problems so we are not unique at all, if anything the functional countries are the rarity here
Same as you guys: 50/50
Although I think the z with the slash is more common for children or people that learned how to write during communism
In university most of my colleagues wrote in a very "sloppy way" or very "typewriter-like" so a lot of the calligraphy we're taught just goes away at some point (unless the commies drilled it into your head)
While I'm still in highschool, a lot of people write z and Z with a line in the middle, since it's easier to know for sure that's a Z and not some other letter
There are some cases of people who don't draw the line, but there are few and far between and practically non existent in the older generations
Elderly especially still write in cursive
Wait
What
How
That's one funky z.
Nah,not that common
But im at a new school and im in a cpass with everyone epse having 2 names
Im the only one with one name
Yes
If you are Romanian and you have parents/grandparents that are at least slightly religious people, chances are you have a second name, usually one of them is from a saint
yep, very common
*random*: Peanut butter and jelly
Monster trucks (even if I like them)
Those churches where you sing
Welcoming your new neighbours with pie (*only seen it in movies
Is it even a thing
Those shirts that some wear on holidays
With sandals
And long socks
Wtf
Using Lbs and "miles" like smh
Smiling at Strangers
That is really odd as a European I find it so weird when they do that since we dont do it here
Also they are very loud
I was in a restaurant in Frankfurt Germany once and they literally were so loud that I heard their entire conversation about guns and the USA
Hope this doesn't offend anyone I'm just really curious as to why that happens
Bumper stickers saying "God bless the police" and "The Lord protects the police" and so on
I don't think I have ever seen a country where the police is glorified, let alone to this extent
Everyone else hates the police or are at most neutral towards it
The whole allegiance to the flag thing in school, we don't have this here (though we do sing the anthem in music class) and I find it very weird, we don't even have flags inside the classroom
Our flags are usually in flag poles in a hallway or outside on the school building
Anything that has to do with food
And the weird friendlyness
And the honesty that isn't honest all the time
I always find Americans to be "off", like an uncanny valley of behavior
But it's never something in particular that seems strange
Just a general vibe
Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the ones I've met, it's just something there that I can't really figure out
Walking in your outdoor shoes around the house or even in bed
Seriously, wtf
I heard that Americans make small talk with random people
Idk how it is in the rest of my country but here if you don't know someone,don't look at them
Interestingly we tip in Romania too
Everyone from waiters to gas station attendants to hotel receptionists
> Peanut butter and jelly
Chiar am încercat unt de arahide și gem (n-am avut jeleu) pe pâine și mi s-a părut surprinzător de bun
Donno
In orthodox churches people don't really sing because nobody understands what they are saying :)) we barely understand what the story line is
I never understood
Is just like: "aaaaa aaaaaa Jesus all mighty aaaa aaaa  God all mighty aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa *someone* said something aaaaa aaaamin". I always feel like this part in Life of Brian:
Thank you for the neighbours update
Now I can watch your movies knowing it is not true :))
But not the flower themed shirts some Americans  added as a bonus :))
Yeah, but who had the most colorful and visible shirt/ t-shirt signaling "look at my socks and sandals as I walk past your beautiful architectural jewelries or landscapes
Because we don't really understand what they are saying and therefore can't sing :))))))  Yeah, it's kinda weird for foreigners when they get in contact for the first time with an Orthodox church
It's a lot to take in
My ex boyfriend was Catholic and Romanian but never went to an Orthodox Church before dating me
I thought it would be fun to see his face when going in one of our churches
Hell it was
He was like: "what the f*uck
Why is there so much gold
Why so many paintings
What are they singing
What are they wearing
What is this
" :))))
Mie nu mi-a plăcut :)) dar cred ca din cauză că nu imi place combinația dulce-sărat
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
Liberty and justice for all
That's all I know from it
Cuz movies
I've been to many places in Europe and I have never seen other Europeans smiling at strangers
People just mind their own business you know but maybe I haven't seen it lol
I’ve seen them in Texas and Arizona
“especially the snipers” sounds like something out of a Monty Python skit
Never seen a sticker saying bless doctors or firefighters but police and the military, Hells yeah
You do you America
It's weird how people I've never met act like they're my childhood friends :/
I like the space and time Europeans give me to actually get comfortable around them
I mean I know for a fact from people who worked in the industry that if you don't tip the waiters \*will\* spit in your food and hotel receptionists \*will\* lie and say there are no rooms available
Cred că este așa un gust câștigat
Not necessairly
Small churches- just the priests and their help
Bigger churches - choir
But there are always some old ladies thinking they still have what it takes to sing along
I can imagine it's a matter of region
In my hometown we wouldn't bake or make baskets but if we had a new neighbour that we liked we used to share cookies or fruits or flower seeds for gardening
When I grew up it was a shock to move in a town where neighbours don't even greet themselves
I was the only one saying "good morning". 15 yrs later I still do it
I believe people can change using the power of example
Asa au zis si cand m-au obligat să mănânc spanac  never again
:))
I'm not the kind of person to wish even more oppression on working class people thank you very much
I do cause I'm not a class traitor
[HQ of the Romanian Union of Architects]
[Another photo]
Romanians have poor taste, so I’m going to nominate the [Elbphilharmonie] in Hamburg, Germany as a great example of modern, recent, architecture
I think it’s awesome both out and in
See also [this] [this] and [this] because a cool building deserves cool publicity
None
We can't build something good-looking to save our lives
>Romanians have poor taste
This is so damn true, I can't remember the last time I saw something well-made and aestethic
It's like we are injected with kitsch and shitty tastes when we are born
I hope this generation of kids will have better ideas
Lol I enjoyed your presentation
You could assume selling marijuana is illegal in Europe and you’d be right 99% of the time
For starters I'd just start with the European Parliament
I'd switch from national lists to european parties voted by everyone, essentially creating a new type of politician focused at european levels
Then the parliament can take on more roles and be the higher body of EU
The current system is very lacking with nationals voting for parties they prefer at the national level and european groups keeping around weird as fuck parties vor seats (like S&D keeping the romanian party PSD)
Essentially right now voting for a european group you like might require giving power to corrupt members and that needs to be changed
If we do that in time it's my opinion that further integration would be reached simply from inertia
Having Esperanto adopted as the official languages, although other national languages should not be supressed
Full integration and the spark of European nationalism
We should be able to rival USA and plunge into another competition, or something like a cold war but not with commies
Yes, all the way to federalization
I think it's important to prioritize infrastructure and transport (particularly the rail system), higher education (further expanding on the Bologna system and healthcare (too much variation in between healthcare cost and quality within the union rn imo), integrate all non-Schengen members and secure the outer borders, same for the Eurozone
More integration when it comes to telecommunication and media, stuff like phone contracts and data costs
That would require also a major restructuring of the EU parliament by diverting more power from individual states to it
I don't agree with alarmists who say that would lead to the end of country-specific cultural identity
>You can't tell a Spaniard and Finn that they're the same
But Spaniards and Finns are people too
Jokes aside, I think what people want is a single currency, an integrated railway, a bit more intervention from the union and stuff like that, not an elimination of culture
I would even argue that the cultures of European countries are not *that* different anyway
We all have a similar core of beliefs in the end (and I'm not talking about religion)
It's not like Spain is burning witches at the stake and Finnland has a ministry of magic
Well, you know all of your parliament members
How about a normal day-to-day person in your country
Consider that right now there's lots of countries where you just have lists (unordered ones) and people vote only for the local party that gives out european positions as rewards
This highly differs then most national elections
I'd argue this is part of the reason why they feel they are run by Brussel
Since there's no accountability feeling
Even if you're mad at a policy normal people don't know or fell they can blame an elected person or party, you now can only blame Brussel
No one feels that they could rally up with people from a neighbouring country and penalize politicians at the next elections since that's not what we're voting right now
That said, that also means no one from Europe (even if we're still talking about a co-national) has to come and convince you that he did a good job and you should vote for him again
Or campaign that at the european level he knows of your problems and you're not alone
So I think the moment we make this change people will start feeling more in power and transfer that blame to someone palpable
Someone that they might vote against or for
Exactly, that would change as a result
>Yes I am aware of who represents me in the EU parliament and I also know that they have a special interest in specific issues which may effect Sweden more than other countries
This ~~would~~  wouldn't (this is a late edit, I meant to say wouldn't) change
This would get more powerful
That's my main point
And good for you for knowing who represents you
>When I voted in the EU election I voted for the candidate who I thought would best represent my views in the EU parliament
Because the voting system isn't unified a lot of people didn't have this option
They voted for a party who had a list (maybe ordered, maybe not)
>I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but I don't think a European list is the only solution
If we managed to increase people's engagement in EU politics the current system could work fine
Just look at the article 13 situation; people in various European countries were trying to hold their own national representatives accountable
I don't see how the situation would have been different with a European list
Yes, but I asked you if you know who represents you because I was being a realist
Most people don't. And most people don't have a clue
And most people don't engage in politics (or outside community politics that directly and tangebly affect them from one day to the other)
And look at article 13, because that's exactly my point
Maybe you just happened to not have this problem but what if those pro-article 13 were from the national party you wanted to represent you
Or what if those anti-article 13 were from the national party you simply couldn't vote for
Not to mention that EU's work doesn't stop at just that law
Actually I fell that article 13 (at least in the final law) is the least of our problems
Local representives from european parties would need to explain their position everywhere to keep or win their seats at the next elections, as opposed to being eclipsed by purely local issues
Keep in mind that pure european parties doesn't mean we'd vote only for lists of unknown names
Actually I'm not even suggesting a voting system, just pure european parties and a unified (same everywhere) system
Everything else would be up for debate, hell even FPTP would make sense in the european Parliament
>Just look at the article 13 situation; people in various European countries were trying to hold their own national representatives accountable
It's weird that you feel this way since most would say there was no accountability at all
Simply put the seats changed a bit, if at all, because of that EU-wide issue
There were some protests, yes
But I don't fell or think those got really translated in votes
The main problem is that in this current manner there's absolutely no way I would want the Parliament having more powers
On the other hand the Parliament should have more power since it's absurdly week right now
So really, I can't think of any other solution
And I do believe that if day-to-day voters (outside this reddit sphere) from different countries are given the chance to collectively discuss upcoming elections and feel they have the power to change the result rather then simply wait for Merkel and Macron to state their preferences, then euroscepticism will fall and a greater sense of integration and community will be achieved
Wait
Pizza was brought into the world by magic
Yes in Romania but just a little
Same here, I think each participant tends to focus on their own part and then put it in the general aspect of the war
With a special focus on _some_ parts in countries that were part of the soviet block (behind the Iron Curtain), because why not picture history in a particular way if you can (yes, I am ironic about it)
Old school popcorn
My favorite it’s the Romanian Atheneum, a magnificent piece of Neoclassical architecture and eclecticism, inspired by the Pantheon of Rome itself
It was built with money from donation, a building that unites every Romanian
The most impressive from a engineering, architectural and scale it’s undoubtedly the Palace of Parliament, it’s not a beautiful building for many, but you can’t deny the raw manpower needed in order to built this building
Castelul Peleş, Castelul Huniazilor
google this and you will want to move here
The palace of the parliament(Bucharest)
The column of the infinity( Targu Jiu)
Kissing gate(Targu Jiu)
These are 3 of the most interesting, but the most impressive is the palace of the parliament, it's the second biggest building in the world, after the Pentagon
:))
That's Romania, a country with tradition in sculpture and architecture
:))
•Arcul de Triumf (Arch of Triumph), it has the greatest victories from Romania's history on it
It was inspired from the Paris one - another object that made the Bucharest "The Little Paris" .
•Ateneul Român - Un leu pentru ateneu
•Casa Poporului (People's House) - Made in the Cold War and finished after, it received the titles of "The second biggest building", "The Heaviest building" , "The biggest administrative building", "The most expensive house", and "One of the most important buildings (?)"
Every material what was used in the building of it was made NATIONAl - no imports
°Fun fact° It has an underground level as big as the Height of the entire building
•Coloana Infinitului (The infinte collumn), Poarta Sărutului (The Kissing Gate), Masa Tăcerii (The silence's table) - All made by Constantin Brâncuși.
•Iasi and Alba Iulia are the cities that has a lot of cultural interest
•Castelul Bran (The Bran castle)  °want some vampires
;) °
•Catelul Peleș (The Peleș castle)
Etc
There are a few contenders:
-the palace of the Parliament in Bucharest
- Peles castle
- Constanta casino (too bad for its current state)
- the wooden monstaries of Maramures (Barsana in particular)
My favorites probably have to be the Peles Castle in Sinaia, the Palace of Culture in Iasi and the Romanian Atheneum in Bucharest, tho most of the pre-communist buildings are also very beautiful
I'd say the best are the Palace Of Parliament followed by the Romainan Ateneu
None of them compare to buildings like the Sagrada familia in Barcelone though
Viena is by far the most beautiful city I ve ever been too
Architecturally speaking and taking into account all the history
Wish it wasn't so expensive to live there
We will meet again
Bus controllers, jandarmeria and minecraft server admins
Politician in Romania
For Romanian standards DB is abso-fucking-lutely amazing
But then again our standards are somewhat under the sea level
We don't have infrastructure to go anywhere, but we can download *aaaaaall* the movies *at once*
Funny how the Chinese government should throw accusations about not respecting human rights
Edit: a word
Hmm
stereotypical you say
Today I was poor
Oh, wait
That was yestarday too
And the day before
S#it
I am living and walking stereotype and I don't even feel bad about i!t!
I taught someone how to pirate shit lmaoo
I sometimes wear my hoodie like a cape and pretend im Dracula
Also fengs with breadsticks
Eastern European too
My parents still make shitload of schnitzels when they go on a road trip
I'm a dual citizen
I was born in Moldova to Moldovan parents so I have that
I also have "regained" Romanian citizenship, by proving that my ancestors (actually only my grandparents) were born in Romania to parents of Romanian descent and citizenship
They didn't move - the border moved when the USSR annexed Moldova in 1940, and they became citizens of the Moldovan SSR
This is the case for a big chunk of Moldova's population
I think not only allowing, but *encouraging* people to re-gain their citizenship was a fantastic move by the Romanian state
It leads to more economic collaboration, more exchange of experiences, and ultimately convinces more people on both sides that we are the same nation
Now I live in a third country and will apply for citizenship in the fullness of time, so I can have a say in the running of this place
That does not make me less Romanian, so why should I have to renounce that citizenship
I am not allowed dual citizenship in Spain and it's very very frustrating for me
Because my family and I get discriminated quite a lot when searching for jobs and even for driving lessons
Having a Spanish citizenship would just get rid of so many issues I have with employment
But, although my brother is happy to renounce the Romanian citizenship, I am not
I don't wanna give up my true identity lol even tho I think I fit well here, I don't wanna turn my back on my own land
I wish they approve of them soon
Because we came here for better opportunities
And because I think having dual citizenship is just better
If there's ever a big conflict here I could always go back to Romania, and if there's a conflict in Romania I could always return back here
Do you see what I mean
It's just more useful
And it's infuriating that my moroccan friend can have it but I can't lol
Not even my peruvian boyfriend can have dual
I don't understand how they make the decisions of which country yes and which not
Also, I want to eventually go back to Romania but I feel very out of place there between the people as I basically grew up in Spain and they're quite different
Plus the pay in Romania is awful, all of my family back home struggle a lot
And I would miss my friends from here
I don't really know anyone in Romania or have any friends left there
It's a bit scary
that's a very ignorant question
what's wrong with living in one country and caring about both ( your birth country and your current one)
if he contributes , pays his taxes , obyes spanish laws but stil has a connection with his birth country, who are you to ask such a stupid question
Because I'm romanian
And I'm not gonna ignore my real ancestry
Lol
That's like when people say why use the native tongue at home cuz if you live in a different country you must assimilate
I can feel both spaniard and romanian but I'm still romanian
My dna is romanian
My family is romanian
My childhood was romanian
My culture is romanian lol
French
French is least
I think it sounds disguisting
But Italian is beautiful
Definitely Spanish, if like to learn it one day too
is there a big difference between Danish and Swedish
wow that’s so interesting
i don’t know why but i always assumed scandinavian languages were very similar to each other
thanks
i just opened up Bergen and Vaksdal in Hordaland to compare, and the difference is incredible despite their proximity, that’s fascinating
Poland
I feel like we are very similar in many aspects, both our communities abroad are very negatively seen unfortunately and we both got a lot of shit from the Brexit campaign in the UK
Also it's arguably that got fucked the most in recent European history, so it annoys me when the West talks shit about them
Serbia
I like them
They sure did mistakes, but this doesn't make them all a genocidal nation or whatever crap I read here about them
Hungary
We may have issues, but this doesn't mean I don't like Hungary and Hungarian people
Only we can call them names, you are not allowed to :P
Stay away from Serbia, or I'll cut you
Leave Poland alone T.T. Poland went through enough shit, they deserve some rest
Hungary
Only we can make fun of Hungary
Moldavia
Moldavia is our little brother, you mess with Moldavia, you mess with us
Moldova, they our bros, literally
Britain + every Balkan country
Thank you mate
D'awww
We respect you, but we don't really mean it when we talk shit about Hungary, unless it's football
“How do I explain to my non-balkan friends that my mom calls me “mom”?”
My parents used to call me "pui" or "puiuț", which literally means baby chick (or its diminutive)
Nuca, from Dienuca (nickname for Diana) and it literally translates to "walnut".
The male version of my name
I have a brother and he was called by the female version of his name
My parents thought they were hilarious
Other than that my mom calls me "guriță" sometimes, which means "little mouth". It's a regional thing, I guess, because my grandma called her that too
People tend to get confused when I tell them that my father calls me, a girl, "dad"
I believe it's a thing in some Spanish speaking countries as well
Edit: not sure about Spain, but I think Mexicans and other Latin Americans call their children "mami/papi" as a term of endearment
They never called me that but I am aware of the concept :)
>my mother would call me "müsli"
For a second there I thought your mother calls you cereal
Parents would literally call the kids their own “title” as a term of endearment
“Hai, mai, mama” = “C mon mom” trying to make you do something
Weird but it works
We brothers are too headstrong to call anybody our older brother, regardless of age
It’s either ‘younger brother’ or ‘brother’ in my experience
The Romanian course teaches you amazing sentances about our country such as "We live in a monarchy".
We haven't had a king since 1947
I used it for German and French
For German it's good for practicing and learning words
But it's crap at teaching you rules and exceptions to the rules
For French it's structured waaaaay better
It explains the rules several times
It has these exercises where you're supposed to repeat a rule over and over
So you can actually learn French grammar, but it's crap at teaching you how to pronounce stuff
For Romanian , it is awful  , they teach Romanian but you see there is a diference betwen the romanians they learn you on duolingo and accuall romanian , for example that romanian is so wierd that when i heard it on my new classmate who was from bucharest , we all laught at his funny romanian
Tbf, duolingo was better at teaching me German than the A2 course I got from the university (it was taught by a person that just finished studying pedagogy)
But you're right that it's not gonna get you very far
Pharmaceutical ads and gambling ads . They banned Cigarette ads so thats a start
The drugs commercials which have the following template:” have you ever felt like
you might have a .... deficit
The following drug doesn’t require a prescription “   . Also alcohol
diesel cars under euro 5
I second this
Especially for politicians
Well it is in the administration
Is it legal to litter in Luxembourg
Bribes with extra steps
I almost got fined for sitting on a bench right next to the rookzone
And they explained that there is a designated square around that pole and you cannot be outside of it (the square wasn't marked)
So some stations do enforce that rule
They should enforce it more strictly tho
I think that guy let me go just because i was still close to that pole
But if I were far away, I'm pretty sure I would've gotten a fine
And I should be getting fined for not following a simple rule like that
I mean, it's not that hard to move to a designated zone, as the smoke bothers a lot of people
And it also keeps the rest of the platform clean
I really don't understand why smokers wouldn't follow such a simple rule
Well, in there are stories here in Braşov, Braşov (Brassó/Corona/Oraşul Stalin/Kronstadt), Transilvanya that there lives A Dragon in the "Tâmpa" mountain
I don't think there are people who still refer to Braşov as Oraşul Stalin
In my area at least, idk how wide spread they are in Romania
Some female ghosts, usually bride souls, but depending on the persons you ask it can be any unmarried girl spirit known to dance around in the fields/around wells for some reason around midnight and up to like 2-3 am and if they see you passing by you are fucked (also, a funny story, there was this thing that if you step in their hora any part of you that entered will be cut off instantly which is completely contradictory to the rest of the legend and yeah
) these ghosts are usually called iele
Dunno, but it got stuck in my head since 2018 when I was part of a partnering between my school and the museum I  the town's square about it
Today I learned that nordic countries bring their own drinks to parties and consider it rude to drink without previously asking
I'm still  processing this information
I can't even imagine
This seems fair and common sense to me :)
Now I am even more confused
Have you tried them in different countries
They taste different
Same brand
Different taste
Due to water characteristics
In Romania I can easly make the difference but in Germany for example I have no idea which is which
Next time try coke too
You will spot the difference immediately
Here, for example, it is very sprinkling- to the point you cry :)) I was discussing this with a friend from Italy and he said that it is because of our natural sprinkling waters
They are very sprinkling and we are used to them
If any beverage manufacturer would make less sprinkling drinks, we wouldn't buy them
Seems right if I think about it - none of my friends (including me) like the light sprinkling waters and you barely can find them in supermarkets
Same with sugar addings
They are different
And then the water pH which changes the taste in each factory
Same here
But I got to point where I literally tell them what to buy because most parties are at my house and they are not guests anymore
They are family
And they must wash dishes also or we move the parties somewhere else :)))
Thank you
<3 It's always nice to hear people liked it
Just like any other country it has it's good and bad parts but overall we really like meeting new people and socialize with them
Hope your staying was nice and you had time to visit a little bit :)
Romania has the neutral gender which behaves like masculine when singular and like feminine for plural
We feel the vibes most of the time, by realizing what plural form makes more sense but they are some words that can have both forms depending on the meaning and that's confusing, e.g: viruși (plural for computer virus) and virusuri (plural for viruses like covid)
The singular form is virus for both
I would say 99% of the time I would be capable to guess the gender for a noun I have never heard before
The reason is that genders in Romanian are defined by the way we count the noun
For example, we use one bed, two beds to determine the gender of bed
In that regard we have 3 options
Un - doi : if you count the noun like this then it has a male gender
Una - două: female gender
Un - două: neutral
O - doi: doesn't exist
The only exception would be proper noun, especially foreign ones
Those are mostly figured out by trying to count them in your head and figure out wha sounds most Romanian
In Romanian, the definite article (in English: "the") modifies the word
For example:
bath - baie
the bath - baia
pencil - creion
the pencil - creionul
The indefinite article (in English: "a" or "an") is added before the word and it depends on the gender of the word:
a bath - o baie
a pencil - un creion
When getting accustomed to the langauge, it's easy to tell the gender of the word by the way it sounds (using the indefinite article just sounds bad to someone used to hearing the language)
For the definite article form, you essentially learn it at the same time as you learn the base word
While it is somewhat regular depending on gender, it's not regular enough to be a rule
Well i guess this is one of the hardest traits of romanian language
Because we have suffixes for changing the meaning (case, number,article) (so instead of the forest we say forestthe ,one word) .But sometimes the predefined suffix doesnt sound properly and and then we change the root sometimes dramatically and this can be tough . Also we kind of feel the gender and such things but not always and some words have been used with the wrong articles so many times now both the former wrong and the correct form are correct
Also i can't say i studied a lot of french but from my limited experience i can sense in most of the cases the gender there despite not actually studying them .
It's funny when Hungarians speak Romanian
They don't have gender in their language so they mostly guess at random
It makes for very funny constructions, that no other group manages to make
O - doi definitely exist
Have you ever been to Harghita
We don't feel the gender, there is clear rule
We count the object (one objects, two objects) if both singular and plural sound masculine, it's masculine, masculine singular with feminine plural you get neutral gender and feminine is feminine sounding for both
As someone who learned German along with my native language, das Nutella sounds horrible
Either die, or just add a noun to the name which has an undisputed article like nutella jar or nutella spread
the feel part is what you say sound masculine or feminine
It's clear if you decide the gender when counting there is nothing to debate over but that implies you decided .This step of deciding how to actually count is the step im talking about .
&#x200B;
I see here a debate over Nutella gender in Germany .For me Nutella can't be in any way nothing but feminine
But apparently in other languages i can be neuter .And so what we might consider clear gender for us in reality it's not because there is no axiomatic rule to enforce that gender , its just the way it is .Ofc there are words like "boy" or "girl" where gender is self-understood but not everything in the world has a in-built gender .So there the languages decide how it will deal with it . You can consider "mapa" plural to be "mapi "(which is wrong , its "mape") but the sound alike "lampa" have the plural "lămpi"(also to be noted how the a changes into an  "ă" ) (instead of "lampe", which would be the natural plural form considering the sounding alike mapa situation)
The romanian language would have been very fine if the correct plural form of those words would be the opposite
Lămpi should seriously be changed to lampe, it makes so much more sense
We didn't, but nutella is not neutral
It's either a name or feminine
Very similar in Romanian
O pula -> feminine
O pizda -> feminine
Un penis -> masculine
Un vagin -> masculine
Huh, the "scientific" names are masculine while the slang is feminine
Weird
Un lămpi, doi lämps
My region has the same one ..knife-wielding drunks . I know the felling
>that we’re all ugly
Funny how the country with the ugly stereotype has some of the most beautiful celebrities
>But then sometimes I come back from a holiday on the continent, look around at us and think, fuck me, we are a sorry looking bunch
Lol, I think the same thing when I go back home
I think this is mostly because you/I got used to the typical look from home and anything else seems like a breath of fresh air
'' Malakas
'' I just like how it rings how I like to say it
I never heard of this one
Nah, when I return home I think exactly the opposite
"Finally normal looking people
>Jesus christ on a stick
That's probably a porn title
And In Romania it's Transylvanians
Only short sleeves without anything else
Then probably 24 degree C.
For me T shirt is like at least 23°C. If its between 15-23 it's more of a t shirt and light jacket, or a light sweater /sweatshirt
When we go up to like 29, 30 and over its just "wish I could remove my skin" weather
17-18C if it’s not windy, which drops the perceived temperature
But like the others said, 20C is a decent  baseline
For Romania it would probably be Dragnea getting jailed and recently the Dăncilă goverment falling
Hopefully this will bring a brighter future for Romania
Stayed as shitty as it was
how the introduction of the € was like
I'm curious
we still dont have €
I wish we could get rid of romanian Ron/leu so we can get euro because
> not have to bother with exchanging currency
and other things I can't think of lol
so bigger salaries
lol
Romanian leu cut 4 zeros in 2004 and people still call the 100 lei bill "a million".

Decebal and Burebista were Dacian soldiers who fought heroically the Roman during the Dacian-Roman wars
I'd say Mihai Viteazu (Michael the Brave); he was the first to unite the Romanian principalities in 1600, but only briefly unfortunately because he was assasinated
What about Charles XII a.k.a. Carolus Rex
You forgot about Regina Maria
What about Joan Huniady (John of Hunedoara)
Actually they were Dacian kings and only Decebalus fought in the Dacian-Roman wars
Burebista fought the Celts and expanded the territory of Dacia
However,he did send troops to aid Pompey so he technically fought against Romans
My father actively took part in 1989 Romanian revolution, he knew how to handle a rifle so he was called to the warehouse he used to work at and was given a rifle (defend it from rioters and looters), he ended up not having to fire a single shot
My grandfather from my father's side fought in WW2 and was captured by the russians, was sent to a prison in siberia
A few years after the war he was released and came home
A great grandfather fought in WW1, but I don't know much about him other than that
My grandparents were kinda during WWII and my mom grew up in the communist era
Both my parents and my aunt took part in the 1989 Romanian revolution and my mom almost got killed there in fact, they shot dead a man that was protesting right next to her, could’ve been her
How can you drown while doing laundry
We still do somewhat
Even our national anthem acknowledges this lmao
Acum ori niciodată să dăm dovezi la lume
Că-n aste mâni mai curge un sânge de roman,
Şi că-n a noastre piepturi păstrăm cu fală-un nume
Triumfător în lupte, un nume de Traian
Now or never we will prove to the world
That in these hands, Roman blood still flows
And that in our chests we proudly keep a name
Triumphant in battles, a name of Trajan
Wanna a hug
Also we did called our country Romania
I mean yeah, but that just comes from the people inhabiting this land calling themselves 'rumâni' or a variation thereof, not necessarily claiming themselves to be successors of the Roman empire
Me too buddy
We didn't claim anything
It just is a fact
Our language might've originally developed from a vulgar Latin dialect, but that doesn't make us anything more than a romance speaking people, definitely not successors to the Roman Empire
We are roman successors as much as any latin nation+greece
> definitely not successors to the Roman Empire
Why not
Continue your train of though please
Looking at some traditional practices I can say for certain that whoever Trajan brought into Dacia to colonise the region was a very romanised citizen
One example is how we sacrifice and eat pigs for Christmas, similar to the roman Saturnalia
Were the romans all true latins coming from the italian peninsula
Not all of them
My theory is that we're a mix of Latins, roman citizens coming from around the empire, Dacians and whatever else happened to be around here
Cashiers having chairs to sit on while at the register
How can they force someone to stand like that for hours on end
It does not improve their ability to do their job in any way, it's just a cultural thing that ruins peoples health for no reason, especially if they are older, overweight or have preexisting health conditions
Even if you're healthy, do it long anough and your knees will eventually get busted
LIDL, this thing is on my list of the greatest invention of humanity
Wait
That's illegal
this
almost everyone i know (me included) speaks at least 3 languages (romanian, english and german or french) and sometimes they also speak hungarian
i always thought that americans are so lucky that they don’t need to speak other languages, but now i realize that it’s a blessing and a curse
Never disrespect Kaufland again
There aren't any
Wait
That's illegal

We used to have (I think it still is published) a comic called "Mickey Mouse," full with the Disney cast (Mickey and friends, Donald and family, and the extended cast around them)
This was right after '89 when communism fell
I was a kid then, I was 6
Well, This comic usually had a few stories in it
Mickey was always a do-gooder, he was the detective, and he had Goofy with him, and Minnie, and stuff like that
Donald was a different story
He had his nephews with him, or he had Uncle Scrooge, or Gyro, or there were the Beagle Brothers he had to deal with
There was that witch that always wanted Uncle Scrooge's first coin
And then, Donald was a pilot, he was a sailor, he was an explorer, he went on adventures, he explored jungles, pyramids, deserts, caves
Donald had flaws, he was funny, he was angry, he was happy, Donald had character
I always read Mickey's stories because they were always the first in the comic book, but Donald was what I was after
I had hundreds of those comics
Donald was very popular among my friends, and we used to laugh at his stories, he was our favorite
Thatsthejoke

We don’t have Aldi here so I can’t tell the difference
LIDL and Kaufland are really popular here, I think I have like 5 LIDLs and 2 Kauflands in an area of about 1 km radius from me
Also, for whatever reason, many times Kaufland and LIDL are being build very close to one another
We only have LIDL and Kaufland
It’s actually called Xenophobia
Could be our regions have received different stories
Mickey was always a detective, Goofy was his sidekick, and Mickey was always the hero
With Donald you had no idea what to expect
He always changed jobs, he always changed scenery, he was involved in varied adventures, had a wider array of cast members around him
And Donald was not the main character in all these stories, sometimes it was only his nephews doing boy scout things, other times his Uncle Scrooge doing things, other times that cousin of his who was always lucky no matter what, or it was a story with the witch, or a story with the Beagle Brothers, or a Gyro the inventor story, or something
Donald was far more interesting
This reminds me,  bagging your groceries by yourself is also a thing in europe, you can use your own bag and place things in them the way you like it
Too much self deprecation in my opinion
Sure, you are far from being the best anymore, but trust me, a guy from Poland has no place telling you that
Only the top Europe countries can compete with the U.S still
It’s a lot worse, but still a lot better than most of the world
There are some huge issues that desperately need solving there, — healthcare, education, college debt, public safety — but I believe you will be able to solve them in time
Same here
The instructors are very persistant in convincing you to learn to drive the manual ones so that you are not limited after getting your driving licence
They convinced me and passed the exam last year on the manual one
Damn it was hard in the Bucharest traffic
At 12 in the afternoon when everybody swears and screams
One guy pulled his car next to mine and screamed at the police guy: *"don't give her the driving licence
"*. I wanted to scream back but I had a camera recording the exam so I just smiled back at that asshole with a smile saying *"yeah
Fuck you too
"* :))
In Romania we say "smoching"(pronounced like smoking) to tuxedo
Taxi drivers
Never, but NEVER use Bucharest' taxi
They charge almost 15 euros per km (idk for sure since I don't live in Bucharest but I heard the prices are big)
Romanian taxies are super expensive if they hear you speacking english
I have a relative wich asced a taxi the price and he wanted to take triple the money
Not really a scam, but here people should be cautious with the personal belongings that can be sold to pawn shops
If an area has a lot of pawn shops, you know you have to be extra careful and keep your phone close
Some start to negociate the price before you tell them where you need to go
In Romania too
In romania they'll say,, Is (ammount) okay
,, . Usually it's overpriced and they don't get the taximeter started
* Outdated
* Too much focus on memory
* Religious indoctrination
* Propagandistic history
* Writers worshipped like a pantheon of Gods
* Too much focus on western history and little to no lesson about the eastern european countries (I mean,come one
We learn about the American independence,English civil war and French Revolution but (next to) nothing about the PLC,Kievan Rus,Kingdom of Hungary or the Bulgarian and Serbian empires whitch were at our doorstep
I've seen this over a long period of time so I have my personal arguments, not nit-picking
I have the age to know enough to argue
- The educational system since the 90s has gradually degraded because of copying other systems from other countries
This is because of the lack of responsibility of those tasked of it
Academic professors (yeah, them) have given up to design the curriculum and relied on copying from other systems
Ever since the early-middle 2000s, no matter the minister for education (honestly, I cannot blame the position in itself, since it's a managerial at best & filled with some political interests at worst with political motivations), the solution has remained to copy what he see/hear from other countries
The situation was made worse now that parents think they know best what their kids *must and mustn't learn* and relied on typical thought-terminating cliches like ”Look at that country, let's copy its education scheme & structure” and so on
Former class idiots, seeing themselves with some money in their pocket & with their own family, now they want to have their stupid vengeful attempt at reformation (due to their mustered frustration against schooling in general) by advocating *the same thing it had happened since the early 2000s* without paying a dime (as if serious schooling structure rebuild-up is free or cheap)
They think buying school requisites is too much, when they simply forget we never were a wealthy country to begin with, to have what we perceive that Western Europe has
*Tough shit, pops n' moms; it is how it is*.
Add the Bologna system, where it did wrecked the university structure for some fields, and here we are
If there's a fuck-up, all those responsible for education point their fingers at: (1) the scheme they've copied from other countries (therefore, blame those countries' system) and (2) the Bologna system
”We can't do nothing, it's how it is
School textbooks aren't concise anymore because dipshit parents worry about ”hardships” for their kid learning (learning
school is not a disco
), they've dumbed some of the school textbooks and now some are given ”complementary exercise textbooks”, where they apparently complete tasks & exercises in tandem with what they learn theory from the textbook
What's worse is that some teachers (gymnasium-high school) are offered deals to buy *certain* test problems/exercises textbooks -- for example, in mathematics, because the problem in the regular textbooks are either too weak or not enough with exercises for kids to continuously solve math problems & in-print the theorems (and how to apply them) in their brains
A lot of these textbooks with test problems are hit and miss
If you have a weak teacher, then good luck passing the national tests in gymnasium or high school
And don't get me started on tutoring
Tutoring existed under communism, where you'd go at your teacher to cram you with problems (real sciences or literature-grammar, or physics, or chemistry; it depended where your weak weak link was)
- No more dropouts
In order to keep the general PR happy (”At school X, there have been n dropouts, therefore the teachers are baaaad
”), you rarely ever hear(d) of gymnasium and high school expels + the steady dissipation of vocation schools
Remember that I mentioned about former class idiots, that see themselves with some money in their pocket & think they know better what the system needs
Well, *they*'re the drop-outs that should've been
And they're arrogant
There's no fear of wrecking your life if you don't take school serious
It isn't a secret that vocational/trade schools are meant for dumber kids that simply can't keep up & are given a second chance to re-orientate their calling in life
- Double-edged literature
The *first problem* is that kids don't read as they once did
They don't want to read literature
They're adverse in enriching their own vocabulary, yet they have no problem memorizing every stupid temporal gimmick
So, now they rely on literature criticism
They memorize literature criticism without reading their compulsory works of literature that they must
The *second problem* comes from the testing system itself, at least in high school
This isn't controversial but it's up for debate
Every literature teacher knows that, besides needing to read their compulsory list of books, pupils must also frame their commentaries, analyzation in such a way that resembles that of a literary critic
Not in gymnasium, but in high school a pupil is expected of them to know by 11th-12th grade how to argue about a short story, a poem, or a novel
Doesn't matter, you're a grown up, you must know how to argue of & about it
This creates a problem of arbitrariness because, after all, the Baccalaureate (in regards to literature; history, logic, philosophy, sociology, economics, psychology) are marked by a ”committee” of 3 (maybe 4, 5) of high school teachers ( (*not yours*, just to be clear)
So, it's a die in a cast under Damocles' sword how your test will be marked, how much the committee likes the way you've written, how you've written, and how much (in regards to details) you've written
Kids these days being distracted by phones and don't paying attention to the teacher
And also highjacking the class cuz they get bored
And then complaining that the school is not ok for them but they won't even try
Yeah
Sorry to break it to you: it's not your teacher .. it's you
Disclaimer: 27 electronics engineer
When I felt that the school failed my expectations I just started learning all by myself
No drama
Take what you can, never give back
We have schoolbooks as old as 1999, that we still use
Including a geography textbook with Yugoslavia in it and a TIC (Technologies of Information and Comunication) textbook from 2006 which is needless to say not very useful
Now, i know they are trying to write new textbooks but they aren't as good as the old ones, so it isn't helping that much
For example, we have a brand new P.E book, which i dont know if it is something normal or not
It's definetly a bit weird
The way the information is shoved into you
The lack of modernization, I mean we have projectors in most classes but they are used when the teacher is lazy and doesn't wanna write and we present our projects
I don't know if this counts but the lack of AC in the classrooms is horrible
Imagine 25-30 people sweating at 35 C while trying to learn something
We have a lot of useless subjects
For example Latin
We have Latin once a week just in eight grade
You'll never do it again
Also we have books that are ten years old but our curriculum is new
very good my comrade
i couldn’t have said it better, my tovarăș
same can be said for romania
Yes we had a whole lesson about Roman society,administration,warfare,traditions etc
We also studied other ancient civilisations like Persia,Egypt and Greece
> Why do you learn about the English civil war
In 4th grade, they start to learn history
It's about the country in a very dim-touched set of lessons, given the grade and age period
*We'll ignore this one
In 5th grade, they learn universal history, starting from antiquity
*Nothing too deep, just enough to tackle the subject, from an internationalist/cosmopolitan view
In 6th grade, they teach from late antiquity to middle-late medieval period (maybe a bit after that) in Europe
*Again, nothing deep, still internationalist/cosmopolitan view, just enough to touch that ”Here, in 1xxx, things went like this” sort of way
In 7th grade, they learn about Europe & the Americas from late-medieval period onwards
This is where the lessons about statehood, philosophy, economics, reforms, revolutions, technological advancements, conflicts, wars etc
are presented
*A-gain, still from a internationalist-cosmopolitan view, nothing in-depth, just the popular generalised events, occurrences, and so on, like your civil war
In 8th grade, they learn about the country's history
Obviously, far more in-depth than in 4th grade, but still a generalised way
Grades 9th-to-11th are the *groundhog day* grades from 5th to 7th, although with more details & in-depth approach
12th grade tackles the country with a lot details than (obviously) 4th and 8th grade
>Why do you learn about the English civil war
Different reasons
If I were to guess:
- The idea of republicanism, parliamentarism, democracy that were starting to appear *before* the Enlightenment Age
- Why Britain was far ahead from other European nations and why it became an empire, why it developed faster than the rest of Europe
- The problems of [absolute] monarchism, religious zealotry/fundamentalism, social struggle & mobility, game theory, political philosophy, state-building, nation-building, genuine progressiveness
- Understanding the contemporary English/British social fabric and the legacy that the civil war left behind
Since we were never a powerhouse of our own and always were a lump on the map, Romanian education (in regards to history & other fields, even literature) is pro-internationalist/cosmopolitan than national
It's understandable
I personally attended english-bilingual classes so those things are included as a separate class
In high-school you learn 3 years of general history and one year romanian history
At least that's the way it worked up untill i graduated (2018)
What I mean is stupid nationalistic myths such as:
> Dacians where just minding their own buissiness and the Romans attacked them just to steal their gold
When in reality the Dacians started it by attacking the province of Moesia and killing it's governor
> We were the shield of Europe and we saved it from Ottoman expansions
No we didn't! We simply defended ourselves
We were not on some kind of crusade against Ottomans
> The Romanian principalities where friends and never fought each other
Actually the fought each other plenty of times
But it is always brushed under the rug or twisted in some form
Like: "Ruler of principality X was an Ottoman/Hungarian/Polish puppet and the Ruler of principality Y invaded principality X in order to return the rightful ruler on the throne and free principality X from Ottoman/Hungarian/Polish opression". Or in a more famous case when Stephen the Great of Moldavia invaded Wallachia with Ottoman support in order to take the port of Kilia back from his cousin Vlad
Whitch is often twisted as "Stephen pretending to attack Vlad in order to confuse the enemy" or "Stephen coming to save Kilia from Ottoman hands".
> Our medieval rulers were brave patriots who fought for their people and Michael the Brave was the biggest patriot because he united the Romanian provinces into a single state thus fullfilling the national ideal of the Romanian people
There was no such thing as nationalism or patriotism back then
These rulers only fought as self defense and Michael the Brave united the provinces out of oportunism
> Constantin Brâncoveanu was killed because he refused to convert to Islam
Actually he was killed for threason
The Sultan offered to pardon him if he converted to Islam whitch he refused
> Romanian army fought for it's brothers who suffered under Austro-Hungarian opression
Actually many of the soldiers at the time were peasants and they didn't care about the Transylvanian Romanians
The only reason they enlisted in the army is because they were promised more land if the take Transylvania
> Romanian army was super badass in WW1 and beat the crap out of it's enemies
When in reality our army was shit and we were pushed back when the German troops arrived
And even if we won some battles after the French came to train us we were still pushed back and almost turned into a German puppet
> The Interwar era was a paradise
While it is often romanticized a lot
The interwar era was not that great
* Corruption was still a problem
* Elections where not really fair
* Protests where violently surpressed
* Working conditions where shit
* And women didn't enjoy the same rights they do today
> We were always the good guys who did no wrong
Actually there is a lot of shit that isn't covered in history class
Such as
* The despotic nature of our rulers
* The Gypsy slaves
* The Hungarians massacred by Avram Iancu and the Transylvanian Romanian rebels
* Our involvement in the holocaust
* And the war crimes done during WW2
But our history is always treated as if we were always in the right and everyone we fought against is always in the wrong
That's what I mean by "propagandistic history"
>we had a whole lesson about Roman society,administration,warfare,traditions etc
Only a lesson
More like 3 months in 5th grade and 3 months in 9th grade
Well it took a few days in 5th grade but we didn't learn that much about Rome in high school
I really liked flammekeuches when I was in France
Praise Alsace
When i went to France i had the opportunity to taste sweet bread
It was weird bit glad I tasted it lol
Georgian food was a cool surprise for me too
Our boss took us out for lunch, and we got a series of dips/spreads as appetizers and were told they were Georgian
I absolutely loved one of them which I then learned was made with eggplant, I was surprised because I normally hate and avoid eggplant
Unfortunately I don't know its name :(
Mom, can we get mititei
No, we have mititei at home
Mititei at home:
> ćevapi
You have just started a gang war
Be it what it may, in France I was told it's alsacian
Either way, it's delicious
Well I wasn't in Alsace I was in Lyon and no, I haven't tried any wines actually while I was there unfortunately
I had some tigersbrock beer or something like that with it and it was quite enjoyable
Hmm it looked different from Baba ganoush, If I recall correctly it was [the white one on the top right] (they were all delicious tho <3)
Probably the flag from the communist period:
Out flag with the communist coat of arms, because obvious reasons
On the opposite, the flag with a hole in the middle is used as a symbol of revolution nowadays
Definitely the communist flag
However, most of them [had a hole cut in the middle of it] durin the 1989 Revolution
Or the Iron Guard flag is hated as well idk
Hop-hop, two teams, one team seeks, one team hides and runs
The runners would scream hop-hop so the other team would know when to start searching
You have to touch the runners, but some kids would make a cross or 3 on the runner's back
We have break the line as well but called "Țară Țară Vrem Ostași" (Country Country We Want Soldiers) rounds would start saying this then a line picks the one they want the other to send crashing into them
If the line breaks he gets to take an "enemy" to his team but if the line holds the crasher gets coopted
There also was Așchie (Splinter); everyone stood in a circle, a leg outstretched, then after a count of 2 to 3, everyone says Așchie
The first who got the word in then had to step on someone else's foot
If he stepped, he continued
If he missed (you could dodge) the one who dodged attacked next
Then 1,2,3 la perete stop (1,2,3, at the wall, stop); all except one lined up and had to touch a wall
But one had to stay near the wall, facing it, then say the phrase and turn around
If you were running and got caught moving you were eliminated, if not you could continue running when the wall guy started
If you reached the wall you stood next
Nu prea imi vine o fraza in minte, dar multumesc ca esti interesat / interesata de limba mea
And he/she is like: Cool
what does it mean
"I don't have a phrase in mind, but thank you for being interested in my language"
"Oh"
"Sounds like italian, can you understand italian
I usually complain for a bit about them asking me to do that
In my language so we both can get what we want
Láttam egy szamárt a dzsungelben, de a kurva oroszlán megette
(hungarian)
In english that would mean: i saw a donkey in the jungle but that bitch of a lion ate it
That's if you translate it mot-a-mot
Ro:"Pisicuțăăă"
Hu:"A dög rágná ki a beledet te tetves"
Huh
I usually use the good ol' "Sugi pula"
On the right side of the screen, you see a panel called "community settings" and there's your username
Click on the crayon icon to add your flag
Nu prea imi vine doesn't have a translation in italian as far as I know, maybe "niente nella mia mente" if you adapt the whole phrase
Edit: Niente nella mia mente, grazie per essere interessato della mia lingua
Something like that
I tried that and once i got a "is that an invitation
Considering this is Europe the better question would have been "Is there any other nation your nation **doesn't** have grievances with
And if yes how many hundred kilometers away from your current border is it
Hungary
Ever since the middle ages the Hungarian Empire Moldavia and Wallachia (and sometimes Transylvania) have been feuding
In the first world war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was the Kingdom of Romania's enemy
Afterwards, in 1919 there was the Hungarian-Romanian war in which Hungary tried to get Transylvania back
In the second world war Hungary took northern Transylvania with the approval of Hitler
Relations have improved however in recent years
At this point its not just “grievance” its just hatred
It doesn't make sense to get a territory containing 70% Romanians and only 17% Hungarians
And my opinion is that they have plenty of rights there
They get to attend their own schools and study everything in Hungarian
Someone born there can easily make it through life without speaking Romanian at all if he doesn't leave the region
Which is frustrating for a Romanian visiting the region, as I discovered myself a few years back when I couldn't speak Romanian with anybody in the middle of my own country
We also have Piticot (rough translation is: Dwarf) in Romania
I used to play it as a kid
You can play it for free here:
There's also a game called "Moara" (The Mill), which is played by creating lines of three stones on lines
[Rummy]
it's a very competitive game
my parents were always playing it in high school
i also played it and i loved it:)))
Oradea
It's like the 9th or 8th largest city in Romania
It's well known here for having actually good administration
It's also the safest city in Romania, happiest people and many more
Ah this reminds me of when I had to explain to a middle eastern taxi driver in the UK that Bucharest and Budapest are different places
Trip to the airport turned geopolitics lesson
Turin was a big meme here a few years back
It's Bucharest for sure
[here] you can see an image from 2011
Is Bucharest, I can see my neighborhood’s circular shape
I somehow knew it would be Bucharest when I clicked this thread
This city always surprises people
Bucharest, for sure, I can see my neighborhood'
Never thought my city looks so good from the sky
Yup it's Bucharest
Zoom in on the center and you see the Constitution Square, and the big chunk of darkness next to if must be the Parliament Building
Bucuresteni are entering the chat
I live in it :) It is of course Bucharest :)
Hei, I can see my apartment

That we are somewhat racist
We are somewhat racist towards a certain minority
That we accept racism to a certain community
So true, when temps get too high ..it's like a spider web set on your brain . I hate summer with a passion
How can that be
I suppose you would get separated from most (or all) school colleagues and meet new
Do you knowingly restraint yourselves as not to make new friends
Will you remain at 'acquaintance' stage for the rest of your lives
I met the latest guy I like and I almost call friend about three years ago
Mate, if you have some cash I can help you with your problem
So true ..it's so engraved into our society that I don't think we'll ever get over it . "A furat dar macar a facut ceva" mentality
And sometimes a bit loud
Maybe
I noticed it in Hungary too, against the same people
Ditto
Spanish, right
I find this fascinating
In my area they dismantled a good part of a freaking railway
It made the trains squeeze up the remaining one and made commuting 50km from 2h to 4h-6h via train for a year
I used to live near the railway and saw them casually carrying the metal on a Sunday
It was infuriating that the police didn't do a thing when they came
They acknowledged the missing rail parts and said it was probably them
Then they went home
You can try to count, then Carol II takes the throne and everything goes screwy
Fascists and communism and all
squirrel is "veveriță"
V-E-V-E-R-I-T-S-A
Ts is actually ț but none here would understand
Veveriță in romanian
From the (old) Slavic *vĕverica*, which comes from proto-Slavic *veverъka* <inevitably from Proto-Indo-European *wer-*. I give Aromanian *viviritsã*, neo-Greek βερβερίτσα (ververítsa)
Related to Latin *viverra*.
I think it means it's full of life
Viva - life
Blindly supporting Israel in whatever shit they decide to do
We even tried to follow the US model and move our embassy to Jerusalem
I think we support Israel for religious reasons and jesssuuusssss
But it's still pretty dumb
Elaborate on 4
Religious reasons, not wanting to seem anti-Semitic, trying to wash away our previous sins with the Jews, many reasons in fact
Not only that
Many jews in Israel came from Romania, we had a pretty high jewish population pre ww2
In a smaller dose, maybe
With Romanians being kind of islamophobes due to Ottoman history, Israel is still supported by many
There is a simple saying "If you want a 5 at the Bacalaureat, go to school, if you want a 10, go to privtae tutors"
yeah in highschool almost everyone does private lessons on exam subjects, it's this way because a lot of teachers don't give a shit about actually helping students learn about the subject and only superficially cover the main points in class so that later more students will seek to pay private lessons with the same teachers ..it's a mess and you need to be pretty motivated to learn everything by yourself, but that can definitely be done too
It's common to get some tutoring for the most important subjects for university exams
It's not that common for any other period
Almost every kid in my class went to private tuitions
Its honestly insane
The teachers are partially to blame for it, but it's mostly because the education system sucks ass
Not a very big thing here
Some kids get private tutoring before their Bacalaureate exam
I did too because I was a mess in one of the subjects and I would've failed
Some kids also get tutoring before applying for university but that's not SUPER common either
Most families can't properly afford it
Eh, if you choose the easy path in high school (filologie/sociologie) it's impossible not to get a 7 imo
Its still kinda fucked up that you almost have to pay to get good results at the exam, shouldnt regular school be enough
Its sad that people think this shit(justified)
I mean, I dont think that high grades should be easy to get
In my classroom, 12 got over a 9 in the exam, and only 3 did private lessons
I never really studied anything in school, only started reading essays a week before the exam and I still got over 8
It's really not that hard
But I do agree that the system sucks
Things might be different for those who choose maths/chemistry in high school, it's easier to get bad grades there
Well I am more of a Maths and science person, so it may be harder at mate/info or SN, where I want to go
Most places that sells them are also keeping them in a refrigerated shelf here
But now that you mentioned it I do remember my grandparents, who owned chickens not keeping their fresh eggs in a fridge
I always put them in the fridge, I don’t know anyone that does otherwise
*Papanași*: [Fried] vs [Boiled] There is only one right answer
^^^boiled
Also non-Transylvanians apparently fight over *Mucenici*. There are 2 versions: [soup] (in the south) vs
[cake/brioche] (in Moldavia)
It definitely has to be [Dragostea din tei] (or as everyone outside Romania knows it, **the Numa Numa song**)
edit: apparently a lot of foreigners know it by the original title haha that's actually great given that it's in Romanian
I'd also add [Dacă ploaia s-ar opri] and [Trăiască berea]
Seeing you're from Portugal I have to say that [this song] went viral in Romania because it's very fucked up
And I think we are the also reason why the comments were disabled :))
Haha yes that's the official title
Numa numa doesn't even make sense, it's just how a lot of foreigners understood the lyrics "Vrei să pleci, dar **nu mă, nu mă iei**"
A rough translation would be "You wanna leave but **you won't take me, take me** with you"
Not really, it's more complex than that:
"nu" means "no", or anything negative (let's say when using the negative form of a verb - not, will not etc
while "mă" is a reflexive pronoun, 1st person singular (more or less like "me", as in "take me")
That being said, "nu mă" would literally be "**not/don't/won't** (take) **me** - the verb (conjugated form) is "iei" in this lyric: nu mă, nu mă iei (from the infinitive form "a lua" - "to take")
So, you can only intelligibly translate the whole lyric "nu mă, nu mă iei" as "you won't take me, take me" (or something of this sort), but not only the "nu mă, nu mă"/"Numa numa" part
Maybe you didn't want so many details but it was fun to write haha
Hope this Romanian 101 was clear enough
More like, "you won't, you won't"
Its hard to give an exact translation in English but "**nu mă"**  roughly means "you won't"
Basically anywhere in romania is by train
Also Budapest and maybe Sofia can go by train, anything further is plan
I usually search for both options, and pick whichever has the best price/duration balance
I do prefer trains because I like looking out of the window hahah
But if the trip takes like half a day by train (or, in any case, way more than driving to/from the airport, waiting for check-in, security blah blah and the flight duration itself) I'll definitely switch to flying
However if the starting point is Romania, I'll definitely pick flying
For example Bucharest to Budapest is like 16 hours by train and it's not much cheaper than a plane ticket either
When I lived in Romania, I took the train inside the country, bus/car to the nearby countries and plane to everywhere else
Now I live in Germany, so I take the train inside Germany + to France, bus to the Netherlands and Czech Republic, car to Poland and plane everywhere else
I only take trains for internal travel
Considering how slow and crappy trains are here tho, I would take a plane ride over it any time
But for cross-border, I always choose flying
It's just faster, usually more affordable, and convenient
A trip from the French Atlantic coast to the Black Sea uses about 3 full tanks of diesel, maybe 5 for gasoline
Somewhere in that range
Add to that paying for road taxes, food and hotels and it gets expensive
I don’t think it’s even comparable to the greenhouse gases output of a plane, those should be much lower
Sweden is a capitalist country, with a free-market economy, high taxes and a generous welfare system
Democratic Socialism is what you have in Venezuela
Here is what the Prime Minister of Denmark [had to say] on the subject
Yeah, why should we implement fiscal reforms, free healthcare/education, public housing
Fuck those
Let's burn everything down, kill thousands of people during the process and make an entire country stagnate for years just to satisfy some weird fetish
In my country, I heard people saying Americans are dumb because they get their education from the Simpsons and South Park
they kinda have a point tbh
Isn't christian democracy in theory centre-left economically and center-right socially
We re not a country full of vampires and gymnasts
No, we are not populated by vampires
We actually love garlic
While not quite US-tier we still aren't that dirt-poor save for certain areas
And no, we are not all Gypsies
We are not vampires and and Vlad Tepes was not Dracula
Do they even portray us
Half the time it's vampires speaking with an obnoxious and wrong accent, the other time they portray us like slavs, which is still wrong
I do not think there are many movies with Romanian characters or about Romania
Everytime something about Romania comes up, it’s some grey setting full of commie blocks and pretty poor people
No doubt Romania is poor compared to Western Europe, but let’s get real, people are not that poor for it to be a main feature of them in movies
Also not all of Romania is commie blocks
no guys , we do not have vampires in our country
Vampires, Dracula, Transylvania and mountains
Please send help, Dracula is not even a slightly cool thing
Yeah he was a great ruler that made that night attack on ottoman camps, but others were so better, for ex
Stefan cel Mare, Mircea cel Batran, Mihai Viteazu, Carol I etc
too many vampires maybe
How am I supposed to phone somebody If there isn't a red phone box every 10 meters
Well, we’re not blessed with a Mediterranean climate to grow a thousand herbs and spices, and we tend to like our traditional cuisine, which as you probably understand wasn’t very imaginative at the time
Besides, vampires come out at night, and smell is especially important in the dark
Dude, get your geography up to date

I was 9 years old when my parents decided to buy me a bike and my father somewhat helped me learn to ride my bike, but most of the time we would go to a hill and I would sit on my bike and my dad would give me a push as I would then go down the hill with my bike
Once I ran into a tree and almost broke my arm, but at least after a couple of weeks or some I had learned to ride my bike
I learned at 13, my older brother at 10, because our parents were assholes back then and didn't understand why would a girl want to "harm herself" by riding a bike
I never learned riding a bike, i have a hell grandpa and when i was 6 yrs old i just kept falling on the bike and papa  would scream at me and i just gave up
15th century balkans, personalitties like Vlad Dracula,Stephen the great,Mathias Corvinus,Skanderberg,Mehmed the second
> we often refer to the French as cugini d'oltralpe (cousins beyond the Alps)
Similar to how we call the Moldovans "Frații de peste Prut" (Brothers over the Prut river)
Well I heard many nicknames for hungarians
hungarians = bozgor
Really
Are there any other nicknames besides "Bozgori"?
Lmao, şogor in Romanian means a guy that fucked them same girl as you
No, cuz we like you
Also
* Bulgarians: "Castraveți", "Zarzavagii" and "Cepari"
* Ukrainians: "Hoholi/Haholi"
Well you can't just bring it up without saying it, can you
We have something similar; when someone isn't listening or doesn't understand what you're saying we say "Are you turkish
" or "Am I speaking Turkish
I was just joking because I've heard lots of people talking shit about hungarians here, hence lots of "nicknames".
never heard these ones
Also for Bulgarians "Cefe late" and for Ukranians and sometimes moldovans "racketz"
You use cucumbers and onions
"Castraveți" means Cucumbers, "Zarzavagii" is derived from "Zarzavat" which means "Vegetables" and "Cepari" is derived from "Ceapă" which means "Onion".
They are a references to the fact that Bulgarians in Romania used to work as gardners and also to the salads which Bulgaria is famous for in modern Romania
I think it's taught objectively
At least that's how i learnt about it, the reasons of WW2 start, the holocaust, the allied forces, the benefits of Romania, the downfalls of romania
In Romania we are first taught why ww2 started and we talk about our alliance with Germany
How they took Czechoslovakia and how nobody did anything
The invasion of Poland and the other states west of Germany, so the blitzkrieg
Then we talk about operation Barbarossa, the territories we took, how we got wrecked, all that good stuff
We talk about internal politics for a brief period and then we go over some battles in Africa and Asia, we don't go in-depth
After that it's D-day, and the fall of Nazi Germany in general
So yeah, it's not really much
We often look at our own achievements and failures in the war, and a quite long lecture of important events and fights, which country fought for what side, political parties, fascism, communism, Germany being Germany, my country being sneaky and pulling a turn around, changing sides to the allies, the king is dethroned and a whole bunch of government stuff happens
We often put technological advancements in it too
And nothing (almost nothing
) on Japan, the Pacific war, Midway, Afrika Korps, Rommel, El Alamein etc
We did talk about Japan, Italy, the pacific War and all that
But I'm not sure if it was in the book or not
Could be, I was in school a long time ago, learned pre-1989 history
Dacians,the inter-war period,the wars against ottomans as we were THE SHIELD OF EUROPE AGAINST MUSLIMS HORDES i mean the SHIELD OF EUROPE was not just 3 fuckery medieval states ya' know
1918-1940 and the pre-Roman Dacian period
The last crazy theory I heard was that dacians (the tribes that existed before Romanians) *fucking taught* Latin to the Roman invaders
This is the crazy nationalist twist of the theory that dacians spoke something similar to Latin (and this because the language dacians spoke completely disappeared, Romanian is a mostly Latin language)
Communism lmao
The free territory was at least interesting
You forgot our Golden Era, when Hagi was scoring against Argentina and Colombia
In other words the Ottomans' punching bags
Wait, you had two Empires and you're looking up to Todor Jivkov
There's something wrong there
Sorry mate, you were the second SHIELD
Somehow we managed to keep the Europe Christian, nobody wastes time to explain how the Ottomans got Vienna under siege while we were PROTECTING EUROPE
Dont get me wrong brfore us bulgarians,serbs,byzantines,bosnians,albanians etc were THE SHIELD OF EUROPE,yes they failed and got conquered and then it came our time to shine and wallachia,transylvania,hungary and moldavia got defeated(in this exact order),yes even after this they continue to revolt and cause troubles for the ottomans and slowed their advance into europe but claiming that my country and only was the SHIELD OF EUROPE is wrong it was more like a team effort
Bcuz that was THE GOLDEN ERA
Pretty wrong but ok
It was
But keep in mind that most over the top nationalists will praise [this
Well, it depends on how you measure it
While it was an improvement over the past, we had the second last GDP in Europe
If you think that's great, then you should hear the theory about Deutschland being the "The Land of the Dacians".
Yeah saying shield is pretty overexagerating but as much as i dont wanna sound like a nationalistic we cant deny their achievments
To be honest, most of them
Jokes aside, probably the former mining cities in the Carpathians
Basically looking like stereotypical ghost towns
I wouldn't call it necessary ugly but it is the most depressing I've saw for sure
Yes, I have a thick moldavian accent and my friends and coworkers keep making fun of it
I have a slight Moldavian accent, especailly when i get mad, but i also use regional words
For info, i live in the capital of Romania, Bucharest
I dont really get mocked for it, but some people told me to stop using "îs", instead to use "sunt" (translation, I *am* ), especially my romanian language and literature teachers
I cant (and dont want to) stop
My parents are both moldavian
I spent all my childhood summers in Moldavia (region of Vrancea, to be more exact)
Thats how i learned to talk :)
And because of that, i also have a slight russian/slavic accent when speaking English
My English TC teacher always tells me "Go take Putin by the hand and learn proper accents together" (jokingly, of course)
> the way people in Bucharest talk, the way they switch up their "ă" and "e"

Breton is nota a Gaelic language
Let me explain:
Celtic languages are divided into 2 groups: the Gaelic ones, properly called Goidelic (Irish, Scottish-Gaelic and Manx) and Brythonic ones (Welsh, Cornish and Breton)
So Breton is Celtic, but not "Gaelic".
I'm sure it's excelent (especially against English vampires), but in this case it was a typo
You're right, I updated the comment
The netherlands fought the water once and won
Who said they won't do it once again
You fought the water once, and won
Netherlands strong and powerful
"decât" and "doar", both would be translated as "just"
&#x200B;
"decât" is used in negative forms, like "Nu am decât 100 de dolari
" = "I have only 100 dollars"
"doar" - "Am doar 100 de dolari" = "I only have 100 dollars
&#x200B;
But there it's an exception to "decât" - " Decât să merg la munte, mai bine merg la mare
" = "Rather than going to the mountain, I would better go to the sea
In Romanian we use "-" for many verbs and pronouns
Many people mess it up (place the minus where it shouldn't be and dont place it where it should be) like s-au/sau
They mean different thing, "s-au" needs to be used with a verb e.g. "s-au sarutat", means "they kissed", the verb is "au sarutat" and the "s-" defines who did the action, and "sau" means "or".  Another example is la/l-a. "La" means "to" (as a place, can be used for hours) and "l-a" is used like the "s-au" example
vroiam/voiam
Voiam means "I wanted" and vroiam isn't a word, its just the wrong way of saying voiam
The examples with suomea and sri lanka are rules in Romanian, but aren't common mistakes
Si cratimele sunt futute

Dear lord
I'm a Romanian citizen (part of the eu btw) and live in Germany
I have a job now and pay the same amount of taxes that Germans with the same social status (marital status, kids, qualifications, etc) pay
If I were to lose my job
I would have to go through the same unemployment process that German citizens go through and the German state would pay for my unemployment
So I pay taxes
I paid for that safety net
As an eu citizen I think you're eligible for unemployment benefits from the country you currently live in, if you already had a job and paid taxes for 1 year
If you didn't pay taxes for a year then I don't think you get unemployment money
In Romania, this is actually a rule for everyone
You can't get unemployment unless you paid taxes for a year (but I might be wrong cuz I've been out of there for a while now)
In conclusion, the way I see it is that you are treated as a citizen of that country
You pay the same taxes, you do the same work, you get the same benefits
From personal experience
You are free to move, study, work, with just border controls between non-Schengen countries, but no other requirements like visas
But if you want to settle in another country and work, you need to declare that you are changing your residency, make a new ID in the new country and all that jazz
You're by not means _abandoning_ your home country in any way, but all the work that you do in the new country under the new ID is taxed there
Also, once you work in a certain country, **based on the laws around there**, you might get entitled to social benefits other than what you get guaranteed as an EU citizen
For example, my step-dad works in Belgium while I'm in Romania
Since I'm still in university, I get a sum of money each month under their welfare for taking care of children
This, however, implied first going to the Romanian authorities and telling them to stop giving me child welfare
Conditions for welfare often are that you can only obtain it from one country at once
In simple terms:
EU citizens have to be treated like national citizens
There are however laws in place (the 3 month limit in which you are to find a job, for example) that ensures a person that moves without doing nothing doesn't fall on the social security net of the destination country
In theory you can even get a nasty letter that you're not welcomed in the country :)) (you don't have to leave and you can further look for a job, but you could receive such a letter)
However, once he works, studies or is a pensioner (the pension still get paid by the countries in which he worked according to their law without discrimination) or has immediate family that does so the EU citizen has to be treated exactly the same
Actually
the EU law goes even further and requires all residents to be treated equally when it comes to social assistance
The only difference is that a non-EU person might be conditioned by his visa to what he can or can't do and so some assistance is simply void (a 3 year worker on a visa and temporary residence card might not enjoy any long term benefits the hosting country might have after loosing his job since he has to leave the country if he can't find another job in a specified amount of time)
This is not so weird
EU discrimination is about treating foreign EU citizens the same as locals
Amazingly you can discriminate on your own citizens
~~Wales~~ Scotland (if I remember correctly -- hopefully I don't confuse them with others) has (well, had) free higher education for scotish citizens but not for people residing in England
They however have to provide the same free higher education for all EU citizens
Related to ID, it again is very specific to the country
In Romania, all residents must have an ID card an a Romanian "Personal Numerical Code".
For Romanian people, that code starts with 1 or 5 for men and 2 or 6 for women
For foreign people, it starts with 7 or 8
My step-dad who is working in Belgium also had to get a Belgian ID card
This actually makes sense
The EU law has to take account on everything it's happening in the EU
And there are safeguards against people trying to benefit from social welfare while residing in another country (e.g. romanians getting money from Spain after just a few years of working -- keep in mind a lot of EE migrators might benefit form such a scheme from multiple countries)
It is actually the prefered way for Sweden to change it's laws if they see fit (or simply keep paying it without an actual obligation) rather then further engaging in obliging countries to pay similar pensions to people that no longer reside in their countries
It was really cool
Even after seeing a lot of it in movies and tv shows, which was nice being able to recognize things, it was very impressive and I got to discover a lot of interesting things
Oh and the statue of Liberty is much smaller than I imagined
besides from it being cool in general
I thought the financial district / downtown area seemed really really crowded i.e. narrow streets and skyscrapers, lots of shadow from the buildings and no sunlight, this is if you take a walk in the Wall St
area I would say
Not impressed
I prefer Hong Kong, Singapore, Madrid, Barcelona
Reasons: dirty, smelly, rats, alot of weird people, don't feel safe, expensive
Bad traffic, noise, non stop noise
But the op asked for the architecture and buildings
"Despicable Me" was translated as "Sunt Un Mic Ticălos" which means "I'm A Little Bastard".
Also "Die Hard" was translated as "Greu de Ucis" which means "Hard to Kill".
> Groundhog day: Idétlen időkig (Until clumsy, (?) times)
Here it was translated as "Ziua Cârtiței" (the Day of the Mole)
> Breaking Bad: Totál szívás (Totally sucks)
That's worse than our translation, "Pe căi greșite" (On wrong paths/ways)
That one was translated as "Pradă Dificilă" (Hard to get Prey)
Got beaten by 7 dudes and got my money stolen as well in the front of a church
thx romania
Spilled some dude's drink while very drunk at a night club
I had only spilled half his drink but he wanted me to pay for it full price
When I said no he slapped me and I slapped him back, then a bodyguard saw me and took me outside where the dude knocked me out in one punch
I guess it was good that I was drunk and fell in one punch cause I could have ended up way worse if I had fought back

I have heard of "Patria mamă" in Romanian, or "Motherland" but I don't think there is any "Fatherland"
Romanian here
Can confirm this is true
We won't kill you, but your parents sure will
I'm struggling to read and understand this comment
Because country is feminine
I've heard patrie used as fatherland before
If a place here doesn't have those, it's either a really important national treasure with the original wooden frame windows, or it's a place with no windows
I've never seen windows like that outside of movies either
bucharestbiketraffic is a bicycle vlogger from Bucharest (electric bikes) and also makes reviews of bikes and stuff, he's pretty enjoyable to watch
[Andrei Terbea
] He makes videos in English, but it's still a great watch
In Romanian only, I'd say [MsAnneGreen
] She makes SexEd videos I guess
I really enjoy watching Buctrafic

So authentic
Apart from when he screams at drivers like an idiot
How about BackPackYourLife or Grigore Varlam, Varlam influence so many people to be a food courier at Glovo and Catalin from BackPackUrLife influenced people to travel
So yea, I just unsubscribe BackPackyourLife because sometimes he do so many clickbaits and he began to show a hunger for money, at first he was independent and living with some resources and a rent
Well honestly drivers in Bucharest are shit, and there is little to no bicycle infrastructure, but yes, that's part of his charm, yelling and stupid drivers
I think most people watch him especially for the screaming parts:))
How common is the handshake as a greeting between men in your country
Do men shake hands when they meet
I mean men who already know each other, as a form of greeting, not when they are first introduced
Is it still going strong or is it regarded as an old-fashioned form of greeting
Depends
Young man shake hands but there's nothing more funny that an old man grabbing them from the handshake into a kiss on both cheeks and, maybe, a huge hug
I laugh inside everytime
If I get to see this with a foreigner is even more funny
They look so confused for a couple of seconds and I'm like "*haha
You weren't expecting this one, weren't you
You got punked with an old fashion kiss
I've been shaking hands with people since I was 14 and always, but always when I meet a man I know I shake hands
It's instinct at this point
No, we do it everyday between friends when we meet and when we say goodbye
Yep, handshakes can be anything between formal and informal here
In the Netherlands they just dont do it, it is so hard as a Romanian  to not be the strange guy that shakes hands with everyone
I had some french family friends come over
I went to shake hands with them
Then they kissed me(this happens in my country in special events and this wasn't one of them)
I felt a little weird and they noticed it
They said it was pretty common in France
I like both Cats and Dogs
I think most people in Romania have both a cat and a dog, especially in the rural areas
In the cities however, most people prefer cats, or really small dogs (from what I personally know)
I prefer cats from all points of view
I like dogs too but I'm not crazy about them
I grew up with stray dogs on the streets and not all of them were nice lol so I've kinda been wary of dogs since
Plus I'm scared of loud sudden noises which includes dogs barking near me
Not sure what the people in my country prefer
Probably 50/50
Many people also have both a cat and a dog
I love both but definitely prefer cats, generally I think that people like dogs better
I'm a cat person
The country is a dog person and I hate it
The continent is mixed, I think
Cats are just ️. Dogs are OK
Lizard person
Jokes aside, I love both for their different quirks
I always wanted a dog, but I don't have the space for one
I have a stray cat that decided to live in my yard and a dragon inside
I think both are quite popular
I know lots of people have dogs and those who have cats usually have more than one
And there's the guard dog / pest control cat thing
What I know for sure is that reptiles aren't popular and lots of people think that my bearded dragon is either gross (he ain't) or that he's going to kill me
He's a derp
He's the best combination of cat and dog and so are other lizards, there's no hair or barking but he loves interaction like a dog, is quite independent like a cat and snuggles with you like one
Unlike neither of them he changes colors and could live his whole life in a terrarium (given that it's the right size) but you can take him out for a walk
And his food is way cheaper
Im an everything person
My grandma was the type of woman who would spend every cent she had to help an animal in her care
However this is not the general consensus of my country, unfortunately
Personally it's hard to choose, I really like both - but I lean towards cats just cause I'm too much of a homebody to even consider having a dog
Nationally I would say dogs - just cause I know more people who prefer dogs
Continentally, probably cats would be a bit more popular, simply because they're easier to take care of
From what I've read, in the past , the glaziers in the west of the country invented a special language in order to communicate with each other, so that others couldn't understand what they were talking about: for example, the recipe of making a certain type of glass or how to make it
In Romania Transylvanian Saxon
It was mistakenly named Saxon as King Géza II brought over a bunch of German workers to defend the border and he called all Germans "Saxons" as most of the miners in Hungary from Germany came from Saxony if I'm not mistaken
The actual language is a Franconian one, which makes it closer to Dutch than to other Saxon varieties such as Low Saxon/German
Well, maybe people are aware that Hungarian is spoken in Romania as well and German
However, I think few people know there are also Turkish, Slovak, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Italian, Armenian speakers in Romania
Also, no, none of these languages are "recent", the people have been living here for at least some centuries
The language that some gypsies speak
It is simillar to indian
It's aktchkually a Moselle Franconian dialect, classifying it as Central Franconian, so closer to Luxembourgish

They are not even that well known in Romania either
It's pretty well known
I'm not reliant of a car (I don't even have a DL) since I live in the capital
I use the public transport (mostly the subway) to go around
Short version: you can get around without a car but it takes alot of time in the capital, and incredibly long in the countryside
Long version: Well take a look at my rute to University
The university is in the center of the city
I have a tram going across my street that leaves me about 10 minutes of walking distance to it, but it's never in station on time due to poor infrastructure, busy roads or people blocking the line
It's crowded to the point of being squashed with all my belongings into the tram door, and God forbid you carry a backpack or something that takes space
The tram either takes 10 minutes to reach the city center(if there is absolutely nobody is on the street) or up to 30 minutes (excluding waiting time)
So If I am in the tram station at 7:30 i am not sure if I'll be at uni at 7:40, 7:50 or even 8:30
Same route by car takes 10 minutes
Always 10 minutes
I'm not going off the line of my tram at all
If i decide to park in the center area it costs 10 ron the first 2 hours and then 20 the next
For 8 hours thats about 30 euros, and for someone spending 5 to 7 days a week there almost every month its a bit expensive
So I end up leaving my car 10 minutes out from uni in a free parking place I find
Except for the costs of the car itself its cheaper and more convenient to use a car
If you add up all monthly tickets for tram/bus/metro its twice as expensive as the money I use for my fuel
You can go anywhere you want faster
You can go in the countryside with it and unlike public transport it's 24/7 available
Will I switch to using the tram
Not if things change
Why don't I use a bycicle or scooter
Because it was stolen and because drivers in Bucharest are mental
I am pro-public transport
If we could get dedicated bus lines I'd become a happy commuter
But the people here are backwards
I live in Romania, I make €500/month
I can't afford a car
Family
Kids
It's maybe cheaper
It's the same with the people living in small towns outside Bucharest
Ive heard corruption is illegal
Cars are technically not allowed to park on sidewalks, bike lanes, building entrances, intersections, roundabouts
Scrabble was illegal, until 1989
Very funny
Wait, what

I think this is the most fair ranking
Athens of course
Do I really need to elaborate on that
Geographically speaking, the following countries are in the Balkan peninsula, partially or fully:
\- Albania
\- Bosnia
\- Bulgaria
\- Montenegro
\- North Macedonia
\- Kosovo
\- Croatia
\- Greece
\- Italy
\- Romania
\- Serbia
\- Slovenia
\- Turkey
Also Bulgaria, there is no way someone would say Bulgaria is not in the Balkans, when it's dead right in the middle in its full entirety
From a geographic point of view, from Romania only the Dobruja (Dobrogea) region is part of Balkans
Historically speaking, that region had a lot more Bulgarians and Turks than the rest of the country
European part of Turkey is
And also Trieste
Istanbul is usually not considered part of the Balkans
I said fully or partially
A region like the Balkans doesn't have to extend to full countries only
Also it's not even the same logic
I think Balkan gets confused with the Southern Slavic countries in the Western mindset
The oldest still inhabited city in Romania, Constanța (historically, Tomis) was founded around 600 BC - there is still evidence of Roman settlement (which happened a good couple of centuries later)
Many other major cities have been around for almost 2 millennia
So yeah, as other people have already said, it's not really a matter of digging in your backyard and coming across artefacts from 2,000 years ago (though it HAS happened), but our history is visible pretty much everywhere
We don't really learn it about it in schools, but we do hear hear about it it a lot
First are all the projects funded by EU money, a lot of which got stolen but still we built things with them .
Then the second leading party (which actually has more support than the leading party outside of villages where priests and mayors tell everyone who to vote for) is known to be very pro EU
People don't know much about the EU from what I've seen, but they know that it's beneficial for us to stay in it
I personally support the EU past the economic benefits but that's another story
It's only the nationalist minority who wants to get rid of the EU and of NATO and basically become like Serbia and also the old communist minority who hates everything
SMS or contactless card
I think you're making a lot of people jealous right now
In my city you can buy it from the bus/tram using a contactless card or scanning a qr code with a special app which is linked to your bank account, or outside from the ticket kiosk or vending machine
I felt the same, my friend
Sometimes the West has to learn from us
There's a 4 digits number where you send a SMS with the bus number you're traveling with and they charge you (€0

You just send for example the text "35" (without quotes) to the number you already have

Honestly I don't mind the vampire/Dracula jokes, but some are pretty annoyed by them
I don't mind those jokes as well
It's the others about a certain ethnicity people confuse use with that get me triggered and make me think again before saying my nationality or not/lying

I find it weird how others talk in salary before taxes, that's not what I see in my bank account

What are the biggest "wow* facts about your country and what world records it has on it's name
Romania holds the place for the biggest administrative building in the world with Palace of Parliament (Palatul Parlamentului), but also being the most expensive house, second biggest building in the world behind the Pentagon of USA and the heaviest
Most of the things you said are not true though
It’s the second largest administrative building or the largest administrative building built with public founds
It’s the most expensive administrative building but there are other buildings more expensive
And it’s not the second biggest building (also depends if you refer to volume, footprint or area), there are some malls and factories bigger
Highest percentage of people actually owning their homes (96%+)

At the balkan corner we would try to kill each other with butter knifes and forks
We would try to calm down the balkan corner as
- Serbia strangles Croatia
-Bosnia and Herzegovina tries to kill Serbia
- Slovenia tries to save Croatia
- Albania quietly takes Kosovo away and bangs Serbia's Head with a plate
- montenegro sleeping
- macedonia being slowly kidnapped by Bulgaria
We'll just slap some Manele and get on the party, prolly get drunk and get kicked out for killing someo- i mean what
We’d just hang from the ceiling
and wait for the right moment to strike
We would switch sides during arguments and we would steal Hungarys food
we would get drunk af
We would be sitting in a dark corner cutting ourselves because the Netherlands won't agree we should stay in their group of friends
Wait, aren't you gonna be the leader who gets mad because everyone is misbehaving and France still tries to start a war with england
With us
Why did you group us with 2 other countries that like you
Romanians and Russians get along for sure, but when it comes to politics and history, you are the country that fucked us over the most in recent history
Did we ever had a problem with other Balkan country
I feel like Romania would just be there saying nothing while all the other Balkan countries argue with each other
Hey, why not us too
We promise we won't put blood in it this time
Well you can include most Eastern European countries on that list probably, if we don’t take politics and history into account, we would all get along
Yeah but we are good friends with Bulgaria now
Well barely anyone remembers our war with Bulgaria and Turkey
it’s definitely in the past for us
Hungary is in Central Europe
Their conflict with us is very Balkan, except we never had any kind of genocides against each other
We mostly like them now, while the other Balkan countries keep on hating on them for historical reasons, we found another enemy country to hate in recent history
(I guess you know which one)
The dacians' religion is something we don't really tackle at school unfortunately
Zalmoxis is often mentioned in Herodotus's writings as a demi god in which the geto dacians believed in
Most of us don't even know the dacians had a polytheistic religion before Christianity and that's really a shame, since there is so much info on it and it's just super interesting
We inslaved gypsies for quite a while
The interwar period is filled with drama, tragedy, heroeism, dreams, fools and it is very interesting
I wish we got taught more on this instead of the useless *Dacia great* circlejerck
On the other hand, we do have few datapoints and recorded history today, in oder to know more
Dacians and the greater Thracian tribes didn't really bother with written history
We do have settlements, ceramics, jewels and stuff like thst, bit since they were tribes, and not some advanced civ, most of it it was just forgotten
Their religion is what i know from the greeks,but we are not really certain it was as stated, as far as i know
Was looking for this
Also, shipped them off to labour/death camps in Transnistria a bit later
It was a month or so ago that I even found out that "regular" slaves (chattel slavery) could be freed, if their master wanted to free them, at the age of 22, or at any age above that

That Transylvania always was Romanian land
I think we are in on that secret
Shhhhhh
The same is in Germany, but you also have the option to do a "tax return" which from what I understand is more of a "please recalculate my taxes" type of thing
Because you're not forced to do it and it's basically asking the financial institution to make sure you paid enough taxes/they didn't take too much
In Ro it's exactly as you described
And I'm not sure you can ask for a recalculation
No, Transylvania was inhabited by a Romanian majority since the Dacians were invaded by Romans at the time the Hungarians arrived
As a person who doesn't have kids nor owns a car, you earn alot
I earn 500 euros after tax in romania and I pay 150 in rent and 200 on food and other expenses
The 1866 Constitution only allowed the death penalty during times of war (Art
18) . Same with the 1923 Constitution (Art
16)
Both were during the (kind of) constitutional monarchy
The 1938 Constitution (during the absolute monarchy) reintroduced the death penalty for "acts against the Monarch and its family, Heads of other Countries, against people holding a office of public dignity, burgalry with murder, and political assassination". It was used extensibly after the assassination of Prime Minister Calinescu in september 1939 by the far-right and during the Marshall Ion Antonescu regime (that happened during a sort of constitutional void)
In the communist period the death penalty was used
During the Dej period (1948-1965) it could be given for more or less anything including "fighting against the new communist order", while during the first Ceausescu period (1965-1971) only for actual crimes
During the second Ceausescu period (1971-1989), it was returned to Dej levels, with very frequent executions for "economic crimes" or "treason".
After the Romanian Revolution things were complicated
On 7th January 1990 a decree abolished the death penalty
People protested because they wanted former communist criminals to be executed
The decree was abolished and instead a referendum was planned
But the authorities decided to abandon the referendum and abolish the decree that was abolshing the decree abolishing the death penalty :)))
In the end in the Constitution of 1991 the death penalty is clearly forbidden in Art
22 (3) - "The death penalty is forbidden".
The last people executed were the Ceausescu couple on the 25th December 1989
Hmmmm, it's hard to answer since I'm not in that position
I would say that the people are not against foreigners in general, but the foreigners need to speak the language good enough to manage on their own, because the Romanian people, as friendly as they are, are not the kind of people to tolerate "dead weight". People are in general very helpful, but the moment they feel like they're being taken advantage of, they'll stop helping completely, even if you're genuine about your intentions
I think the people's attitude towards a foreigner depends a lot on the efforts that foreigner puts into integrating
Meaning if they try to speak the language or if they are friendly to others and don't isolate into their little bubble (this is something some people from Asia do, they don't even get their haircuts from Romanian shops and in small communities people notice and label them as "antisocial")
As for the EU/non-EU distinction
Well
It can be tricky
If you come from a rich EU or non-EU country and you don't try to Integrate, you're a snob
If you come from a poorer country and don't try to integrate, you're a moron
But if you come from a rich country, people will be more tolerant towards certain things because they won't expect you to stay
And they will be shocked that you're not a tourist
As for the paperwork/other kind of stuff one needs to live in our country
I don't know
I can't even make an educated guess
We get today off only because it's the 2nd day of Easter for us
Otherwise if a public holiday falls during the weekend, bad luck, we don't get another day off
However I've heard that some employers can give you that option
It was this year due to easter
Atleast in my school
It transfers on a Saturday so still in the weekend
Surprised how I know that and I am not even Dutch
If by bath you mean the one where you fill up your bathtub and sit in it, then I haven't taken one of those since I was a kid
It's fun to check out your wrinkly fingers afterwards but everything else sucks lol
I do shower everyday though
During summer I shower every time I come back from outside
It depends
Usually, I take a shower every day
During summer, I take 2 showers per day
Oh, I meant that I do like getting wrinkly fingers
hahah I just hate everything else about baths, like I don't even find them relaxing, I just get bored in there and feel like I'm wasting so much water lol
I have a pizza cutter but it never cuts all the way down so I simply use my hands to separate the slices or a knife
I don't, but I've seeen it done in pizza places where they sell by the slice and all their pizzas are rectangular
For those in Bucharest, Latin Pizza is one of those places
I use a knife to cut it
But I do put ketchup on it afterwards
I don't like Hawaii pizza, maybe that will help me save face in front of the Italians
Either Augustus or Aurelian
Augustus for founding the empire and Aurelian for saving it when it was about to collapse
There's stereotypes about every region pretty much
Moldova is poor, rural and uncivilised
Vaslui man is kind of like our Florida man
For example: Vaslui man who quit drinking for the New Year becomes richest man in county
In Brăila there are stereotypically lots of stabbings
Brăila people choose the knife which they'll use to stab the ribbon at the opening of their new bridge
Transylvanians are slow and naïve
Oltenia is also poor, but the people have too much pride
I come from the area of Moldova in Romania and it is considered a place of drunkards, wife beaters and overall temperamental people, in other words a bit of a butt crack
Well I come from a specific historical region called Bucovina and whenever people say I am from Moldova I corect them and tell them I am from Bucovina
I have a bit of an accent so when I lived in Sibiu people looked at me like I was stupid
Now I live in the capital and other than my accent sticking out like a sore thumb there is not a big difference
Well, we have Vaslui, wich is like Romanian Florida
&#x200B;
Braila and Galati, wich are in a "constant war".
&#x200B;
And we have Craiova wich is full of "cool dudes".
Dunno but we have a few cities that have Hollywood like signs of their names
The most famous one is the one in Braşov
I think most of out tv industry in based around Bucharest
[Buftea] is where most Romanian TV shows and movies are filmed
In Romania there is Bucharest and then a big peloton of cities arround 300k (orderd them randomly:Iasi , Galati, Constanta,Craiova,Brasov , Timisoara , Cluj)
* Bucharest is obviously the biggest . Probably best wages in Ro but quality of life is lacking . Pollution is huge , traffic according to many sources is worst in the world even if i guess this is an overstatement but not by much .There are these jokes due to communist heating system failures over and over again due to lack of maintenance .
* Cluj . The emerging city in Ro
A lot of IT and other industries are there , city looks much better than Bucharest but it come at a price as rents there are way bigger .Often it's joked about things Bucharest has and Cluj doesn't .Like Ikea .But especially the Metro/Subway system
* Iasi . Probably 2nd most populated city in Ro , but it's somewhat a poor city in a poorer region .A lot of people from Moldova go here as it's the main city in region and the only one with a decent university .
Having lived in Bucharest for many years, let me offer a slightly different perspective
I empathised with the Irish person in this thread who said Dublin is a little more rought around the edges, and you have to dig a little deeper to find its charms, but it's so great when you do
It just never ceases to surprise with hidden architecture, views, little hip bars and cafés hidden behind a house that looks derelict, in some random side street in the Armenian quarter
I remember finding this place where you can see the brutalist concrete collosus of the Ministry of Defense through an archway of a posh early 20th century villa  Also the parks are top notch, even if the place could use a few more
You're right that it's crowded as fuck and pollution is high though
And yeah lots of places are just irredeemably ugly
Definitely not for everyone
>but it's somewhat a poor city in a poorer region
Altul care se uită la știrile ProTV
i like the city , that's why i'm living here but 99% of people consider me an alien or some lunatic when i'm saying Bucharest is not that bad
n am televizor de 10 ani cred
In fine am , am si cablu dar cred ca daca zic ca de 10 nu m am uitat la astfel de lucruri , nu gresesc .Sau vrei sa mi zici ca Iasi e mai ok decat Timisoara , Oradea , Cluj , Sibiu sau Brasov .As putea chiar extinde cu Constanta
It depends on what you prefer I suppose
If you like history or architecture then I'd suggest Iasi, Alba Iulia, Sibiu or Brasov
Bucharest also fits this category
what are you looking forward to see
if you've been so far in Europe what cities did you enjoy the most
Yeah, our people really love to hate on themselves
Everyone just agrees that Romania is the worst country on earth, and whatever city you live in is the worst city in the country
It really is not that bad after all, and it's slowly getting better imo
„Mai ok” în ce sens boss
Că aici putem face o listă lungă și istovitoare
calitatea vietii .
Ok, dă mai multe detalii
Că și ăsta e un termen ambiguu
We have mandatory vaccinations against tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella
Yes, a patient has the right to spread possible deadly diseases to people who don't have a strong immune system
Yes
A few examples are: Charles - Carol, Louis - Ludovic, Peter - Petru
Romania isn't poor
Also Brasov best city In Romania no doubt
True, for specific values of 'horrible'.
Well, if you have very low expectations, then it's not that hard to pass them :P
There're the sächsische Schweiz here in the East
And Martin Luther
The little towns like Weimar, Erfurt, Halle are really pretty too
Not worth more than a day of walking around, but pretty nonetheless
Right
>Vienna has been named the best city in the world to live in this year
I hate my Country dont get me wrong
Seems about right :P
Which city did you visited
sounds like Romania
.... N-no
That can't be true
Nooooooooo
Unless you pass by someone old (especially in villages)
No more from like the Dachia people who idk If they got robbed by the Roman's or something
So partially but not really
It varies a lot with age
I noticed that in my 20s, everyone bought pastries and cakes for celebrations, like birthdays, people leaving the company or so on
In my 30s now and pizza is the norm
People who happen to work during big public holidays like Easter or Christmas, or in the days right after, will bring some traditional food made by their grandmothers or mothers since that's the good stuff
Depending on the workplace, you may or may not also bring homemade wine or something stronger
In the autumn, if you happen to have a vineyard or have relatives with vineyards, people will bring to work some of the newly made grape juice that hasn't fermented yet
There aren't many workplace related traditions in Romania
Mostly the same thing that you describe
People always bring food or sweets for birthdays or happy occasions
In Germany however
There is some weird shit going on
In my workplace (east Germany), people put pictures of their children on the kitchen wall
Like for everybody to see
And when someone is about to have the baby
People make them a "diaper cake". They literally take out diapers from a diaper bag and arrange them into a cake-shaped pile
I still haven't figured out if this is a super specific thing or not
> My birthday = my treat
Your birthday = your treat
Asking me to do work (like bring the treats or the cake) on your birthday is bizarre
Just a heads up, the first sentence is a bit confusing - "my treat" means you're paying for something :)  As in "Hey, it's my birthday, so let's go out to eat tonight - my treat
Your second sentence clarifies that you're on the side of "you bring ME cake for my birthday", but just wanted to chime in
EDIT
Misread the "*your* birthday" part
[Cargo - Ziua Vrăjitoarelor] fits most of your requirements and I'd say is one of the most well known headbangers that we have
I linked the live version because I prefer that one
They had an amazing performance in White Horse, Costinești back in my teenage days that still rings in my head every now and then
If you want a more *fun* one, here's the ode to drinking - [Anarhia]
Or if you want one that truly fits *all* your requirements, it's [Altar - La Noi] Maybe a bit too "hard" and unpolished for mainstream Rock radios to play it, but it's one of the best critiques of Romanian culture and identity in all of modern art, and a true banger
[Lyrics]
[Alternosfera-Ploile nu vin ]
They're from Moldova but it's a shame to not include them
There is a youtube channel called [Heavy Metal Of The Eastern Bloc] which should cover all of our balkan friends baltic, ukranian and polish friends and russians
You can try the band E-an-na which is a folk metal band with quite a big variety of instruments used in their songs, I fucking love them !
[Subcarpați - dă-i foale
It has a national instrument (sort of), but it's not metal
It's lofi
[Coma - bine]
This one is rock
Here you go mate, some of the best Romania has to offer
I tried to keep it as diverse as possible while still respecting your requirements
They're listed heaviest to lightest
Enjoy, and do post a link with the finished product
Cheerio ^_^
[Negura Bunget - Gradina Stelelor]
[Dordeduh - Desferecat]
[Trooper - Vlad Țepeș]
[An-Theos - Noaptea Sânzienelor]
[Cargo - Călare pe Motoare]
[Luna Amară - Pietre în Alb]
[Phoenix - Negru Vodă ( Live - cause it's the extended version where everyone showed off]
[Timpuri Noi - Vecina]
[Jurjak - Vântul]
[Sarmalele Raci - Șpriț de vară]
[Travka - Urban Violent]
[Taxi - Nu mai simți nimic] - there is also an english version of this song on YT
It was written as a response to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, right when Romania signed a new deal with NATO sending more troops there
[Bere Gratis - Ce n-a văzut Parisul]
should be warned, though, altar went very lame after the first album, which was in english
Well, 3 count
Vlad The Impaler
He actually was a very good leader, very patriotic and loved his people
He just impaled criminals so the people would get scared and no one would do crimes
It is said that if you left your wallet in the city 3 days later it would still be there
The second one was Ion Antonescu, leader of Legionary Romania in WW2
Anti-semitic, he sympathized Adolf and he made the jews rebuild Bucharest after the bombing
The third one was a communist dictator that we executed fairly recent (End of December 1989), Nicolae Ceausescu, he heavily rationized the food, water, oil, heat, medicine etc
and the country just HATED him
And Carol II not
Antonescu was anti semite and orchestrated the Odessa massacre but you can't really say he was insane,since he at least removed the legionaries from power quickly and didn't try to resist being removed from power
Maybe, but most would say Ceausescu
Vlad was crazy, but for that time wasn’t something unheard of to kill criminals in let’s say “creative” ways
Over ten thousands, actually, but the numbers might be exaggerated
But he wasn't insanely cruel for his time and place, medieval Romanian history makes Game of Thrones feel like a documentary
Some context: his father got killed, skinned and stuffed like an animal (not sure about the order); one of the first things he had to deal with after taking the throne was his supporters and family being mutilated and burned or buried alive by opposing nobles
Yeah, you can count him
I don't know much history of that period but I knew he wasn't a "ușă de biserică"
One doesn't get the nickname "the terrible" for nothing though
Vlad loved the people and hated crime
Crazy maybe, but still a good ruler
Vlad wasn't crazy, impaling was a common execution practice back then, and also most of the stories about him are exaggerated
Ceausescu was a megalomaniac and an idiot but I don't think he was crazy
I think Codreanu would fit better, the guy had prophetic dreams that led him to form The Legion, the only problem is that he was never the leader of the country, but still a very influential politician
Many "voievod"s (our term for king) stood up against the ottomans, for a while, this doesn't make him special
Anyway here's a [youtube] video about him/battles
According to the Sultan, yes
But the dude had a huge crush on Vlad, so he might have been a bit biased
He did win a few battles against the turks, but overall had three reigns that totaled 6 years, spent mostly in civil wars against his brother, and managed to get imprisoned by the man he hoped would ally him
If we had a genius ruler that would have been Stefan cel Mare
Yep, meanwhile Ceausescu was just an insane idiot that did nothing but torture and destroy the very soul of citizens
Most of the stories about him are propaganda made by the ottomans and by the Transylvanian saxons
He wasn't at all special in terms of his cruelty by medieval standards, impaling was a common way of execution, and he made quite a few reforms that helped the citizens of Wallachia
Sure you could say he was cruel, but I don't think he was insane
The trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu
The show trial lasted one hour during which time the couple was charged and condemned to death by an improvised court with no prior investigation and no evidence
Heck, even their [forcibly-assigned] lawyers sided with the prosecution and accused them of capital crimes
After the trial they were taken out of the building and immediately executed by a firing squad
What can I say - a monstrous ending to a monstrous era
I don't know if it counts as a court case but one time, a person from Romania was declared dead evem though he was alive
Well, the court cases about the [Romanian Revolution of 1989] and the [Mineriad of June 1990] are still in the works
The first one is investigated because most of the bloodshed and deaths in the Revolution of 1989 happened after Ceausescu fled Bucharest, and complete chaos ensued for several days, with some army units on the side of the revolutionaries, others fighting for the old regime alongside the Securitate, armed civilians shooting other civilians because they were fed lies about "terrorists" and "foreign agents".
During the Revolution the power was seized by basically second-row Communist Party officials who rebranded themselves as the National Slavation Front
They also retained control of other state institutions such as the intelligence services
In June 1990, this new power suppressed pro-reform and pro-[Lustration] protest by academics, arists, students, etc in Bucharest by bringing in coal miners and industrial workers and telling them that they were fighting "radical elements", "hooligans" and "anarchists". If you want to know what people were protesting for, look into the [Proclamation of Timisoara
But since the same old elites retained power in parliament, the magistrature and in the intelligence services until recently, they've blocked and stalled these cases from seeing the light of day
And personally, I don't expect them to be resolved anytime soon
The man that is alive but got declared dead but now he is in court against the government (or something) because he wanted to not be dead anymore
They'll probably call him to vote after he really dies or something
Here's the Romanian equivalent if someone wants to know (pretty similar rules):
Děkuji ti - (I) thank you (sg
) - Îți mulțumesc
Děkuji vám - (I) thank you (pl
or formal) - Vă mulțumesc
Děkujeme ti - (We) thank you (sg
) - Îți mulțumim
Děkujeme vám - (We) thank you (pl
or formal) - Vă mulțumim
Offtopic but those Dutch phrases sound (to me) like a Russian speaking German
Ortăruie (Transylvania Romanian) Ort Der Ruhe
Ștrudel :3
>Rükverc
TIL this word begins with an "R". Always thought it was "Lükverc" (that's how my grandparents always pronounced it)
I have a good one
My grandma used to say "Vesterzi
" for "Do you understand
" (Akin to "Capish
" or "Comprende
" in English)
I don't know if this is widely used in Hungarian
It was very late in life that I realized it comes from German "Verstehen sie
And the English and Standart Romanian equivalents of this
Same
And șnițet :)
Cemetery / Cimitir
Frankly, I've only ever heard my grandma use it, nobody else, so I was always curious where she had gotten it from
Very interesting
Thank you
In my corner of the country the dialectal word would be "temetieu" (from Hungarian)
But it remind me of two other local germanisms:
"ștrase" - corso / strada principală (main street)
"țuhaus" - închisoare (prison)
In my city we even have a Sasisch cemetery with the text and all
It's not very common and society has mixed feelings about them, especially about their personal hygiene
That's how rockers spot each other in public :P Long hair isn't that uncommon here, especially if there is a rock/metal community
About how society views them, I'd assume most of them don't really care lol
Also apart from elderly people, those who aren't rock fans, and strict bosses and teachers, I don't think anyone has any particular negative sentiment towards them
For teenagers we usually call them "Roacers" , which is just a funny way of pronouncing Rocker
You don't even gotta listen to rock, if you got long hair you're a rocker
There's also the skaters who have long hair but the line between them and the rockers is often blurry
How common is it
I don't know, probably 1 in 10 guys or so
There are some
The stigma depends on the age of the people around
Older people don't like that sort of thing and they *will* let you know
Younger people don't really care, but they *will* assume that you listen to rock or metal
In my city, it's not that uncommon
Most of them are metalheads tho
At the start of highschool I was threatened with disciplinary action if I didn't cut my hair by the principal
I know other guys with long hair or beards who got the same treatment
All straight-A students who were bringing awards to the school, mind you
It was one of those schools with a stick up its arse about how great it is, enforcing uniforms and all that jazz
I just kept saying "yes yes i'll do it" until we moved to a different city
That was almost 10 years ago though, pretty sure it's illegal now
Last year i finished school
In the 11 class i had long hair, nobody had any problem except from few frinedly jokes from my classmates
Yeah exactly
I also used to have that one teacher who picked on students with long hair, full beards, dyed hair etc (and it looked pretty good on them, not blunder years material haha)
She was also a school uniform advocate
I'll never understand it
Yeah some schools are much more chill than others
The principal and other school admin were power hungry cunts who would punish anything slightly out of line
A few years ago they wanted to expel a student for a post in a private FB group that was critical of a teacher (but not vulgar or overly impolite), you may have seen that on national TV :)
When I moved nobody had a problem with it at the new place
In Romanian, it literally translates to "nun" (călugăriță)
,,călugărița” which literally translates to Nun
Călugăriță in Romanian, meaning nun
Well, given my country tag you can probably guess already
The most famous song from our country is definitely "Dragostea din tei" by ozon
Ancom gang
What is the most insulting thing that someone can say about your country
In Romania *if you confuse Bucharest with Budapest* or *if you leave food on your plate is considered very insulting*, what about your country
I'd say assumptions like 'All Romanians are gypsies' and 'You all beg/steal/are poor/take our jobs' are way worse then confusing Bucharest with Budapest or leaving food on a plate but ok
I don’t know where in Romania you’re from, but I’ve never heard anybody consider it insulting to leave food on your plate
I think
" that we're thieves"
Outside of the Gypsies issue, for pretty much every Romanian, saying that Greater Romania was bad/, idiotic or saying Romania doesn't own Transylvania or Bessarabia
Sillistria is a bit different cause Romanians weren't a majority albeit a decently sized minority
The same cannot be said about Transylvania and Bessarabia where outside of Bugeac and some parts of Transylvania, Romanians represent a significant majority and have done so for ages
Saying we do not oe should not own these lands is pretty much an insult to our history, heritage and sacrifices we made, especially in 1st World War
So you're from Holland then ?
The schrodinger eastern european  ,takes jobs but never works
We Romanians don't have problems with this, as Switzerland translates to "Elveţia" and Sweden to "Suedia" so no big deal about that
Trianon was fair
In most cases at least
I support Hungary having S. Slovakia and Carphatian Ruthenia, maybe even Voijvodina
The only reason I don't speak my support about these is because of Transylvania
Is probably a grandmother account
I think you know how people here care about the food they make and they expect a nice review
Let's drink Rakija
I'd do it for the memes
This people are definitely annoying, imagine going to the Netherlands to study and everyone assuming you are here to party
I would do that in my country too
To the dumpster  with the Christian god
Praise Zamolxis
Hungarians being salty over a piece of land is a meme in Transylvania
The hungarians from here laugh about it as well
What is it about
I don't understand anything but it sounds really cool
Yep , same in romanian "Olanda" and a lot of other languages
We have "Țările de Jos" but no one uses the term since it's strange
You don't say
That's how we call the Netherlands in Romania "Olanda"- Holland because saying the translated version of Netherlands- "Tarile de Jos" is too long and not everyone knows what country that is but everyone knows where Holland is
It's like instead of saying Netherlands  you'd say "The countries beneath" It's kind of a fucked up translation but it's all we got
Sorry
In my case it was a tease  ..also we use "Olanda" in romanian but I don't think anyone would use "Holland" when speaking English ..they'd use "Netherland"
I think you might have missed the sarcasm ..it was just a tease
The soviets killed or imprisoned any opposition to their occupation and generally the soviet cooperationist are seen worse than the military government or even the Legionaries so no one was punished fairly
Many opportunistic legionnaires ended up in the Communist Party
Thee was the famous poem by Păstorel:
"Căpitane, nu fi trist,
Garda merge înainte,
Prin Partidul Comunist"
*("[Captain] don't be sad,*
*The [Iron] Guard lives on,*
*Through the Communist Party")*
Mă refer la legionari ca mișcare nu membri
Totuși poemul evidențiază tipul de oameni căutați de sovietici în timpul ocupației mai ales sub domnia lui Stalin
Translated(I am referring to the movement not its members
Tho the poem does underlines the type of people that the soviets wanted during the occupation especially under Stalins reign
Lots, including citadels
My favorite is the Alba Carolina Citatel
None
But i’d wish to
It's okay Romania, maybe we'll have something to say on the next post
I'm a student and not employed, but I'll be talking for mom
She works as the one deciding the exchange rates at this exchange and pawn chain (don't know the world for it in English) and managing places of the chain
She also serves the clients and is also the company's  accountant
Because she's employed the state gives her health insurance and that's basically it
Her workplace doesn't count extra hours but demands them, no such thing as brakes, you have every other weekend free if you're lucky and they don't respect legal holidays
She works 8am-6pm in winter and 8am-7pm in summer
It used to be 8-8 but they didn't get enough clients in that time frame to justify electrical bills
They write all their employees as minimum wage on papers to pay the least amount of taxes, so in all records they work minimum wage, affecting everything from credit score to retirement age and pension
Also, no restroom access and heating in the winter it's your problem
One example for why most people go to work abroad
Damn all these countries with so many great benefits :'(
Currently unemployed, but at my previous job:
- mandatory state health insurance
- 2 checkups / year at a private clinic
- work phone
- mandatory 21 days / year paid vacation days
Most jobs here only "offer" the mandatory stuff
I get the benefit of having a job
everything else is either corporate BS either necessairy items for my job, packed as a "benefit". So I went to my employer and told him I don't care about SPA Treatments and fitness classes
I want money to do whatever the heck I wanna do with them after a hard week
And he agreed
I get money to do whatever I want
I work in IT
The main benefits are: 3 extra vacation days a year over the legal requirement; can buy company stock at a large discount; free phone  with an unlimited plan; can work from home 5-10 days a month; better health insurance than what the state provides;
Had no idea Metro existed in other countries as well
UiPath by any chance
I know they offer unlimited time off
Of course
Because the State regulates this very well: paid sick leave, maternity leave, minimum days off, minimum salary, healthcare, social insurance, etc
It is not a "benefit" from a private company
It is not their way of saying "I care about you". They are forced to do it - and I am happy they are
Otherwise we would be in the same situation as US i.r. to healthcare
Bottom line is that we are not friends (company vs employees) nor enemies
It is a partnership where one is providing a service and the other one is paying for those services
Most companies try to cover the lack of humanity by providing some packages that they name "benefits", which are the equivalent of a "back pat" when you are in a coma
It's not ok
The real Benefits are: better management, better communication, better working hours, better work distribution, personnel trainings, time breaks, extra holiday leaves after a project is succesfully completed, real meetings where employees are heard (related to good management), etc
It's hard for them to offer the above but so much easier to replace them with fitness classes
I see
I think it's the work culture in the US that pushes long workweeks rather than the companies themselves
Exactly
The problem is that most US Companies don't understand that most Europeans are socialists and they care about the social well being of their individuals and strictly regulate these situations
So when they hire Europeans they present their social obligations as "benefits". I refuse to consider them so
They should be basic obligations for any company in the world, just like the human rights
Because not respecting the life quality of your employee and not caring is like stealing a person's dignity :(
In romanian, one of the shortest panvocalic words is oleiau which is the third person, plural, past continous form of the verb a oleia and it means to grease or to imbibe with oil
Romanian also has three extra vowels: ă(which represents the schwa sound), î and â which represent the same sound but î is written as the first or last letter, with some exceptions, and â is written inside the word
The shortest word which contains all the vowels present in the romanian language is autoînsămânţările which can be broken into auto + însămânțările,
auto means "by own means"
însămânțările is the plural articulated form of însămânțare which is the action of sowing coming from the verb a însămânța which means to sow coming from în + sămânța which translate to in + seed
So autoînsămânţările means the natural sowings of plants
I don’t recall is ever happening in Romania, but to be fair, i rarely leave my house at night when the drunk people are out and about
Did we colonized any country
TIL Cameroonese is a word that exist
I'd nominate the Unification of 1918
Some may say the Revolution of 1989 which sowed the seeds of discord and corruption that our modern state is founded on, or the small union of 1859
*But* unification has been (and continues to be) *the* defining theme of the arc of our history since at least the early 1800, if not since 1600
Sure, at the moment it may seem to be on the back burner because of more current affairs, like troubles with infrastructure, healthcare, the economy, justice and corruption, etc, as well as the sheer legal impracticality of a union
But those come and go, whereas "are those people over there the same as us
" is a much more fundamental question
"Basarabia e România" is by far the most common graffiti all over both countries (meaning Bessarabia, the historical name of today's Republic of Moldova, is Romania)
And well, 1918 is the culmination of that effort
Literally every town has a main street and square called Unirii or 1 Decembrie 1918
I would say the unification of Wallachia and Moldova into Romania in 1859
Ironically or not, the end of WW1 is probably Romania's defining moment as well, finally being united with millions of brethren Romanians
That meant a lot
However, Moldova and Wallachia uniting in 1859 and becoming Kingdom of Romania, and then King Carol I coming to throne, led later to the full independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878-1879 and the modernization of the country
So hard to choose
Yes definitely
Also the Battle of Mohács is quite significant too
I never really enjoyed most of the traditional food because it's really fatty and it made me sick very often
I absolutely hate *piftie* ([aspic in english ]
And pork skin/fat for Christmas
I hate that
Fish borsch
I like fish and borsch in general but not fish borsch
It smells so fishy, tastes so fishy, full of tomato juice and sometimes you get fish bones, fish skin or other nasty things
Would not recommend
(I'm recommending "papanași" tho)
I'm curious why the reaction
Personally it's my favorite dish from your country
I like gin with cucumbers in it
It's definitely not a common tates tho
Are you me
Because same
Yes
The cabbage rolls that have either too much rice or too much grease from the meat are so gross (but vegan ones are good)
Racitura has such a terrible smell that it turns my stomach upside down *de la o posta*. The gelatin, ew
Boeuf salad is basically mayo cake
Coliva is just extra sweet porridge but we treat it like some great dessert because we only get it every once in a while
The only thing I personally *really* like are Pleșcoi sausages
Other than that
miss me with that Romanian shit
I don't like pork either, so I like vegetarian sarmale a lot more (with soy, mushroons and other vegetables), also drob made with chicken and vegetables is 100 times better than the original one, at least for my taste
I've never understood the fuss about zacusca, I don't like it but everyone else seems to love it
Not risotto I hope
I'd rather eat instant noodles and cheap granulated soy made into meatballs
You probably didn't eat good risotto that's why
I don't know the paella recipe
But I do know the risotto one, and risotto cooked in water it isn't tasty, even if you put a lot of parmesan in it, you feel that something is missing
It shouldn't be mushy
Is should be creamy, silky and tasty
You can get separate grains from long grain rice such as Basmati or Jasmine
For risotto you'd have to use short grain rice, more starchy, such as Arborio or Carnaroli
Short grain rice is also used in rice pudding (i like the sweet one), which is delicious
(google says in Pakistan is called kheer)
Believing in astrology
I'm not even sure how it is so popular and works with Christianity, since we are such a religious country
We really like storing ALL of our shopping bags in a drawer and then forget about them
[THIS]
It's a saying, not an action or gesture, but here we go:
"My dick
I worked for the summer at Lidl and something weird I noticed about old grannies
they buy yogurt (like little ones and lots of them) and they put EVERY SINGLE YOGURT in a SEPARATE PLASTIC BAG
Why
It makes scanning that shit so difficult
Then ZF Tom is Finnish

If you're not watching Die Hard, you're doing Christmas wrong
Same here in Romania
It's a tradition already
Here too, we even have memes for it
Please don't forget the bag with bags
Yep, bread with every course here also
So it's not just a Romanian thing
Fuck me
I had no idea Sto Lat from Discworld is a real thing

I call this move "the trap". My dad used to do it with all my friends
Always seemed like a regular handshake
Always ended up with him kissing them

TIL that there are people from other countries that are pulled by the current
Open Air ASTRA Museum:
It's a huge 96 ha complex and though it's called The ASTRA Museum of Transylvanian Civilization, it encompasses images of rural life from across all historic regions of the country
There are some 400, 500 traditional houses and in the summer you can see people wearing traditional garments in some of the courtyards, doing pottery, wood sculptures or cooking traditional dishes (that you can buy)
A day isn't enough to visit the entire complex
Some local people come visiting on bikes or roller skates
I think the video, which is very complimenting, shows enough to get an idea of how cool that place is
I personally visit it every summer
Astra village museum in Sibiu Romania
It is an amazing outdoor museum that explores the the architecture of the Romanian villages across Romania
It is an amazing walk through a massive park and you can go inside houses and explore
It is spread across and it offers a beautiful experience of walking and feeling in a way the vibe of old România
There are actors here and there that tell you about the houses
It is the best museum experience I had in Romania
For Valencia, I will always recommend [The Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts]
It was only 3 Euro per person and absolutely worth it
Stunning work from many different time periods
When a new mall opened all the shops in the food court were empty while people were lining up at kfc :(.
If you want to eat Junk food you either eat at McDonald's or KFC
However Mickey D is more common due to it's kid friendly foods
According to Google there are a bunch of KFC s in Ro
And there are also some 3 "Kentucky fried chicken" s. And I know the one in Bucharest
It is not KFC
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen, but it never will actually happen cuz it's a tiny ass shop in between some apartment buildings in a country that no one cares about
I would say that we still have the outdated version here: women are the ones that cook in the house
It is rare to find a man that actually knows how to make more that French fries and an omlette
Though in recent years, I have started to see (at least in my circles/bubble) that men (and not single) have started to learn how to cook more and bringing food to work
I got lucky and snagged myself a man that actually knows how to cook
This sums up my experience too
We still have that mentality of "if you can cook (especially the traditional dishes) you're wife material / no man will marry you if you can't". No one taught me how to cook either, as a teenager I was expected to focus on school and was more of a nuisance in the kitchen anyway
I just figured it out when I first moved out haha
Sounds accurate, men under 30 do tend to cook a lot more, at least compared to our fathers and grandfathers
It's probably because we spend more time living on our own before marriage and you can only eat so much takeout and sandwiches
Yeah exactly
It's like when you're told "you're still a kid, you have no business here" and "you're almost a grownup, you should know this" at the same time
Yeah, i can second that
In their 20s especially
I talk and ask most my guy friends for their recipes and we chat about cooking a lot
Definitely a shift in mentality but it's probably slower in rural areas
There's also an interesting trend of more capable and less negletful fathers that i'm starting to see
Almost all my Romanian friends and family had some kind of abuse, neglect, or simply lacked a relationship with their father
Russia, you can expect the common borders to come back anytime
I think it's Poland and Austria
We don't border them but in my social bubble, we consider them neighbors
Every Country that was a Satellite State of the USSR is now our neighbour
poland i think
Ireland  I just love those guys
They would make the best neighbours ever
I can even imagine swearing eachother over the borders and then getting drunk and being bffs :))
I never felt that Poland like this, I think Greece is way more of a neighbor
Scares me I undrestood you both without studying neither Italian nor Spanish
So I live in what I would call a decent size city
Not too big, but not too small either
When you compare to Bucharest, you can see some similarities here and there
Like traffic, but it's still worse in Bucharest
Naturally being the capital Bucharest has more jobs and a more vibrant lifestyle I suppose due to all the restaurants and malls
I'd also say the other big cities we have, like Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara are nicer, like more manicured
Bucharest is random and gritty and surprising
I love it
Also, Romania is very centralised
Bucharest has over 2M people, but the next big cities have around 350k each
the second city is brum
Breslau (sorry, idk the Polish spelling)

The Szekely land, in the southeast corner of Transylvania
As a national minority they have guaranteed seats in parliament, and they regularly bring up a law about the autonomy of the Szekely land (currently it's 2 and a half counties, doesn't have any overall administrative status)
It gets voted down, but even if they'd make some kind of deal with the majority to pass it, it's still unconstitutional
Our constitution says in like the first 3 lines that our country is unitary and indivisible, meaning you cannot have something like a devolved administration without a consitutional amendment
It seems like Szekely autonomy is just a political threat used by their politicians
They get education and services in their own language and guaranteed representation
I've never heard any actual demands from them, though if someone wants to correct me please do
That corner of Transylvania, right by the middle
Secuimea
They keep whining, we keep denying, people keep acting like they’re legitimate
10-15 years ago stray dogs were a big issue, there were frequent reports of them attacking people
I remember as a kid there were quite a few packs on my way to school
We even had a few inside our school grounds, all fine and dandy until a student got bitten
But then the government took some measures and drastically reduced their numbers
If I think about it I can't remember the last time I saw a stray dog, or heard someone mention/complain about them like before
The only animals I see on the street are cats, but I can't always tell if they're strays or not
For example I have a few neighbors who let their cats roam free so I just assume it's theirs lol
I'm curious where you've been in Romania, I'm not familiar with the situation in other cities
Seeing all the westerners saying they never saw a feral dog makes me realise how much we still have to work to reach civilization xD
Stray dogs are EVERYWHERE where I live, there are in big towns too but not so many
I live in a small town and I kid you not I passed by a pack of 10 huge angry dogs on my way to school
At 7 am
Not a single person on the street
It's so annoying because there are no shelters where I live and no one has the initiative to build one and people keep throwing away their unwanted dogs on the street  it makes me so mad
There are 4 stray and 2 semi-stray (they technically have an owner but spend most of their time on the street) just on my street
Where I lived before there were like 3 cats that every other day jumped the fence, came to our back door and asked for food
(there were waay more on my street overall) Sometimes they even kept me company during my nights of astronomical observations :)
So yes, I would say Romania has quite a big problem with stray animals
Yes, stray dogs have actually been a very big issue in Romania, since there were packs of aggresive ones and many deaths resulted from them
Nowadays it's pretty rare to see them (atleast in my city)
Destroyer cats
Sounds so dangerous, they must be huge and evil
I live in Cluj-Napoca and haven't seen any
If you start one, dm me for donations
Hahah, I've been to Bucharest a couple times, I hope the situation has improved since
Come again once the pandemic is over :D
I'm also kinda scared of dogs for this reason
As a kid I've always been told "stay calm, they can sense fear" and stuff when passing by packs of strays
I guess some sort of "dogs can and will be aggressive if you're nervous around them" mentality just stuck with me
Also the fact that some guard dogs roam the front yard and bark through the fence at every passer-by doesn't help either lol, I always try to keep a good distance from people's yards if possible
I'm not super familiar with the situation but I'm pretty sure they are
They used to collect the stray dogs off the streets and take them to shelters, afaik many of them were neutered and re-released, but I guess many others were euthanized sooner or later
I'm sure they have better quality of life in German shelters than in Romanian ones, and better chance of finding a home too
People generally use both but blue is more common and some things like exams must be completed only in blue
Anyhow blue is basically the only colour for fountain pens, it's a distinct type of blue,  I always reffered that type of blue as "Ink blue" . Children are encouraged and oftentimes forced to use fountain pens, and only in elementary school do they start using ballpoint pens, so fountain pens are still common here, even though most prefer the cheaper and more convenient ballpoints
For ballpoint and rollerball pens black is somewhat common too, but most are still dark blue or light blue
So basically teachers are telling their students to fuck off
>red pen (reserved for the teachers)
Haha, same here, teachers use red pen only when correcting homeworks, tests etc
to highlight mistakes
Romanian here, most of the parties in my childhood did not involve a lot of kids so my parents would just bring in food and stay in a different room
Larger parties would usually have a group of parents close by chilling and having drinks, peeping food
But it always felt very Independent
do you get birthday parties with your friends
cringe
the true ones look at their parents friends getting drunk after receiving some money for their birthday
Well bread, salami, melted cheese
But I prefer to make in the sandwich-maker
At home, I like it pretty simple: cheese, ham, mayo, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers
For bread, I prefer butter croissants, but otherwise, some plain white bread is great
You might think me a monster, but sometimes I put chips in my sandwiches
Until you try it, you cannot judge me though :))
But when I go out, I do love some pulled pork sandwich, if available
Yum
Seems like our presidential election will actually be about choosing the best candidate instead of the lesser evil
The two prefferd candidates are both relatively clean and capable
I've never been in this situation since I had the right to vote
Liviu Dragnea is now in jail :D
Oh come on :D, you guys are doing great compared to us
Right
Right
I was actually looking for this post haha
Germany-Berlin
Never been in Switzerland, I'd choose Austria from the two
Switzerland is boring, is cool just for holidays
But you can speak German in any of those
Around 1 euro for 15 km but quality and speed are abysmal . The speed is lower now than in the 70s in more than half of the network  . Timisoara<->Bucharest one of the main routes in the country has trains going 9h and 30 min at best for 500 km .
Since the revolution (1989) less than 500 km have been repaired to the point the rail would allow construction speed (most of the rails here have been constructed for 120-140 km max speed but due to lack of maintenance there are a LOT of speed restrictions)
To give some examples, the overnight from Cluj to Bucharest is around €20, leaving at 10pm and arriving around 7-8am
If you want a sleeping car that makes it like €25
Timisoara would be around the same price, but the tracks are worse so it's slower
Bucharest to Constanta is around €10-15 iirc, but it only takes 2h for 200km because the tracks are well maintained
If you take commuter trains short distances can be dirt cheap (under €5), but those stop in every village
If you take IR (inter regional) trains, the price on short distances doesn't scale so well
Unlike most places, we do not have dynamic pricing
The price for a given route on a given train class is constant regardless of season, day of the week, time of day, demand etc
You only get discounts for buying much in advance (3 weeks or more), for being a student (at a Romanian uni, so my expat ass had to pay full price), retired, etc
It is kind of slow, and conditions are variable
In my experience IR trains are mostly fine, commuter trains have a high chance of being filthy
Also if travelling on popular routes at peak times (seaside or mountainside on a summer weekend) tickets may be hard to find
The speed issue is getting better slowly, as rebuilding of mainline sections of track has picked up again in recent years
But yeah be prepared to still have sections of 20km/h because of track issues
Just about everything is in Bucharest last I checked
Bucharest holds everything lol
"Ion" by Liviu Rebreanu
Had to struggle through hunderds of pages of what is in essence a story of a young paesant with highly questionable morals which just managed to get me disgusted, even some of my teachers said they didn't enjoy it
Ion by Liviu Rebreanu
A poor woman gets beaten  almost to death by her father and husband and hangs herself
Nice book
Hmmm we have a lot but i forgot em :(
_Ion_ is my second least favorite, for the same reasons as you
but the only book I never managed to finish is _Romania pitoreasca_. A travel blog before there were blogs, aka hundreds of pages of descriptions of rivers and forests, with nothing happening
I agree
The people in that book are so shitty
When I read how Ana was beaten I started crying and couldn't read anymore
Gospodin in Romanian means "houseman" like a person that takes care of a house
And today it's mostly used to refer to clean and organized people
It's funny how weird the false friends are between the eastern countries
*sweats in bourgeois*
Went to Germany, everyone was nice, warm, willing to joke and return a smile
Food in UK is not terrible, quite the opposite actually
Nordic women are very far from being one of the most beautiful women in the world, that title is easily held by eastern european women and south american women
Germany is not so exact and precise as you would think
Especially Berlin
Also the “strict” police is nowhere to be found in Berlin in the eastern block
German stereotypes seem to apply mostly to bavarian germans only
Greeks are not lazy bastards that refuse to work
Russia is not dangerous
Like as a tourist, during late hours, you could walk through badly famed neighbourhoods and you wouldn’t feel scared or in danger at all
Paris is not romantic, it is full of bums, beggars and drug dealers and the pastries are extremely mediocre
If not straight out horrible
So is the service in most places
If you go to France go to the other cities, where all the good stereotypes about France check out
Gorgeous country, horrible capital
I highly disliked pizza in Italy
This might be personal preference, but I enjoyed seafood the most there, not pasta (which was not bad) or lasagna (which was good, but still not as good as the seafood)
Not so much a Nederlands stereotype, but amsterdam, for “one of the safest cities in the world”, has a shit ton of thieves and shady characters
Most of Spain’s stereotypes are true, except for 2
One is about the country and one about the people
The one about the country is that Spain is viewed as this beachy paradise where you would chill by the sea with a glass of sangria
While you could definitely do this, there is a **LOT** more to Spain than that, from gorgeous museums and art galleries to superb mountain tops
It also rains a ton in some parts of the country
The one about people is that a lot of spaniards are cruel blood thirsters that enjoy seeing animals being killed for entertainment
This is far from the truth, very few spaniards actually go to bull fights or enjoy watching them and there are a lot of petitions and NGO’s that want to stop them
If you know any stereotypes that I missed, ask away if they were true for me or not, since I’ve been to all of Europe(multiple times) and a bunch outside of it
I had the same experience, maybe we did something wrong, dunno
This
It shocked me as well
**offensed Finns approaching**
But the northern you go in Sweden and Norway people start to get more cold and distant
Ayyyy
Austrian stereotype checks out
The fuck
Went to London in the summer of 2016, I was terrified
God, the rain
I just debunked a stereotype that was going around for a long time
Maybe someone could use it
Am I living under a rock because I did it and the stereotype is no longer trendy
Are you always such an uptight prick or is it only with strangers
You sound like an overblown arrogant asshole, just saying
Maybe you should debunk a bad stereotype about your country by not being like that
*I have no stance on this argument btw, just calling it what I see*
I live in Romania, work in IT, no family yet, and yes I have disposable income
I actually afford 3 vacations ( Greece every year, one in Ro, and a trip to Germany(my other home) and visiting that part of EU)
Got 2 investment accounts ( nothing big) and one saving account
Also have stock at my company and I constantly buy more from 5% of my netto
I don’t say this is generraly available but for me, yes it exists
Damn
That moment when you realize how lucky you are
We might be poor, but in my case, as a software developer in Bucharest, I earn the same salary as in Western Europe
A senior software developer can purchase a 50m² apartment in Bucharest in less than 3 years just by saving money while also paying rent and other expenses, without the need of a mortgage
Yes, sometimes
I guess is because I watch a lot of english youtube, movies and tv shows without subs, anime with english subs
I read a lot in english, like the comments from reddit
And the thing is that my english is not that good
Once I forgot the word for rabbit, at Easter, in both English and Romanian
So I was trying to describe a rabbit enclosure
"so that fluffy animal with, you know, ears
" I could only remember the German word
I also experience this
The more practice I get in German the worse I get at English and vice versa
Hungarian and Romanian don't seem to be affected by this weird push and pull
I blame them both being germanic languages
I just come from a very mixed family
It's not that uncommon
I heard my friend speaking Danish, sounds pretty cool
fyi finnish is the only nordic language that is part of the finno ugric language family
Sounds good
I had to Google this
So in 2020 it was ProTv which is more or less ok
It has a lot of crappy shows (imo), but all the good movies
On second place there was Kanal D. Which has a bunch of Turkish, Indian and Korean soap operas
Edit: I understood "nr 1" as meaning "the most viewed".
religion=government propaganda
For my old TV it was TVR 1
But a really shitty transmission of it
Now I think its either ProTV or a Digi one
I don't recall, I don't really watch TV
I interpreted "nr 1" to mean "the most viewed". Otherwise, yeah, you're right
I understood "nr 1" as "the most viewed" :P.
Ah, I thought it meant like when you press the 1 button
My bad
Mine is a really small nitpick that once I've found I can't get it out of my head
I'll just write how different words split into syllables in our language, and let you figure out what annoys me
Es - to - nia
Le - to - nia
Li - tua - nia
Ma - ce - do - nia
O - cea - nia
Ger - ma - nia
Tran - sil - va - nia
Ro - mâ - ni - a
Romanian doesn't have a word for "them". We do have the word "them" but it's gendered
Ei - them (the males)
Ele- them (the females)
It kinda sucks since we don't know how to address to nonbinary people
Most of the time we use Ei but it's still kinda awkward
I hate you for putting this into my head
Now I won't stop spliting every country with -nia until I find another one
Hahah this never crossed my mind
I would have split them all like "ni-a". Could it be because for all of those the accent is on the second-to-last syllable, while for Romania it's on "ni"?
TANZANIA
Well played
Ya gotta let them balls breath, my friend
If Romania merged with its neighbors:
Hungary: Hungarian nationalists spawned in Debrecen, Budapest, and Szeged, they demand the liberation of Hungary(and the whole Transylvanian region /s)
Bulgaria: Ok at first but then they'll get pissed because it is the same as it used to be but now the official language is Romanian
Moldova: Some Slavs and some regionalists are pissed, but the general populace likes their higher wage and the unionists are happy(myself included)
Ukraine: Instant revolt
They don't mind being part of the EU but want their country back
Serbia: ?? Dunno, probably a mix between Bulgaria and Ukraine
Romania would be whole again
So it’s a happy marriage
Do you know for how long Romania tried to merge with Moldova
It was about time honestly
>back to the Habsburg Empire
Oh, God

None of the people I know who went there got any money, but he was absolutely convinced he knew better
Some people ...
I swear that in 2010 I saw in one of the primary school books that Yugoslavia was bordering Romania, so for 5 years I actually thought we border Yugoslavia
You can't imagine my reaction when I found out that country doesn't exist anymore
When I was a kid I thaugh that:
* Finland was germanic
* England, Soctland and Wales were independent countries
* Vietnam was part of Portugal
* Spanish and Italian are the same language
* Poland and Switzerland are nordic/scandinavian countries
* Czechs are germanic
* Hungarians are slavic
* Bosnia is fictional
* Greece is next to France
* Belarus is a French region
* Lithuania is fictional
* Russia is part of Western Europe
* And for some odd reason, that Armenia was full of creepy supernatural stuff
When I was very young, I would see the shape of Romania in the Weather, and looking at the shape of Europe, I concluded that it's the Iberian Peninsula
Wait they don't?
The thing is
I was the only one to have the error in that book, I had an older version because there were not enough books
So everyone knew about Serbia but me
and nobody even tried to correct me
Gotta love education in Romania
But I wish I was allowed to draw borders too, pretend I was at Yalta conference
There was a show where some people mentioned places where they've been and at one point they mentioned "Vietnam, Portugal" and so I taught that Vietnam was a Portuguese region since it was the first time I heard about it
Then when I saw that they are nowhere near each other, I started thinking that It might have been a colonoy or protectorate or something
Because I first heard about it from a cartoon where one of the characters is from there
Since I never heard about it before and I only heard about it from a cartoon, I decided that it has to be fictional
I explained the Vietnam thing [here]
As for Belarus, I thaught that it's a French region because the name sounded French to me
But it wasn't named Yugoslavia back then, it was named Serbia-Montenegro
The Kids from Room 402
Look at my spoon collection
I was the other way around, I heard stuff in cartoons and thought it was real
Well you also have great smaller cities like Lille, I visited with my parents 3 years ago it was great
Yeah, that one !
Yeah and it was in another room because kids are annoying
Source: I was an annoying kid
Iny community the rule is that if there are 4+ children they get a separate table
If it's very small children and there's many of them we sit them together so they can socialize
Only I was an antisocial kid so I just sat at the adult table and discussed politics and such
I was a very weird kid
Yeap, kids usually get smaller chairs next to their parents, or if they are very young (like 2 or 3) they might even just sit in their parents' lap when they need to eat, the rest of the time they are all running around anyway

We have a Constitutional Court which has 9 judges and they are appointed (by the President, Parliament, etc)
We also have a High Court which probably has over 100 judges and they get their by passing exams, interviews and gaining experience

13 treisprezece - treişpe
You get the point I don't feel like writing all the others
>For numbers 20+ we use: tens digit (feminine wherever the case) + "zeci şi" + units digit (some tens are shortened for easier pronounciation: şasezeci -> şaizeci)
22 - douăzeci şi doi / douăzeci şi două
45 - patruzeci şi cinci

In romanian we say patruzeci (4x10) și nouă (and 9) (49)
But between 10 and 20 it's a little bit weird
11-unsprezece, un - one, spre - to, zece - ten
So one to ten it's eleven

He made a mistake, he meant "patruzeci". Funnily enough, 60 is not șasezeci, but șaizeci, like the same shorter version as in șaisprezece (16)
Yes , you are right , good observation , I edited the comment now , I was still thinking about sprezece
Yes , you are right , sorry guys ...
I edited the comment now , thanks for telling me about the mistake
Mostly nothing, they remain under the ownership of the military
But last year and this year, 2 unused forts started renting the place for airsoft events
It's a bit of a sad story
In the late 19th century a series of forts were built around Bucharest to defend it from a potential invasion
Most of my countrymen don't know about these places, heck I didn't even know about them until this year and I live in the county they're located in
The reason why most people don't know about them is that a lot of them were bought by companies to be used as storage spaces and the ones that weren't bought have been abandoned and are extremely dirty
If I had the money I'd love to purchase at least one of the forts and renovate them, then turn them into tourist attractions
They really deserve more than this, a lot of interesting history, but a shame it has all been forgotten

Didn't know they're Croatian
who tf is Edward Maya
Florin Salam is pretty big outside our country too
i only heard of behemoth
Might be, not sure
I still treat them as Romanians
Moldova should unite with us
Holy shit how come I've never heard of this guy until today
what did you think it was
same language tho
Vaya Con dios is way too low in this thread
> Bucovina
Sorry, never heard of them until now
Idk where he is now, but he was our most famous singer/DJ once(300m+views on YT)
They debuted 8-9 years ago dude
n-am auzit in viata mea de el :))
They look like Romanians and talk like Romanians
Most of them have Romanian citizenship
Except for random borders, they are romanians
It's the same with part of Bucovina which is currently in the Ukraine and other Romanians living around the southern and western borders
yeah
he's pretty cool tbh
oh lol
Nu-i chiar asa mare branza, sincer a fost "One hit wonder(defapt 2 melodii)"
If you speak the language and are an ethnic Romanian it's as simple as taking a trip to Bucharest and signing some papers
Most of the ethnic Romanians from outside the EU do that because being an EU citizen has a lot of perks
Stand corrected
The ratio of Romanian citizens is still amazingly high since all of them have romanian first degree relatives
It's not like you have to live x years in Romania
Is that a real thing
No one says that here
It's super rare lol
I sometimes do that and most of the time they answer back but idk

Greetings from Romania
Hungarian Folk Tales was also aired here
It was nice that I also recognize some of them from the stories that my grandma told, funny thing is that she is neither Hungarian or Romanian
I guess stories could travel everywhere
I guess it's the Orthodox tradition
I think it's the case for us too
How many other lies have I been told by pop culture
This applies here as well
Wh– Next you’ll tell me that Italians don’t have moustaches
I expect them to act as a team and put some effort and resources into gathering and watching the games together on the tv
Do some bonding, get to know themselves better and maybe if they are lucky, go to the stadium and watch Austria or Ukraine play
We'll 100% win this Euro and the World Cup , if you say anything else other than this you are clearly deluded , Germany only won against us out of pure luck , what do you mean they had a lot of shots on our goal ? Our goalie was the best man on the pitch .
Came here for the TV joke :)))
I love how French and Italian sound
Italian (I already speak it) and Spanish (I want to learn it sometime in the future)
French can sound nice too, but I can't understand a word they're saying
Might be a little weeb bias but in all seriousness, I like how Japanese sounds
Compared to other East Asian languages, when I listen to something in Japanese, I can distinguish the majority of the words, I can't understand anything, but just the fact that I can distinguish when a word ends and another begins makes me feel good
Since starting college I also began to like listening to French
I did not like French one bit because of school, but now I enjoy it
Call me a weeb but Japanese sounds the best in my opinion
For me it's Russian
Ottomans
I don't think romanian will disappear, and even if it did I'd be too fucking dead to care at that point
I think what happened with Irish and Welsh, as well as what happened with some national languages in the USSR like Belorussian and Kazakh, shows that it is very difficult to kill a language
And it really only happens if an outside force, like an empire, try to "integrate" a territory by erasing national identity, such as by forced mass migrations (which afaik happened in both the cases i mentioned)
This reminds me
I grew up in Chisinau, Moldova, where the official (and majority) language is Romanian but there are lots of Russian speakers who moved there during the USSR
As a speaker of Romanian if you walked into a shop run by a Russophone or for example asked one for directions on the street, half the time you would get an annoyed/disgusted look and a reply (in Russian) like "can you speak a normal language
". Granted this was 15 years ago, but 15 years after the USSR collapsed they still had the impression they were speaking the lingua franca
Annoying as all shit
In Romania we had [Haiduci]
In romanian also, haiduc
Although they are romanticised as bandits like Robin Hood that steal from the wealthy and give to the poor
Sometimes they even help armies in fighting the Ottomans
One of the most famous tho was Baba Novac, serb haiduc that helped Mihai Viteazul in battles against the Ottoman Empire
There are many songs and balads regarding him and his sons
Except for today, i'd choose either 1850s soon to be Romania or 1910s Romania
Exciting historical times which i'd like to witness myself

In Romania, gypsies call themselves gypsies, without a racist implication
In more official stuff, they are called Roma
i always said eastern europe (romania) but apparently there are debates on whether romania is actually a balkan country
maybe both
transylvania has central european influences too
I'd say Eastern Europe, even though geographically we're, at the same time, central, eastern, and balkan
Eastern Europe if we were to go by the whole Iron Curtain thing and maybe religion
Central Europe if we were to go by our language and political views in the past 30 years
Part of the country is in the Balkans, so Balkanic could also be a definition
I'm here to say only this: what the hell is that username
Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, the Balkans
we really don't agree much on what region of Europe we are part of
Yes, but it is rude ask of your guest to take them off
Yes always
Yes
Yes
I only tell the visitors to keep their shoes unless I plan to clean the home in the same day or tomorrow
In Romania it is considered rude to ask your guest to take them off  if they feel like doing it (because it is more comfortable) then they can do it
And we usually offer some house slippers
It is really funny because all my non-romanian friends find it weird that we go from 5 to 5 min like: "please take the slippers
Please do it
I can't stand looking at you like that
So, if you're ever visiting a Romanian and it asks you to leave them on, it's ok to do it
On the other hand, if you're visiting a Turkish person, take them off
From my knowledge they consider it rude not to take them off
I'm pretty sure you never said that to anyone
You know why
Because 99% will never let it come to that point, their first instict being to take off their shoes

Mamaliga, don't get me wrong, but mamaliga is very often eaten in poor villages (Yes we eat it in cities too, but not that often that the villagers do) and it's a very popular food for tourists to try, because it's considered our staple food
I have a suggestion for you tourists, try our soups/ciorba and sarmale, oh and the pastries too
Yes, mamaliga is good but it's very overrated by tourists
Putuleți
I guess mămăligă is something thats considered poor people food, but it's a traditional dish here
Fish and chips maybe
No we eat it as often as the villagers do
Now I wanna visit Budapest again (even though I dislike McD)
I love how they made the vodafone logo out of wood in the first photo

Such a fantastic song
Not like every-day but usually near Easter, we do cook up a rabbit
But this is mainly in small villages
Yes, people do, it's not a big deal
Me personally, not really
They are too cure for me to see them as food
I also tried the meat and didn't really like the taste
So you learned romanian
wait,Turkish is a European language
Romania and Moldova
Romania and Moldova obviously
Romania, Moldova, simple
Romania and Bulgaria
Mostly, because they're usually from Latin and our language also has Latin roots
Examples:
Au- aur
Cu- cupru
Fe- fier
Examples of those that not match:
Na- Sodiu (also called natriu sometimes)
N- azot
Hg- mercur
But the W comes from wolfram
Rarely called tungsten here
In romanian almost all does make sense .Looking over the table only exceptions (where the symbol letter has nothing in common with the romanian word) i found are:
Nitrogen(N) is Azot from French Azote meaning the same thing
We have nitrogen as a word , idk if official but most of the people will understand you if you say it , but it's like saying "plethora" instead of "lot" in english .
Sodium(Na) is Sodiu
Potassium(K) is Potasiu
Mercury(H) is Mercur
From  around 80th element we use the english/international form ,probably due to the fact when those were discovered when globalization was already a thing .
For us Fe(romanian Fier), Au(romanian Aur) ,Ag (romanian Argint) ,W(romanian Wolfram ,but this word exist in english as well) or Pb(romanian Plumb)does make sense
Almost all of them make sense, we have a couple exceptions:
- Na - Sodiu
- K - Potasiu
- Hg - Mercur
- N - Azot
- P - Fosfor
And a couple that are close but not quite:
- Dy - Disprosiu
- Th - Toriu
- Cm - Curiu
I wonder if any other languages gets it as close as we do
Yes, most of them do, with the exception of a handful of them which we learned that the names comes from Latin and that why they are different
In reality most of them comes from Latin but they are similarly enough that you would not notice
Some make more sense than English
Gold, Au, is aur
Silver, Ag, is argint
Then again nitrogen, N, is azot
I hesitate to say 100%
But very nearly
The benefits of being a romance language, very close to latin, and 99
5% phonetic
I should probably add that "nitro" in Romanian also refers to nitrogen, especially in chemistry, for example nitroglicerină / nitroglycerin
For us Au is aur and Cu is cupru
we call it Stibiu .
We’re boring as hell for the most part:
- Hydrogen - Hidrogen
- Oxygen - Oxigen
- Carbon - Carbon
- Gold - Aur
- Silver - Argint
- Nitrogen - Azot
- Sodium - Sodiu (Natriu)
Fun fact Romanian considers both Nitrogen and Azot valid names so you really can use the english names for compounds freely
Yeah, you're correct
whenever i find french written on the internet is just basically romanian (actually i'm very aware romanian is actually french)  written in very strange form . Chomage (Fr) is somaj (Ro) , both pronounced the same . There are huge number of words like this
> quicksilver
agh sounds so much cooler
Why'd they change it
If you know how to consider the words (i.e just read them normally ) there is a huge level of mutual understanding
same in romanian (talking about sh) but my english keyboard doesnt have that key and i was too lazy to copy paste it from around the internet . We got a lot of words from french , pronounced exactly the same (more or less , i cant think of an example now but for sure we dont copy your nasalisation-or however it's called- rule) just that we take the spoken form , not the written one
For instance for chomage we use somaj not comagé(how would we read chomage using romanian rules) .
The only minority language that is actively spoken here is Hungarian
Lots of people speak it - while full-blooded Hungarians only make up around 6-7% of Romania’s population, a hell of a lot more people have some Hungarian heritage (myself included), either a parent or a grandparent or something like that (fun fact: the Romanian President is an ethnic German, the previous Prime Minister is half-Hungarian, the current Deputy Prime Minister also has Hungarian heritage)
I assume roughly 10% of the country can speak at least basic Hungarian
Edit: Completely forgot about Turkish
There are small communities of Tatars in Dobrudja that speak Turkish
"Cum nu vi tu Țepeș Doamne
" (How come thou don't come lord Impaler) from "the III-th Letter" by Mihai Eminescu
Often misquated as "Unde ești tu Țepeși Doamne ?!" (Were art thou lord Implaer ?)
It is a quate used when talking about the corruption in the country
Basically calling upon Vlad the Impaler to punish the corrupt politicians
One use for comedy: “Coboară jos Luceafăr blând” (“Get down down you gentle Morningstar”)
It’s used for comedy since “Coboara jos” it’s a pleonasm
Here it’s used to show the impressive feat the girl ask the Morningstar to do, to leave his place in the sky and come to Earth to be with her
Well, it works for Trump
The quote it’s from a book inspired my real events, the second ruling of Alexandru Lapusneanu, he was forced to abduct from the position of king
After a few years, with the help of ottomans and money he came back as a king once again (hence the quote) and killed most of those that betrayed him in the first place
It’s a very cruel story
The only countries we can currently beat are Lithuania, Malta and Faroe
Searched it up and we got beaten one time 9-0 by Hungary
What
You guys have Euro 2020
The whole “traditional life”concept
I don’t want to offend anyone but I simply feels like a stranger at every party, wedding or grills because I just can’t understand all the village life like things most of Romanians do
People being too "playful" or being too "caterincă". I just hate that Romanians cannot be fucking serious
Men with beer bellies so big they look pregnant
Very few people give a damn what they look like after a certain age
And they completely stop taking care of themselves
There are many things I can't stand
For instance holding the flowers when walking on the stree upside down (like when you want to give someone flowers later, you hold them upside down
Idk why, but you musn't hold them in their natural way
And NEVER EVER give them to a living person in an even number)
When I applied for a job in Germany they told me to fax them some documents

"Poșta română" (Romanian post) has the service of sending faxes
Yeah, those people that thinks they don’t enjoy manele but they do
For me it’s always just good music, nothing else, no manele, no traditional, no shit pop
Unfortunately my mother love those
Thanks, stranger :D
Hungary and hungarians have big problems with suicide, the biggest suicide rates in Romania are in Harghita and Covasna
I do not know why
Same here
I enjoy very old traditional music, search Fabris on youtube
What is on Etno TV or Favorit TV is not traditional music, is some new wave pop folk music
Same in romania always “boss”doesn’t matter if he’s 10 years older then you,you call them boss no matter what
Nobody knows (eh) .... but probably because it's because it's in wallachia and it wouldn't get taken if any other part that the hungry neighbours want would get taken
We have a few, mainly:
"Mă doare-n cur" - it hurts inside my ass, rarely used literatively, so everyone understands this is most likely you not caring
"Mă doare-n pulă" - my dick hurts
"Mă doare-n cot" - my elbow hurts, again, we tend to say it like these kind of aches are bearable, but I think it's kind of the opposite
"Mi se rupe" - it gets ripped apart, implying that would be the dick
"Ma doare in pula", it means "it hurts in my dick" and both sexes can use it
"ma doare in cot" - my elbow hurts
"ma doare in paișpe/pedală" - my "14"/pedal hurts
ma doare in pula - my dick hurts
they all mean "nu imi pasa" - i dont care
I would also add "D-aia nu mai pot eu" meaning "That's why I no longer can"
And "mi se fâlfâie", which means "it is waving", "it" usually being a woman's genitalia (labias, mostly) and "waving" like how you'd wave a handkerchief

They are both old and mostly filled with old and traditional things
My French teacher taught us that it's cooler to make that little inversion when asking a question, but then I noticed not many French do it like that
It depends on the name too (how it sounds basically), but pretty often it would end with an "i" for both female and male names
Gabriela -> Gabi
Alexandra/Alina -> Ali
Flavia -> Flavi
Cecilia -> Ceci
Bogdan -> Bogdi
Andrei -> Andi
Adrian/Adriana -> Adi
Cristian -> Cristi
Daniela -> Dani
Vasile -> Vasi
But since most Romanian names are short (e.g. Maria, Ioana, Ion/Ioan, Paul), you usually get an actual nickname than a shortening of your given name
We also like to change a name and almost make it like a nickname:
Ion/Ioan/Ioana -> Ionel, Ionuţ, Nelu, Ionică (male); Ionela, Oana, Onuța (female)
Almost all female names end in a
Romanian here
For male it's -uțu/-uț (ootzoo/ootz)
Example: Ion- Ionuț, Alex- Alexuțu
For female it's -uța (ootza)
Example: Ilinca- Ilincuța.
If you want to go farther, you can add an *ițu* on the end
Isn't that a diminutive
Quite nice
Yep, there's a whole range of suffixes that you can add to the name (or to its shortened version): -ițu, -elu, -ică, -uța, -uca etc

>Facebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe
Legal documents filed with the Irish High Court set out the simple reality that Facebook, and many other businesses, organizations, and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services
This is an issue over the legislative void created by the recently dismantled Privacy Shield agreement between US and EU which permitted user data transfers
Now US companies operating in EU have to find new ways to transfer data while demonstrating they can provide the same level of data privacy EU demands from companies domiciled in their jurisdiction
Should happen the same to Reddit for all I care
They're all just US propaganda machines anyway
That is a good thing actually
That would limit my aunt's intake of conspiracy theories

Boris isn’t far off from Trump, he didn’t take the virus seriously either at the start, and #brexit isn’t any more mature than what we’re seeing in the US
I see both countries as needing adult supervision right now
0:20 " and above everything else, all the leaders " ? I'm having trouble understanding this and I couldn't understand in French either even though I speak it
He wants to say that they caricature every religion ans every leader of religion or country ?
All forms of religion should be abolished, and religious extremists, killed
All borders disbanded and people let free to roam and establish wherever they want
We should think of ourselves more like we\`re the same civilisation, not "nations" or "countries". Separation only brings injustice, lack of human rights, corruption, terror and all sorts of fun shit that led us where we are now
Banning all religions and maiming their prophets should be step #0 in solving our issues
I wonder
can't they find a way for offended Muslims to sue the ones who make the caricatures ? The prospect of getting money may at least divert the hate and extremism
Yeah and getting called racists or xenophobe for stating facts
Some people understand things harder than they should
I agree and self reflection is very important too
But at the same time some people are too sensitive and throw words here and there for no reason
Well some religions evolved, like Christianity
Nobody today calls for Crusades or Inquisition
Why can't Islam evolve too and not be about violence ever again
Yes and I'm probably wrong to generalize
My bad
But, how do we change the groups of Muslim extremists who are ok with beheading others or any form of violence
Last time I checked the news channels were full these days with people from Islamic countries burning the flag of France and photos of Macron
They didn't seem too bothered with the fact that someone beheaded an innocent man
No, their sentiments were more important
And even more terrorists attacks came in the name of Islam
So I'd assume that quite an important part of the Islamic world is still backwards
Otherwise we'd see more Muslims condemning such acts in public
It's what they value that's not compatible with European values
So how do we change the values of millions if not hundreds of millions of Muslims who aren't progressive
Or at least the ones that set foot in Europe
Because if we Europeans don't do anything we may wake one day with Muslim fundamentalists ruling over us
Or with Christian/Non-Religious groups of Europeans that become anti-Muslims and extremists
Sort of how many people turned into Nazists/Communists after WWI because of the problems they were facing and because they let themselves ruled over by their instincts of survival
And how do you show them that
Also obviously killing is not an option
I wish such things would be done, but so far it looks like most European governments are inept in this
Type C super charge
I hope
I don't know how I lived without supercharge until now tbh
Is this about the charging port or the brick
like that was the bigest problem in the world in this moment
Super charge is just another name for very fast charging
I have a Huawei but I heard supercharge for Samsung as well, it's about the adaptor, not the cable and the compatibility of the phone, obviously
No, it just charges large batteries faster
Well the idea is to have only 1 type that is compatible with any phone, at least that's why I would assume
This is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the creator of the VLC media player, he refused tens of millions of euros in order to keep VLC ads-free
Merci, Jean
About 6 years ago, I was working in a computer repair shop and had many customers complaining about malware
Much of that malware was from using proprietary ad supported video players or "add ons" to codec packs
I would remove all those crappy players and codecs and just install VLC, literally no complaints
VLC is proof that open source software can be much better than shitty proprietary paid or ad-supported software

What would the artist do about 20-30-50km long cities
Not everyone works in an office where riding the bike is an option
Some/ a lot of people have stuff to carry around
when you're walking down a street, how many cars pass you
Say 20-30 cars
In each car there is at least one person
My point is that they do take up more space, but also enable faster movement, so they stay in the public space for less time
> they don't suddenly switch to free roaming public spaces once no cars are on them
They do sometimes, when people want that: for public gatherings, festivals, markets ... etc
- I know places that close for cars almost every weekend
When there are enough of those events in a place (usually the city center) that place tends to close the roads permanently
Reykjavík is a spread city though, you wouldn't want to walk in freezing weather for hours every day
Or wait for the bus 30 minutes each way
Pedestrian only spaces are great for city, town, neighborhood centers
You can also combine the 2: large safe areas with cars never being to far away
Hopefully Bucharest will follow suit in the near future

Felicitări
Fuck you Putin
Long overdue for Moldova to leave its past behind
I really dislike this occidental identity politics title
Should've at least put her name in the title
Her name is Maia Sandu
The most important/relevant thing is that she's pro-EU, not her freakin gender
Not a lot of people care around here what her gender is
Where I'm from we don't really care about the identity of the people in positions of power
In Romania we had a female prime minister, a female mayor of our capital city, a female former chief prosecutor of National Anticorruption Directorate, multiple female ministers, a romanian -germanic ethnic as our president
We have bigger problems to deal with
What's really funny is that Moldova can't be considered a progressive country but guess what
When you have real big problems in your country, you don't have the luxury to pick and choose based on your prejudices, you need to choose the most competent person for the job and most people recognize that

Bravo din România de la Iași, sunt mândru de voi și vă așteptăm acasă în România Mare
Was not Transnistria given the Middle finger by Russia several times in the past
they would truly be morons if they still love Russia
and dodon  sucks the dick of Russia and  denies the genocides and deportations  the russians did in Basarabia and north Bukovina
Any source on that
Also, when I learned about Anotnescu in school there were very few negative things we talked about
History books were written by very patriotic nationalists
I had to learn from other sources as an adult how stuff actually went down
Ignorant French
Nothing new
Moldova Republic is such a widely known bastion of progressivism that even US East Coast socialites take their cues from them
It is known

Să sperăm că nu vom mai fi politic separați pentru mult timp
Federație (cu statele Moldova, Țara Românească/Valahia și Transilvania) sau cum am fost în perioada interbelică, uniți să fim și să avem un stat cât mai puternic
Well this one's going in the history books
I'm gonna tell my children this is the abortion flag
Oh, wait, what children
Right
^(just joking, I stand with this cause)
Oh yea, what a peaceful protest
Definitely won't clog the traffic and give some people breathing problems
I agree, it shouldn't exist
That's why we should make birth control and sex ed more easily available
Glad we're on the same page
Look
I work in a care home where the majority of the staff got sick
The majority had nothing, no symptoms
One person got the virus 3 times, one time after the vaccine
Me I was sick, together with 2 other colleagues, one of them went to hospital
Eldery who got the virus
Yes
None of them died
Some had no symptoms
I know this is only one care home out of I dont know how many
But when you see this, can you blame the people being less afraid and not taking the virus so serious
Because people are unimaginably imbecile
Always true
Hitler complaining about the Jews ruling US and the world is also a recurrent idea, just replace the Jews with the current flavor of mistrust target, E.g. Bill Gates
Please god, not another war
We don’t need another migrant/refugee crisis
Waiting for Steiner

It's not very well known but what Hitler was actually doing here was surveying the damage done to the mods house
My little brother asked me if that’s Slenderman in the left corner and now I can’t unsee it
I didn't know Mr Bolton had a reddit account
Still screaming into your pillow that the war with Iran hasn't happened yet
It is a sad day to all people of Europe
I can only hope that one day it will be rebuilt but the history lost in this fire is irreplaceable
My mom's crying right now, and I can't fault her for it in the slightest
Absolute tragedy
Why
I fell for one of the classic blunders
You fuckin
You motherfucker .... I can't believe I've fallen for this
Fucking asshole lol
I... just
can't... believe I just bit the bullet so hard
Romania too
It works in Romania
So I give up
That post is wrong it works fine
God dammit
Now thats how you protest fascism
Always happy to see young people in politics especially in rulling positions, hope it will happen to other countries  around the world
Also out of curiosity could anyone tell me her origins ( her name sounds romanian) i saw she is the child of same sex couple but nothig else
those kids are no match to his skill

I had a good laugh
Thank you for posting this

As a visualization [here's] what the Armenians were promised following WWI and the Turkish War of Independence
Called Wilsonian Armenia since Woodrow Wilson was mostly responsible for its proposal
My mother's part of the family ended up as refugees in Romania as a result of the Armenian genocide
And that's how my dad met my mother
Next is me on the 6th, tomorrow
He's the oldest member of the EC
He just turned 69
High five old man
Turning 30 in December :/
Dunno what to say
You can do pretty much everything you do at 20, unless your life gets severely limited by having kids
Isn’t the UK the one who wants to close up its borders and leave the EU but still enjoy the trade benefits associated with member states
It's funny that they think there's still going to be a French state in 2050

Not just that, but some people have since died and other have gained the voting age
Why should a stale vote be better than a fresh one

Wow
The one picture where Macron looks badass
Now that's some nice fanart
i wonder what the texts say
He looks like he drank from a suspicious red fountain in a forrest surrounded by satyrs and demons
You even nailed the red-green color scheme that repels colorblind people
Sometimes I don't even bother clicking if I see it, but on better days I focus and figure it out
As a romanian all i can say is that we take those
Romania and Bulgaria have to be at least in the worrying category
We are the wrestling for the bottom 2 positions of every EU chart (only with EU countries) and if there is a chart about continental Europe, we're at most average
Romania prolly average tbh
Ok results is still ok
We did it guys
This map says we're doing ok, so it must be true
Same about Romania honestly, we're usually at the end of the list
We are at the top of the list sometimes
E.g. for domestic violence statistics
I don't care if it's OK/average/worrying, Romania and Bulgaria should have the same color
Romania #1^*
*terms and conditions may apply
Yeah I agree
And high speed fixed internet
I'd trade the high internet speed for less stupid people
Hearing about 10mbps or lower internet speed from wetsern countries always makes me chuckle
The minimum internet contract you get here is 50mbps, and if you live in a good area you can upgrade to 1gb/s.
Yeah, 1gb/s download and 200 to 500 upload, though that depends on the package or internet provider that you use
Of course, it's not available everywhere, but even a small city like mine with a little over 10k habitants can get 100mbps speed minimum and it's dirt cheap
Yep, we had that since around 2013
Cost ~ 8 €/month
Same can be said about repeating a referendum over and over until the desired result is obtained
I'm anti-Brexit, but that quote is retarded
The entire point of a democracy is to do what the people want it to do
The referendum was meant to happen once and only once
It's completely the people's fault for voting pro-Brexit
Can some one explain to me what is the role of the monarch of U.K
So U.K is leaving E.U and then Northern Ireland and scotland leave U.K, in this era of power shifting across the globe U.K is making a grave mistake
That's what Germans also said
Same
Winter when I was younger was dope af with lots of snow

Guys its obviously a street sized fountain with real cars as decoration
We are like the anti-Netherlands
Ooof
This looks like România , im romanian btw
Oh wow
It rains in brazil as well
every time there's some serious rain the drainage system gets overwhelmed
Don't worry though, according to our ex mayor there are no problems
We even have a stereotypical name for an incompetent/lazy builder which is Dorel
As a Romania, definitely agreed
Ah, a classic
Because we only have about 10-15 years to solve the issues that we have on this planet
big country problems
Bru, did they put Ceausescu as a Moldovian
So many ethnic stereotypes

Holy crap, this is awesome
Yet they are still different countries
Germany and Austria both have different ones, as well as all of the former countries of Yugoslavia
not really, theres barely any russians
They look like siblings lol
Edit: I didn't mean that they are not good for each other (and I'm also part of the community), I just said that some of them kinda look alike
2020 so far
Insert 'this is fine' meme
my mom asked me if this is real, since 5 hours ago it was daylight outside
They should build a villa on top of it
Is there more to dig up
Would love to see more of it
Polish culture at its best
When will these people get civilised
This cannot be real
This doesn't happen in the Nordic countries (edit: i meant it's more to the north than my country that's all), does it
Maybe I had a idealized image in my head but this is completely mind-bendingly shocking
I really have to get more research done in europe
Poor people though, to have your apartment set on fire like that
Oh fair point, it's a more to the north than mine that's all, a slip of the tongue
Thanks for pointing out my mistake
Winter is the new spring
aaah, that's hot
Yep, i went to the mountain side in Romania and i only wore a t-shirt outside lmao

Very nice picture, kudos - but the event is called a lunar eclipse, or a Moon eclipse
That's how astronomers talk about it
"Blood", "wolf", "super" and other terms from vampire fantasy books for teenagers are just how bloggers and uncritical media like to talk about it
It's a fad - this too shall pass, although it may take years
But it's an eclipse
A Moon eclipse

Reminder that being a victim of an authoritarian state does not necessarily also mean you're a good person or that you yourself don't also have authoritarian tendencies
Being an adversary of the current Kremlin establishment doesn't mean he isn't a far right winger with some beliefs and ideas that westerners would HATE if he was a politician in any other country
Like if this guy was Polish or Hungarian, with some of the things he said
Oh man
Would be public enemy number one on reddit
But no because he's an opposition figure in Russia he's a good guy now
The gushing praise I'm reading here for him just because he's an opponent of Putin is ridiculous
Stop thinking in binaries
There is no (meaningful) liberal democratic opposition in Russia
Since when has Russia cared about what Europe thinks
And with a United States that’s so divided, they can probably do whatever they want (in Russia) without any major international repercussion
change the word Crimea with Kososvo and see how you like it

How can you even call yourself a nationalist and support the people that destroyed your country and massacred it's people, this is just thinly veiled neo nazism
They know that people won't rally under the bloody swastikas so they cover them up with nationalist symbols
Yeah, and the people who scrawl swastikas onto Jewish headstones and what not are actually really pious Buddhists trying to spread the faith
motherfucker's doing what now
Nice, ridiculing democracy is so funny hahah memes amirite
That attitude towards democracy is going to send you either a hundred years back, or to some dystopia that everybody thinks "surely that wouldn't happen *here*, right
See UK ? This is how it's done
Welcome back France
Hope to see you more at the helm of Europe now
Awesome
The EU needs more high-speed rail
* high-speed rail can replace in many cases planes; aviation uses 10 times more energy than high-speed rail, so it's going to be a huge reduction in energy usage
* high-speed rail reduces the need for regular speed passenger rail, freeing the existing rails for freight
* rail uses domestically-produced electricity, whereas planes and trucks use imported oil
I live in Romania, here almost all the train locomotives are exclusively and entirely diesel based
I think I saw only a single power based locomotive my whole life in this country
The only power thing I see are 80s and 90s trams that sadly our overly corrupt country does not want to let go off for newer models
Oh and metro subway in Bucharest
To get to see this country having clean trains that are entirely electric, would be a blessing, my god
Clean air is a good so a cabin in the mountains should be an EU citizen right despite income
Why
Cars are good things
It's cheaper to fly because there are various kinds of subsidies to aviation
For instance, taxes on fuel/energy:
* aviation fuel is tax-free, they pay no excises, not even VAT
* for the electricity used by trains, there are all kinds of taxes (for instance, subsidies paid for green energy) and VAT
Airports are also paid by governments and they cost huge amounts of money
Look at the new Berlin Airport which cost already more 10 billion €.
With the money from building just this one airport, China would build 500 km of high speed rail
Well , if I think of it, I would love to see more people use the train so I can drive more and faster
Mine hasn’t changed at all, you can’t rate them lower than 0
I don't care, every country does what it believes it's the right thing to do
If the voters of the US chose people that didn't do much for the country then it is how it supposed to be
I have to remind you guys that most of the executive things are done by the States and not by the Federal government
Federally it's illegal to smoke weed yet it's legal in CO and CA
The state of NY did a fantastic job during this time
Locally in every state people took precaution
Florida was a mess when it opened its beaches because the locals were careful with the virus but the tourist weren't.
I can see why Poland likes US it is because Russia is right next to it, same goes for Romania, these two countries can't really hate the US because they trust America more than France or Germany (especially after Macron proposed the two speed system)
At least they have some sort of history, and a culture that’s not based on consumerism
(Edit): And they haven’t voted for their wanker leader
I am going to ignore your arrogance and say it actually is quite nice
In case you’re not aware, money isn’t everything, and if it’s that important to you, we have the highest gdp growth in europe
That’s such a civilised answer
I never expect anything like this on social media
Do not forget to remove the people behind him as well, after the romanian revolution in ‘89, we got rid of the dictator, but it was the people behind him that starved us, now guess what, the same people run the social-democrat party that runs the country and 30 years latee here we are, at the bottom of every european statistic
The dictator is just a puppet, the people that run the institutions, the industry, tve army, they are the puppeters, don’t allow them to join democracy, ever
What can I say, Macron has bad luck
Well nothing says "we want shit" like a fuckin death threat right
They got tired of their high living standards or what
Omelette
To be fair, those yellow vests are more green than yellow
That orange fellow is closer to the "yellow" denomination than the rest
You joke, but a former high-school colleague of mine moved to the States for studies and all and after she got married (in Texas, of all places) she once told me that she and her husband have 15 guns in their house

or gypsies do this
I mean they are the worst drivers i've ever seen
As a Romanian I can confirm the validity of such claims
Pls let me out
I’m Romanian and grew up in America
I drive like I’m always in an F1 race
I had no idea this was in my blood
I’ve gotta say I feel pretty attacked in this thread as I’ve owned both a Passat and 3 series
I only speak for myself but no
When I'm somewhere unfamiliar I have to pay extra attention to the road signs as well as the traffic and that means slowing down to the speed limit to process it all
Also pedestrians abroad cross the street as if there are invisible walls around them
They're the real suicidal maniacs
Ah indeed
Just imagine having to go through the already disgusting MTEROREX experience and have someone blast their music in your face every morning
We gotta spend all the speed we bottled up on those medieval paths our government calls roads
i agree, u/Ass-Eater9000
Uhm no, let's get honest, this time we can't just shift the blame on gypsies
I know some Snow White level of whiteness dudes that do this too
Doing this is seen as "cool" among certain groups, so that's how it got so common
Wow - these vezess guys really hunt for those crazy Romanians, don't they
Heh
I guess that's because they used to be really bad, you'd be out of a vehicle and a few teeth if you tried to cross one at any decent speed
The few I cross frequently have been repaired years ago, though
Edit: yeah, if there's no barrier the law is that you stop, like the other guy said
Yeah no that's probably not Romanian
You would have heard manele
it also sounds like the western part of romania
>at least the Romanians' have the courtesy to signal
Now that's a compliment you don't hear that often
>I’m Romanian and grew up in America
After seven years, not anymore
Dude, romanian metro is a godsend in comparison to british metro
I've been to London and I couldn't believe how loud it was
hate the fact that they are mixed or hate both Romanians and Hungarians
How much is many
That's a rookie technique
Here they stop basically in the middle of one of the lanes of the main road, making sure you have to stop to let him enter the main road, unless you want to crash into his car
Then they will make the "sorry" hand sign and pretend like it wasn't on purpose
Fucking cunts
I wish I had a monster truck to run them over
I will do no such thing
What about 7 years
It isn't
I'd rather be crammed in the Bucharest underground than in STB
Same here
I can't even say it's related to the level of education, I know some dudes with university degrees that drive like they want to die
After seven years spending in America, you aren't a Romanian anymore
I’ll change my birth certificate
I can agree on the last part
I live in Timisoara and drivers from southern Romania (especially south-west, they tend to move here a lot) are, on average, worse drivers
3 out of 5 times you see some stupid driver, it's from that area and not from here
I had friends in Naples, Italy
They said to me: "Traffic lights are a mere street decoration with no practical use
In the city, is not rare that scooters and mopeds are plowing over the sidewalk at 30+ mph to avoid traffic, with no minimum attention for the pedestrians
I lived in Rome, same thing
At least a dozen times, I almost got killed by scooters going 50+ on curbs
Parking is lawless, and is not rare that people are losing shit and breaking car mirrors or burning down illegally parked mopeds
Birth certificate or not, you aren't Romanian anymore
Lol at your idea of the world
It isn't an ”idea”, it's a fact
You aren't Romanian
Great Scott
Getting pepper sprayed from that close must hurt
I'm really sad for her regardless the context
And it's literally just her (and that unfazed dude) surrounded by police
Couldn't they like
push her away with their shields if they didn't like her
No corruption, political position doesn't mean you will be immune to police
Rather foolish of her to read
I meant like "gentle push", kind of like shooing her away like you do with your foot to a pigeon, but you're right, there would probably be nothing gentle about it
We hade the same joke in Romania, about our Militia (communist police)

Roosevelt was manipulated by Stalin
Truman was a hardcore anti-communist and stood up to Stalin and his totalitarian policies

i hope hes gonna collaborate with the EU a little bit more, Trump kinda cut ties with the EU
I know that we dont need Americas help, but its still nice to see the U.S. and EU working together
Trump did say once that he will leave america if he loses

I hope the people cheering in this thread will show the same enthusiasm for equality when the genders are reversed too
Then again, this thread hit /all, so a lot of people from the "special" subreddits are probably lurking around
What you ultimately want is a situation where everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, regardless if they're men, women, martians or what have you
The "problems" appear when you have multiple people with the same/very similar qualifications but you can't hire them all, so then as an employer you have to decide which *individual* you think is better based on things beyond just competency in their field, the sort of stuff you might learn about them in interviews or from their social media
So technically, you're always discriminating, but ideally when qualifications aren't the deciding factor one would hope the employer decides based on **actually listening to the unique individual in front of them** than deciding based on the preconceived notions they have about that individual because of what's between their legs
this sub is right-wing as fuckkkkkkkkk
> In this case, they quantified competence
Since this was in a state institution, I expect it was required by law to do this
dunno if it's most, i'm pretty hard left and i usually stay away from this sub because i doubt i can have the most reasonable discussions with people who defend banks and corporations and sing prayers to the EU and to neo-liberalism, which happens so much on this sub
I'll give you that i rarely ever saw openly fascist idiots in threads that don't hit /r/all and in this thread it's almost like there's a flood of them
Good luck and don't give up

It's a very natural thing

Hello
Round apartment buildings in Moscow, Russia
Built in the 1970s.
It looks interesting
What was the rationale for this shape
More vertical space, less ground footprint
This
This is what I love and still miss about these apartment buildings
Every building, even those in the city center, have their own little gardens, in which trees are planted, and mostly anything that people from said apartment building want to plant
Sadly, this trend starts to fade out, to make space for cars
A shame, it helped clean the air
Nature at it's finest
This
And as an experiment in design/architecture
Bro the new Dunkirk movie is lookin
Baguette
Definitely better than its Easter European wannabe counterpart Bucharest
Not to be confused with the Arc de Triomphe in București (also known as smol Paris) , sadly no military parade has happend there this year cuz of covid
> In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of 'Paris of the East' (Romanian: Parisul Estului) or 'Little Paris' (Romanian: Micul Paris)
From Wikipedia
Of course, only the locals know this nickname
You know what this picture lacks
A homemade still for pălincă behind the house
yeah were just waiting for it to resolve itself, right ? shouldn't be too long now
And be a sweety and hand me that olivier salad
What the hell are you talking about
What's up with the white lines in Russia and Turkey
Why are Belarus and Ukraine included but not Russia
This looks like subtle American propaganda to me
Ah yes, the great wall of Russia
Man, I wish sources were always stickied at the top in threads like this
I scrolled way too much to find it
Anyway, thanks
Half of thread is full of nazi germans thinking is ok to beat people on street
It is acceptable since it's against a idiot who thinks it's funny to do a nazi salute in fucking Dresden
Neo-nazis are a bunch of degenerates and deserve what's coming to them
Stop defending them
Over-sensationalized Fake News
It's not only Poland
Check the US, UK, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Australia, China
It's like the dumbest assholes in world got together and decided to ruin countries and fuck people over just for the lols
As a Romanian
I agree with you
Too many dumb idiots votes for corruption because they promise higher pension income but they never think that a rise of pension means higher prices
Unfortunately the poverty is so high that people accept everything here and is frustrating as fuck
It was an international example, just like the US
People celebrate being born LGBT because of the historical oppression and violence, that happen to this very day
Being proud of being born in one country or another is just dumb
I don't get people who aren't enjoying the meme like a normal person and just type "AmErIcAnS aRe DuMb; ThIs SysTEm iS BeTtEr tHaN tHe AmErIcAn OnE"
Yes, because liberalism is all about the free markets, less government, “individual liberty” in Europe
The classical liberalism we have is quite right wing
Sure, but we have a dictionary definition that encompasses all that, and that is “classical liberalism”
Absolute unit
Can someone explain why there isn’t Bulgaria, Romania, etc
**I**r**e**land
Idk
Or perhaps The Republic of Internet Explorer
Everywhere in europe : *protests*
Denmark : Mh yes duck go quack
Goose march is very important
We go to /r/all again
Up with it then
I'm guessing that if a lot of countries would go "We'll ban the fuck out of you and your businesses after you leave office" he would definitely take notice
Other ex-presidents (besides the fact they wouldn't have pulled this shit), they'd go "big deal, so I won't have book signings or talks there", but this fucker has his tentacles all over the world and an embargo over businesses linked to him would hurt him big time
Refugees are not immigrants
You're seriously retarded
Poor soul
*Where you rollin' ?*
You mean punchflips
The internet here is amazing, but sometimes the mobile data can be shit
You can have 4G+ in the middle of a forest near the capital, or some very poor H+ in the middle of Bucharest
I know that that's the provider fault, but compared to Italy, where I had signal and internet even in the most remote areas, here it's very chaotic
Can confirm
And I'm sometimes still frustrated by it
meanwhile, im stuck with a shitty router from Digi that can only do 35 Mbps for like 5 eur
For those feeling bad, I'm Romanian paying the same and my absolute max is 60Mbps
eu la 30 de lei am 80 cu 80
Ce abonament ai
I love these threads
Reminds me that there are things that are extremely good here
Good internet is such a normal thing here that everyone takes it for granted
I still can't believe that this is something extraordinary
Bruh wtf , 40 euro for 5mbps
If you somehow manage to ignore all the border controls, you would be able to get a fiber optic cable from Arad to Strasbourg for about 2500-3000 Eur + whatever it takes to lay it
Well you do have the disadvantage of living in Romania so I dont think its worth it
I have it from Digi also, but I get 360Mbps
I have the 4€ plan, because it was before they had gigabit internet
>If you go to some african countries with 100€ you can basically own the entire city
true lol
It's the same here
Nobody can afford this internet in Romania except the millionaires
I am on a 56 Kbps dial-up connection right now
Too bad we can't implement anything else as good
That's reasonable, considering you live on an island far away and a connection to other data centers is done by expensive undersea cable or even more expensive satellite
Better than nothing
Think about those children in Africa
salaries are not lower in hungary compared to romania, wtf are you on anout
Selly te iobezk
It's not that bad
Why are they refusing tho
Just drive and unroll it on the side of the road, hope that no one cuts it
Buy an Army surplus tank from Russia, just pull the cable straight to the other side
Tanks probably don't depreciate much, so when done you could just sell the tank
Nah, it's not that bad
Is not that bad
We compare too much with the West for our own sake
Well for one we have almost 5000 daily covid cases these days, which is, you know, not very ideal
But hey the food is great
Its okay, but the guys pfp is one of the problems
It's bad, but not that bad
I would rather live somewhere else, in a more developed European country
nope, having a gdp ppp per capita of  32
000 is def not bad, it's decent
I can confirm that statement, I personally heard it before
At best it may be an exaggeration, but certainly not a joke folks laugh at
They are also stealing materials from roads
What i heard is that the "rural people" are gypsies don't downvote me it's what i heard
probably gypsies
It isnt a joke its a profesion many take pride in
I have so many stories from my vilage that you wouldnt belive
Preach
U get wifi from romania u do it in romanian style
Nah the usual thieves of tracks, metal wires and God knows what else have been mostly always gypsies
Sometimes they make the news by being stupid enough to get caught, and you can clearly see
Welp

Btw in my country a lot of people think's that in the time of Ceausescu was better,and the new generation are a little to socialist because their lack of understanding what is a truly democratic and good for people  country
Man he was mediocrity incarnate, i can’t believe they’re using him in this fashion and it’s working
can i say snow is hot
Good
Yeah, I used one of those auto email things but didn't really expect it to do anything since I doubt our MEPs would listen
If a parliament voted by 3 million people won't think anything is wrong when half a million are protesting a change I doubt the same kind of people would listen to a few emails
I'm curious to see how they voted
How thin is the ice when you let thousands of untested seasonal workers into Germany and how does that fit into her "caution is the order of the day " nonsense and the reproduction number
Anyone  from Germany want to weigh in on this ?Are you aware of this at all
How essential  are these workers during this crisis if they are treated as expendable
Some reports say they are not even provided basic housing and safety equipment
Well, she has a PhD in quantum chemistry
When the RN wins the elections in France they’ll exit the EU as well
Same with the Italian far-right
Add that to divisive dictators like Orban and the semi-dictatorships of Poland and Romania
The EU will cease to exist in 10 years unfortunately
Brexit is just the beginning
He's definitely more of an autocrat than a democratically-elected leader at this point
Hungary's democracy is fragile at best - I wouldn't be surprised if the latest election Orban won was rigged from the start
Yet still parties like the RN in France and Vox in Spain are on the rise
The RN is France's second biggest political party at the moment, not far behind Macron's LREM
Le Pen has publicly outlined her intentions to take France out of the EU, readopt the franc as the French currency, and join an alliance with Russia - despite that, millions will vote her in the next elections
The situation in Central Europe is precarious at best and the only reason Hungary and Poland haven't flipped over to Russia is because EU funds keep coming in, straight into PiS and Fidesz's pockets
Romania and Bulgaria are marred by corruption - while I don't know much of what's going on in Bulgaria, the Romanian ruling party, PSD, is a proto-populist party whose policies are very conservative in nature despite them proclaiming their allegiance to leftist politics
Italy will have a far-right leadership soon and countries like Austria and the Netherlands are growing increasingly eurosceptic
The EU won't survive the 2020s.

I never said that right wing parties are dictatorships
Counterexample: the Tories who are in power in the UK are right-wing, yet the UK definitely isn't a dictatorship
I'd also argue Macron is operating on a centre-right platform
Merkel is centre-right as well

So when are the antifa and other leftist terrorist groups going put on trial, or is political violence acceptable when the left does it
I see Covid is a thing of the past in Greece
I cant understand anything they're saying but I can feel their pure joy
One the group is an leftist anarchist group which is why they fly the flags, two North Korea calls itself a democratic republic, it’s almost like the actions of group matter more then the labels they give themselves
These fucking cunts where fighting with police and throwing Molotov cocktails this very day
But let me guess the police are fascist
Violence for political reasons is terrorism
It doesn’t change because you support the political ideas of the group
Also pointing out the hypocrisy of arresting one of violent group and not the other doesn’t make you a fascist it makes you a rational human
I know they operated a brothel with women from Europe who were forced to work there after being deceived into thinking that they were getting a job
The people arrested where members of Antifa; this isn’t the first time people associate with group committed acts of terror
Hell a few years ago members associate with the groups carried out bombings against political rivals
How is the group not a terrorist organization
Oh yes because the powers that be like the ideology of the group
Get houses down; respond by setting cops on fire; fine let’s say you are right as of now you can’t tell if these people are associated with the group but let’s say after their arrest these people are tied to antifa
If this happens would you be okay with labeling the group as a terrorist organization
Cops and other political groups they don’t agree with
And by fight you mean set on fire and bomb
Which idk about you sounds like causing a state of terror
Just because they are shit at being terrorist doesn’t make them any less terrorist
Also those anarchist groups you are referring are well known for acts of terrorism such as the black star, Revolutionary Nuclei, and Nihilist Faction which all claim to be anti-fascist
Look man keep defending terrorist maybe if you do it well enough next time they riot in Athens you’re house won’t get burnt down
Antifa is more then ideology it is also a group that act as decentralize cells
They mobilize and communicate here on Reddit on Facebook and other social media platforms
Just because some members don’t carry out acts of terrorism doesn’t mean the group as a whole isn’t terroristic
Not all members of golden dawn helped in the murder that doesn’t excuse the party as a whole
Fair enough
Eastern Ukraine looks the same

That's why today we mark the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of ~~Stalinism~~ Communism and Nazism
When will we remember the victims of capitalism
Never because capitalism rules  the world now and if someone dares to attack it he’ll become one of the victims

I think you’re so prepared to have a “communism isn’t bad it just wasn’t implemented right” fight you’re not seeing that nobody’s arguing that here

Christmas Market 2019, Dresden, Germany
2020 has ruined even Christmas
Dresden, city, capital of Saxony Land (state), eastern Germany
Dresden is the traditional capital of Saxony and the third largest city in eastern Germany after Berlin and Leipzig
It lies in the broad basin of the Elbe River between Meissen and Pirna, 30 km north of the Czech border and 160 km south of Berlin
Sheltering hills north and south of the Elbe valley contribute to the mild climate enjoyed by Dresden
Dresden is distinguished by the celebrated art museums and classic architecture of its reconstructed old town
Completed in 1743 and rebuilt after WWII, the baroque church Frauenkirche is famed for its grand dome
The Versailles-inspired Zwinger palace houses museums including Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, exhibiting masterpieces of art like Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna
Dresden originated as the Slav village of Drezdzany, meaning “Forest Dwellers on the Plain,” on the Elbe’s north bank
First mentioned in 1216, the town on the south bank was founded at a ford by Margrave Dietrich of Meissen as a German colony
The Slav settlement on the north bank, although older, was known as New Town and the later German town on the south bank as Old Town
Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony, who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor
The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its baroque and rococo city centre
Before World War II, Dresden was called “the Florence on the Elbe” and was considered one of the world’s most beautiful cities owing to its architecture and art treasures
During the war, however, it was almost completely destroyed by massive bombing raids that took place on the night of February 13–14, 1945, by an Anglo-American force
The raids obliterated much of Dresden and killed thousands of civilians; various postwar estimates placed the death toll between 35,000 and 135,000 people, but in the early 21st century an official German commission concluded that up to 25,000 had perished
The city was so badly damaged that it was suggested that the best approach might be to level the site
After the war a compromise was reached by rebuilding the Zwinger, the Saxon royal palace, and the Baroque buildings around the palace and creating a new city in the area outside
Much of the city was subsequently reconstructed with modern (though rather plain) buildings, broad streets and squares, and green open spaces, with the aim of preserving as far as possible the character of the old city
You wouldn't know by looking at photos of old charming European cities like these the horrors WW2 brought upon them
Ok, gotcha
I'll go get a Berliner right now and drink some homemade vișinată!
I think theyre just berliners or these donuts that are more of a sphere than american ones or from where they are
This pic is upsetting my stomach
And absolutely nothing was done about it all this time
If I say something about climate change, y’all gonna shout at me, call me retarded and say weather =/= climate, aintcha
But I still wanna say it’s been raining in Bucharest for two days straight
In fucking mid-January
Shit’s fucked up
Hey
This is Europe

Bruh Romania wtf
Oh no Romania
Romania,wtf
I can relate to Sweden, Croatia and Slovenia
I'm running on Romanian hardware and Slovenian software
Accurate for Romania
As a Romanian I don't know what to say but interesting
It's just a map to make fun of stereotypes
"How do I avoid Roma
" First of all nobody calls them Roma and second of all it's common knowledge
Nobody needs to google that
The only trick I know: Have friends that are friends with some of them
the romanian one hurt a bit
Roma refers to gypsies
In what way
If everyone is poor , no one is .
Let's make this a reality everywhere , cuz that is how we abolish poverty .
Tbh when I burst out laughing too, but then got sad if this is real
You know I was kidding right
I'm tellin' you
The romans are coming

I mean crazy people are not exclusive to one race, I got sad cuzz if the search was real, it would have been REALLY FUCKING RACIST

Judging by his shirt I think he loved living
We ,europeans, should respond with more cartoons of Muhammed, we value our freedom of speech and wont let some insane people scare us
These people need to be viewed as they are: insane and threats to society
And treated as such
I don't know what to say except that I hope the victims will rest in peace and their families will be able to get through this
It's sickening to think about what happened
Barbaric
The issue with any proposed laws is that they would target the entire population instead
It's extremely difficult to do anything that wouldn't enforce these strict rules on the 99
99% of people that have nothing to do with this
People like you must be salivating at the thought of more attacks like this in order to undermine your true enemies: secularism and liberalism
> Yall aren't in the middle ages
But that's exactly the problem
Two cultures: one went through the Enlightenment and absorbed its values, the other did not
They don't see the world the same way, yet they try to live together
I have a so-called moderate Muslim acquaintance that said she doesn't agree with the beheading
then 5 minutes later starts screaming all over FB "boycott the French
They're oppressing us since colonial times
I love you Mohamed" and shit like that
the hypocrisy is astounding
Well, you have one culture that went through and absorbed the values of the Enlightenment
And you have another culture which has not done that
And now they try to live together
It's a large gap
Rip Romania :( Y we no in photo

Not the statistic you'd want to beat
Why are we comparing our real numbers with their fake ones
I'm genuinely puzzled about the evolution in China, even if their numbers are somewhat not correct
The debate in Europe was about taking the "herd Immunity" approach or the lockdown approach, but in both cases, from what I understand the end result would be that 60%-70% of the population will be exposed to the virus in some way
The only difference being the timeframe and the risk factor
So what happened in China
How come there are no new cases
Did almost a  billion people got exposed
Are there almost a billion people already immune
Could someone with medical knowledge explain this phenomenon to me
We are number 1
Eh , well things weren't great to begin with, so we're trying our best not to spread this virus, cause if it does, we're fucked
The healthcare system over here is okish at best if you're lucky and have $$$ and live in a bigger city
Then again, living in smaller communities means less chances to get this thing
Who knows how things will develop
At least the government is trying to contain it as best they can
I honestly think it could have been a lot worse, at least until now
So I see that the "equal gender representation" mantra has gone down the drain
Romania on this same day as well
I went today, I think there will be pics and videos tomorrow
Go Russia
I dont know if it will make a difference but fuck these corrupt oligarchs
Climate change is a good thing for russia, it opens up new maritime lanes and unfreezes the tundra
So dont hope that russia will ever do anything about it
I have the same expression when my dad repeats himself for the thousand's time about a subject that he finds revolting(Side note: He was born in the Soviet Union)
He tries to pick her up with cheap lines :)

This is a good ideea since tickets only affect the poor people
looks like a black metal album cover
if they saw our roads now they would hang themselves
In Romania we don't build roads, we discover them
It is still better than nowadays romanian roads
I don't think there has ever been any Roman settlement documented in Bucharest
The oldest record of Bucharest ever existing dates to around ~1500
Same in Bucharest, it must be an ancient Roman custom
I would say the same about Romanian roads
but they haven't been built yet
Construction on the A3 started like 15 years ago
yeah it means citizen of Rome
I don't get the "bad roads" circlejerk, we have really good roads in Romania, just very few KMs of highway
I've seen much, much worse roads in the uk for example
There's a lot of stuff like this happening and slowing the road building projects
But that's not really the main culprit
funny and sad at the same time
I think that it's normal to have a permit, it's the same here in Romania
Otherwise, it would be ridiculously easy for poachers or normal people to steal or "uncover" and then sell on the Black Market some really important and valuable objects
It was a really big problem here immediately after the fall of communism, in 1989, when we still didn't have very centralised and strong authorities and laws
Maybe in Scandinavia the average citizen is responsible enough to return to the police a seemingly old enough object
Dacia wasn't completely conquered either
Googling it seems to say it's the cellar of an inn built in the 18th century

New post
Glad to see Hungarians finally protesting against the shit Orban has been doing for a while now
All the support from across the border to our Hungarian bros, I really wish you manage to win this battle
Remember that this is just a battle in a long war and the only way to get Orban to either step down or change his policies is to put constant pressure on him through protests
Whoever says it doesn’t work, fuck that, it worked for us a couple of years ago, it will work for you too
Finally, it was about time to do it

Can someone explain what is the guy in this photo doing
It's quite amazing knowing that ALL the people in those photos are right now dead
I don't know
for me, it's almost astonishing
I wonder how will future generations feel thinking the same when they will re-evaluate current generation photos in around 2200 or so when camera technology will heavily surpass today's standard (personally I think smart watches will be capable of taking current day DSLR level photos while DSLR cameras will be able of 100-200 Mpix with much, much higer iso and so forth being capable out of the box)
The same will be said for our generation, those born in the 80s and 90s.

I am offended that Romania is not on that list, we are very unfriendly to Russia and our objective of reunification with Moldova really upsets them, we should have totally been there with the UK

Nukes can be built, also Germany is still under sanctions since WW2, in regards to its military, UN could lift them, though that might be controversial

So much bullshit in this thread about American cops in this thread, when I was in the US, I went out exploring the woods, at some point got lost, ended up on a busy expressway (it was illegal to walk on a expressway in that state) cop found me, instead of giving me a fine (which he could have) he gave me a ride home
Meanwhile in Austria, I got stopped by police once for absolutely no reason and they started looking around my car, at absolutely everything, just to find a reason to give me a fine
Not to mention Hungary, where cops are 2x bigger assholes, because they are looking for a reason to extort a bribe from you
There are good cops and asshole cops everywhere, it’s not one country vs another
In the US, there is a lot more violent crime than in Europe, so it’s normal cops are more prepared to deal with that kind of shit
Actually there are only two countries between Hungary and the Netherlands (Austria and Germany)

The problem is that most commie blocks you see now are in a bad shape due to lack of maintanance from the owners
You could easily solve their depressing look by fixing the exterior(better insulation, etc
) and giving them some fresh new paint
not really
They were mostly built to move people from land to cities and industrial centers
Most commie blocks were built around factories to give the idea that it's comfortable to sleep and then go to work really quickly
In all the ex communist countries these neighborhoods are called dormitories
That was the intention, cheap housing for the workers and with some semblence of comfort so as the people don't get crazy

German reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung) was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR, colloquially East Germany; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik/DDR) became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, colloquially West Germany; German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland) to form the reunited nation of Germany, as provided by Article 23 of the FRG's then constitution (Grundgesetz)
The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity (German: Deutsche Einheit), celebrated each year on 3 October as German Unity Day (German: Tag der deutschen Einheit)
Berlin was reunited into a single city, and again became the capital of united Germany
The post-1990 united Germany is not a successor state, but an enlarged continuation of the former West Germany
As such, the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany retained the West German seats in international organizations including the European Community (later the European Union) and NATO, while the memberships in the Warsaw Pact and other international organizations to which East Germany belonged simply ceased to exist because East Germany ceased to exist
It also maintains the United Nations membership of the old West Germany

One thing that seems to be the same in every country(from what i understand from the coomments so far) is that the ruling party says is a great deal while the opposition says it's a bad deal
They shouldn't have taken on new debt in my opinion
> Strengthening them and allowing them to function better is a fantastic way to improve your country altogether - and this applies to the European level as well
The only problem is there is no certainty that the poorer countries will be strengthened
It looks to me like the money will go to all manner of thieves, and corrupt politicians, and the situation will not improve
> I agree that I do not trust our Eastern European politicians with spending, but why the fuck should that mean that we do not get development or support funds
This seems contradictory
You do not trust them in general, but you think they should be trusted with this money in particular, because
why exactly
I too am east-european, and I fear that this money will only go to thieves, and will not help ordinary citizens like myself
I don't see any arguments against this
Only some blind trust that it will be ok, while you write that you do not trust politicians
Which is it
Same here in Romania
I hate our stupid leaders
Romanians have a paranoia about debts, that is since Ceausescu wanted to give back every penny to the banks while the population did not even have the basic food
> Because I'd rather risk
"I trust the thieves because I'd rather have the money stolen than not have it at all
Well, no arguing with that
We'll just have to agree to disagree
Of course, not all the money will be stolen, to the last cent
As sure as it is that at least one cent will be stolen
The exact amount is unknown, and really unknowable now, so you can just say you are ok with whatever amount will be stolen
But kind of unfair to accuse others, Netherlands for example, that they are hypocrites for not being ok with stolen money, as you are
It sounds to me like they are exactly right, and you actually support thieves, because it is convenient to you, that after the theft something remains for you
Hardly a superior moral position

Gullholmen, Sweden
Gullholmen is a town located on a small island in Sweden's Orust Municipality
The town is notable for the absence of car traffic, and is serviced by a ferry to the mainland multiple times per day
It only takes about ten minutes to reach Gullholmen by ferry from Tuvesvik, on Orust
One part of the town is on a small island that is known as Sweden's most densely populated, a veritable beehive of summer cottages and all year round houses
There is a lovely, friendly atmosphere among the small alleys that meander among old fishing cottages and boathouses
There are a few restaurants and cafés in the harbour area where you can eat good food and enjoy the lively setting of the pleasure boats
To me it looks similar to Denmark
Wait until you'll see them with sandals and socks

60 years ago, on 19 August 1960, two brave dogs, Belka and Strelka, went to space on board Sputnik 5
They became the first living beings (and the cutest
) to safely return from orbit, paving way for human spaceflight
Belka (Белка, literally, "Squirrel" or alternatively "Whitey") and Strelka (Стрелка, "Little Arrow") spent a day in space aboard Korabl-Sputnik 2 (Sputnik 5) on 19 August 1960 before safely returning to Earth
They were accompanied by a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, flies and several plants and fungi
All passengers survived
They were the first Earth-born creatures to go into orbit and return alive
Animals do have personalities (should be obvious to anyone who's met more than one animal) and some of them may put themselves in danger to help someone they consider part of their group, even if they didn't *have* to
Is that not bravery
Obviously the dogs "bravely going into space" is bullshit, and people love attributing human thinking to their pets, but animals do have emotions and personalities, I don't know how anyone could claim otherwise
They're not biological robots who only act in 'pre-programmed' ways, in fact that's the more outlandish claim as far as I'm concerned
Pretty accurate

What you mean "no data" for Romania, Moldova and Ukraine

In romanian we dont 1 language to iee in this situation, we just use a random language, but saying that it sounds chinese is the most used

Romania would be either chinese or turkish

inb4: Vote for the euro-skeptics
My opinion is that [people are blowing this thing out of proportion] I'm beginning to think that the whole propaganda against it has been coordinated in order to make people vote in a certain way

Before you down-vote this, remember that what people today are saying about Article 13, that it will "ruin the internet as we know it", others have said about GDPR

It made me a little more euro-skeptic not because of what the article will or will not do, but how it was voted on, by people who had no idea what they voted on, they ignored a pretty big voice of the people who protested either online or in Germany and probably mostly did it cause they were persuaded by lobbyists
In no way can you tell me that this article serves the average EU citizen and not the big companies
> they ignored a pretty big voice of the people who protested
with arguments that had little to do with what the law proposal actually proposes
That's my point here
There's a lot of propaganda around the issue and very little discussions on the actual text of the law
> It made me a little more euro-skeptic not because of what the article will or will not do, but how it was voted on
You're proposing to judge the law proposal and the people who voted on it, not based on what the law is meant to do, but on your perceived understanding of the motives of others
You're better off rolling a dice to decide on this
So, when you breathe out, it goes "clink, clink" on the ground, right

The war made the holocaust worse, but I don't really see one necessarily tied to the other
The holocaust would have probably happened without the war, remember that nazis were gassing the mentally handicapped people long before the jews
Also, they had concentration camps since 1933
It was just a matter of time
Speaking of time, the stars on jews and gettos only started in 1941, 1
5 years after the war started
The war did facilitate the nazis opening extermination camps out of sight of german population, though
I used to work for the biggest independent mortgage dealer in Romania just before the 2007-2008 crisis, and I'd say that every month or so we were receiving at least a call from a lady pensioner from the UK who had heard/read that the Romanian real-estate market was on the upward trend and so she wanted to know how could she get a mortgage in order to invest

Netherlands always know to sell itself
They are some of the worst offenders to CO2 reduction in Europe, but everybody knows them for their bikes and windmills
Now add wind turbines to the mix
These look pretty, but they generate only 8% of electricity inNetherlands
In the UK they do double, at 18%. Even Romania, a very poor country by comparison, does 10%. But we'll never have such beautiful pictures and good PR
> But we are still proud of our ancestors who managed to 'create' an entire province and protect us from being under sea level
as you should, this is nothing short of a miracle
Also, NL has 52k GDp per capita, compare that with 12k per capita
This is not just 4 times richer, it also means they have much more disposable income on average
The Netherlands could afford many more expensive solutions for renewable electricity, like solar PV - there is no NIMBYsim with solar
Anyway, my post was more about the good PR that netherlands has, even when they don;t deserve it, rather than the actual solutions to the energy problem
I didn't get into the entire pollution, I stuck to the electricity production
This is the first to de-carbonize in every country, and  Netherlands is way behind other rich countries, it does worse than even poor countries
You have some unique challenges, true, but other countries also have challenges, like say for instance, not having enough money for hospitals and roads, but they still de carbonized the electricity more

Dutch engineering: Veluwemeer Aqueduct in Harderwijk, the Netherlands
Open since 2002, the Veluwemeer Aqueduct is a stunning work of architecture and engineering
This waterway measures up at a short 25 meters long by 19 meters wide and is located in Harderwijk, the Netherlands
During the design of this unique passage, engineers chose to construct the waterway over the N302 road, where 28,000 vehicles pass each day
Veluwemeer is a shallow 3-meter deep water bridge that allows for small boats and other water vehicles to pass with ease
In addition to this easy boating passage, pedestrian walkways are on both sides allowing for foot traffic
Unlike drawbridges or other roadway structures, the water bridge design implemented in this aqueduct allows for constant traffic flow on the road and in the water
Why not build bride over the water

In Romania it was legal under the constitution but there is no legislation made to make it official
The constitution only specified "two people" (ruff translation)
They made a referendum in 2018 to try to change the constitution so that there is no possibility any future judge would make a new law to permit it
It won by 91% but since only 21% of registrant voters came to vote it was deemed invalid
It's neither legal or illegal in Romania, as the constitution doesn't mention gender when talking about marriage
All old religious people went nuts when they realised this and got mobilised by their churches to vote on making it illegal in a referendum
It failed
as an lgbt person from eastern europe this hurts :( i just want equality
I'd love to say this is not representative for the most population here, but it is
Not for the reasons one might think, but simply because the some part of the population doesn't even know what a homosexual or heterosexual mean
Another reason is that we weren't asked, and even if we would be, the young generation that cares about this wouldn't care enough to vote if it means getting out of the house, so we're basically stuck with whatever the old generation that doesn't know much about these things vote
Romania also did

Yes, because all religious people (90% of the world) is against science, believes in "the invisible man in the sky" (according to atheists, who don't know any of the hundreds of beliefs), and against human progress
Has imaginary friends, is mentally unstable, is against human progression, and believes in Santa
That's your common religious person, right
So, in your boring life, you enjoy going to an internet forum, shaming and discriminating every person that is not a member of your belief, and rudely insult people just by bringing up the topic
Either you are troll (which I doubt, because your account is 8 years old, and most trolls make new accounts), stupid, or most likely had a bad day involving a religious person
And no, I'm not a religious person trying to defend my belief (I am more of an agnostic)
The reason of this comment of mine is because I saw how angry and wrong your comment was
>I'm sorry, but adults with imaginary friends are either stupid or mentally unstable
They are working against progression and talking down on every human achievement, because they truly believe the easter bunny and santa claus to be real
Yes I agree with that, and the world is filled with those fake Christians, who consider themselves "Christian" even though they didn't ever read the Bible
A good example is how, as I remember, Jesus Christ whole message is that we should turn the other cheek, and love everyone, even the sinful, because we are all sons and daughters of God
In my opinion, a sin is an action that intentionally harms someone
Example, violence and anger targeting towards someone is a sin
Forcefully taking an object from another person (stealing) is a sin
But being gay isn't a sin
Homosexuality doesn't harm anyone (people getting offended for no reason does not count as harm, as the first person didn't intend it
A sin can be forgiven if the sinner did it by mistake, or now regrets it, or both)
Gosh darn that is fucking beautiful

The medieval town of Monteriggioni, Italy, which has remained intact over the centuries
Monteriggioni is a walled town in Tuscany, Italy, known for its medieval fortifications and watchtowers
The castle walls offer views of the surrounding Chianti region
On a small natural hillock, this completely walled medieval town in the Siena Province of Tuscany was built between 1213 and 1219 by the overlords of Siena for defensive purposes: its strategic location atop a hill overlooking the Cassia Road allowed the castle to control the cities of the Val d’Elsa and Staggia and be on the lookout for any armies approaching Siena
Except for some work done in the 16th century, when the towers were lowered, very little work has been done to Monteriggioni's walls or buildings since they were first erected
Thus, Monteriggioni's walls and the buildings that make up the town are the best preserved example of their kind in all of Italy
Distances from other major towns and cities are: Siena 15 km; Volterra - 39 km; Florence 50 km; Pisa 157 km

Darmstadt is a city in the state of Hesse in Germany, located in the southern part of the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region)
Darmstadt had a population of around 157,437 at the end of 2016
The Darmstadt Larger Urban Zone has 430,993 inhabitants
It’s known for the Mathildenhöhe district's art nouveau buildings, like the iconic Wedding Tower
Museum Künstlerkolonie features art nouveau glass, textiles and jewelry
Hessisches Landesmuseum displays art by Joseph Beuys
Northeast, the Messel Pit has Eocene-era fossils
To the south is ruined Frankenstein Castle, which may have inspired the famed book
Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" (German: Wissenschaftsstadt) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies
The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research, where several chemical elements such as bohrium (1981), meitnerium (1982), hassium (1984), darmstadtium (1994), roentgenium (1994), and copernicium (1996) were discovered
Wile I do like the garden rooftop idea the exterior design ruins the image
The irregular lines clash with the neighboring buildings topped with the fact that every window is different
I imagine the green ones are the original and the white ones were replaced later on
Happy independence day from your neighbours
Happy Independence day from Romania
Happy independence day from România
Happy independence day neighbour
i hope russia nuke will nuke your shithole
There’s so many puns in this thread hahah
yea, i hate it, now give all the land back to russian, poland and romania
Congrats I feel offended now
Romania: thats all you can
you really missed your chance here
Oh you did not
Task accomplished successfully
the best part about it is that Moldova does not exist
It's perfect
i am mad >:(
What monster made this
Oh my eyes, those retarded borders are horrbile
YEAH WE STILL GOT TRANSYLVANIA THO
This map is not offensive enough
Romania should have an independent enclave consisting of 2 counties in the middle of the country that are mostly hungarian
Replacing Romania with Hungary pissed me off as a Romanian
Great post tho
If you want to insult us:
- just make us part of Russia
-wait
Fuck you
*angry noises*
"Now listen here you little shit
Give Transylvania back
Where's the insult to Turkey ?
Hochland
Still no Transylvania though
;) I guess there is no scenario where Hungary gets it
> But what should it be then
The Hungary label applied to (part of) Romania should be replaced with Gypsy (or something along these lines)
The confusion of Romanians with Gypsies triggers us way more
> Don't forget it also has to offend the other nations
not all names trigger all nations
For example we're no triggered that Netherlands is called (for some reason that I don't even know) Bene
They way I interpret it is that a label applied to a teritory should trigger the people there
why
I see that Transilvania is still part of Romania
The new Romania
> gypsies are slavs
I think he just triggered a few hundred milions slavs
friendship between poles and hungarians is no more
protesting against climate change is like fighting windmills
Marienplatz Library, Munich, Germany
Munich’s municipal law library is one of the most beautiful European libraries
The rather small library is located within the city’s new town hall, which was built between 1867 and 1908 and is supposed to resemble a bright warm forest
The future is here today: you can't play Bach on Youtube because Sony says they own his compositions
Green defense
is there like a random church in a forest
there must be some interesting history behind it
Just go to sleep

It’s SHITE being Scottish
We’re the lowest of the low
The scum of the fucking Earth
The most wretched, miserable, servile, pathetic trash that was ever shat into civilization
Some hate the English
I don’t. They’re just wankers
We, on the other hand, are COLONIZED by wankers
Can’t even find a decent culture to be colonized BY
We’re ruled by effete assholes
It’s a SHITE state of affairs to be in, OP, and ALL the fantastic photos in the world won’t make any fucking difference

Such a cool juxtaposed perspective

Go brothers, eastern europe should not tolerate corruption anymore
I really hope you guys are going to get better through this
We know how this is and we're going through the same problems and mentalities
Cheers from Romania
Meanwhile, our abusers just got away with gasing and washing streets with us 2 years ago
yeah, but no, you guys in Russia and Belarus have no chance, i really feel sorry, but there is not a single chance you can grow something democratic
Not pictured here: the thousands of tourists overcrowding the tiny streets and the queue of people behind you waiting to take the exact same picture
Every picture of Greece be like

i dont want to be drunk there tbh
Such a beautiful landscape
Guys I'm just curious, isn't it hard to stay in such a place without sunglasses all the time
Like my eyes are frowning easily just to snow when I'm getting out of the house, but these buildings seem even whiter
Ah yes the meditarean, where the only colours are withe and blue sky
well, we expect another bout of cold this weekend, so it isn't done
today 23, tomorrow 5, fun times
That's so  sad
Netherlands is my favorite country, and its beautiful
Sadly, that's true (as far as I know) :/
Copenhagen, Denmark
Charming Northern city
Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure
The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange
Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology
Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region
With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts
Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions
They do
And people living in that exact place probably pay a huge premium
Same for Venice or that super cute city in Austria (can't remember the name, but it's been posted before)
Edit: in Bucharest, there's either the huge premium or the fact that the inside of those buildings hasn't really changed for 100 years, so you end up in weird cold apartments with broken toilets down the hall and weird crammed staircases
It's fine as a hostel experience, but not as a living one
I think Hallstatt (or at least one that looked very similar)
And doing this is illegal in Romania, a cheap and eco friendly-ish way of protecting your crop because the government must think our farmers are drunk 24/7 and will burn the crops down
They would burn the organic waste
Český Krumlov, Czech Republic
Český Krumlov is a city in the South Bohemia region of the Czech Republic
It’s bisected by the Vltava River, and dominated by its 13th-century castle
The castle has Gothic, Renaissance and baroque elements, an 11-hectare garden and an original 17th-century baroque theater
There are panoramic views of the old town and the river from the top of its round belltower
Remainia
We are truly touched
I think that they're referencing that England doesn't have the best view on us
Bruh why tf you're from Mordor
Indeed we are
Yesss
Someone find that link
Edit:
Both probably
gotta get those EU subsidies
I think you've managed to overcome that with ... cough ... decency
Suprised Pickachu
Yiu are walking a fine line of hypocrisy here cause the EU has repeated refferendums on the Lisboa treaty until they came out "right"
Sarcasm aside some of us in the East hoped they'll go for cheap, they went for supply chain, stability, qualified workforce and a hundred other things we're not on par with
Now, assembly aside the supply chain for car manufacturers is so spread out it's almost impossible some of the production of the parts won't trickle down to other states
It's a big win for Germany, but also a ein for Europe and why not, ... the freaking planet
Ummm .. cough .. we're salty about our gold too
Now that’s a fun fact
Damn
I've been there and I didn't know it looked like that from above
Shameful political oppression what happens in Belarus
Imagine being Lukashenko, crying because your are not "properly" elected and then kidnapping your own people
The EU stood silent when the first pro-russian insurgencies rose up in ukraine, stood silent when crimea was annexed, did nothing with the Belarussian issue and still pretends that Russia is our best financial partner when it comes to natural resources
Fucking pog let's go
How sad, please tell me more about how Nato is a bad thing
Pretty sure they won't deliver on those nuclear strikes though
Nothing to worry about in here
You are an American state already !!11
1111
1+!!  /s
This is a very rational answer thank you but I cannot agree with looking at it from this point of view
Dismissing Ukraine as not our problem despite the fact it is sitting to our right should be enough of our concern
Russia is an expansionist oligarchy that does not wish sustain any value of liberty
I'd like to think that our principles of freedom would stand out over quick greed for resources
Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim
Well, they can't consider throwing nukes unless they want to get nuked back
It's really simple and not worth it
Nukes scare no one
Chill
The only way a war would happen between these countries, and Helsninki blasted out of existence, it would be because Russia started it
They have always been the aggressor
They are considered an aggressor state
A regional bully
NATO exists because of THEM, not something else
I'm sorry Poland, you up there roasting one single piece of meat at a time on the fire

I really mean it, no sarcasm or malice intended
At least you didn't vote for lies on a bus, blue passports or some other irrelevant bullshit
If you honestly believe Britain is better off on its own, that's a legitimate reason
In my view, an ever-closer union sounds great, and i fail to see what's so awful about it, unless you're nostalgic about the glorious imperial past and a nationalistic arrogance, but oh well, to each his own
That
actually makes an awful lot of sense
All of it
To be perfectly candid, i still resent it on a personal level a bit, because i would have rather had the UK in it with us too
Feels a bit like a betrayal, like it's a statement on how the UK is better than the rest of us, and unlike the rest of us, it's better off alone
But as far as your arguments go, i really can't argue with any of them
In the end, you're probably right, further integration would have been next to impossible for the UK, and it's better to cut off ties now seeing how that's the direction that the rest of us are going, rather than dragging it out and making it more strained and painful for everybody
I never thought of it that way
You're also echoing my thoughts about the fiscal union, for the record
Also, Germany's our California
You could have been Texas
Just like Texas, we could have pretended that you can secede whenever you want, as an urban myth
The attitudes towards the EU really vary across it
Here in Romania, it's still very popular
You have to understand, this was truly a national goal for us
In 1995, every single one of our parliamentary parties signed a joint declaration proclaiming EU integration to be a national goal
Every party, even the far-right
To us, on some level it represents how we finally chose our path with Europe, and broke away from our Iron Curtain past
There's dissent and some eurosceptics now, of course, but overall we're still solidly pro-EU
By the time we joined, we had millions of emigrants in the West, it made it easier to connect with them, to visit them, and so on
Also, we mostly welcome EU oversight
We're distrustful of our own government ( for good reasons ), so having the extra EU overhead is a good thing, it's a check on corruption and incompetence
EU funded projects are seen far better and more competent than our own government's projects
I honestly think it's also a generational thing
Younger people feel more attached to the EU as they grew up with it present everywhere
Older people don't have as big of a connection to it, because the EU only started gaining traction in the last few decades
This was pretty obvious in the UK referendum as well
Younger people might have gotten EU scholarships, EU train tickets for the youth, EU-funded classes or trips, might have seen it on building projects, might have met people through Erasmus
Basically, younger people are more inclined to have had the EU as a part of their life
Anyway, basically, i feel betrayed by the UK as a european, not as a romanian
As a romanian, we've had backlash before, from other EU countries too
It's only natural, i think, i for one never take it personally
Of course rotten apples emigrated to the west as well, and of course they made headlines, what can you do
See, a european identity was engrained in me growing up
We weren't just a forgotten shitty poor country at the edge of Europe, the EU represented us too on the world stage
We had rights, we had a voice in it just like the other members, we had a global reputation
Let's face it, in your analogy, we're Alabama
Of course we're fiercely alabamian and proud of it, but we're also grateful for having the entire federation representing us and being in this with us
Still don't understand why it took so long for this to happen
3 years wasted for both the EU and UK
Unless
I had a coworker (of German descent) whose aunt kept some grain bags with the eagle and swastika, since WWII
She just turned them inside out and used them to store grain, corn, etc
It's incredible she dared to keep something like that during Communist times
This is ripe for memeing
If the EU justifies itself as being reactive, then this is a stand in weakness, not ~~prominence~~ proactiveness
The whole ”united in diversity” crumbles (some to say that it already does)
I laughed about this with an old German guy
He said that in Germany, they don't like to expose their houses, but while they travel abroad, they love to use street view

The US thinks that the way to fix the salmonella problem is to clean the chicken at the end of the process
The EU thinks that the way to fix the salmonella problem is to have cleaner environments in which to raise the chicken

Good bye Poland :( but wait, my country is doing right now the same thing :(
and we here in Romania are like
hold our beer
It is almost the exact same thing in Romania, and old people eat that shit up
Goodbye Poland
See you soon
Stay strong Poland, these corrupt politicians have gone mad, here in Romania too the same thing is happening, laws are being changed to end the independence of the justice system, our corrupt, like yours, want to avoid jail so they want to end the rule of law
We are protesting and I know so are you, let us hope we will all save our freedom, the opposite of the rule of law is dictatorship
Reminds me of our state media here in Romania, in a way, just less subtle, I guess Edit: "more" changed to "less"
I think what we're doing is worse
They only want to control the justice system
In addition to that, we're also making corruption legal
it is the main public tv station
the polish BBC
This is getting really serious in Romania as well
They started with the same crap of modifying judicial procedures and with anti-Eu propaganda (although not to the scale that your picture suggests)
We're headed towards an Article 7 of our own pretty soon
Couple that with the fact that the core EU has been talking about 2-speed Europe for a while and I can only conclude that EU founders are seriously considering a split within the EU
There may be no advantage in keeping corrupt EE nations in the block
you should look over the fence
in Romania after they saw the Polish example, they did not stopped to the magistrate statute, basically what is changed in Poland but went directly to the main penal laws and started butchering them so that it would be impossible to properly prosecute corruption charges, economic charges and others assimilated
it is much worse than Poland
yes but its coverage is national and it is a very important tv
In Romania's case I think most of the population does know better, the problem was that at the last elections only 39% of the eligible voters went to the polls
Out of those, 40% voted for the jerks who are now in power
That means that around 20% of the eligible voters actually voted for them
Which is quite low
Out of those 20%, a big chunk are poor and old
When you're poor you don't really give a fuck anymore and you accept any kind of quick cash promises (like pension raises) they make
As for fighting, we have been fighting
There were a lot of protests this past year
We had a max of 600K people at one time
That's out of a population of 19M. We have a great opposition party in the parliament which is making life hard for the crooks by making every single discussion that goes on behind closed doors in the parliament public
Students are protesting, judicial employees are protesting
But the fuckers keep on voting those crazy laws
It feels like the only option left is to break down the doors of parliament and drag them out of there
not enough apparently
No, you are wrong
Soros is to blame for everything wrong in Romania
At least that's what our TV says
Soros pays 25$ for adults, 15$ for children and $5 for pets that come to anti-government protests
Really, that's what they claimed and many believed it
looks like an empty cave

I was wondering why this is not a thing yet, tons of plastic waste thrown when you can refill
I always buy the biggest item which is expensive at first but at long term is actually cheaper and always wondered, why not they make a refill bottle instead
you go with your empty bottle, press the button and pay for Liter
This would be cheaper and eco-friendly
Press Freedom in the EU 2020
[rankings ] for all countries
[source]
x doubt
I don't know how the amount of corruption in the press means that the press doesn't have freedom
I went to the [page] about Romania and sure i agree with most of the stuff there but then they don't cite any sources or show any examples on any of the allegations that actually pertains to freedom of the press like the GDPR abuse, and the criminalisation of insulting the leaders
Plus they allege some bullshit about nationalist discourse against minorities which has no link to freedom of the press
And for some reason you have to scroll through text instead of it being displayed in full, really bad design
For all the people asking how is this decided, check [this] it explains the situation for each country
Didn't expect rank 48
Didnt  knew romania was doing so badly
It always seems like the press has a bit too much  freedom here
Now portugal can into nordic
[here] are the rankings for all countries if anyone's interested
I can totally feel you, it's scary
USA can into eastern europe
pro: they're now eastern european bros
How are the protests going
I've clicked on their site to check what they say in detail about my country and they didn't cite any sources, it just seems like the writer's opinion about every country
Really disappointed in something claiming to be the reporter version of something as prestigious as Doctors without Borders
Journalism is dead
I remember norway is first place
I posted two comments with all the countries' rankings somewhere here
Yep
It's Norway, it's not a EU member
I have posted the [stats for the whole world] a lot in these comments, I couldn't find a map that included the 2020 data for all of europe
I have included the source in the comments, but I guess it got buried
[Here]
Yep, they're 154th
[this]
Norway
Uk is [35th]
I didn't make the map
I've been responding to a lot of comments with [this] which is the ranking of all countries
[Here]
Every countries' situation is explained [here ]
Yes, Norway is 1st
[Here's ] the ranking for all countries

You can find it [here]
I didn't make the map
[Here] are all the rankings

Also, I think they base it on more current stuff than the financial crisis

I didn't say europe tho
there are 14 countries in the green, 33 in the yellow and 63 in the orange, I have no idea based on which criteria

It's Bastille Day today too
that's a great idea, we should start doing that too
I think it's because it's made by the EU parliament

Stop with these maps, I told you already, I'm not going anywhere
leaving home at 30 ? seems way late if you ask me
While I agree with you completely, I think it's a combination of more factors
For example, I'm 35 and still registered at my mom's place, even though I own my own place
I simply didn't feel a need to change my ID card
When it will expire in ~5 years, that's when I'll officially moving out
But also, I moved out of my parents house when I was 30
No reason to do it sooner, my then gf, current wife, was already staying with me for a few years, so why pay rent somewhere and waste that money when we could simply live there and save for our own place
And there are also the cultural reasons, people in Eastern and Southern Europe tend to be a lot closer with their extended families than our counterparts in the West
So, yes, the map is wrong, you can't take 2 numbers and compare them, but it is also right and should at least give you an idea
I left at 22
worked full time since 19
would’ve left at 18 but I had university in the same town, so no point in paying rent; but after that I left for another town
Anyway, the first 2 years I also lived with my bro and 2 friends in a 4 bedroom apartment, so I don’t see that as bad
it was fun
anyway I’m not judging due to financial situation or whatever, I’m more thinking “if you’re 25 not working, not having a plan and living with parents, that’s bad”
Oh hell yeah, I like these kind of posts
Even though the world would be a better place if we didn't have reasons to protest

Romanian here: I bet it's nice to live in a region with no devastating earthquakes
*Devastating earthquakes*
The day before I was born 40 years ago, a 1 minute 7
4 quake leveled 3/4s of old Bucharest
The frequency with with such events occur is about 30-35 years, so we're at least 5 years overdue for another big one
Problem is, before the end of the 19th, beginning of 20th century, Romania's capital was little more than muddy huts and some 1-2 storey old boyars mansions, so the effects weren't as hardcore
When the next one hits, the losses are estimated to be in the tens of billions of euros and the city will probably be all but abandoned
If you have a still standing 2000-year old Roman aqueduct, you're not in an extremely active seismic zone
All I'm saying is count your blessing

What's the matter with this guy
I remember reading about him but what did he do exactly
Why was it necessary to fake his death

So we got more land now
This is a very interesting map
TIL Norway has a larger area than Poland
Huh
Also, as a romanian, i gotta say, at least now we're close to the other Romance languages
not bad
If you count how many Romanians work in Germany this can be reality in a few generations

Highly skeptical of this sort of map if it's all based on GDP
Say you have a French bank based in Paris that has activities and big profits all over France, but all of it is counted only towards the GDP of Paris
I'm pretty sure that sums up pretty much the whole map
It's basically "Let's color Europe based on how many big companies are based on each region
Italy looks like the Romanian flag :D
screw this graph
Bet it was made by a westerner
We'll see in a few years
Bucharest is listed as "more developed"? This is just wrong, they had water problems and all sorts since forever, there are other cities in Romania which are more clean and handled much better

Floating houses immune to rising sea levels in the Ijburg section of Amsterdam
They put the heavier parts on the home, like the kitchens and bathrooms, on the bottom floor to help maintain stability and balance
The plumbing connections are all flexible so that the houses can move with the wind and tide
But how will humanity ever adapt if the sea level rises by half a meter in one hundred fucking years
Oh man, so many claims, so little evidence
Last time we had a “housing issue” it was caused by the fact that banks knew governments would bail them out so they could afford to act completely irresponsible
So far, all climate predictions have proven to be nothing but fear-mongering and we have no reason to believe this time is different
And if the climate changes as much as they claim, why the hell would migrants come to Europe
And yes, millions of people might lose their houses, in a span of one hundred years
you do realize that’s a very long time, right

... that are to our liking
Cyprus right now has way better economy than back then
The dude came back in 1974 and the country is doing quite well
Cypriots should just remember the past and go on as united since they have way better economy than both Turkey and Greece(Cyprus has 30000$ GDP/capita)
I don't know if Northern Cyprus is administrating themselves that area since only Turkey recognizes the country so from my point of view Northern Cyprus didn't gain independence just yet until proven otherwise
Neither of those things should matter in a pandemic
what the fuck
No one single number is the purveyor of all truth
Hospitalizations and deaths overlook a bunch of cases, too
It ignores mild cases
It ignores silent cases
Once you have enough capacity to satisfy most demand in terms of testing, then testing becomes very relevant to measuring the actual spread of the virus
> But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections
Or, in the good ole' US of A's case, you test more so you can bill the insurance company a cool million dollars
Give some to the poor fucks being ruled by middle school level politicians
Unrelated: How did you guys manage to get the common people to vote for people who are not openly imbeciles
Oh yeah forgot that you have a functioning educational system
Talking politics is a past time everywhere I think, but it's one thing to argue about climate policies and another thing to argue to vote for the guy who throws 2l of sunflower oil and 1kg of flour or the one who gives you a nice electoral bucket and cap
Hah
We had one of these last year at our presedential elections too
Similar story as well: the sitting president called some hand-picked journalists to ask questions and the other candidate held a separate AMA session with other journalists
Both were called "debates".
Such is politics in Eastern Europe
Yeah, about that
I have to concur
Based on the attributions that presidents have in Poland it really isn't a bad idea
Since the most important attribution of the president is denying unconstitutional laws from what I've gathered from this thread then it'll mean a double filter for the parliament regarding laws

The majestic Austrian Alps showing off their layers
The Central Eastern Alps (German: Zentralalpen or Zentrale Ostalpen), also referred to as Austrian Central Alps (Österreichische Zentralalpen) or just Central Alps comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia
The term "Central Alps" is very common in the Geography of Austria as one of the seven major landscape regions of the country
The Central Alps form the eastern part of the Alpine divide, its central chain of mountains, as well as those ranges that extend or accompany it to the north and south
The highest mountain in the Austrian Alps (and the highest in Austria) is [Grossglockner] at 3,798 metres

I don't like that utilitarian take on personal liberty
Outlawing being a moron is a slippery slope, no matter how few cases it applies to at first
I know we're not talking about state censorship here, but it sounds like you're toying with the idea
In your previous message you were passing blame to all Serbs
And you explained how it's fully justified
That's just wrong man
You are right, in that we need to admit our mistakes and learn from them
But try to avoid broad generalizations like that
Remember that's exactly what the perpetrators of genocides do
No, there are people who genuinely believe that the holocaust/armenian genocide/srebrenica are not real or are exaggerated
That's not promoting genocide anymore than 'fire can't melt steel beams' is promoting terrorism
You won't change any Serb's mind by being hostile towards them with that kind of sweeping generalizations
Like Gandhi said - be the change you want to see in the world

Would like to see one of when did it become illegal
In Romania it was actually 2001
Before that it was still illegal if it was “in public” or “causing public outrage” and the latter wouldn’t have been difficult to conjure up
Let's not forget that it has been legal in Romania too until communism took over:)

Hospital room in Romania , 2018
Timisoara is also one of the more prosperous cities of Romania
WTF are those guys doing over there
[Found another picture from the same place]
Victor Babes Hospital for infectious diseases , Timisoara , Romania
This is not a singular case
2018 in a different romanian hospital, same [story]
This is because of the 'Deep State' or 'Parallel State' in Romania
The ruling party has nothing to do with this
Fuck, this is in my city
It's ok
The hospital manager said the pictures were taken "from the worst possible angle". Case solved
You know what the most embarrassing thing about this picture is
You look at this picture and imagine what kind of primitive poverty ridden shithole could surround such a hospital
The irony is that this hospital is located in Timisoara, the second richest city in Romania after Bucharest, soon to be European Capital of Culture
It's a city that probably has a higher concentration of brand new Audis, BMWs and Mercedes than many large German cities
It's a city where people come from all over Europe for dental work (in private clinics of course), a city where arabs from rich families pay tens of thousands of euros per year to study medicine
It's a city where you can hear sums of money like 100,000 euros thrown around like they're talking about spare change
Just yesterday I saw the iPhone X for sale at the fucking supermarket
There are private clinics with state of the art MRI and CT machines running 24/7 giving scans to people from all over the country
The problem is that there is a huge discrepancy between the private and state sector in Timisoara
Not only is Timisoara a victim of Romania's highly centralized system which sucks money from the few developed region and pours it into welfare benefits for people who are 40-50 and never worked a single day in their entire lives (despite being perfectly able to work) but the local authorities aren't any better either
Almost everything that is the responsibility of the local administration is either falling apart and whatever is done is either of low quality, bad design or too expensive (and usually it's all three combined)
You can essentially find half a million euros mansions on unpaved streets
Many people would prefer prison over hospital in Romania
Yup, that place is pretty bad
I'm a medicine student in Timisoara, so I've been there once and it really was kinda scary to see the conditions those people are in
It's probably the worst hospital in Timisoara in terms of conditions, I have to agree
I have classes at several other hospitals in Timisoara and they look much better, pretty modern too
This one is a basically a ghetto
Nice repost
You can have the TV remote for 1 euro/hour
I went to visit last summer and my grandma was in the hospital two years ago for a mild blood clot in her brain
My aunt was there to take care of her and told me that the service is garbage, unless you pay a bribe and then they take care of you like they're supposed to in the first place
Also heard on ProTV a number of times that people buy their degrees and don't study for it
And not just for medicine, but driving and other things that require you to be licensed or certified
It's no wonder there's protests nearly all year long now in Romania
The corruption is laughably obvious and in your face that it feels like I'm on /r/nottheonion
And last year when I went to Romania, at the small airport in Timisoara, they had these brochures on how to stop corruption and report it
I thought that was really cute
I feel like there's gonna be another violent revolution and the corrupt assholes who die from it deserve it
The title implies all hospital rooms in Romania are like this one, which is obviously not true
This is most likely taken in a small under financed hospital in some small town
Edit: Idiots downvoting
Appalling
That said you have to love all the Americans from /r/all coming over to make fun of universal healthcare
In Romanian hospitals, poor people die because conditions in the "free" option are poor and they can't afford private clinics
In American hospitals, poor people die because
oh wait, they die out on the curb because they won't get any healthcare if their bank account isn't fat enough
I guess they should've picked themselves up by their bootstraps before they got sick
Stupid poor people
and an empty wallet .
> WTF are those guys doing over there
They are doing the same as the rest of the country: stealing from public funds
Its literally such a joke of a hospital
but Robu doesnt give a fuck :(
Gotta post that MRSA meme while you can
[Mirror cause it took a while to load for me and in case of hug of death]
It is better than this one, this one is quite shocking for Romanians too
You get nice renovated hospitals next to some that were not renovated in a loooong time (think 70s)
It is the case of Ob-Gyn maternity hospital in my city
When my wife had to go to a procedure she was hospitalized in the old building
Dark, quite messy looking (not as extreme as this post), rude personnel who was clearly affected by their environment
Two years ago when she had to deliver our baby, she was in another building next to it
Clean, modern, even the staff was nicer (I still think the environment someone works in affects them in a great way), everything sterilized
But that part of the hospital was renovated 5 years ago
But I would overall rate the care received there and the facility a 7/10 or even 8/10
But bribing is a whole other story and change in that direction is painfully slow as you have to change mentalities (unfortunately, not just of the staff but of patients as well)
Because that hospital is in the middle of a renovation
This pic was taken in one of the rooms which have been renovated already
You are right in many aspects
Ah, you sweet Yankee child
What do you know of corruption
Of the commie regime, the censorship, the intellectual void
You blame the public for the current state of affairs, but this society is also the vector of something else
Of years of fear and survival by stealing from the very state that took everything
These were the glorious commie years
They produced people in a constant state of worry, for which survival is more important than principles or ideology
They became party members, they applauded at rallies, they lived in fear of the secret service
They had to get by, had to feed their families and make it to tomorrow
So a grocery shop employee would steal some meat products and give to a doctor, or a teacher, or a city hall employee, so they'd get looked at, or tutored, or get approval for something or other
They would teach their children to do the same, and on it went, for more than 50 years
You see, it's not easy caring for others, or for things greater than yourself, when you're on the brink yourself
People that stay in hospitals like the one in the picture, they live in abject poverty
If they weren't poor, they wouldn't be there
They worry about themselves, first and foremost, not about the dog shit in the street
It is about corruption because the corruption of the system results in the corruption of the individual as well
Our parents and grandparents waited for the Americans to come save them from the commies, and in the end it was their kids that went out and got shot and got rid of some of the commies
Our parents would listen to Radio Free Europe quietly, so neighbors won't hear them and rat them out to the secret service, that would erase them from existence
Our parents endured an unjust and deeply corrupted regime for decades and were a part of it
They are corrupted as well
Now they're in their golden years, trying to make it to tomorrow on a pension that barely covers basic needs
So they vote the most corrupt party, hoping to get something out of it
Meanwhile, the young and able leave the country because they have no future here
Those that remain are too busy worrying about tomorrow to care about anything else
You say it's apathy and learned helplessness, i say it's despair and hopelessness
Even so, some people find the strength to protest, to go out there in the cold and ask for change
What else would you have them do
Set Bucharest ablaze and publicly decapitate the ruling party members
I'd love that, but I don't think our EU friends would
Let's say you want to do something about it
Let's say you grab a bucket of white paint and try to make a difference
First, the hospital director would tell you "are you implying that we're incompetent
you think you're better than us
we don't need you
get the fuck outta here
", because big corrupt assholes have big corrupt egos
Then the hospital security would tell you you're not allowed in the premises except on visiting hours, and if you try to paint the wall, they'll call the cops to arrest you for vandalism
Your own Doug Stanhope said in a show of his something like "give a man a fish, you feed him for a day
But teach a man to fish
then he has to get a fishing permit, and proper fishing tools and he ends up owing to some bank". In our scenario, you might just end up getting spat on by patients for trying to do something good
It wouldn't be the first time this happened in Romania
Every Romanian remembers the Mineriada
The Romanian society may be sick, but let's not pass the buck just yet
The ruling party, the ministers, the administrators, they're to blame, first and foremost, for not doing their fucking jobs
I'm just an average joe, i do what i can, when i can
I'm not a paragon of charity or whatever
But when it's time to do my job, i do it
Those that were elected and they're not doing their jobs, they're to blame
That the society is deeply flawed and doesn't punish them is inconsequential
Can we change the state of the country
Yes, of course
Should we
Most certainly
But are we the ones elected and hired to do so
Nope
We do what we can, though, knowing that it could be all for naught
We do it because we have no choice
It's either that, or be everything you're portraying in your post
One last thing, people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
You say "as an American living in Romania", like you have some kind of evolved outlook on things
Please don't forget Trump got elected there, just like PSD got elected here
Please don't forget you have places that look like warzones as well, like Detroit, Cleveland, Michigan
Please don't forget lobbying is pretty much corruption in the open
We're not that different, as far as societies go
Not really
Your free and brave can be just as shit, just as corrupted, just as incompetent as our glorious leaders
Your society just as apathetic and ignorant as ours
And you have great individuals and good, warm peoples, just like us
There's shit and roses everywhere in this world
Please, don't forget
This is a great comment
I think you've hit the nail in the head
[Pic of the parking lot
That Porsche on the left allegedly belongs to the manager
>Are there any dead people in the bathroom
Yes, there are
Maybe not so extreme
But it's really really bad
When my grandma was hospitalized for a stroke there were cockroaches in the saloon and the toilet wasn't functional
Well maybe because it was a private hospital
And yes you can't judge every hospital based on just one picture but in this case it is kind of true
Indeed there are some hospitals in the big cities that are renovated and look decent but those are few
The worst part is that churches look better than the hospitals and are a lot more of those
And yes doctors are douchebags
That's really besides the point, of course the top class hospitals in Romania look just like Western hospitals
The difference is the West doesn't have hospitals that look like this
It's not Europe's problem to fix every single thing wrong in this country
At the current state of the health system , I don't think it's even possible
Because even if you helped us, the politicians would either steal the money or use them to build more churches
I can say the same about Poland can’t I?
It's in Timisoara
The third most populated city in Romania
Corruption
Hospitals and medical universities are basically feudal estates
I am all for increased and progressive taxation, for sure our country needs it
But with our current situation, with how much corruption there is in our administration, I'm not sure how much the extra funds would help
Well what did you expect
it says *for* infectious diseases not *against*.
The moment the parallel state pulls a "coup" it is going to be 1989 all over again
This is why I never leave my apartment
What hospital
Now you made me curious
Im pretty sure it's a small underfinanced hospital as I assumed
I went to  the main hospital in Baia Mare, so far smaller than Timisoara, and it looked pretty good
My father went to the main Cardio Hospital in Timisoara and it also looked good at that time
So your picture is obviously not the regular situation and you know it
They probably steal just *some* of the public funds in other parts of the world
In Romania they steal all the public funds
I believe it's mostly an isolated incident, it's shocking to Romanians too
But I don't think it's the only one
The healthcare system is the worst part of this country imo
Things improved since we joined the EU 11 years ago , aspects of every day life , infrastructure
But hospitals remained the same since 1989 , it's the biggest stain of this country , maybe alongside the situation of the orphanages
> Romania has flaws, but America as we know it may be terminal
You do realize that's a similar attitude to that of our youth, right
"Country X may have flaws, but Romania is terminal". So you cut and run, but somehow think you have what it takes to advise us what to do
Did all those things you've said worked for USA
> I wrote the post I did in defense of the country
Didn't seem so to me
Nonetheless, Romania doesn't need defending, nor attacking for that matter
Things are what they are, and that's all there is to it
I wasn't defending Romania, i was just drawing a line between points in history that got us where we are now
> When elections come, where are the hoards of volunteers giving away free food and pamphlets in the villages, trying to influence rural and elderly voters
There already are hordes of "volunteers", but they belong to the PSD
Why should we do the same
Or, better yet, why do it when there's elections, why not now
Because we need their votes
Enough to compromise our own principles, by acting like those fucking greedy and corrupt assholes do
Because, what, our cause is just so the end justifies the means
You're kidding, right
> You have more power than you know
You have less than you think
You gotta be realistic about these things
There's only so much one person can do, without going Lee Harvey Oswald on their asses
Which, as i said before, is kind of frowned upon in these parts
> Step one - the one you can start with right now - is to put a name and face on the problem
We do have a name, and a face, complete with moustachio
What's step two
Wait in a warehouse with a rifle
Don't you get it that it's pointless, that it doesn't make a true difference
> Specific and, importantly, small
And then plan, and organize, and act in a logical way that will actually, directly fix the problem
Then you'll see people start to overcome decades of helplessness
Thanks, real good advice
Maybe you should heed your own advice and apply it to USA
See how that works out
"Deep systemic barriers" ain't got shit on "deep, systemic corruption". I'm sorry, but from down here in the mud, where i'm standing, it seems to me that you, from your high horse, don't get to advise me on how to act in order to save my country
Because if you would have an idea about how to do it, you'd do it for the land of the free and home of the brave
But you didn't. You cut your losses and moved away
Not me, you see
I've been here since i was born and i'm not gonna leave just because the going gets rough
I fight, but i fight my own way
It's Victor Babes hospital for treating infectious diseases
It is, but in various degrees
In some countries, places of business, government institutions, you cannot abstain from taking bribes, your colleagues and bosses will pressure you into doing it
And yet they weren't. I wonder why
Hmm
Maybe because it benefited the older members too
I don't think any decisions at this level are made out of the goodness of their hearts
Business and political interests decided this move
Muhahahahahahah
Bulgaria at least is in the same boat
I think Croatia, possibly Lithuania or Latvia
We're not former soviet, the USSR ended at our eastern border
We were communist though
The current government is retarded
Every seemingly good thing that they do is so they have fuel for the next election
We also have tax evasion, the flat tax rate doesn't magically prevent it
It's not some big metropolis
It has it's nice areas, but still it's just a city with a population of 300k. There is some nice historical architecture
What did you visit in Romania
I assumed that you're talking about the picture and wanted to point out that is consistent with the name
I've seen it on tv meanwhile
Still an exception not a rule
Yeah the infrastructure is bad, no doubt about that
One thing Romania shines at compared to Germany I would say is nature, a lot more untouched wilderness in Romania, and also most rural areas still keep some of the traditions of old times, if you're into that you should definitely check it out
We have lots of monasteries and villages where you could get a taste of what life was like in Europe 100 years ago
The only downside is that infrastructure sucks and the people are quite poor, which is probably why we managed to preserve some of the traditions in the first place
If we would manage to preserve these traditions and way of life while bringing good infrastructure and economic development to those areas I think it would be quite a hit, lots of cool things to see and experience if you're into the whole traditional stuff
Maybe
There's also creating moral equivalency
I think they call that a Soviet moment

The Vienna Philarmonic Concert posted on youtube gets a Copyright strike
from my knowledge the rights owner is Eurovision/ORF, not SME
Yet in Romania the public literally wants us killed
Also other good guides: History books, Wikipedia, or EU4
I always remembered it in school as the one who looks like a miniature version of Africa
For my geography exam I had to name all the European countries and their capitalis, I did well with  the Balkans, but when it came to the Baltics I had problems with Lithuania and Latvia, not to mention that in Romanian Latvia is Letonia, I was so confused
"Sweden"
This happened last time we learned about Northern Europe at school
Aerial shot of Mount Vesuvius, 9 km east of Naples, Italy
Vesuvius and Etna are the most famous volcanoes in Europe
Mount Vesuvius' eruption from AD 79 led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum
Ah shit, here we go again
Based on the traditional costumes they are somewhere from the southern part of the country, in what was once Wallachia
PS: People on Reddit are really obsessed with interpreting the one millisecond face mimic of the bride
Sad
Now that the part of why she seems sad has been clarified, regarding the flowers:
In Romania it's not uncommon for people to keep the flowers oriented downward like this
In fact, I would say it's the standard way how people hold them
Only when giving the flowers to someone is it necessary to turn them around
Stop saying that the bride looks sad lmao did you guys ever been to an orthodox wedding ceremony
We take it pretty seriously
I call BS
I am from Romania and 99,99% of weddings are just a big pile of sh\*t with sh\*tty musics, sh\*tty peoples and sh\*tty traditions
Stop spreading bullshit
Just because a couple decides to make a ' traditional wedding' doesn't that mean is a common thing in Romania
It is a growing trend in Romania
If you google "nunta traditionala" (traditional wedding) you will see variations from full traditional clothing for the groom and bride, folk inspired elements on more conventional wedding attire, all the guests wearing traditional clothing, etc
Anyway this is happening at less than 10% of the weddings
(My wife is a wedding planner so I have seen all the variations possible)
Traditional inspired clothing
While groom's may very well be genuine , I don't know of any traditional  woman clothing (bride or not) with a such long dress
> How common it is to marry in traditional clothing
Romanian here, this is the first time I see it
At first I thought that OP confused Romania with Moldova
never saw it before and i have participated to more than 20 weddings
Very uncommon
Considering all it takes to get ready for a wedding, and the fact that an hour-long ceremony is a short one, she probably didn't get to eat anything and is focusing on not fainting
Yea what the heck is up with the comments
Have these people ever been in a church
It's meant to be a spiritual place, it would be considered weird or even rude if they smiled, like they are mocking the ceremony
They get them during the ceremony (and return them at the end)
Maybe the pic was taken before that part of ceremony
After certain point of ceremony only . The picture may be during first part
It's becoming more popular which I think is a nice change from the boring suit and white dress
where does it say it's common
You are thinking of gypsies
Romanians are not gypsies
Stop confusing Romanian with Roma or Romani, the new names for gypsies
> those living in caravans in France are french gypsies, some 500
000 people which are treated by the french law as second-class citizens - les gens du voyage
Those are french gypsies
Usually it works like this in France: Someone does good, he is 200% french pride
Someone does bad he is an immigrant, gypsy, call it it something else, but he is 200% not french
Racism at its finest
One hour is short
The catholic ones are 20-30 minutes tops
At least here
Who is Larry David and where can I find him
participated at orthodox wedding this summer, less than 30 mins
*then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less

I'd like to imagine that at first the orléaniste wrote "Royal square" and then later came Louis and added his name so they didn't have to like carve another name for the place
They're thinking ahead you never know when it's time for another revolution so might as well not vandalise the building
Not trying to be racist, but is this man a gypsy or why is he so dark
He looks more Northern African or Middle Eastern than Albanian to me
But we face a pretty big brain drain as most of our students go work in other European countries
Keep in mind that the 1980s were terrible for us, the economy was very bad, living standards plummeted, industry suffered from lack of investment and was mostly uncompetitive, we started the 90s from a much lower point than Poland, Czechia etc
The 60s and 70s were far better in this regard
Also one more thing to keep in mind is that the 90s were characterised by a huge informal economy that exists even today but to a much smaller scale, though still higher than most countries in Europe
Everyone was avoiding taxes which I'm guessing was something completely alien to most
Lots of trafficking rings in cigarettes, alcohol, oil products, massive trafficking to embargo hit Serbia etc
Consumer goods were being imported on a massive scale and almost all informally
However we could have done much better
This whole country is underdeveloped
There are a ton of areas which would be fantastic to exploit, tourism, resources, etc but no one is doing anything
The entire Danube keys is a great example
Massive truck traffic from the Balkans and Turkey going to the west, naval shipyards, some of the largest hydroelectric power plants in Europe, absolutely stunning scenery, ancient ruins, beautiful roads, hiking trails etc, and its mostly unchanged from the 90s. Such a shame
And yet some romanians still miss socialism :(
Still not the best in Europe but you can't ask much from a former communist nation
shrek69_420
Romania also started to get people from poorer countries
In Timisoara I see everytime in city centre or at Iulius Mall, people from India, Vietnam and so on
Huge issue not recognized enough
We are basically paying to train doctors, engineers etc and the west gets them for the price of a low cost airplane ticket
Do you have some data to support that claim or is just a feeling
You are welcome anytime
Stay safe and after this pandemic go ahead and pay us a visit
We have a little of everything haha
Impossible to do, numbers are too unreliable
They were mostly made up BS
However I can tell you from my family's experience that starting from around 62-63 living standards improved dramatically
Things were alright until 79-80 then it started going downhill fast
IT's not bad
Real estate prices are some of the lowest in the EU compared to how much people earn, cost of living also
You're not despised, just pitied
Yup
We're still not growing fast enough
We need growth rates of over 5% and we didn't manage to sustain that for long stretches
Communism is the very definition of failure
Edit: Looks like nobody got the liberty prime reference
I do stand by this though, communism is cancer
Just no
Ask your parents or other people who had to raise kids in the 90s.
> is still the same
thats a lie
Maybe is lower than what these numbers might make you think (debatable) but saying it hasn't improved considerably since '90s is a blatant lie
ah yes the good old inferiority complex don't you just love how we are the worst country in the world and we haven't changed a single bit and if we did it does not matter because i do not like it when i see something positive about my country
We had this at my uni as well, I think we were 1st or 2nd nationality in CS
Yup
In all Italian, Spanish, German and British city I can almost guarantee theres at least a Romanian
Go around your city and you'll be convinced
> without the locals profiting at any point
the locals profit from the wages they get from the extranational companies that open offices in romania
IT workers in bucharest earn approx
2x the median wage of romania
i personally know people who earned 2000 euros per month in 2008, at a time when it was basically an unthinkable amount of money to earn every month
In before westerners coming to explain how we didn't have real communism and must try it again
the name
Arguing with tankies is exhausting, I told one to move to North Korea and he was like "why would I want to move there
". Communism is great apparently but only for others
The life style definitely changed
I remember McDonald being a luxury I could afford maybe twice per year
A holiday abroad was only for the well off, a holiday in Bali for the insanely wealthy
Having a car when you got married considered a huge thing
Coca Cola was fancy, TEC was the norm, and because we could buy TEC every other day we considered ourselves lucky
It was definitely way way worse
my town is not big, it has about 27k people
unlike 12 years ago, yes
we have sewage systems now
the schools are way better than they were before, even the roads have improved a lot, everyone i know has a better life and bigger salaries
the country overall has improved
you can't just get the most unheard of poor village and set it as the example because it does not represent everything
It's not
Free people need free markets
There is no other way
yea pretty rare
> Countries like Croatia and Romania benefit massiveley from expats sending money to their families back home, though
I think there are different categories of people - those educated and those who do physical work
The first category tend to move abroad with their family and make a life there, the others take jobs  and  stay for  a  few years and  return home or send money home to  family
We don't get these financial transfers from the educated part of our immigration, it's the other part
Well curva is also a word in romanian did they say something else
I think it’s about the same in Romania, there used to be 23 mil
Romanians living in the country, now there’s like 16-18 mil
Germany is really bad at this
It is so annoying and hard when you try to find a photo of a location
I can see my neighbourhood only from above
Yeah, some people are afraid to expose their properties
But technology in Germany is in general far behind than in other countries
It is like they have allergy on it
For official documents, they still use the post

I can't put both Romania and Germany like in AskEurope
Yes, but they are spying themselves, thank you very much, not letting Americans do it however they like
It is such a pity, considering the resources Germany has

I don't think Russia, the US, or the UK give a fuck when the UN is upset with them

But then every four years they have a chance for another 7-1 against Brazil and they're world leaders
Jokes on you, we don't have highways
Me when I see someone use the metric system instead of the imperial system: I see you are a man of culture as well
Not so many motorways in Romania so it makes sense there is no limit for Ro
Can't have more than 100km/h limit if u don't 100km of highway 4head  smth
You can't have highway speed limit if you don't have highways
*This comment was made by the Romania gang*
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
Other countries : dont go with a  too high speed  on the streets
Germany: lmao,just floor it  as much as your car can
Romania is not accurate
Yes the speed limit is 130 but in reality is 140 since you don't get a ticket if you are only 10km/h over, you just get a warning so you can imagine that everyone whenever they see a speed limit they instinctively add 10km/h. Also the left lane on that highway usually moves at like 150/160
[If we can reach 130 on ours why can't they reach 80 on theirs
Salut
We’re building them so sloooow
And with triple the cost they are done in west-eu
I still hope that our kids will be able to actually use them

How does that convert to the Texas unit of measurement
About 17/64 quarters of a third of a hogshead per fortnight
It's pretty cool
It’s the same kind of hard on brexiters had
Nothing bizarre about it
Well think about it, us Europeans were humiliated by brexiters which had a smug and superior attitude about the whole thing
How can it not be satisfying for us to see Scotland doing to them what they did to us, while using their exact arguments of independence
It's labeled because a lot of people don't know how Scotland's flag looks like  it's just to help give more context
Why are people making such a big fuss
Yeah, I know why they chose to leave, a deep hatred of people like me, I’m Romanian, and while I never had the intention to live in the UK I did take that personally
I don’t think immigration would have ever went so far as to exceed 50% of the population, nothing like that happened in any EU nation, I think that’s just scaremongering
But regardless it is humiliating to me, I knew people who had moved in the UK, they all had decent jobs and were being nice people
Only that demographic decline happens just as much in Romania, our population is aging too and our wages are rising
I’m already being payed here just as much as I would be in the UK
The current rate of immigration will not be sustainable over the next four decades and if you knew anything about Romanians you would know that most of them do not plan on growing old in other countries, and are in fact using a lot of the money they make in other countries to build homes and businesses in Romania
And I can attest to being hated, I visited your country twice, as a tourist, spending money I had earned here, in Romania, but countless people in the UK aggressively asked me if I had come to take their benefits, how can I feel anything other than humiliated
We never treat foreigners like that, even when they come from Vietnam or Sri Lanka to work in Romania
I'm pretty sure in Moldova they also use 'pivă', heard a lot of Moldavians saying that word and I was confused as to what they mean by it; I thought it was the equivalent for the Romanian 'halbă', the glass you usually drink beer in but now it makes more sense
Oh, Hungary
**FIXED
Elections are organized in Russia, just to know who almost had a chance against Putin

Circumcised Christian here
The reason I got circumcised is totally absurd though: my godmother was Jewish and also happened to be a doctor, so she told my mom that she needs to do it because otherwise I will get infections, so she did it when I was like 5-6 year old with anesthesia
I can’t really complain, for me it’s been ok so far, I have no issues during sex, but of course, I cant make a comparison since I never had sex before it
Unless there is a medical reason for it, yeah, ban this shit, it’s useless

I take one more step it will the farthest away from home I've ever been
It's a powerful part of the American mythos, watering the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants, heroic citizens raising up against oppressive governments, all that good stuff
Never actually works that way since for all the bluster the US government is actually really good at bringing it's population around to it's way of thinking and has been so for a very, very long time

Hey, watch out
My name is Remus, and let me tell you, in Romania, or at least the South-West (Oltenia, and sometimes Ardeal) it's a quite common name
And it just rolls of the tongue
Romulus tho ? I barely knew some people called that, and even they would always get nicknamed something else (like Romica), Romulus just sounds shitty as a name, and that's why it will never be a popular, or at least common name through the ages
Remus, Marius, Flavius, Darius ? Cool names that just feel right
Even Julius works pretty well
But Romulus ? That's just bad
So take that
I’d say the date on this one is somewhat controversial

1 billions are gone, thats too much money
The same article was posted yesterday and it was critical towards the shameless news manipulation by the Dutch
Obviously it was downvoted
Now it's reposted, comments are highly critical towards Romania and lo and behold thousands of upvotes
Absolutely disgusting
I am disgusted and the saddest shit is that I am not surprised one bit
Yesterday I just found out we spend over 15 million euros on a single km of highway
Where on earth is all that money going is beyond me
But sadly, in the pockets of politicians that usually get voted by the braindead old farts of the country
I keep hearing about cases like this and I just cannot comprehend stealing that MUCH money, like sure I can imagine stealing a couple of tens of thousands here and there, but 800 MILLION
If someone told me "Here's 800 million, feel free to steal them", I literally have no idea how to do that
Hope some harsher laws will be imposed soon
Fuck all corruption
This is valid here as well for a LOT of things, but I guess no one cares about the Danube Delta enough to even bother to do that
Believe it or not, BER is completed and operational
Beg your pardon, your presence is on a whole other level of vomit-inducing disgust

A very hungry Putin
I love the fact that the kids can barely reach the light switch if they jump
WELL DONE
Well done, brothers
I remember that in a small town from the Romanian region of Moldova the mayor brought a [marching band to inaugurate a stop light]
To be honest, I don’t really understand how people keep voting the same people over and over again for important offices when those people are clearly corrupt and will use that power for their own gain and not for the people’s. I think this is the situation in both Romania and Moldova where we have corrupt politicians that use populist ways to keep their power
Edit: changed a but with when
To be fair I can understand why this can be a big deal
Ten years ago I started my first job in Romania installing security cameras
The first place I went was a recently renovated school in some shit hole remote village
Before the renovation, the school had no indoors toilets, just some latrines in the yard
The teachers said that since the renovation, the pupils just kept flushing the toilets all day because most of them never flushed a toilet before and were amazed by it
That shit really stuck with me
They slowly catching up with their big bro
I cant believe this is a big thing
this shit is starting to be sad at this point

TBH, the "houses" in Ireland and the UK are basically horizontal apartment blocks

Land reclamation around the former island of Urk, the Netherlands: the 1930s vs now
The fishing town on the island of Urk used to be completely surrounded by water until land reclamation projects in the beginning of the 20th century incorporated it into the Dutch mainland
Now part of the Noordoostpolder (North east polder) the community there is still very tight-knit
>Due to initial financial difficulties, construction of the polder did not begin until 1936
Construction of the dikes and the necessary pumping stations was disrupted during World War II during the 1940 German conquest of the Netherlands
The encircling dikes were both closed in December 1940, and the pumping stations started draining in early 1941
The Noordoostpolder was considered to be sufficiently drained in September 1942, and the developmental process was started for the 480 km² of new land
>“Land usage focused mostly on farming
Less fertile areas were designated to be planted as forest land
Land in the polders was state-owned during the entire developmental process
Several years after this was completed, the various plots were distributed among private parties, with priority given to the early pioneers who had been in the polder since the start
Later, farmers from all over the Netherlands became eligible for the remainder
Candidates were put through a selection process before receiving their own pieces of new land

Yup

>They didn't actually do anything significant for acknowledging their acts towards Congolese people
*they* ?? Who the fuck's *they* ? How are belgian people in the 21st century responsible for what leopold ii did in the 19th
Should I want an apology from the romans for their invasion of dacia
How is this normal thought
Winners get statues
See Stalin
Do they associate the name to the battleship the Nazis built and don't know who Bismark is and what he did or what
No, i don't think that if my grandfather stole something, that i have any moral obligation to the victim or their family
Do italians owe me from what the romans stole from dacia
Do the mongols owe everybody for the fact that their conquests killed 5% of the world at the time
That's bullshit
And besides, it's not as if leopold spent the stolen resources on bettering the lives of his subjects
I'd say 99% of belgians' amcestors *didn't* benefit from leopold stealing and building palaces and shit
So stop acting as if world history is a bunch of homogenous groups acting like characters in a book
Nuance exists
"Belgians" are not a group devoid of period and context, who have always had the same values, morals and ethics
Same for romans, mongols, etc
But he also created/unified Germany, didn't he
Okay, guess i was undeducated on the topic
So when am I getting my reparations from the romans, ottomans, mongols and russians
Cool, but war was a normal thing in Europe during that time (for a very long time actually)
I mean, people in Romania would tell you to fuck off if you told them to stop admiring Vlad the Impaler, and he was a pretty awful human being all things considered
Oh, I agree that what he did was necessary, and other countries did it too
I'm just saying that we can still look up to certain historical figures even I they weren't good people
Bismarck started wars, but he also unified Germany, so he does deserve some praise
It was okay at the time
It's not okay by modern standards
I never said that, I argued against that multiple times
Just because what they did is not ok by modern standards it doesn't mean that their statues should be removed
People always change their mind about what's right and what isn't.
On one hand I think that the community should ultimately decide whose statue they should keep and which to bring down
On the other hand this could create some pretty awful situations
It's a hard topic to discuss
I scrolled through these comments and found 16(!) by you that's some variation of this or arguing with people about this
Obvious agenda is obvious
Next December (2018) it’s Romania’s turn
Romania bans Chinese companies from participating in highway and railway tenders
(Article in romanian)
Translation in EN
EXCLUSIVE Chinese companies, excluded from tenders for highways and railways
The Government adopted a memorandum proposed by Minister Cătălin Drulă - Official
&#x200B;
The government adopted a memorandum at the January 27 meeting, which provides for the exclusion of Chinese companies from infrastructure tenders, government sources told [G4Media
ro] The memorandum proposed by the Minister of Transport, Cătălin Drulă, will be followed by a government ordinance that will amend the public procurement law, in accordance with the directions of the European Commission
The reason
Unfair competition from Chinese state-owned companies, but also poor quality of work
&#x200B;
The memorandum adopted by the government stipulates that companies from non-EU countries can be excluded from infrastructure tenders without an agreement with the European Union that would allow them access to the European public procurement market
&#x200B;
UPDATE 13
31: Deputy Prime Minister Dan Barna confirmed the adoption of the memorandum and said in a press conference that the decision was taken after a discussion with the European Commission
Dacian Cioloș also confirmed the decision
UPDATE 10
18: Prime Minister Florin Cîțu declared this morning that "there must be an emergency ordinance, you will have the information when it will happen".
Important: according to the memorandum adopted by the government, the exclusion will apply to both future and ongoing auctions
In this case, the large Chinese state-controlled companies participating in major tenders, such as the Sibiu-Pitești Highway, the Pitești-Craiova expressway and the purchase of electric trains launched by the Railway Reform Authority, could be directly affected
&#x200B;
The memorandum does not explicitly provide for the elimination of Chinese companies from auctions, but for companies from third countries that do not have agreements for entering the European public auction market, but China is one of these countries, according to [G4Media
ro]
&#x200B;
The draft GEO that will implement the memorandum adopted by the government will be prepared by the General Secretariat of the government and the National Agency for Public Procurement (ANAP)
&#x200B;
The reasons for excluding Chinese companies from tenders in Romania are the unfair competition caused by their support by the Chinese state, the lack of approval of their products in the EU, but also the history of failed or poorly executed works in other European countries
&#x200B;
At the moment, several Chinese companies are involved in tenders for major infrastructure objectives in Romania
These are China Railway 14th Bureau Group, Sinohydro Corporation and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), all participants in the tenders for sections of the Bucharest ring highway, the Pitesti - Sibiu Highway and the Pitesti - Sibiu expressway, works totaling over 3
5 billion euros
&#x200B;
The Chinese contested many of the auction results, which led to the extension of the design and execution period and, implicitly, to the delay of the projects
&#x200B;
In addition, the CRRC Quingdao Sifang company won in front of Alstom and Siemens the tender of 1
7 billion lei for 40 electric trains, but its trains are not yet approved by the European Railway Authority (ERA)
If the Chinese manufacturer does not obtain European approval within a year and a half, the Romanian state will ask the court to refund the advance and will award the contract to the second place bidder - all with a delay of many years
A new tender for another 20 electric trains launched in 2019 has been challenged by the Chinese manufacturer and will be restored after almost a year and a half
&#x200B;
What is the Ministry of Transport based on in an attempt to exclude Chinese companies from the tender
The EU legal provisions that allow such behavior are contained in the European Commission Communication no
5494 of 2019
It states that “economic operators from third countries, which do not have an agreement providing for the opening of the EU public procurement market or whose products, services and works do not fall under such an agreement, do not have secure access to EU procurement procedures and may be excluded ”. The EU has concluded a Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) with 19 third countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Israel and Moldova, but China is not a signatory
As such, Chinese companies can be excluded from EU public tenders
&#x200B;
The Ministry of Transport claims that Chinese companies are increasingly participating in tenders for road and rail infrastructure in Romania and distort competition through dumping prices that they can afford thanks to state aid received from the Chinese government
In addition, according to the Ministry of Transport, Chinese companies do not have the certifications and approvals required by the EU, such as construction in areas protected, protection and safety of employees
&#x200B;
In addition, there have been cases of bad practice in Europe by some Chinese companies involved in major infrastructure works
The best known example comes from Poland, which terminated in 2011 the contract with Covec for the construction of a large highway
The Chinese company did not have the financial capacity to support the works, despite winning the tender
Similar situations, which have led to major political scandals, have occurred in northern Macedonia and Montenegro

Nicely done
I hope more EU countries take this stance
The reasoning behind this, I quote "Unfair competition due to subsidies/support from the Chinese gvt" and "poor quality work".
The proposition does not target Chinese companies specifically but says all non EU companies that do not have an agreement with the EU to participate in public acquisition tenders can be excluded from the process
I support this stance
As long as EU companies are not allowed to operate and participate in tenders in China why should we allow them to do so here
Also the way they behaved in regards to this pandemic is absolutely appalling, threatening and bullying countries like Sweden and France, imposing economic sanctions on Australia because they wanted to investigate the origins of the virus, conditioning countries that had received medical equipment to publicly thank the Chinese gvt for it etc
Many people don't know this but back in Dec 2019, the EU actually sent many supplies to China to help them out, though we never made a fuss about it
When the tables turned they used this as a political tool
Shame on them
In another example of something similar, a few of years ago, there was a big tender for a nuclear power plant, here in Romania, they wanted to build two more reactors, the company that was the front runner was a Chinese company, it undercut by large margin every American and European company that submitted an offer
There were fears that the work would be shoddy, and you don't f around with nuke reactors
We all know what happened the last time
The contract got cancelled altogether because of the Chinese companies, they didn't really want to ban them nor was there a legal tool to allow this and also the gvt didn't want to deal with the political fallout of such a decision back then
I'm glad the political climate changed enough for such a move
This is a new policy from this new government that Ilike, compared to PSD which would make even more deals with the chinese if they could
While from the outside, this may look like a solid decision and a very healthy one too, this is in fact really shitty
Why
You may ask
Our country has a very specific way of functioning
A company owned by a relative of a corrupt politician is getting jobs
The deadlines are absolutely possible yet they are never hit properly
The amount of work put into these projects is shitty yet every single hour gets paid and they get really lazy and progress is slow
Jobs are quite often done poorly and when the job finishes, the whole project has to restart
That means, new funds are needed and another 5-10 years are wasted on the said project
Romania should have been covered with highways from top to bottom
Yet we barely have ANY highways at all strictly because all the money for said highways are in the pockets of corrupt politicians (often of the "PSD" party) who are consistently promising left & right
Old farts constantly trust them even though they have been backstabbed multiple times by the same people, they get voted
proper work gets done for like a week or two and then back to working as little as possible for as much pay as possible
I see some other Romanians praising this as well and the blind nationalism can be seen
Either people who didn't look a single second at what exactly is happening in Romania are commenting or just people who hate the concept of getting any help from China are commenting
None of them most likely know just how much money gets wasted in this bottomless pit known as Romania
And oh boy
when we'll hit rock bottom, politicians will be drinking expensive champagne and will laugh while 90% of the country will face serious consequences
And yet
people from my country still do not wish to go and vote whenever given the chance while old farts who are on their way out are slowly ruining this country by voting when most of the time, they do not even know why they are voting, they are just being told to do so and are bribed with an euro or two worth of goods
Not from a Fidesz member
It's called bootlicking to the Americans, not backbone
Good, let them build nuclear reactors in Poland to prove to the rest of us that you guys are not sinophobic
They do, in order to get residence
Big problem this because they are needlessly driving prices up in places
Look what happened in Vancouver Canada because of them
Most rich Chinese are desperate to get an anchor somewhere outside China in case they fall out of grace
They’ve been kicked out of some African countries for the way they treated locals or done jobs
Good point on irrational fears
Fears in this case are totally founded
Why
America will have to change in the long run
It cannot sustain itself with just financial services and printing dollars
It's simply not feasible to import far more than they export in the long run like they did for the last 30 years
They will have to reduce imports to balance the trade deficit, whether they want it or not
China is already EU's top trade partner and the difference will grow as the US imports from Europe will go down
I have no issues with anyone rich or poor buying a house if they intend to live in it or rent it out, however they never even set foot there, they buy it for residence visa schemes, they don't rent them because they're supposed to be residents and they just sit there empty
This is a problem imo
Allow them to buy AFTER they've established residence not in order to
This way you weed out 95% of such practices
> we can easily afford to neutralize them
>They are very deep into our systems of governance
Sounds like you're not judging the battle on all fronts
Russia being "deep" in western systems means they specialized vertically while the west horizontally
>quite a lot can be done
Sounds eerily [like the GoT dialogue between Cersei and Littlefinger] what good is having 20x the money one actor has when your will is staggered or even crippled by the enemy
Ancient Macedonia was much smaller and poorer than the Persian Empire and they still won because they focused on amassing the weapons and trained men and utilized techniques which simply surpassed their enemies on the battlefronts that mattered
Russia was underestimated many times by military geniuses which were undefeated until succumbing to either Russian political or territorial advantages which were capitalized by simply more shrewd people
Yeah, not anymore
That bullet already sunk in: Trump, Brexit, far-right party ratings rising across europe, avalance of fake-news, nord-stream 2
Before 2015 how many people have even considered Russia to mount such a soft-power offensive and be that effective at corroding the trust of the most powerful western nations in one another
Before 2014 how many people would've thought Russia would actually invade Ukraine
Most people were too busy gawking at the middle east to think that sophisticated

Amen to that
There goes my sense of pride and accomplishment

Not as weird as you might think
You don't even know if the lootboxes you purchase are rigged or not
When you buy a booster pack, you know there are cards in it
When you open EA's lootbox, you can't know if the algorithm behind it decided you don't deserve to get anything good today
People are extremely naive to think EA doesn't rig the lootboxes
At least 35
000 people protesting against the government in Bucharest
Just came back from the protest, I couldn't resist the cold anymore, also I have an exam on Monday
Hopefully, my nationals will be stronger and more active than me, today
Edit: I passed the exam
It's becoming a cultural thing here
We are going protesting as easy as going to the cinema
I am glad of it
The press here said we were about 60
000 out there
Is possible to force a new election
Also remember to vote next time not just protest
man its too cold for that shit ill just stay here enjoy my hot cocoa in my warm bed and ... of fuck I've got exams on Tuesday god fuck me
Actualy less than a month untill we make the full year of protests
Altho protests were only held in the winter, because these kind of decisions were made only in winter
They think that the cold weather and snow will keep us off the streets
And that late in the night decisions will surprise us so much, we won't have time to react
That is the reason we took a break from march to december, but I guess you could call it a full year
Directly , probably not , this government is too corrupt to actually care about the hundreds of thousands of people protesting against them
The long term goal are the elections
The parliament election and the Presidential ones
PSD has a loyal following of elderly people , people benefiting from social welfare or generally poor individuals that vote them constantly based on empty promises that never come in fruition
The votes of these people are basically set in stone , but they are not a huge number
On the last presidential elections the PSD candidate lost against Klaus Iohannis because more and more people rallied against them and decided to participate in the elections
The turnout was surprisingly high , so they lost
That's the goal , to make the people who are undecided or usually abstain from the elections to go out there and cast their vote
For this aspect , yes , the protests are definitely making a change
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
About 70k in Bucharest and 100k overall
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
We have better beer though
They have a loyal following , so the votes of their fan base will probably remain set in stone
If the silent majority is encouraged to go out and vote , the chances for PSD drop dramatically , because those people are more unlikely to vote for the current government , especially one which hasn't delivered even 10% of their campaign promises
And the protests are encouraging in this aspect , more and more people join them , so maybe more people are actually getting interested in politics again , so the turnout
should be higher
No, if elections were to be held tomorrow, not much will change
Maybe one or two of the smaller parties might not make it in parliament, but the big ones will most likely get the same results
We hate corruption and the corrupt thieves running our country
We want a change
We want a country run by decent and honest people
Democracy mean governing within rule of law, with checks and balances together with the judicial system
Winning the election doesn't grant you right to dictatorship for 4 years
Complete opposite
The people are protesting against the corruption that it's happening inside this government
They are protesting against the socialist party PSD , against the third change of prime minister in one year , caused by internal disputes in the PSD camp , against the proposed justice laws , which will make it much harder for prosecutors to actually investigate corruption cases
People are protesting because they are sick of this continuous shit , we want a normal country , aligned with the European values , not one that it's still struggling to escape the Communism's shadow
Is Ceausescu the only Romanian name you know
Cause I can't imagine why else you'd bring him up
Go back to your cave
Directly probably not
The goals are the next elections
Presidential and for the Parliament
If the silent majority is encouraged to go out and actually cast their vote , PSD stands no chance
It happened before , on the last Presidential elections , when the turnout was much bigger than anticipated , and Klaus Iohannis won against the PSD candidate , Victor Ponta
Don't feed the trolls
Well, having one of the best internet connections in the world fades in importance  when you take into consideration the fact that we're speeding back towards dictatorship
Well , personally I like Timisoreana
No , it's not about that
The social democratic party ( PSD ) doesn't really follow a strict ideology . They are just corrupt , and they follow their own agenda , trying to adapt the justice laws of the country in order to escape prosecution
That's why the people are protesting , because they are corrupt and don't care about the will of the people
Not because of nationalism or a clash between ideologies
Absolutely

I've seen a somewhat related joke this week on social media (I'm translating here so here's to not getting lost in translation) :
- OMG those tourists on the street were using such bad language
- Cursing, huh
- No they were speaking Finnish
If you don’t pay attention, the clouds kinda look like flying cars, which fits the theme quite nicely
Can’t confirm, the street shown is not just a huge traffic jam
Try squinting your eyes really hard and maybe tear up a bit
Could work, worst case scenario you look like an idiot
dunno man, maybe the clouds come from my cigars
30 of my smoking buddies seem to agree tho
Tbh I find your links far more depressing than the OP
Personal preference I guess
How did they fix it irl
In the game I usually have to demolish like 20 skyscrapers and a roundabout magically appears out of nowhere in an instant
I wouldn’t say wrong, more like having an unpopular opinion
It’s all subjective
In the picture you saw teo people who disagree with me
What does that have to do with anything
I’m aware my opinion is unpopular, I’m not sure how that discards it
The reason is that the vast majority of people enjoy certain styles, and the reverse: certain places were specifically designed to incorporate the traits that the vast majority of people enjoys
But let’s go around calling those with a different opinion insane, shall we
I feel very uncomfortable and lonely being surrounded by a large amount of people having fun
My idea of fun when outside (I generally prefer indoors) is discussing certain topics (history, physics, video games) with one, maybe two friends and making jokes about them
I find the noise that comes with being surrounded by people annoying, which makes me self-conscious to not do the same to them, which leads to me closing up and not really interacting with my friends anymore
That is not fun, that is boring
Boredom makes me close up even more, but then I remember that I am in public and look about as out of place as I feel, which again makes me self-conscious
In that case I don’t really know what to do, so I kind of just panic and try to get home asap
tl;dr i hate when other people have fun
I don’t find anything in particular that is really wrong
It looks ok, there are just some  (probably perfectly justified) things that bother me
One example is how if you look to the right, the street just seems to go into a wall with nothing behind it
I’m sure there’s a great reason for that (lake
), but I don’t like how empty it feels
Next, the White House feels really out of place imo
You have glass blocks to the left, then you have this 19th century thing slapped in there, kinda like a poor facade
Looking at the lake, the fence and the traffic signs ruin the scene for me
I understand why they’re necessary, but that isn’t enough for my brain to accept it
The blocks also feel a little put of place to me
This is 100% true for Romanian, I had an interesting time adapting to these anglo world sentences
A Romanian priest blessed a christian tv office with a painting roller a few years ago
Omg they go crazy on the blessings
But is this small broom the regular thing for blessing
Our priests use dry basil bouquets
Classic Eastern Europe
Nice
Interesting, I have never seen a blessing with this kind of small broom

A moment of silence for our fellow /u/Bananenhannes who rests in the no karmazone for posting in the wrong subreddit
Damn these are great
Just one
Christ, no
We'd fill the whole carnival space
Oooohh, yeah, oh yeah
We have plenty of corruption
But we're getting rid of it, sure, takes time and effort and the road isn't always smooth or straight, but fuck it, one way or the other, we'll get rid of it
Hopefully it will not be approved by the member states' governments
Making a vague document like the Paris Agreement legally binding is not a good idea
I can see a future where the bigger the man the more the vote counts
One achieving higher vote count by salary, education etc
Its surelly not perfect and has a lot of flaws
What other voting sistems could save democracy in future
Stupidity and ignorance is the next plague
Why do Redditors have to act like literally everything ever is a foregone conclusion
Just because you can find an explanation for a fact doesn't mean your explanation is true, nor does it mean that it's the whole picture and that all investigation should therefore stop
Stop shitting on people who do the actual hard work of finding proofs and data with your armchair know-it-all smugness
It's not the way forward
It never was meant to be the way forward
Full democracy (referendums) is simply the tyranny of the majority

I was just watching that episode from World at War, lol, I just started the series
I had to scroll down way too much for the /r/expectedsabaton
Don't have much to say about this particular issue other than "wow, absolutely never heard of this phenomenon before".
What I'd like to really say is, due to the sheer amount of info in this post and the comments, I couldn't be more happy to be subscribed to r/Europe
Thanks OP and all
Nice, "vis" means "dream" in romanian
i was there on a tour
we were stuck due to a storm
How safe is this
Massive worldwide protests like many unaffected countries are doing now in solidarity with the racial problem in US
Yesterday an old lady came into my shop and she was angry that the shops will close soon
She thought it was stupid
And asked her: how do you think the hospitals will be able to treat pacients, if everybody gets sick
Her response: yeah, but not everybody goes to hospital
So yeah
I stoped talking to her
Good, sensible advice
Today we closed at 3 pm
The shop will stay closed until further notice
So, starting now I will try to stay inside the house as much as I can
Turkey is like: armenia kinda sus
I was doing tasks
2020 things
turkey is officially supporting Azerbaijan and is supposedly bringing in ex isis members as volunteers
Russia hasn't officially announced a side but will definitely help Armenia against Azerbaijan turning it more in a proxy war against Turkey
's okay, US presidential elections coming up real soon now
What, can not honor it
Can someone check this
Very interesting

I think they would offer better protection than nothing, at least your eyes won't get sprayed directly, but the gas would still make it's way in, and you'd then probably want to remove it
I only experienced tear gas a few times, but you start to feel it before you see it, so that what I would intuitively assume
Geneva convention more like Geneva suggestion
So, this is happening everywhere
Castillo de Coca (Castle of Coca) - Central Spain
Castle of Coca located in Segovia, Spain, was built in the 15th century by a Moorish architect - common practice back in the medieval times - and is now deemed to be one of the best examples of Spanish Mudejar brickwork with elements of Gothic architecture
Interestingly, the bricks used during the construction works are hardened bricks that can better withstand enemy onslaught during sieges
The central keep is situated in the northern part of the castle and is known as the Tower of Homage
The castles used to have 2 walls that defended the complex, but the outer wall is ruined today
The castle belonged to powerful Spanish House of Alba
The 10 stations in the new metro line opened in Bucharest, Romania this week
85% of its cost was paid from the European Union's cohesion funds
EU taxes
But still in most apartment buildings in Bucharest we don't have warm water at all
Wonderful
But with colours and everything, or is Mirrors Edge, or is a Minecraft build with shaders put on 25 iterations of raytracing
I remember when this metro line was started a decade ago and on my way to first grade in school and saw panels on the construction yards for the stations, they said "in 3 years you will take the subway to work from here". I am now in my last year of highschool and the stations arent yet open
As beautiful as they may be i see them as a testament of our corruption and lies, siphoning european funds into their pockets
You forgot about maybe one of the coolest stations of them all
Drumul Taberei
Yeah, everything will be destroyed in no time
Can't wait to see cigarettes all over the place (+ the inevitable graffiti that some idiots will use to write their name, "f*ck the government", or other shit like that)
Let's forget the fact that it took 8 years to complete 7km
Lol I was think about that too
I played mirror's edge recently and loved it
Idk, i've been to bucharest like 3 times and really didn't like it, it's waay to crowded and messy, the heat was unbearable (at least in the summer), if you're planning on visiting romania is suggest aomething nore in the mountains like bran, arieseni and the likes
I haven't seen it yet and I'm kinda split here
On one hand I think there are because I've always seen signs on projects funded by the EU, on the other hand local and parliamentary elections are comeing and the goverment most probably wants people to think "WE DID THIS", so idk, maybe someone who was there yesterday will tell you
Hey, I wasn't there since the opening, but during construction I can confirm I saw one sign
There some panels, but I'd double it with huge EU flags anywhere something was built with EU funds
The EU needs better PR firms
During the last few years, in most metro trains on most lines you could see a big poster with the details of the project, cost, and who funded it
Around 700 million €.
New
We know that it was funded by EU
We may not know that it was funded so heavily
Anyway most Romanians are pro Eu and know that we get money
Some people in Romania complain that we gain too much money for nothing and that money could be used more usefully in other countries because it costs a lot of additional money because of bad management of constructions
M5 Line
bine tu
A lot of infrastructure is built by Eu because it's cheaper in real money
Eu verification is way more rigorous
If it was from the government some people would have stopped a part of money for themselves
Plenty of them: Dublin, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Malta, Cyprus
It was not really the case until now, but the trains for this one won't arrive until 2023 (?!) so until then they'll have to "borrow" from the other lines
i think 62
well uk can afford to pay for projects like this from their own budget
It’s a semi-scam for eastern europe also
But like .. the best of a possible list of scams so i can’t complain
we're too poor
lmao absolutely not
Looks cool, yea, but it took them like 10 years to make it, and we still have moldy, rusty hospitals and schools
I think we should focus on our infrastructure before we add neat, money draining, knickknacks
But whatever, at least it kinda looks like Mirrors Edge
Iași București
6 hours for 400 km
For reference,  with highways, that would be 3
5 hours
Labor costs are lower here
They claim there's no impact on the other lines
They can run this one with the control system in degraded mode until then, and while it won't achieve 1-2 minute intervals it would keep the old trains busy
That part of the city is extremely crowded, so even if not optimal it will be a huge improvement, not just a political move
No offense taken
Yes, we pay for the lack of highways with blood
How long it is
thanks, the perspective makes it look longer
Isn't that small edge between Czack and USSR Romania

Percent of remain actually coinciding with number of millions of euros received from the emergency fund
That is great
So why are bits and pieces cut from Romania, Ukraine, France, etc, but not from Croatia
Why isn't they're bottom bit in the south
Bruh most of latvia and prety much all of estonia is more northen then denmark but denmark is in northen europe while estonia and latvia are central
Also kaliningrad is more western then finland, estonia,latvia,lithuania and most of poland and most of romania but its estern europe not even central
Sometimes political geografy doesent make eny sense
These maps can never be 100% accurate
There'll always be people who feel like they have been included in the wrong group
As for Romania, I think it's just hard to include us in one single category, we're just a transitional country
It feels kinda off to me that some from Oradea and someone from Debrecen have completely different cultures that need to be put in different categories
Just like I feel it's wrong someone from Radauti and someone from Chernivtsi will be that different too
There's just no way someone from Moldova for example has more in common with Greece than with Ukraine
So now Transilvania is central Europe wtf
croatia central europe
what the fuck are you on about, it's southeastern europe all day and night, make it orange or cut it like you did with us and serbia, because croatia has balkan, italian and central european influence
estonia is northern europe, netherlands is central europe
greece is a tough one, i believe they have much more in common with the rest of south eastern europe than they to with italy for example
the rest is as good as it is, gj
I hate borders
This map is bullshit and you all know it
These lines follow the German Empire + Austrian Empire's borders that's why Netherlands was left out
yeah go ahead and cut Romania in half again an see what happens we have entered the world wars for that place, except for a small region in the middle of the country all the space is Romania and the people there would be really mad to go back to Hungarian domination again after they fought for hundreds of years not to be
Tell your Orban to call our Orban and discuss it
Here we go again :))
Why point out Romania only, there is Ukraine and Serbia in there as well
You may need a little reminder that you were there fighting in the Soviet Union as well :)
> Western Ukraine makes some amount of sense
How come
And that's no different from Transylvania, which was under german/austrian-hungarian influence for centuries, there were lots of germans, not so many these days, also hungarians are the biggest ethnic minority in Romania
Well that's why they included a chunk of Romania
I think it's the same for Serbia
It's basically regions/countries that were under german/austrian-hungarian influence
that's a nuclear blast, i know when i see one
Wait a second, was Britain not an unofficial 51st US state after 1980's ?

Well there are plenty of other hotels with a way better view in Cluj
and I gotta give it to you indeed I feel there are way too many cemeteries in Cluj
And also a huge one in the center of the city, which I've never seen in other Romanian cities
My home town has only one cemetery which is huge nevertheless, but it;'s at the edge of the city
Here is a promotional video of the city:  [  (just to compensate for the cemetery hahaha)
Not Cluj, but I live in Romania next to a cemetery
The best neighbors tbh, no noises, no complains, no "can I borrow that", they may came out at midnight to play some chess, no stealing, true good neighbors
Make sure not to get killed by a Strigoi
At least then it was safer 'cause people were coffin less
Well
pay up next time, you probably rented that for €20 a day
if OP also catches a live funeral then that would be the cherry on top hahahah for a 5\* experience
Cluj ain't cheap tho
People still believe in Strigoi
With the occasion of a funeral, I was once told by my countryside relatives never to let a cat in the same room with a dead person because they will turn into a Strigoi
Some iele/ sânziene if OP is male, and a zburător if they’re female :))

You mash together a crapload of cultures, races and religions and pray they don't clash
There won't be any unity among these people, the human tribalistic instinct is to get together with your own kind, with those with which you share something in common

Crazy stuff, I work nearby, I can hear the sirens from ambulances and police
EDIT: wow, they [blocked the doors] at the company where I work, nobody's allowed in or out since we're close to where it happened, and the perp is still on the run
according to [reports] "heavily armed anti-terror squads" have surrounded a building some 200m away from where it happened
Municipality says most institutions are in complete lockdown until 6PM local time, nobody allowed to come or go
Days without a terrorist attack, back to 1 ... Ugh and we were doing so good almost 3 whole days guys
Well fuck me then ima stop countin

For romania you could also use "I was told this is gypsy country
You know, from rroma = romania
". People will go crazy, guaranteed
I'd say that it's more annoying for Romanians to be called Gypsies
American wines hahaha that's the best one
For Hungary you can also use the one for Romania, with a small change: ''Beautiful country, I love Bucharest
''. For some reason many foreigners, including famous bands/singers/etc
mix those 2 names
Bucharest for Hungary and Budapest for Romania
''Hello, Bucharest
We love it here in Hungary
'' or ''Yeah, Budapest
Romania is awesome
But we are not gypsies, we are romanians :(

The right term for mexicans, cubans, colombians, etc
is hispanics
Cause they were colonized by the Spaniards, not by the Romans
The true Latins are dead for ages
The neo-latins are in Europe only
And they don't call themselves latinos and latina
Romanian language has one of the richest heritages of Latin of all the Romance countries, therefore we named our country Romania=descendants of the Roman empire
The other guys, the Rroma people, migrated from Indian ethnic background to Europe and have a very similar name, hence the confusion
EDIT: "one of the richest" instead "the richest". The latter makes it a very debatable assertion
Romanians stronk latins
Imperium in imperio
*flips table*
don't really have a problem with that, tbh
I find it interesting that Tolkien was super into Germanic stuff and there are some theories that he was holding what we'd consider a rather outdated worldview
And while trying to devise fantasy Germanic sounding languages, the language he liked most isn't even Indo-European
> among Stockholm Swedes
Just curious, how does Copenhagen compare to Stockholm in the "Nordic psyche" (I could not find another term) in terms of "this is the most important city out here/the one with the most history"?
My money (as a South-Eastern European who has never visited that region) would be on Copenhagen being ahead of Stockholm in that race, it's geographically closer to the [blue banana] further away from the big, empty and "uncivilised" North  (compared to Stockholm, that is), and generally speaking looks to be more densely built (at least from the photos)
I might be talking crap for all I know, hence the question
The famous Via Appia (The Appian Way) nowadays, Rome, Italy
The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic
It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy
Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by *Statius*:
>Appia longarum
regina viarum
>"the Appian Way the queen of the long roads"
The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC, during the Samnite Wars
At first it ran only 212 km from Rome south-southeastward to ancient Capua, in Campania, but by about 244 BCE it had been extended another 370 km southeastward to reach the port of Brundisium (Brindisi), situated in the “heel” of Italy and lying along the Adriatic Sea
As the main highway to the seaports of southeastern Italy, and thus to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean, the Appian Way was so important that during the empire it was administered by a curator of praetorian rank
The road averaged 6 metres in width and was slightly convex in surface in order to facilitate good drainage
The road’s foundation was of heavy stone blocks cemented together with lime mortar; over these were laid polygonal blocks of lava that were smoothly and expertly fitted together
The lava blocks formed a good traveling surface, and one that proved to have extraordinary durability over the centuries
The first few miles of the Appian Way outside Rome are flanked by a striking series of monuments, and there are also milestones and other inscriptions along the remains of the road
Pompei the sequel
well, so far we are ahead in clean energy, NL is really lagging
You have good PR though, with bicycles and old windmills, everyone assumes you are better
This title is misleading af: 100 years since first declaration of independence does not mean 100 years of independence
You were in the USSR for a rather long part of these 100 years
Anyone that knows history and the fact Estonia was under soviet rule for a long long time so, it was not independent for 100 years as the title wrongly claims
It's just 100 years since first declaration of independence
Edit: I wonder what sort of retards without basic knowledge of history would downvote facts
Brainless snowflakes most likely
The title for being misleading
Estonia can't have 100 years of independence since it was around half of this time under soviet rule
If the title would have been :'' 100 years since first declaration of independence of Estonia'' that would have been correct

Loreto Island, Italy
Loreto Island, is located on Lake Iseo north of Montisola, Italy
Loreto is the smallest island of lake Iseo, and it is a privately owned island
There used to be a monastery on the island since the 15 century, but it switched hands and in 1910 a Neo-Gothic castle was built on the island and still stands there today

The protests matter even if you don't see immediate changes, don't stop protesting, like Romania did after we got gassed and we were beaten by the gendarmerie ( riot police )
Stay strong and be persistent
This kind of plague is resistent
They should be afraid because the world is changing for the better the young people are more in touch with politics and we are sick  of them the old way of doing things is over we want the world now
Good job our Czech friends
Getting rid of the communist garbage is difficult, but trust me, by protesting you will manage to do it
Woke people: But why would civilians need assault rifles
It's not like they can battle tanks
A Czech guy holding a molotov cocktail: Let me show you how it's done
Another Eastern Bloc person here who moved to the US - I was old enough to take part in the overthrow of the communist regime back in the day
The social stuff in the US is catastrophic
Seriously, it's the dumbest thing ever
Health care, pensions, maternity/paternity leave, vacation, help with preschool - all these are a disaster
I've a well paid job in the computer industry, so it's not too bad, but blue collar folks - I just can't imagine
There are politicians here who try to fix things, do stuff that in Europe we would consider normal, and the opposition labels them "extremists" or "socialists"; it's like a comedy show
America is great if you make a lot of money in a field of work that's in high demand - and even then, you should better love your job, because you're going to spend a lot of your time with it
If you're Elon Musk, this is the best place on Earth for you
If all of the above do not apply, then Europe is far better in every way
America has better military and better technology, and more money
But on the social side of things, they are 100 years behind Europe
> There’s a greater income and wealth inequality in Europe than in the US
Not true
There are some fairly miserable folks in the US as well, and the rich tend to be obscenely richer compared to the middle class
You just don't see all that on TV
Drive through Nevada or the Bible Belt and you'll see some incredibly poor folks; heck, Central Valley in California is not all sunshine and bunnies
Social mobility is also far lower in the US
In America, if you fall through the cracks, you fall all the way down, and you stay there - there's no safety net to catch you
I had classmates in college, in Eastern Europe, who were from very poor families
They went on, got their degrees, and then had careers in science, studying and doing pretty cool stuff
In America, if you're born poor, college is not something you'll ever be able to afford
Which then have to be repaid and are often a trap
The system is unbelievably stupid, no matter how much lipstick you put on it
Isn't this from 2016
You all talking about fixing that loophole
But until they fix this, Google and other giants will benefit from it until 2020
That's A LOT of money
And maybe, after 2020 another loophole will be found
I wonder how's the inverview at Google for an finance/account specialist: *And what loophole do you think you'll find in order to reduce costs for the next years to come
Dutch people can read it though
Or better yet, isolate tax havens from the global financial system and they will end their shady practices right away
Of course, there are too many powerful people interested in keeping this practice going for it to ever happen
First of all, free markets are about as real as Santa or unicorns
Secondly, this has nothing to do with free markets, it has to do with international finance
If they stay in the Netherlands, it means that it's better than back home for them
Call me when you can build a hospital, pay for doctors' education, build highways, build airports, etc
I know
But for many of them the forced "profession" would be the same back home, I imagine
The lesser of two evils, I guess
I'm from Romania, I don't know what you're talking about with "daddy government". Our government would throw us to the dogs and then piss on our graves if we let it :)))
Getting back on track, I don't know exactly what you're doing in Ecuador, but I see that Ecuador's HDI and inequality adjusted HDI (IHDI) are 0
752 and 0
603
I'm talking about HDI not because it is not awesome, but it correlates pretty well with general standards of living in a country, probably better than the simpler GDP
So, part 2, Romania's HDI and inequality adjusted HDI (IHDI) are 0
811 and 0
717
I haven't lived in Ecuador, but based on these simple numbers, I can't imagine Ecuador being a paradise to live in, except for nature, and that wasn't built by humans - and at the end of the day, we have to live everyday with humans
We don't measure civilizations by the beauty of their mountains, but by what people have built, learned, researched, created, in general
Part 3, the Netherlands HDI/IHDI are 0
931 and 0
857
**TL;DR**: You must be crazy-crazy to say that it's better to live in Ecuador, that in the Netherlands, for the average Ecuadorean
I'm pretty sure Ecuador has better views and better weather, but I'd still live in the Netherlands :)
TL;DR: Fuck you, got mine
That's both horrible and not sustainable if you have an ounce of empathy
People are less educated in general, it's harder to find interesting people as a result
You're more likely to get robbed since people are so poor (who can blame them
It's much easier, during a crisis, to be attacked, robbed, killed, etc
Everything is usually dirtier, grimier, more worn out because people can't afford good things or decent replacements/repairs, etc
Sure, you can build your bubble and I wish you good luck with that
But I'd still live among calm, peaceful, tranquil and especially **content** people
Also rich, when possible :)

Thank GOD Romania is shedding its Christianity slow and steady too

Even the Soviets understood this

I don't deny that
It's just that most young people believe in god, but not in church

Fuck
in Romanian is :
Bag pula
Bag picioarele
La naiba
Not hungarian, but shouldn't it be Boz meg(probably wrong spelling)
Why is it in persona 5 font
Technically that's kind of accurate, but in Romania we don't really use "La naiba" (it's probably the tamest 'cuss' we've got and it means "to hell" not fuck) when we have _so_ many alternatives that are much more expressive
And don't forget the classic *futu-i*

[Urlaţi] = Scream;
[Spermezeu] = JizzGod;
[Mamaia] = Grandma;
[Pianu de Sus] = The Piano Above;
[Mădulari] = Cocks;
Granted, some of these are not the most generous translations, but still, to someone who could be learning Romanian, those would be the first connection they'd make
Replace "Belgrade" with "Minas Tirith" and you get LOTR
> Spermezeu = JizzGod;
Hahahah what the fuck
Edit: To add further, there's [Miroși] which roughly translates to "You smell".
Mădulari = Limbs
We should petition the mayor of "Cocks" to twin it to "Boobs village". In the interest of world peace, of course
Good point
Still, to name your town "refugees" is a little bit too much :)

Looking to visit one day
Reminds me of [Stavropoleos street in Bucharest] - and [another angle]
Good morning Europe from Corvins' Castle
Am fost acolo e frumos :)
Salut
Servus
The good old magyars already talking shit sad
The one and only, but the "castle" or whatever citadel was before was given to its grandfather Vojk Corvin wich origins still remsin debated(either vlach or cuman) and his father John Corvin or Hunyadi(who means "of hunedoara" the region he abd his familly ruled upon) and he build the castle
And the tower to the right of the leftmost tower is a happy cyclops
Wasnt this castle inspired by the one in Budapesr
Servus
Hoes mad
Hahaha thanks this made my day,  BTW you forgot to put this "/s"  at the end of your post
>moat with water
Vlach or cuman, lol
He was Vlach and Vlach means Romanian for those who do not know
He was orthodox and was born in Hațegului country which was an autonomous region at that time because it was mainly inhabited by Romanians
Ok so let me get this straight, a castle build by a familly with most likely vlsch or cuman origins, build in a region where magyars where in a minority so the workforce they used was mainly vlach was build by you and your friends right
How am i s romanian nationalist i strongly belive the castle dosent belong to any coubtry and represent the achivement of the ppl who lived there: magyars,romanians,germans etc
Is not posted as "vajdahunyad" bcuz the familly was named corvin therefore  corvin castle but both name are eligible dont get mad that they dont post it as the name you preffer
>"We know, hasn't it yet appeared that what they post in half of the cases we built
Yes m8 bcuz out of sll the fortress/castles/buildings etc in Transylvania were are build by hungarians is not like half of the noble famillies from Transylvania have romanian/pechen/cuman/slavic origins(romanian "Cândea or Cîndea became Kendeffy, romanian Dragosesti became Dagffy, Vucasin became Wakasyn and so on) and the population was equally diversed but is allright mate everything was build by hungarians and everyone stayed and jerk off right
Well, sucks for you
I don't see anything wrong with claiming him as a national hero
It's not as if it denies the fact that he was a hungarian king or make him any less of a hungarian national hero
I guess no reason to still have ethnic Hungarians in Romania then
They are born in Romania, in Romanian cities and most of them speak Romanian
Well its annoying too when magyars like your friends up there claim every little shit was build by magyars and everyone else didnt do shit for centuries, you have citties like alba iulia,deva,timisoara and the rest of the banat and maramures were magyars were represented a small minority through most of the history would be right for us rn to decline every right magyars have to these achivments
Look at the magyara in the comments who fail to realise that Transylvania was a melting point for different cultures, we do not claim Matthias Corvinus(also i do nlt understand why you put so much accent on calling him Hunyadi when is literally the same shit bu ok) we consider Mathiass and John national heroes bcuz they played a important role in Transylvanian history who was a rightfull ruler(during his time literally vlachs were more loyal to him the szekely or the saxons, who rebelled against him supported by Stephen the Great of Moldavia, after he defeated the saxons and szekely Mathias got defeated by Stephen at battle of Baia where he got wounded, after the battle he and his army retreated after he rewarded plenty of vlachs from Maramures for saving his life),yes there is a highly possibility he was a romanian ancestry but no one really cares about it tbh only the extremists like your buddies who claim that every fence was build by them
Ok so a castle built at the order of a vlach noble,a castle wich workforce was mainly vlach bcuz of the region wich was a vlach majority one was a only hungarian build right
In the process of erecting this castle both hungarians and vlachs were involved period
Yes it was in county of Hunedoara(Vajdahunyad) in the voivodship of Transylvania wich was part of Kingdom of Hungary(feudalism 101) but to say it was build by hungarians is as wrong as saying it was build by vlachs, is the produc of the colective work of this 2 group of ppl and  more
Love the unbiased magyar links i cannot understand
Btw that tree starts in 1508 well to bad that the firsy atestation of this familly is from 1236 under the "candea" name
>And yes Dagffy apperently did have olah ancestors on one side, but I don’t really see the point
That like it or not everything in Transilvania waa build only by you, majority of the castles,fortifications etc were build in ethnic diverse areas, and a lot of people of different ethnicities took part in the process of building
>So you managed to point out two of thousands, one of which wasn’t even true
Actually i pointed 3 :/ and do you know the meaning of "and so on"
>We just pointed out that whenever there is a pic about “beautiful Romania” it’s alway a pic about a Transylvanian city center built by us in the 19th century
When for the majority of it hungary and Transylvania was under austrian rule, following yout logic tthat claims that this castle build by a vlach familly with tge participation of other vlschs,saxons and magyars as part of the workforce is hugarian dosent that make everything build in the 19th before AH austrian
Also again i'm sure that absolutely 0 romanians from that juicy majority who inhabited Transylvania cobtributed to the building of this citties it was all on you ;)
> and old town built by us or the saxons,
You mean Sibiu or Sighisoara who was literally borded with Amlas county a Vlach predominant region in the west and in the east Fagaras county who again was known to have a big vlach populstion in the north Alba Iulia and Deva with again predominant Vlach populations, or Brasov who was founded on some bulgarian and vlach villages i'm sure vlachs barely did anything to help
> or an old castle built by us in the middle ages passed off as Romanian
achievements
Just like this one is an only hungarian achievment :)
>Which is fine you do you, just don’t act so offended when we point that out
Well dont get pissed off when the history is not the straight line you think it is
You are the one claiming "ancestry" doesn't count as long as he was in Hungary
Same argument should apply to the Hungarians in Romania then
They are born Romanians, not Hungarians after all
Say this to you co-nationals who think they build evetything then
Eo does Napoleon in the polisn one
Actually the term of nationalitty didnt exist back  then
The infamous theory that Vlachs became a majority only after Maria Theresia
Don't you get bored of promoting such senseless stuff
There isn't much debate to have in any day, shedding some more Trianon tears over the internet won't change history
>Just because there were Hungarian engineers at the building of the Suez Canal I don’t claim it’s partly a Hungarian achievement
Well you should bcuz it is
>The same way just because Temesvár bordered vlach regions it doesn’t mean they had anything to do with it, the same line of thought would led to me say Vienna is a partly Hungarian achievement
Actually funny enough Timisoara and the banat region were mainly serb abd romania with a considerable number of germans after the ottoman occupation the hungarians started to fade away by the 18th century they were under 1% magyars living and yes,you can say Wien was a partially hungarian achievment, a lot of it was built with the resources and money they obtain from hungary and other provinces
>As for the Austrian part, even during those times Hungary had significant autonomy, with different laws and legislature from
the rest of the empire
The same way durin hingarian kingdom regions like Hunedoara,Fagaras,Maramures and many around the southern border including the saxon citties had their own different laws
>But if we argue about semantics anything before 18th is not a Romanian achievement, because it didn’t exist yet
And all those places were built by Hungarians nobility
Wich again like i state a considerable number of them were of non-hungarian descent and i doubt that the hungarian nobility made the plsns,gathered the raw materials,manufactered them and build this things
>As for the family, you say official sources are not true regarding the family tree because they are Hungarian but a wikipedia page without any sources is the ultimate truth
No i'm not saying that your link is false i'm saying that there are more earlier mentions
>Also you try to force on mediaval places the ethnographic map of Transylvania after Maria-Theresia and her invited Romanian settlers
Funny enough during her time there was a documented migration of romanians from Transylvania to romanian principallities they were named "ungurenii" if you wanna do some research
>Either way this whole discussion is not really worth my time, given 4th is coming soon we will have a lot of debates about it anyways
Sure
Ask the Germans of Alsace in France if they are still Germans
The answer is likely no
And why do they got defensive by a post about a castle which wasnt theirs(personally Laszlo who lives in Debrecen dosent have any right on the castle such as you and i do not have it either) and wich yes their ancestors togheter with mine and many more build it like the rest of Transylvania
That is because this is one of the few aspects where Romania didn’t follow the French example and a lot of minority rights were granted
And Alsace had a German majority as well
Besides, you are talking about 2 counties with forests and 3 towns in total, it’s not some regional economic powerhouse or anything, so chill out
Seems like Orban lied to you again
1 million Hungarians in Szekelyland
Who lied to you like that, poor soul
Hungarians in Romania and Hungarians in Szekelyland are different things, my man
Hungarians in Arad have nothing to do with the Szekelys
According to the 2011 official census, 609,033 Hungarians (56
8%) live in the counties of Covasna, Harghita and Mureș (out of a total population of 1,071,890 inhabitants)
Check the facts before spewing Orban’s propaganda
yes yes, you are all anti-Orban but he ends up winning by a huge margin, you are all pro-EU, but you do the opppsite of EU values, we know that
You made a mistake by 400k people, so it’s enough for me to understand how much you know about the topic
Typical Trianon crybaby
Lemme know when your country gets rid of Orban, 20 years from now maybe
No, I do not usually make mistakes, not when talking to ultranationalists like you
I said “maybe they were given too many rights” and yeah, I agree, they show no respect for this country, so it’s a bit hard to have empathy for them
What 50 years of oppression
They had Hungarian schools even in communist times
Ceausescu did ethnic cleansing
Now I really want to see some proof
He sure did many bad things, but ethnic cleansing wasn’t one of them
I mean our human rights were constantly violated under his rule, but that’s a different thing, he did no ethnic cleansing
He did no actions that had the extermination of Hungarians as its goal
You can call it oppression if you want I guess, I can agree with that
[Is this] what the Space Force will look like
I don’t get the point of promoting 112, here in Romania 90% of 112 calls are either pranks, non-emergencies or butt dials
If they want to make a campaign, they should campaign for people to stop dialing unless someone is in real danger
I don’t know about other countries, but in Romania if you call 911 it just forwards you to 112
Meanwhile in the Oslo airport they have some ridiculously small 250ml bottles of water at €5
Oh and if you have a relay, you have to get out of the airport and pass through security again, so you can’t hold on to your old one
In Dubai a bottle of water in the airport costs 1 Dirham, which is about 0
25$.

I'd feel the same; the weeaboo result is a bit surprising tbh, though, I don' fall for that either
The uniformizing, cosmopolitist, of ”Let's like everybody” is boring, unoriginal, forced, and isn't let alone to develop itself naturally without political or ideological ulterior motives & pressure
Btw, you gotta love this interesting characteristic of ”muddying the water” they got here: they combine the ethnic background up top, with religious background down below
If that ain't interestingly quaint, I dunno what is
So we equally hate just about everyone that's not white and christian ?

I call bullshit on the portrayal of Hungary on this map
Hungary was erased from the map in 1526 at Mohacs by the Ottoman Empire and stopped existing as an independent state for almost 400 years
In 1867 it was part of the Austria-Hungary Empire, but only after WW1 it rebecame an independent state and reapeared on Europe's map
Also, Transylvania was an autonomous principality under ottoman and then austrian suzerainity, with periods of quasi-independence
It wasn't part of Hungary for a long time
It was given by Viena to Budapest in the A-H, for 50 years or so, till it became part of Romania
The whole hungarian propaganda with ''Transylvania was ours for 1000 years'' is major bullshit
>After the Battle of Mohács in 1526 it belonged to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, from which the Principality of Transylvania emerged
During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, the principality was a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire; however, the principality had dual suzerainty (Ottoman and Habsburg)
[2][3] In 1690, the Habsburgs gained possession of Transylvania through the Hungarian crown
[4][5][6] After 1711[7] Habsburg control of Transylvania was consolidated, and Transylvanian princes were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors
[8][9] After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the separate status[10] of Transylvania ceased; it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania) as part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire
[11] After World War I, Transylvania became part of Romania
Edit: Hungarian irredentists downvoting
lol Always stay in denial
You never disappoint on this aspect
So many mistakes
Principality of Transylvania is missing
All the crown lands of the Austrian Empire are put under Hungary when it wasnt the case untill the Austro-Hungarian Empire
And the fact that is posted from a bought account doesent help
It was erased from the map as there was no more independent Hungary and you know it
Transylvania was a different principality than Hungary, from 1570 after some, from 1526 under others
It was under ottoman and austrian suzerainity till the half of the 19th century and had periods of quasi-independence
Transylvania was always inhabited in majority by romanians even based on your own censuses
So it was our land and we decided when we were allowed to have a say, that we should get rid of your rule
Both romanians and germans in Transylvania were against the hungarians both in 1848 and 1918
So we had an absolute majority of almost 2/3
What happened in 1918-1920, confirmed at Trianon, was JUSTICE for all those 10 nationalities trapped in A-H, although they represented close to 2/3 of the entire population of A-H. Do you see the slovaks, serbians, croatians, polish, czech, italians, etc
cry after A-H or Hungary or claim you are right in your irredentist claims
I see nobody saying you are right
Even the austrians show more dignity and do not share histerical tears after the A-H empire
Showing just how pathetic you are
The one full of lies are your beloved hungarian irredentists, you being one of them
You even seem to forget that you people (well your turkic-asian looking ancestors) came from the fucking Central Asia and only started conquering this region after the 10th century, ending it somewhere in the 13th-14th century
You talk about fucking legitimacy
You people are pathetic as fuck as always
Go claim your true ancestral lands from Central Asia
But you'll probably just invent retarded claims like ''romanians are in fact albanians that migrated in Transylvania only after we came''. lol
The only nation crying after Trianon as some great injustice is Hungary
Well, some irredentists there that are clinging from the false belief, promoted by ultranationalist parties, that Hungary was great till 1920, when in fact it was small and ruled by other nations since 1526
The delusion is very strong in you people
Even in A-H you were just the small poor relative that got to a privileged position cause Austria wanted to still appear as a force in front of Prussia and the new state called Germany
It didn't want to accept that it lost the hegemony in the german world and is no longer a first hand power
Edit: Instead of crying hysterically ''Trianon, Trianon'' as some great injustice of the world, it would be more useful to realize that if your rule would have been decent, there would have been no Trianon
That if you would have respected the nationalities trapped there and gave them rights instead of trying to forcibly assimilate them and keep them as ''tolerated'' nationalities only, perhaps not all would have wanted to escape you
Hahaha
That's it
Show your true ugly face
Just as your hungarian ancestors did
We are not pathetic like you to claim we were big when we weren't, ''bitch''.
Learn some history
Romanians and germans in Transylvania were against the hungarians and their desire to annex Transylvania in 1848 and supported the union with Romania in 1918
There was even someone called Avram Iancu, that you irredentists like to call a ''mass murderer''. I made this point because you usually love to bitch that there was no referendum and the romanians didn't have the majority to impose their decision
lol 64% at least, was not enough
You lost the 1848 revolution and only got Transylvania cause Austria wouldn't accept it was no longer an important power in Europe
Just as you don't want to accept that romanians were the majority in Transylvania and would have been stupid not to want to get rid of your abusive rule and forced magyarization
Apparently that's the great ''crime'' you are accusing romanians of
That they should have wanted to stay as slaves for you
lol
You can make up as many lies as you want
Like your bullshit theories that we are albanians
Like your lies about 1000 years of hungarian rule in Transylvania
Like your history that still doesn't admit that Iancu de Hunedoara aka Janos Hunyadi (magyarized name) was romanian or that Matei Corvin aka Matthias Corvinus also had some romanian blood
etc
If you want to know the truth, read your own chronicles who claim that when your magyars came here, the romanians were already present
Your own censuses or the austrian ones that constantly showed the romanians as the majority here (at least 54% romanians and 10% germans) even if you had the bad habbit of registering gypsies and jews as magyars
lol Etc, etc, etc
You are the one bitching about Trianon and romanians
I am simply not letting your bullshit claims pass as ''truth'', when they aren't. You can bitch as long as you want, but we are still the majority here with over 80% and nothing can change the cold hard evidence
You can keep on masturbating to the map of ''Great Hungary'' from before 1526 and stay delusional about parts of your history

Romania should have had the vampire teeth and cape
The Netherlands should have had red eyes
Either England or The Great Britain, not GB instead of England
A baguette to France
Spain should have had their emblem
And regarding Gypsies: Turkey has the highest number of them in Europe
Hungary, Bulgaria, Slovakia and N. Macedonia have a higher percentage of gypsies in their population than Romania

Households in the EU unable to pay utility bills on time in the past 12 months
In 2018, almost 7% of households had been unable to pay utility bills (heating, electricity, gas, water, etc
) on time, due to financial difficulties
However, this share has fallen steadily in the EU as a whole, from over 10% of households in 2013
Among households, in particular those with dependent children faced difficulties in paying utility bills on time
In the EU, just below 14% of households consisting of a single adult with dependent children faced such difficulties in 2018, compared to less than 3% of households consisting of two adults (with at least one of them 65 years or older)
Among households with two or three adults and dependent children, this share was around 11%.
In 2018, more than a third of households in Greece (36%) had experienced problems paying their utility bills on time during the last 12 months, with many households facing such problems also in Bulgaria (30%)
In contrast, few households had been unable to pay their utility bills on time in the Netherlands, Czechia, Sweden and Austria (all around 2%)
Oh hey, we’re finally not first on a negative graph

Exactly
Should've had a heart attack right on that spot
I think this is false or misreported
From what I read, they knew pretty much that war was inevitable and they even trained for it
Zhukov was doing war games and enhancing the frontline just months before Barbarossa
Maybe they couldn't pinpoint the exact date Hitler would attack, but I am pretty sure they knew it was inevitable, so the idea that they just stood there in chaos, is not what a victorious party would do, and smells more like cold war propaganda than factual history
The entire forced collectivization happened to prepare for war, because Hitler was already agitating for eastern expansion
The idea of peaceful coexistence was never on the table and they both knew it
So both sides were preparing for war since 1933
The actual attack might have been a surprize, but I think it's greatly exagerated
When your last decade's work is largely preparation for war then I doubt you should chicken out the moment it happens
THIS IS PHENOMENAL

Happy International Beer Day
Among the EU Member States, Germany was the top producer in 2019 with a production of 8
0 billion litres (or 23% of the EU total production)
In other words, about one in every four beers containing alcohol produced in the EU originated from Germany
Germany was followed by Poland and Spain (each 3
9 bn litres produced, or 11%), the Netherlands (2
5 bn litres, or 7%), Belgium (2
4 bn litres, or 7%; 2017 data), France (2
0 bn litres, or 6%), Czechia (1
9 bn litres, or 6%)
Compared with 2018, Lithuania recorded the largest increase in the production of beer containing alcohol (+7%), followed by Spain (+6%) and Italy (+5%)
In contrast, the production of beer in the Netherlands fell by 9%, in Latvia by 7% and in Slovakia by 6%.

I'll cherish this day accordingly, enjoying two dark beers tonight
I'm quite surprised our country isn't in this top considering the number of beer brands we're currently producing and the yearly consumption

> humidify the curtains
Keep windows, curtains and blinds CLOSED ALL DAY, (closed as in completely closed)
Hang humid cloth in front of the fans
Don't do any of that
If you do, you'll have a bad time
Sweat-cooling takes place by the phase transition of evaporation extracting heat from the skin
For that you want the air as dry as possible
If the air is humid, evaporation of sweat is diminished, your body overheats
Humid air is not automatically cooler air, that's not how reality works
To cool down you need to transfer heat from your body
One way is to be in direct contact with conductive cooler matter, like cold metal or cold water, or even cold air, but we assume here cold air is not available
Second way is phase transition : a substance, in this case water, needs an additional amount of heat to transition to gaseous state, and if the conditions are right it takes that heat from the surrounding vicinity (your skin) as the transition takes place
The right conditions are when the environment is not saturated with the final state of the substance (water vapor in this case)

I spent a night in Rome with a Brasilian woman
Was pretty cool experience
But yes, spanish, italian, portuguese, romanian do share a common root
Romanian had a more rough formation, being between slavic, hunnic, fino ugric, greek and way more influencea beyond just latin
But identity is also a choice and while latin was the majority of the language it was also a concious choice in the 19th to bring the language closer to other Romance languages, most notable French
We really had a sweet spot for French, arguably we still do
The majority of Romanian people living abroad are in Spain and Italy, languages that are really easy to understand for us
Later edit: still have a really cool Brasilian friend (and another aquiantance now that I think of it) who is (are) currently studying in UK
It is interesting to see how Bolsanto (spelling

Kinda hard to trust ur government if they barely even know grammar
As a romanian I can confirm
This should give a moment of pause to politicians to reevaluate their situation but they probably don't give a duck
they're too busy stealing and shift
you're goddamn right i do
You bet I do
I don't trust my government AT ALL
I would gladly let the EU rule insted
They'd definitely do a much better job
In Romania we have a saying inherited from the communist era "Timpul trece leafa merge" a rough translation is "Even if you do your job or you don't, you still get paid" and that characterizes our whole government apparatus
So the trust in EU is high simply because the bar is set so low by every romanian institution
obviously
we don't have who to trust lol
Not at all shocked
I'm not surprised at all
You can't trust someone who lies to your face and takes your money saying that it's for you, using it to build their 20th villa/mansion

how could we trust it

They weren't harassed in any way by the ralliers, let alone the fking police
We still have homophobia, but saying that it's harsher than the Turks is an insult
>  Eastern Europe is still homophobic as well with the exception of Czechia maybe, and they're harsher than the Turks
Romania is in Eastern Europe
Polignano a Mare, Italy
Located on the Adriatic Sea, the town is a popular tourist destination with its limestone cliffs, white-washed houses, and deep blue waters
It is also popular for its beaches, most notably Cala Porto which is known for its white and aquamarine-coloured pebbles
Came here to say this
Our AirBnb host suggested we visit Monopoli instead of Polignano
We visited both just to compare, and Monopoli was the best, honestly
> I'm truggered
That triggered me
Where are the Anglos

you may be joking but apparently North Korea does care about climate change
That's interesting
Do you know more info about that
What was the reason of the war
> The fact is the withdrawal agreement has been rejected by parliament three times and will not pass in its current form so if the EU wants a deal, it needs to change its stance
EU wants UK to stay, no other scenario is anywhere near what EU wants
UK parliament and prime-minister has to make sure the interests of the 60mil brits will be looked after while EU has to make sure the interests of the 500mil europeans inside the union are looked after
Why would the EU make concessions against the interests of the people they represent
Is like UK created the problem and now is pointing fingers at the EU  claiming they refuse to solve said problem in a manner that satisfies UK's interests
Should have done this from the start
3 years wasted for nothing
Yeah but he is a politician
His personal feelings are irrelevant
If he has to reach a deal in order to stay in power he will we just need to find a way to tie those two together
If he wants a no deal theres nothing we can do
The sad part is that even a deal scenario will cause the world economy to take a hit nevermind a no deal one
Gonna be a nice morning waking up to literally the rest of the world yelling at both UK and EU for triggering a recession
I mean is not unthinkable:
No deal into recession into pound devaluation and i guess they plan to buy everything during recession but what they did not anticipated is russians and chinese and saudi arabians coming in hot and buying everything at 15pence/lira while the brexiteers are offering 10pence/lira
And then happy independence and congratulations other people own everything in your country and they got it cheap af
And if you own everthing you can bet that the next asset you buy is the english politician
Then is smooth sailing
Not for the brits tho
> A No Deal Brexit is against the interests of the people they represent
A No Deal Brexit is against the interests of the british people too
So here we are
> Exactly
So we need a new smaller deal to avoid the No Deal scenario
We need a trade agreement first and foremost and then what it's possible to agree on
And from my understanding the current negotiated agreement provides all of that and the only big issues are about the fishing rights and the irish backstop
EU cannot make a smaller deal with the chapters both sides agree one and leave the issues to be negotiated for later because then UK will just be: right we signed the agreement and concerning the fishing rights there will be none and concerning the irish backstop there will be a hard border in place
Have a nice day
So EU cannot sign a deal where those 2 major disagreements are not solved because then it will not have any negotiating weight trying to solve them in the future
And the UK does not want to  sign a deal that solves those issues claiming that they leave to be independent and having other people fish in their waters and no border between 2 independent political entities (EU and UK) kinda underminds that
So here we are in a deadlock
Sure you could argue that by going the no deal way then you can bet your arse there will be no fishing rights and a hard border in Ireland which si 100% true
The only difference being that the irish and the EU fishermen wont feel like they were betrayed and their interests and concerns were disconsidered
So this is how we got to this standstill
EU will only sign the deal that we negotiated (which means the UK negotiating team agreed to it btw) or we will sign no deal
We are together thru the good and the bad pretty much
Is kind of the whole point
So then why did the british parliament voted down the agreement 3 times in a row
What issues in the said agreement made them vote it down
One would think so but i don't know what is going on in the british politics but it feels like no progress was made whatsoever
The same issues that were discussed after article 50 was filed are unsolved to this day it seems
Seems to me like the way forward is for Boris to talk with the parliament, then come in front of the press and be like:
After consulting with the parliament we have reached the conclusion that they would vote the agreemet provided we manage to:
- solve the irish backstop
- partition the seagull population in the channel
- deport the male population of polish and romanian imigrants we will like to keep their women
- find a way to stahp the rain
I am ovbiously joking but it seems to me like it would be the sensible thing to do
Prime minister front an center, find out what needs to be changed to make the parliament vote the negoatiated deal then come in front of the press and tell the british and the eu people exactly what  and where the problems lay

Thank you .... Greeks make literally half of my family, since my 2 male cousins and 2 aunts on my mothers' side all married Greeks
The weird thing is .... they all met in Germany, since they work and live there XD I also studied in Germany, came back home for a while, probably will go back ... I'm starting to wonder if I have to actively look for Greek girls instead of wasting my time with others XD might be my fate
And I'm awfully jealous of my adorable nieces casually boasting 4 languages (Romanian, Greek, German, English) whilst I was only hearing my first English words from cartoons at their age :(
Well, we don't have a particular saying for this day so don't worry :)
A "Happy National Day" or something along those lines will do just fine
Nothing comes to my mind
I would stick with the basic "La mulți ani, romani
La mulți ani, România
The gypsies with 5-6 kids and the ultra-religious people of Eastern Romania pump the numbers up for sure
It used to be
In the early '90 we had about 23 million people
Recovery from the communist era was harsh so a lot of people left
It's similiar to many countries from the former Eastern Bloc
Hai noroc și la mulți ani
It’s true, the Romani have a higher birth rate, but also worth mentioning, a lot of the infantile death is on their camp as well
Romanians on average are lower, but we also have the Romanians in Eastern Romania who are pretty religious and have natural high birth rates

Not sure if you knew this or you did it by mistake, but this ~~is~~ can be one of the worst swears a southern American can throw at you

It's alright, I suppose, but you better head back when your visa expires"

How do you know
My intentions were good, no /s. There is so much stupid hate sometimes between Ro and Hu, let's just be friends please
Poor
We're poor
And our country is very corrupt
And the infrastructure is shit
And young people decided that its better to go and work in a country that pays them a good wage
And more
Yep, Sofia (the older girl) was already changing words and listening to us speaking in 4 languages when she was only 6, it truly brings your ego down XD
That was like 6 years ago, when we had this Christmas event together and the mixture of Romanians and Greeks in a rowdy party is something else, no surprise the German neighbors called the police a few times :O we only did noise though
Sadly didn't have that opportunity after since I went to Zurich and then all around, and when I was studying I was in Bremen and Hamburg, whilst most of them are in Dortmund/Koln, so they meet every year like that, harder for me, although they always invite me :D
Thank you and I'd go with this: "La mulți ani și multă sănătate

it's just funny
Let me tell you something, my friend
We are getting better
more gypsies means bad so it's a bad thing
german saxon villages are like that
and probably villages in the poorest counties
Oh okay, that’s interesting lol
Oh yeah, definetly
We're lucky that we're in the EU
We have the potential, we just need less corrupt people to lead us on the right path
Now that's a challenge
Yeah if you're a doctor or software engineer/work in it
The rest of the country is still poor af
Pretty much, yeah
It implies a longer lifespan

It is, but things are slowly getting better so there's hope left
5 more days and we may be a little closer

Yeah, for the parliament
Can we just admit it already that the Brexit movement emerged in a time of high distress for Europe with an alarming number of terrorist attacks

Well, the only exit they saw possible at the time

So you don't put palm oil in butter and just about everything
What about high fructose corn syrup
I don't want to fuel the anti-US circlejerk, but I moved from Europe to the US a few months ago, here are my observations:
- cheese is much worse that in Europe
Also, you miss the specialty cheeses of Europe
- eggs and milk are cheap and good
- butter is worse
- meat is cheap
- chickens are huge, I guess because of antibiotics
Also pork bits are huge, makes you think you are eating something unnatural
- you miss the specialty meats of Europe: pastrama, prosciutto etc
- you miss good salami and sausages
- bread is worse in general, but there are a few expensive brands that are fine
- vegetables are good, but a bit pricier than in Europe
So you just confirmed my point :) For some good tasting meat of cheese you buy a lot of European stuff
Which is fine, just that it's too expensive or hard to find, especially in a little town like mine
Back in Europe I didn't have to buy artisan or hipster cheese/meat/bread to get tasty stuff, that is the difference
Depends where in Europe as well

The real question is, do they hate the romanies or the romanians
lol
Uh, i don't know what's more confusing, the fact that you might be romanian or that I should take it seriously, I have no idea what to do
Please stop putting salt on our wounds
Nah, it's because gypsies are not called Bulga, Bulgari or Bulgaries

Yeah, I doubt anyone knows the exact % of albanians who have not assimilated, because those who assimilate don't stand out
Nah, mate, I know a lot of people from varied countries
USA, Canada, Romania, Portugal, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Mexico
everyone loves the Dutch
Both probably and most of them  probably cant even make a diference between tho not every Roma is a bad person(also note to use Roma as romanies is even more confusing for westerners)well i never liked the brits to being, with this even more now

My friend's aunt and uncle, visiting some city in the US
Uncle says to aunt, in Romanian: Let's ask the dick over there to take a photo of us

Ethnic groups of Bukovina region, Austria-Hungary, 1902; from top left: Hutsul, Hungarian, Roma, Lipovan (Russian), Jew, Pole, Schwab (German), Romanian, Rusyn
Beautiful photo
I am from Bucovina as well and I have 3 of the ethnicities here in my family: Romanian, Lipovan and Ukrainian (my grandfather called himself Ruthenian though, not Hutsul)
And still today, you can find towns where all those nations live in perfect peace with one another
Bucovina, at least the part within the romanian borders, Satu Mare and even in Harghita, you'll see people bonded by mutual trust and humanity
Worth visiting 11/10
Frumos️
Fancy looking folks
Amazing picture
Bucovina used to be one of the most ethnically diverse regions of Romania, together with Dobrogea and Banat
Nowadays it’s not as diverse I believe, the fight is between us in Banat and Dobrogea
That’s actually really cool
I’m from the region of Bukovina and both my family name and family tree clearly states the Hutsul descendence
True Europe
Actually, Rusyns are the same as Rutherians
>Satu Mare and even in Harghita, you'll see people bonded by mutual trust and humanity
...ermmmmmmmmmmm what
Hungarians have been pushing for autonomy from the romanian state (not constitutional), and romanians hate hungarians & vice-versa
Sure, we don't kill each other, but I wouldn't call it living in harmony, bonded by mutual trust and all that bullshit you just said
Despite living in romania, they refuse to learn the language, and 5 km from where I live, it seems like it's a different country
Billboards in hungarian, store signs in hungarian, schools in hungarian etc
Fuck those guys
100 years ago romanians had to learn hungarian to be able to interact with the state under the domination of austriahungary, while getting the treatment of second class citizens
These assholes have the same rights as everyone else, same citizenship, same everything but still refuse to learn the language of their country just because of their bullshit ancestry
Fuck
Them
Note they all have medals
My guess is that they are members of the Imperial-Royal Army
All pre-WWI Europe was a big Stachistan
From what I understand, nowadays, they are considered subgroups of Ukrainian ethnicity
It's both a religion and an ethnic group
In this particular case, the ethnic group is "Ashkenazi Jews", Jews who came (or were brought) in Europe during the Roman Empire (particularly in Italy), then moved into what is now Southern Germany were they acquired a German dialect (Yiddish), then moved to Eastern Europe
Hutsuls are Rusyns, but not all Rusyns are Hutsuls
In what sense not native
By the time of the photo, all of them have been living for many generations in Bukovina, so they were natives
All of them came in the last thousand years, assimilating whatever populations were there before
* Romanians: 1000-1300 (from Maramureș)
* Hungarians: 1000-1300 (from Hungary)
* Rusyns, Hutsuls: 1000-1300 (from the north)
* Roma: 1400s (enslaved)
* Poles: 1700-1720 (most of them came during the Great Northern War; there was some Polish population previously as well)
* Russians: 1700s (fleeing religious persecution)
* Germans: 1780s (after the Austrian annexation)
* Jews: 1800-1840 (fleeing massacres in the Russian Empire)
I guess you mean the Rrom and the Jew
It’s interesting though how the Rroma were treated so badly here (slavery and stuff) while the Jews enjoyed a pretty privileged position
The first Yiddish theater opened a bit further south than Bucovina, in the city of Iasi
Probably the most accurate description of the Eastern European lifestyle
They do, however, leave when their angry wives call them to finally sign the divorce papers
As far as I know, Ruthenians are basically Western Ukrainains while Rusyns are pretty much their own thing, but they never got to have their own state
Not all Hungarians are like that, the majority in fact are not
I grew up in Banat and I swear we do not make any kind of difference between Hungarians and us
I thought those hostilities were a joke until I got to visit some cities in Transylvania where some tensions seem to exist
dude, grow up
Around 15k
Actually, at the same time, none are native and all are native
All their languages formed in other places: Slavic languages in the North, Romanian and Hungarian in the West, Yiddish and German far in the West
However, they all likely had ancestors among the people who already lived in Bukovina
When people move to another place, they usually intermarry the people who already live there
And that's fine, as long as they didn't come from somewhere between the Ural Mountains and Mongolia, damn those steppe invaders in particular
> the Jews enjoyed a pretty privileged position
They did not have any privileges
There were plenty of restrictions placed on them
They could not own land nor join guilds ("bresle"), so they could not be either farmers or craftsmen, which is why they were mostly merchants
>its just the leading magyar party making retarded promises to win votes lol
And that's not an issue
The fact that they're literally trying to divide the country
The fact that they just tried to ram through parliament an anti-constitutional autonomy law
The fact that they are doing their best to prevent romanian from being taught properly in schools
The fact that magyars keep voting these literal traitors to the nation
Idk where you live, but belive me, there's issues
No, we're not
We were second class citizens under occupation
They're just citizens, with representatives and everything
Edit: what i said above is historically accurate
Downvote all you want
If you think wanting *romanian citizens* to at least know how to speak *romanian* is nationalism, then idk what to tell you
Because i'm really the furthest thing from a nationalist
It's not impossible btw
The turks did it in dobrogea
They get along just fine with everyone
You guys arent special
If you have romanian citizenship then, for fuck's sake, speak romanian
Whatever you say, jefe
Ashkenazi Jews have been living in Europe since the Roman Empire, so they have been living in Europe for at least 1800 years
That's longer than the Hungarians
Roma people also have been living in Europe for at least 700-800 years
Also, almost all Jews and Roma have more than half of their DNA of European origin
Compared to the Rroma I mean, we were talking about the two
I see, my bad
My grandfather called himself Ruthenian, but the language he spoke was definitely Ukrainian, he taught my mom as a kid a few songs and it’s Ukrainian

> the settlement policies in Austria was largely segretationist
It depends on the era and place
The Austrian policy in the Banat under Maria Theresia was to forcefully assimilate the Roma
It was mandatory for Roma people to settle in a village (nomadism was banned), they could marry only non-Roma, etc
shit, I forgot Ceausescu made himself president in the 70's

I live in Romania and I installed an AC this year
Can't take the heat, 2 years in a row I couldn't do any work because it was to damn hot and even got sick because of the heat last year
Transylvanian summers were as you described 6-10 years ago
We also used to have lots of snow during the winter season
Almost noone has an AC and it's not like it costs a fortune, I think it was around 450 Euros total (including the team that installed it) and about 10-15 Euros more on the Electricity bill
It's the best purchase I made since building the custom PC
Wouldn't be able to live without it now
Unrelated but one downside is that I am sharing the office space with the girlfriend and her minimum comfortable temperature is my maximum comfortable temperature (26°C)
I like it best at 24°C though (her fav is 28°C)
But yeah, if you don't have one, buy one
It's worth it
Is it because of regulation which prevents you from altering old buildings on the outside
The guys that installed it bought a machine which made a hole with a diameter between 5-10cm which is filled with the cable from the AC
The whole installation took about 1h and we only had to vacuum some dust
But I live in a non-historical apartment building and we own the apartment
I wouldn't recommend buying the portable one, had one when I was renting and it was, as you would say it, umsonst
You have to keep the window open for it to work which is bs
You said you have to live there for a few years first
If you "inform" the government that you're Swedish after a week of living there, do they still accept it
If they don't, then you're still applying, you're just calling it something else
Maybe ask your landlord/lady about it
Properties with AC can be rented for a higher price so it's a win win

Also Croatia,Serbian doesn't count

” and “this is Roman Market” (it’s the Roman Square ffs) are an indicator they translate things word by word and their vocabulary is limited
To their defense, however, I’d blame school for focusing too much on grammar, and less on practice and conversational skills
brexit gets a new meaning
In Romania you learn from the 3rd grade either English or French ( some schools teach german or other languages) and from the 5th grade you get a second foreign language
So if you got english in 3rd grade, you'll get French in 5th and you'll be considered "advanced" level for English later in highschool
For exemple I learned french from 3rd grade and English from 5, although I don't know much French at all because I hated my primary french teacher .
Wait, what
Isn't English the first language you learn in schools
I don't remember us having a choice, in 3rd grade it was English and then French in the 5th grade
Edit: we also studied Latin but it's the most useless thing in the world, we can't even speak or translate without a dictionary, we mostly learn grammar
I don't remember making a choice as well, but some classes had English first and some French first
The only choice I made was in highschool, where I chosed english
Damn I wish I could do that too, studying only one foreign language in highschool
Instead I have to study English and French, and Latin too but it's mostly grammar
A pain in the ass
I didn't know they still teach latin lmao

That's a pretty common trope, but I wonder if actual Bible reading was indeed the main driver to educate everyone in those cultures
Weren't there more practical considerations also pushing literacy
I guess it boils down to the balance between "that's how Protestants are in general" and "that's how those specific cultures tend to be regardless". Which might be tricky to figure out
The high literacy rate was bcuz of 2 opposing systems:
You had AH who after passing some laws that forbidded the learning of romanian or any minority languages in msjority of the schools
On the other hand you had ASTRA ,an organization who opened hundreds of romanian schools and highschools across Transylvania, its main founds camed from the kingdom of Romania
These organization appeard as a reaction to the new laws imposed by AH , wich forced denationalizqtiom and magysrization on the  minoritties living in the hungarian half

Gay plot to take over the world through climate change
The gendarmerie  intervened in force with water cannons and gas to evacuate the protesters  from the Victoria square and the nearby streets
The interior minister decreted Code Red, asking all police officers to get to work
This was obviously prepared in advance by the PSD government
When PSD organized its own rally with people brought in from all over the country, there were no water cannons on sight, no gases, no shields
The hospitals were informed by the authorities, from this morning, that there will be many people injured during this meeting
Dragnea and his PSD want to intimidate the population from protesting
Things have gotten a little more violent than what is displayed in the picture
The riot police is out of control
Full story from what is known right now (others who have been paying attention/watching please correct me or point out additional details as they appear):
The protest gathered 100,000+ in Bucharest
At one point one of the shops in the area asked for help from the police because hooligans were rampaging through the square
The police force asked the riot police to intervene
They dispatched a few rows of their own to *march through the protesters* to get to the affected shop
Unsurprisingly, 2-3 riot officers were caught by the mindless hooligans and were beaten up severely (from the images it looked like they were being beaten close to death)
**Many protesters intervened and acted as human shields, protecting the 2-3 riot police members that were singled out**.
This is when the riot police initiated a full-scale assault and started bombarding the entire 100,000 crowd (fire at will)
Almost the entire protest was pushed out, with a clash between hooligans and riot police breaking out, while the majority of the protest was pushed to one side (and of course, many protesters fleeing because things were getting dangerous)
The remaining protesters (a few thousand by the looks of it) are now singled out on the left side of the square, with the central area largely empty (or rather full of riot police vans and such)
One thing I should point out is, the riot police have been very aggressive and provoking the whole night
They didn't single out the hooligans (which are incredibly easy to identify), instead choosing to use tear gas on everyone as a response
It is not a normal response to disperse an entire crowd of peaceful protesters with endless tear gas grenades flung **right in the middle of the main crowd indiscriminately**. It's not like they chose to disperse or fight the hooligans, they shot tear gas at **everyone**.
**Edit:** [Here is a video of the incident that initiated this event] **You can clearly see that many protesters shielded the riot police officers and pushed away the hooligans
** It is important to note that the people in power (PSD) like to use these events and point fingers at the entire protest, for the violent actions of a few (in order to strengthen their position)
Fortunately, many brave souls stepped in and protected them, ~~thus eliminating the chance for PSD to claim that all of the protesters were violent
~~ but PSD and their shill television channel Antena 3 is only showing small segments and pictures where the riot police officers are attacked
A lot of injuries, including a number of gendarmes
One of them seriously
Expect an anti-protest narrative by tomorrow
It's a very old timey Soviet technique: Agitators blend into the crowd and cause trouble, then the police can 'justifiably' disperse the crowd
The protesters will be demonized, the organizers may even get into legal trouble
More protests tomorrow
Stay tuned
Muie Dragnea
Muie PSD
I really hope all these protests will
became votes in 2019 and 2020
Tear gass has stopped, but they targeted harmless protesters with it
EDIT:THEY CHARGED IN WITH THE SHIELDS
PSD trolls have now invaded this thread and try to justify what happened this night with ludicrous arguments
I hope this time it changes something
Probably not
They gassed the fuck out of us later in the evening
Women running with their children in their arns, old people, kids and teenagers

Repression doesn't work in Europe and seldomly elsewhere in the world

It got ugly fast
I’ve seen police beat protesters and protesters beat police
I’m all for getting rid of corruption but hope we don’t end up like Ukraine (no offense)
Education > Protests
We've been doing this shit for ages, when will we get it that it doesn't work
We need to be more educated and less forgetful
yea too bad the "peaceful" protestants started throwing their literal shit on the guards because why not add a little violence to make our point stand better with the government ... bunch of hypocrites ... like ok i am all for the no corruption thing and what not, whatever these guys are fighting for, but by letting your anger and frustations and whatnot out on the poor guards doing their jobs, you prove quite literraly the opposite of what youre trying to achieve ... like c'mon now ppl posting vids on facebook threatening the gendarmes and shit why is this needed ... and also if im still here, why does the diaspora have anything to say about what goes on in this country ? you left, your out, you have no say in this, mind your business ... jesus fucking christ, and then the ones out there lash out on people for DARING to question their doings ... i guess this country is all out of common sense and critical thinking these days ...
Less than the PSD support manifestations
I guess democracy spoke
PSD will win with over 50% alone next elections because they dont fuck the economy like the opposition parties
2:24 AM and they're back
About 100k people there once again and in full force
We'll be back, we're the resilent sort
thank you
much luck needed
fuck sake there would be no need for this if there werent instigators paid by fuck knows who there to stirr up the crowd and intimidate the guards there only to do their jobs ... a "peacefull" protest wouldn't fkin barge in the fckin goverment buildings and whatnot to "discuss" with the politicians of course they'd get pushed back jesus christ there are still laws in this country
Thanks
We lack courage as well for the most part of our history but, from time to time, we snap (*cough* Ceaușescu)
Even our national anthem is called "awaken thee Romanian": Awaken thee, Romanian, wake up from deadly slumber
i mean if they would have critical thinking they would get rid of the people starting the altercations as those are mostly the ones causing everything by being the ones paid to cause shit to go down, and not join them and then cry on social media that gendarmes bad, they hurt people whithout reason, of course that in the mist of everything, the guys paid to serve and protect will not know who to fuckin beat up, its logic, their not superhumans to target the pieces of shit that are paid to destroy the protests from within, before they act, but people need to diverge from those, and keep it peaceful
nobody, especially the ones meant to protect you, is gonna come beat you up, if you dont first stirr them up
Over 100
000 people protesting in the capital and 50k+ around the country
\>Let the protest go on and be forgotten by the end of the next week
\>Bring ultras to disperse the protest and don't even attempt to pretend to stop them so everyone hates you while calling you willingly incompetent
Hard fucking choice indeed
eh, it never does these days, what this country needs is a revolution like the one in 89, go after all the fuckers that think their above the law, make their own decisions, and align the country on the floating line, but allas, this will never happen, everyone is corrupt, and nobody is gonna intentionally break away from the means they use to largen their pockets
Just to clarify, do you think the protest should be peaceful
The protests never stopped at 23 and no such action was justified
This was premeditated
There were no water cannons, gas and shields to the other protests or to the PSD meeting
The gendarmerie has no excuse
It decided to enter Dragnea's sick attempt to silence any opposition and intimidate people from protesting
This was a dictatorship like move
The gendarmerie acted like Dragnea's mad dog tonight
They want to attack the protesters
Problem is, lots of ppl made a big effort only to come here
to protest
that means months and months of protest
those guys will have to go back to their countries next days
of course it should be peacefull, why would you resort to violence to prove your point ? most of the poeple gathered there came with this in mind, those not hereded like ships there, without having any idea what was going on, at least, but the pupets paid by the goverment or fuck knows who to cause the violence, from the inside, and the guards irked by them, and given ultimatums by the government dosent help the situation in any way
We've had enough peaceful protests
What have we achieved
Jack shit is what
If the Jandarmeria wants to be violent, then we'll bite back
It's time someone does something to actually oust this corrupt government
Standing around and waving signs around hasn't and will never achieve anything
dont you understand, nothing will come either way, these protests are as useless as a method of wanting the bigger dogs to change their attitudes and anything else, peacefull or violent, like i keep saying, these fuckers dont know shame or humbleness, they need to taken out fo their positions by force, but as long they keep paying and forcing the police to shield them, everhing will only end in a bigger bloodbath, with uncesesasrry losses for both sides
That's true, but there's nothing we can do besides fight
Maybe violent protests will give way to a revolution
It's definitely better than just chanting things for a few hours and then going home
I wish it wasn't like this and I wish PSD would just quit, but there's far too greedy
I hate PSD as much as the next Romanian but fuck this resorting to violence bullshit
Go vote instead
If you need to vent anger then go hit the gym or /r/Romania for the MUIE PSD memes

''Snow'' in european languages
It snowed heavily here last night, so I thought I should post this
In Romanian we also call snow ''nea'' (from latin) and ''omăt'' (from slavic)
Ninge afara = outside is snowing
Snow = zapada  We are walking in the snow = mergem pe ninsoare
In Romanian it's also called "nea", but it's rarely used colloquially, mostly in artistic texts or songs
Another synonym is omăt, but I've never seen this one used in the wild, only in school when learning synonyms
My mostly Romanian family is always making fun of the one Polish guy because usually our words correspond to the rest of the Romance languages and the Polish words are usually something like zklczszkwskly but now the tables have really turned
In romanian there are 3 words for snow
Is zăpadă, nea and omăt. All with diferent ethimologies
You focking sniegas
Why is this thing reposted every winter
>In Romanian we also call snow ''nea'' (from latin)
Romania latin master race confirmed once again
I was worried for a second
Besides - "Zapada" from Slavic
In Romania only, but not in any Slavic country
I highly doubt the ethymological explanation of this one
It probably has more to do with the political agenda of the Romanian Academy in communist time, when it was forced to cater to the soviet interests
The dictionaries from that time are commonly known as labelling words of unknown origin (incomplete explanations that involved pre-Roman and pre-Slavic sources) as stemming from Slavic by default, in spite of the ridiculously unlikely probability, simply because there was no complete scientific explanation to contradict that
Too bad there is not ebough contemporary academic activity to wash off the communist pseudo-science
Especially considering that only about 20% of our language is Slavic in origin and we're much farther from Slavic culture than our neighbors
“Nea” e un împrumut din franceză care datează doar din perioada pașoptistă când s-a încercat o purificare a limbii de cuvinte de origine slavică, așa numitul proces de *relatinizare*. Limba română pre-1848 era foarte diferită de limba actuală.
> “Nea” e un împrumut din franceză
Dacă ar fi fost împrumut din franceză, ar fi fost folosit în București, nu în sate de munte din Apuseni
The "nea" used in [this traditional "colind"] doesn't look like a French loan-word:
> La căsuța unde-i neaua
> Vine Fiul dulce, singur, și colindă.
And there are other countless examples like it
\> Limba română pre-1848 era foarte diferită de limba actuală.
That's surprising to me
Do you have a source or at least some article expanding on that

I'll have to look up the sources again since it's been a while since I read them but:
A few years back there was a scandal of a pediatric doctor that did extremely painful medical experiments on children he was supposed to be treating, such as putting a metal rod near their backs and putting screws into their spines to "fix" scoliosis or something similar with bones he considered weren't growing properly
He mostly targeted poor families, or families with kids with weird conditions because he figured they wouldn't be able to or have the power to question his practices
Also the fact that it's been revealed several orphanages drug the kids there and tie them to their beds to keep them compliant
I've also read a religious article of an "exorcism" that was performed on a little kid they called posessed because "he would suddenly go very still and start shaking violently" (to anyone with a brain it's obvious he was just seizing)
Instead of following the procedure for a seizure, which is making sure he isn't in danger of hurting himself by bashing his head or something, they rushed him to a church and placed him on the floor there (and it wasn't a soft floor by any means)
Or the fact that we've had gay people thrown in prison for being gay several years after communism fell (I think either late 90's or even early 00's)
Or, not that sinister but just plain stupid and more recent: the church brought "moase" (aka remains of "saints") during the current pandemic and hundreds of people just lined up to kiss them, all on the same spot too :) (it's a /s smile, don't get me wrong)
In the early 70s, our fabulous dictator banned abortions because he wanted a baby boom
For Romanian women
Gypsy women were allowed to get abortions
Some doctors would recommend gypsy women to get abortions even if they were not necessary
Secrete police/party members would actually be in for some gynecological exams and make recommendations
Our communist dictator, Nicolae Ceaușescu, forced workers to build the parlament building and all the workers were then put in the foundantion of the building,this is just a myth but still very dark
When we(Romanians) had our revolution against the ruling party,the communists,(1989) the army shot at the revolutionaires
In return when the revolution was over, the dictator(Nicolae Ceausescu) was executed by firing squad on Christmas day
We were supposed to be a democracy
still working on that
I would have to counter this
In Ireland we have the Kerry Dark Sky Reserve, a Gold Tier Dark Sky Reserve (it was the first Gold Tier in the entire northern hemisphere, awarded in January 2014), and is now part of only 4 Gold Tiers in the whole world

So, not to say the German town is not dark, but is not the darkest place in Europe
Would love to visit it someday though
Cheers
> Or the fact that we've had gay people thrown in prison for being gay several years after communism fell (I think either late 90's or even early 00's)
The former
In 2000 Homosexuality became officially legal
oh my god, I didn’t know about any of this
Romania really is fucked up
Also don't forget the absolute atrocities that the Romanian troops did during the world wars
Romanian concentration camps were something that even the nazis found excessive
thanks :') i hate it
edit: i read it as "the latter" lol, not that it makes it too much better
and this is just a small part of it
if you go ask people under the poverty line or roma people you'll get even worse stories
I actually didn't know about that, damn
Yeah, history classes are very lacking
Check out what the troops did when they took Budapest or occupied Transnistria
Edit: Also check out how the families of gypsy soldiers were killed in concentration camps while they were fighting the war
And that the iron guard performed vampire rituals by cutting they're palms and drinking each other's blood
Or that they skinned jews and put them on meat hooks
Yup
we luckily didn't get the exposure that Hitler got
The only exposure we got is that we changed sides like Italy but only they are getting the attention
Hungary, no reason whatsoever
I would allow Turkey to join the EU and then choose Turkey
I don’t want to sound stereotypical, but

We have some of the best maternity/paternity leave laws in the world
4 months mandatory maternity leave after the child is born and 21 other months of leave for one of the parents as decided by the family, for a total of 2 years
Can be either the mother or the father
If the child is born with a handicap, it's 3 years in total instead of 2
The leave is paid with 85% of your average net income for the past 12 months, up to a cap of about 1700 euro a month
Can I copy your laws
Just a bit, I mean most of the thing actually
We are so behind on everything
Suicidal people will kill themselves anyway, why not have it be as painless as possible
They do offer a lot of psychological help and tests to make sure they are not killing someone who doesn't actually want to die
Example: a girl born in a jehovah's witnesses fanatic family, raped by her uncle violently and because of that shunned by her family and friends for religious reasons
Why keep living in that nightmare of a life
I mean just being born to fanatics is bad enough
I myself would like if our country would have legislation for the present time, not for the 50's.
Also, it would be great if laws would be made for the people, but they sure aren't
Unrelated to progressive laws, I would change the financial laws to make them compatible with living in 2020
it's frustrating to do any kind of business here
I don't even mind the taxes, but the hell you have to go through in order to be able to pay them
A damn mess
Yeah and with Erdogan and the government being a bit too religious, I don't think that will happen soon
You mean like yourself
Gotcha
How dense are you
By that law they offer free sanity pads in public spaces and pharmacies where women that *need* them can have access to them
And a healthy woman is *in fucking need* of a tampon when blood is coming out of her huh-ha and it's not gonna stop if she tells her uterus that lobbyists are just pretending to care about feminism
And these are *absolutely necessary items* for a woman to *function properly in civilized society*.
You can take that straw man and shove it up your ass and if you want you can pretend it's a tampon
These are *necessary items to function without issue in the modern world*. Having more access to them is only a step forward
Vlad the Impaler defeating the Ottomans and asking the other european powers for help but instead got thrown in a hungarian cell
When we made the Ottomans attack themselves in the middle of the night (Can't remember if it was Vlad Tepes or Stefan The Great who commanded that operation)
We rejoined the First World War a day before it was over
Romanian troops didn’t even have enough time to get out the country
I’m Romanian
Vlad the Impaler (vAmPiRe) once made an ambitious plot to kidnap the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and force them to surrender while he was at war with them
The plan went off pretty well, except for one minor detail: the small kidnapping party Vlad was leading **missed,** and accidentally ended up entering the tent of the Sultan’s retainers, rather than the Sultan himself
And we were on the verge of greatness
Alternatively, the whole reign of Carol II
Our Parliament just decided a week ago to get rid of the Prime Minister and its cabinet without a backup plan
They were so surprised they did it that they still don't have a plan
Wtf
Now we have the same PM bc no one made any proposal for a new PM everyone would agree with :))
Yeah, but you did scared the s*it out of everyone
That counts as bonus points :))
Didn't bulagaria invade first ?
Yes bcuz the saxons from transylvania were defending and sustaining pretendents to his throne
Yeah, Romania declared that it would not be neutral in another balkan war
Fair point
"He came into conflict with the Transylvanian Saxons, who supported his opponents, Dan and Basarab Laiotă (who were Vladislav's brothers), and Vlad's illegitimate half-brother, Vlad the Monk
Vlad plundered the Saxon villages, taking the captured people to Wallachia where he had them impaled (which inspired his cognomen)
Peace was restored in 1460
Yes but you cant claim he didnt have a casus beli ,anyway isnt know for sure that the reason he was imprisonned was that one
I'm about to go to Netherlands next week(for a job) in Waalwijk
Any advice
I can go with a bus, or with a plane in EINDHOVEN which do you think is a better choice(from Romania)
Thank you, I guess you're the first non-xenophobic helpful comment
Oh, guess I was kinda late, all I see now is"removed" so I thought all of them were like that
You live in a rusty Soviet-style apartment block built in the early 70s. Your city used to be a regional centre of industry under Communist rule - your mum and dad worked at one of the biggest textile factories in the country
Obviously, like many other cities in your region, all industry virtually disappeared after 1989
You work as a janitor at the only shopping mall in the city - it was built in what used to be the industrial district
You don’t tell your boss, but sometimes you stare at the shop windows around you; you wonder what it’d be like if you got a new pair of shoes or one of those fancy new “laptop” computers
The clock ticks, and before you know it, it’s 1 pm - lunch break
As you eat the ham and butter sandwich you made for yourself at home, you stare at the McDonalds inside the mall, in front of which you see a long queue of mostly young people
You wonder what your son is doing - he had left the country 4 years ago to go work in England as a restaurant waiter - but you haven’t heard from him in 2 weeks
You silently hope that he’s doing okay, and that he hasn’t forgotten about you
It’s the end of the month, so you collect your monthly €270 paycheck and head home, driving a 90s Dacia car
On your way home, you see a bunch of ads for the upcoming local elections
All of them have certain promises embedded under the parties’ slogans - we’ll raise the minimum wage, we’ll build new hospitals, we’ll build more highways
A long time ago, you’d have looked at these claims with optimism
But now, it’s been 30 years since the fall of communism, and the minimum wage has only went up as prices went up, no new hospitals have been built in your area, no new highways either
You’re home - you park your car, walk up to the 3rd floor, where your apartment is, crack a beer open, and turn the TV on
A couple of hours later, you fall asleep on the couch
You wake up the next morning - rinse and repeat
I don't know how the google street car had the courage to go there and take photos
Craiova ?
Did you see any poor people living in a new building
I've been living in a 20mp apartment with the girlfriend for 3 years now and have only been on 2 holidays in those years
None of us really spend money on the things you listed above
Our combined income (after taxes) is roughly 10 times our expenses, and it could be higher if I would work full time but am still studying
I wouldn't consider ourselves poor, but not stinking rich either
That's not a good way to judge poverty
Usually people driving BMWs, sporting the latest Iphones and some chains on them are so deep in debt that they can only dream to be as rich as a homeless addict living in a sewer with 2 cardboard boxes to his name
Exactly, lol
For my 3rd birthday my parents took me to McDonalds
I based this on the Southwest region yeah, my mum’s side of the family is all from there - Craiova, Slatina, Târgu Jiu, etc
We have the same saying like you guys
totally made sense for me
I get what you mean, and in a way, the perception of McDonald’s has massively shifted in places like Bucharest/Cluj, which have drastically improved in terms of standards of life compared to 20-25 years ago
I grew up in Bucharest and the city back then is completely different to how it is now
When I was a little kid, I used to be scared to go into local parks because there were stray dogs everywhere and the rusty benches usually had used syringes near them
People could afford basic necessities, but most luxuries were out of the question barring special occasions such as your kid’s birthday or whatever
You could pretty much get away with anything as long as you bribed the police with a sufficient amount of money
And it wasn’t just the police lmao, I always used to hear an urban myth about how in the late 90s-early 00s students in some schools who wanted to get high grades in the Baccalaureate (our variant of the SAT) would just leave a notebook with $20 bills under each page in front of the supervising teacher when they gave their paper in
The city right now is fundamentally different
For starters, it *looks* different - various historical areas have been rejuvenated/renovated, the road network is less of a mess, office buildings and skyscrapers have been propping up all over
People’s life standards have improved to the point where Bucharest has a higher HDI and GDP per capita than plenty of areas in Western Europe
The city also massively grew in size with the real estate boom of the late 00s - early 10s, the parks have been cleaned up, corruption has significantly been clamped down upon, etc
In a place like Bucharest, people’s opinions about McDonald’s have definitely changed from “let’s eat like Americans” to “ew, it’s unhealthy, let’s just make a kale salad instead”. But in many places forgotten by time, nothing has changed from the 90s till now
> I also forgot to bring in the homeless and particularly Rumanian beggars who live in absolute poverty by several measures
Most of them go there to beg as a job, as a choice
In Romania they build villas with the money they "earn" there
[For ex
] (the news coverage is in Romanian but main subject is how a Swedish delegation came to Romania to see with their own eyes where the beggars live and they were perplexed)
All I'm saying is that most of the Romanian beggars don't deserve your pity and giving them money actually makes things worse
Omgg the Mcdonalds birthday parties
Such an Eastern European classic haha can’t believe I forgot about them
In my local Mcdonalds they were held in a mini-tramway next to the McDrive area
I actually went to one of my friends’ birthday parties there as a kid
Either we didnt have those (from Baia mare) or j was too poor to even know about it
Lol but I do remember when they opened up the first McDonald's in our town and they had a swirly slide
There was a lineup of kids because every other slide in our town was metal and went straight down
This one was plastic AND it went in a circle
It blew our little minds
>  I always used to hear an urban myth about how in the late 90s-early 00s students in some schools who wanted to get high grades in the Baccalaureate (our variant of the SAT) would just leave a notebook with $20 bills under each page in front of the supervising teacher when they gave their paper in
Definitely a real thing, although I'm not sure about the amount
And the money given to the supervisors happened at the beginning of the exam, to make sure they look the other way when you tried to cheat
My highschool had a lot of night classes (seral), with older people who were trying to finally get their BAC diploma, and they were the ones who were paying these supervisors
Im so happy to read this
We came to Canada in 2001 from Baia Mare
I've always told people that romania is a beautiful country but its not fun to live in
I genuinely hope and wish romanian politicians and leaders would get their shit together and it sounds like it's happening slowly
> In my local Mcdonalds they were held in a mini-tramway next to the McDrive area
Dristor
> I doubt that counts for all or most of them really
I don't :))
How do you think they end up there all the way from Romania
If they were so poor they would beg in Romania
Also it's because you guys have a very high standard of living
You think you give them a little amount of money, but for them is better than the one they receive elsewhere (especially in Romania)
They "earn" in Norway and they spend in Romania (and not in the big cities, so the difference is even greater)
+You underestimate how much money you can actually make from begging
[Example] from a show from US
[Example] of "romanians" (few words that they use are in Romanian) that begged in UK
> the conditions they live under here aren’t worthy and pretty shocking
I agree and I don't really understand them
But they don't think like you and me, they have their own set of values
When I went to order frozen yogurt a few years back, I forgot the word for gummy bears and said it in english, so the cashier asked me where I'm from :')
I also frequently translate words directly, for example I wanted to say "the building's records" and I said it as "recordurile cladirii" (recorduri still means records, but only the more common meaning not this one), and my family still reminds me of that to laugh at me
For the most part people don't care much, some might think it's funny or that I'm not Romanian (at first), but I've had a negative experience of someone asking me "how did your romanian teachers ever pass you" or "you'll never get a job like this", as well as constantly correcting me
I honestly don't think my Romanian is That bad, but I'll admit my sentence structure tends to be wonky, and I need a bit more than most to think of words (this is only visible whenever I try to say longer sentences)
I don't care too much tho, cuz I'm moving to Spain in a few years anyway ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ (yes, I'm a stereotype lol)
Oh hell yeah
I forget words in Romanian and just blank out until I forget the word in English too and I'm just stuck there staring at the poor person I was talking to
Yep
I learned English to understand what games are saying and to read all those science articles that don't get translated, as a result I have trouble talking in Romanian about those because I genuinely don't know the translation
Same goes for creatures that I read first in English, and I discovered most people that do that refer to those creatures by their scientific name in Romanian
You would think that a snake so common kept as pet like the Mexican Black Kingsnake would have a name in Romanian too, but it doesn't. Lots of creatures are in the same situation
Yess I'm starting to have the ability of a toddler when it comes to explaining things in a coherent and normal way and it's so annoying, like how did that even happen, i'm still speaking my language everyday yet i'm losing vocabulary
It's even harder when you are trying to switch between 2 nonnative languages
Every time I speak German for a longer time and then switch to English or vice versa I sound like I'm having a  stroke
For day to day use no, but for work related (IT) issues, English is so much practical and concise, aside from being the ‘native’ language for most of the stuff related to my work
Most of the times though I find myself acknowledging that the primary advantage of English is being more concise over my native Romanian
Yes, oh God yes
I forget words in my native language but know them in English
Im top of my class in English and my teacher said she thought that i probably think in english instead of Romanian since i understand English easily but when translating i kinda suck
I use English daily
I feel like I'm getting better at English, not worse at my native language
I use it so much that I created my own language englo-romană or in English English English-Romanian
Yes, especially since I go to a private school that uses the Cambridge syllabus
I mostly use English to communicate with my friends (which are mostly Romanian) and that makes it even messier
I constantly have the fear of mixing the two and it somehow resulted in my self-esteem taking a huge blow if I can’t find a Romanian translation for an English word I know
I’ve shared my fears with my parents, they claim I speak Romanian perfectly, but my fear remains, as unjustified as it is
EDIT: Paragraphs were a mess
Yeah definitely
My boyfriend and I even randomly speak in English
When I write to my friends we often write in English
So much media we consume is in English it's hard not to end up this way lol
I've also been learning English since I was like 5, and so it just became second nature
I tend to find it easier to express certain thoughts in English, it just feels more natural I guess
I can't say I feel bad about it, it's just the direction I developed in
YES
I feel like it's getting worse year by year
Almost all entertainment and media that I consume is in English and I catch myself speaking English like 25% of the time, especially when texting
I used to find it a bit irritating when I saw/heard other people do it and now I'm just as guilty
There are so many words I know in English-but there is no translation in Romanian,or the translated word is unused/weird
Sometimes i even forget words in my native language,or thats just dyslexia
Wait what
What rules
There are rules
Like besides people /place names and the start of sentences
I don't know this in any language lol
Oh boy French classes here were always the teacher talking to themselves and students doing whatever
No one ever cared to even pretend to listen, save for a few kids
It used to be really bad, but now I’m fine with it
I use American accent but can sound a bit Slavic sometimes
I don't mind it, but I know it sounds generically Eastern European
I don't speak with any accent
Is this just me or a general Romanian thing
As a Romanian raised Irish person I think that my English accent is very heavily Irish sided and I do like it
Like some other people on this sub are saying, you shouldn't be ashamed of your accent
If you can convey what you want to say to the other party then that's fine for me
when i'm home alone speaking english to myself,you could probably tell i'm american if you were 50% deaf
when i have to speak in front of other people it's just horrible(bonus points if i'm nervous)
I don't know honestly, I do sort of have an accent but I never thought about it being that noticeable and it doesn't really bother me in english speech anyways as most people still can understand it
I'm disgusted every time I hear my voice when I speak English
I've been told by Americans that I have a French accent though in my opinion I don't sound french at all
Not really tbh, it doesn't sound weird or "russian" in any way but it's pretty obvious I'm not a native speaker
I do like it since half of Romanians have great English accents, but half dont give a fuck
Its like a slower american accent Id say
I sound like a far-eastern Russian trying to mock a British accent and when I was in London I was asked several times if I'm from Russia, so
yeah, I guess
Romanians don't have an accent(I'll explain)
Romanian is phonetic language,that is the sound in the alphabet match the sounds used in words,unlike English,the only exception are found in borrowed words and the 8 letter clusters and sound clusters
That makes our language without an accent,althought this aplies only for Muntenia and Dobruja
So Romanians have the advantage of learning Russian(the sounds â ă ș ț also exist Romanian) and English(since we don't have an accent)
If you hear a Romanian speaking English,it sounds like a Russian speaking English,but he forgot he's Russian XD
I have found that there are more Romanian English accents
There is the Eastern European one but there is also one that sounds more like an Italian/Portuguese accent
You def have a Romanian accent
It's extremely hard to hide
You can even hear it from guys like Andrei Terbea (has a yt channel), who has an almost perfect American accent
I have noticed this with everyone
Have seen native Germans make tons of grammar mistakes and native English people make them
I had to learn the grammar of German and English in school, whereas I never had to think hard on Romanian grammar because, most of the time, it would come out ok naturally
I figure that it's the same for other languages as well
Tbh, English is one of the easiest languages that I know of so every language might feel difficult for native English speakers
That's probably one of the reasons
Compared to German or Dutch though it's much easier
And Hungarian is one of the hardest languages I tried (and failed) to learn, German is a piece of cake by comparison
I do know that Hungarian is very different from germanic and latin languages so it's probably why native Hungarians don't find these languages so easy
And it's the same the other way around
My girlfriend is half Hungarian and has been trying to teach me some
I can read and pronounce but damn if I understand anything
You guys have no gender in the language, it's wild
Still trying
I live in a place with significant Hungarian population and would like to be able to communicate easily with everyone
Well, you'll notice that more then 45 minutes have passed and the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
Which I almost can't believe and hope I haven't jinxed it
It think the most simple answer is the price tag
People know phones need to be changed once in a while, they know phones are dropped once in a while so most aren't comfortable paying that much for just a phone
It's specially true now that calling, whatsapp/messenger/etc
and browsing is possible with almost every single phone out there
So buying a phone that costs more then a gaming system or a fridge (just examples) is kind of silly
To be honest a vast number of people in Romania aren't very rich and those that are well with money still have a more "value for money approch". Sure the  contracts for the carrier aren't expnesive at all and you could well get an iphone if you're willing to pay more for the contract
To be honest it seems to me and I'm not the only one here that apple products are  overpriced and so are the accesories
I had an iphone once but I really liked the android os as soon as I got it
Ro is on the poorer side of life
You're not gonna see people use iPhones unless they want you to (you know, the kind of people that keep flashing the amount of money they have)
Besides that, to buy an iPhone (if you don't live in the capital) means ordering online and some years ago this also meant ordering from outside the country because no inside company would bring them
Now there are more people that have iPhones than 10 years ago, but still not that many
Another thing is that when you buy a Sim card with a payment plan (ex: pay 5 euros per month for a year), you also get an android phone if you pay an extra 2 euros per month
Shittier phones come free with the plan
So what incentive would people have to buy an iPhone except prestige or some technological snobbism
I have friends that have iPhones, but all of them either received it from a relative that lives in North America or as gift from a snobbish family member or won it in a contest, etc
Really it's just the price difference and the specs are not that great either
I mean yes, iPhones are super expensive in Romania (considering the phone I'm using right now was 1
100 lei, which is approximately 230€ and works just fine) but I lived in Italy for a long period of time and iPhones are still not that popular
Sure, a few of the popular girls in highschool had them, but the rest of us had Androids, you'd rarely find someone with an iPhone
I guess it's also just the price
Since in Italy you can get a good Android for €250 and an iPhone is close to €900, maybe even more
i think that one of the reasons might be that apple is an american oem and americans just go for the in house stuff
idk or maybe it just became a trend and everyone likes to sheep along
or maybe NA is the least tech savvy nation so they just go for the simplest to use phone haha
as for europe,i think it's mostly because they're less expensive,dk how to explain the germany phenomenon,(i'm terrible at history so don't @ me)i think it's because of the past economy where people were forced to buy the most basic stuff(pls don't kill me if i'm wrong)but i think that the money saving theory applies to most european countries
on a whole,tech enthusiasts would rather go for android since it's less limited than ios
Why would i "invest" in a company (apple)that takes it's customers for stupid, and shits on them some examples: first and most important intentionally slowing down older phones to force people to but new phones,  removing  existing feautures on phones and selling them sepparate after, lobbying against right to repair laws in USA,   alot of iphone  fixing content blocked on youtube, and many more
Plus you can use your friend's charger if you need to
i kinda have to disagree on the android stuff
every android company has its own android "skin" so the os - or at least the ui - is not really the same
apple on the other hand makes stuff more simple,all iphones(and tablets for the most part) run the same os and the same ui,the macs have their own os and so do their watches
that's why most people go for apple products,because they're simple and seamless to use,not like android phones that each have their own individual ui
i personally am an android fanboy but i can totally understand where iphone users come from
or maybe i just misunderstood what you were saying haha,feel free to correct me if that's the case
>the question hasn't produce a Android vs
iPhone war
*sad pitchfork noises*
Is that shit for real
It just seems so unbelievable to me that she didn't know what the Play Store is
I mean, at least in Romania we have a lot of advertisement for apps and they always say something like "available in the Play Store" or if it's a poster they have the Play Store logo, so I don't know someone could be not aware of the Play Store
lol not if you get a huawei
jk you're right
I meant it more like a rhetorical question and expression of surprise, I wasn't actually implying you might be lying :)
I just find it very strange that a young person wouldn't know such a basic thing about phones, but alas, who am I to judge
I'd say it's Vaslui, the Detroit of Romania
Bucharest doesn't have that good of a reputation either
I'm not sure but I think Caracal due to some recent events
But the city we make fun of it's Vaslui
personally I'm the most dissapinted by Târgoviște
it had potential to be cool due to its history
but its kinda gone to shit now
its ugly, there's trash everywhere, there are lots of abandoned buildings, the historical places are trashed and poorly taken care of by the locals
the only thing saving this town is the chindia tower and all the museums
Vaslui news articles are the Romanian equivalent of Florida Man
Edit: Bucharest overall is okay, far from being comparable to Vaslui imo, I'd say it's mostly the ghetto neighborhoods like Ferentari
But almost every large city has those
Is it either or neither in this context
I can't really tell
I am a Vaslui native and the facts are the following:
The city (town) of Vaslui is actually decent or at least mediocre
The main reason Vaslui got this reputation is because of what happens in various villages across the county of Vaslui
If the county and its capital didn't have the same name then the perception wouls be different
You wouldn't say, for instance, that the people of Munich are barbarians based on what some idiots in some bumfuck village in Bavaria are doing
Detroit is a specific expression, not a shorthand for shitty place
For a city to be "like Detroit", it needs to be a former industrial city that fell apart after the factories were closed, causing many residents to flee to cities that had jobs for them
Vaslui was never a notable industrial town
Nooo, Vaslui beats Caracal for sure
Caracal only had this one recent event (which was horrible indeed), but generally it is hardly mentioned
In Vaslui there is a lot of fucked-up shit going on, it easily wins the contest of the most fucked up place in Romania lmao
It’s “either”, because you used “doesn’t” and English doesn’t accept double negations
Why not both
Who just sits on public toilet seats tho
Edited
Thanks
Moldova is definitely poorer and there would be something to say about Ukraine and Belarus and maybe Albania idk
Yeah the casino is a shame
But it is still a very good walk right next to the sea
It is nice to go there after beach(since it is you have a beach next to it) and after that chose from a bunch of restaurants
It is pretty cool but honestly you might as well go to somewhere better like spain
You might think of this as being cheaper but i assure you it might be the same or even higher depending on what you want to do
People also come there in summer to flex with their cars so there is that
I can say one thing
We always blame it on the traffic
My wife was having a baby
In Romania we say: my dog died
And since I'm living in UK:
Me: - traffic was horrible this morning
My colleague: - but you don't drive
Me: - shush, they don't know that
Came here to say this
Even in University, profs only get started 10-15 minutes after the official start time
It's gotten to a ridiculous point
I made a reservation for my birthday and made it for earlier so people have time to arrive but then I find out that someone has to actually sit there at the agreed upon time or they won't hold it for me
I ended up sitting alone with my girlfriend and another dude for 3 and a half hours until everyone gathered
I was planning for the whole thing to last around 2-3h total
And “the subway was too crowded, so I had to wait for the next one”
we aren't actually lying
Also, if you have to switch at Unirii station during rush hour, it means extra 10 min
That's how it's called here as well
Despite our lack of proper maintenance of many things in our country, subway is actually okay
Quite clean, tickets are not very expensive, some gates are new (especially the one in central areas and the new stations)
It is not as big or modern as the one in London or Paris, but it looks a bit better than the one in Warsaw or Budapest
However, for some reason I found the tube in London to be extremely loud compared to ours, but it might be because of the way tracks are built
It isn't smelly and some stations have convenient stores while the most central station has a McDonald in there
I still wish it looked like the one in Moscow (if you don't know how it looks like, I strongly suggest you google that
To be honest traffic is a major problem in Bucharest as too many people live there and public transporation is usually crap, so subway is probably the best and fastest way to move around the city
Also, really interesting that you have a Romanian girlfriend in Japan, haha
>I think overall Romania looks a million times better as people percieve it, sure its not rich but I never felt like it was poor
Thanks
A lot of people don't realize that
Funny that I've always dreamed to go to Japan as I grew up watching a lot of Anime and picking up Japanese words
I somehow consider it a dreamland
However, I never imagined there are a lot of Romanians there
Interesting
on paper: handy-man
in reality: jack of all trades
IT Support
IT Department but could work anywhere
Probably got the job for  money but has absolutely no idea what to do
Romania - that odd one who is sometimes considered crazy by other co-workers
Works in IT, early 20s, slightly underperforms most of the time but does really well on a few key projects
Frequently takes smoke breaks but doesn’t really hang out with anyone from work
Plays video games at home for most of his evening
I am that not very important staff guy that always steals everyone's shit
Hot and kinda slutty receptionist
Romania: IT support that takes too many smoke and food breaks, so he ends up working less than expected from the management department (Germany) he usually gets in fight with Hungary over which department is better
Like "I slip you an extra 5 Euro bill and you make my panini extra tasty" type of situation
Accurate
I would have said something related to oil
go to the main page of the subreddit and in the top left corner there will be 3 dots, press on them and go to user flair
Most of the time I don't even know what kind of English I'm using :/
I hope it's English tho
> couch
both couch and sofa
>sidewalk
what even is the british version of that
>pants (for trousers)
pants
>gas (for petrol)
i didn't even know it was correct to use petrol for gas, but i'm gonna use it from now on since it's identical to how we call it in my language
>vacation
Vacation
I use holiday to speak of celebrations (Christmas, Easter holidays, etc
) and vacation to speak of actual free days
>candy
not using sweets
>And what about accent
For example how do you pronounce the short O sound like in not
Or do you pronounce your word-final Rs
yes and yes, both in the american way
no reason
The sheer distance between everything and the fact that most americans consider an 8 hour drive no big deal
Super sweet everything
Really oldschool roads
( not bad but oldschool)
But otherwise nice people
The sheer distance between everything and the fact that most americans consider an 8 hour drive no big deal
Friend of mine saw a bag of six doughnuts for 1 dollar
Of course he made a joke about obesity levels in the US
My biggest shock was how small the statue of liberty was because when I saw it on TV I thought it would look completely different
Also beaches in California are not filled with models that will make you feel like you are in heaven
Of course dress code in Walmart or shops in general and morbid obesity
Also seeing an automatic rifle being carried by someone
How you balls freeze in a building all year round, I went to school and I was wearing a sweater and my colleagues were wearing shorts and flipflops during winter
It's frowned upon to put ketchup on pizza, i had all my American friends shocked when i asked for ketchup on pizza day
> Slovenia
you must be tall as hell
Same
There are a lot of inesane things I bumped into during my businy visits but two things stuck with me: I though sesism was bad in our neck of the wood but oh boy do they take it to a whole new level
Nobody blinks an eye that I'm a woman in a top technical position, I was a novelty in the late 2000's when I started but got no comments and was judged purely on my credentials even then but boy was I turned upside down and questioned left a d right while my male colleagues were just take as is
And second the work culture is borderline exploitative
Sure nobody's forcing you to work overtime on no pay but you better do it if you ever want a raise or a promotion
> Everyone on reddit seems to think that wearing shoes inside your house is weird
I can assure you people in real life think this way too haha
My wife is visibly disgusted every time someone jumps on the sofa or in the bed in movies while keeping their outdoor shoes on
Just get slippers or indoor shoes, c'mon
In Budapest they had quite a difficult to understand parking system, and we went up to a young woman to help us
She wasn't familiar because she didn't drive, but she spent 5 minutes searching for someone who knew and could explain
She finally found someone, it was a family coming back to their car in the parking lot, and they gave us their ticket, since they were leaving, and it was paid for the full day
Now that's what I call kind people
>  Is that a legit stereotype/stat
from what I heard, yes
Well we have indoor shoes for that
Like [these]
What is the bad thing happening right now in your country with everyones attention drawn to the obvious current subject
In Romania they are massively illegally cutting forests with even our government lying to our faces about it
Illegal logging
However, citizens are increasingly aware of this
The sad thing is that nobody knows who can actually help us
We have ghost companies selling masks to the government for millions of euro or city halls buying decorative fountains instead of funding the hospitals
Liquid Snake
Whats happening without being in the news
(Taking advantage the spotlight is on corona)
Good one
:))
There’s a dark secret lurking somewhere
They even bought lights and decorations for Easter (Suceava, nonetheless, which is a hot-spot of infection nationwide)
They should raise the quality of life and security for people
What do they want
A bunch of newborns with no future and fucked up families
Ilie (M) and Otilia (F)
Traian and Gelu for males and for females maybe Geta
Probably Haralambie and Zaharie in Romanian
I thought you guys were legally obligated to name your baby boys Atila, Arpad or Laszlo
Ileana is still quite popular here and it sounds good too
I would add Paraschiva, Filofteia and Neaga for girls
I thought letitia is just what our prime minstress called Latvia a year ago
Aren't Kaan and Kağan the same names
Also, I saw the name Gokhan in a turkish drama, it was the name of a highscbooler, probably not written Gökhan though
Are they Romanian
I know no Ilie IRL
To me it sounds like a name people use in more rural areas
You must be Ferdinand
Yeah, well I thought it comes from the old population of Geto-Dacians if that makes sense
Yeah, there are still many more
Is this some sort of Slavic joke that I’m too Latin to understand
It's actually short from Gherghina a variation of Georgeta or Georgiana
Vasile
Everytime I hear the name I picture a 75 years old man from the countryside, I can't imagine someone named Vasile being younger than 50
Are turkish names perhaps hierarchical
Are there some names that can be considered high class
Because sometimes here in romania, that's the thing
People in villages will have lower class names than people in cities
Omg my mom used to believe that shit but thankfully she's normal now
I remember she was afraid of toasters and microwave ovens when I was a child
I always imagine Vasile as you do, but drunk
Are they also Romanian
I bet my mom during the late 90s/early 2000s would match it and surpass it
Here are some of them:
- doing absolutely no work sunday and on religious holidays
- periodically drive to a monastery to bless the car
- periodically call the priest to bless the house
- keeping garlic at the house entrance to repel the evil spirits
- if traveling by train, pour sugar on the floor around the seat and in the compartment doorway (don't really know the reason for this)
- periodically burn incense and smoke the whole house, recite some prayers when smoking the corners
- if I felt sick she would burn some matches and drop the ashes in a glass of water which I would then have to drink for the curse to be lifted
- a different prayer and saint for everything (eg one for good food, one for good grades, etc)
- Not 100% antivax but ~40%
- scared of the following because of radiation: microwave oven, toaster (this one is the weirdest), phones, phone antennas, tv antennas, phone towers, computers and anything left in the wall socket overnight without good reason
- would talk about the good/bad energy she felt while interacting with people
It also had color
- many more, but these are just the ones which come to mind now
I don't know how I turned out normal tbh
Isn't the burnt match toxic
I mean, how wouldn't that make you sicker
Well I wasn't drinking the matches, just sipping from the glass that had some burnt matches on the bottom
I am still here so I guess it's safe
I'm personally very glad that this is happening
And I think loads of idiots in eastern Europe will complain
2050 it’s too long for me, 2025 would had been better
And all cars except hybrid or electric should be banned until 2020
That would cause a massive traffic decongestion in Bucharest for sure
It’s not about what you want, it’s about what it must be done
And that is the only way to archive the future
People would be upset but who care
Humans don’t know what they want until you show them
Only if you could stop being so selfish and think about others
I switch between English and Romanian pretty often but I do forget words in Romanian sometimes
Yes
Sometimes I think some sentences sound weird in Romanian so I say them in English and sometimes i forget the Romanian word and I have to translate it
I never had this problem
That being said, I learned or tried to learn lots of languages along the years
So I can recognize quite a lot of languages by accent and key words, even though I don't know them well
I've been learning english for about 7 or 8 years
About 1 or 2 years in i began thinking in english and not in my native language and i still do
This wasn't a problem until 3 years in when i knew about the same ammount of words in english as my native language and i began forgetting words in my language in favor of english
As an example, i just can't say Făină (Flour)
I just can't remember that word
Yep
I would be watching something in English and if some unexpected word/sentence in Romania pops up I have to think twice before I understand it
Same if I'm listening to the radio and a new song in Romanian comes along but the singer talks fast/ is hard to understand
The first ever perfect 10 awarded in the Olympic games went to Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci
We have an entire village displayed in a museum (Astra Museum of Folk Civilisation)
We have a cemetery called "The Happy Cemetery" located in the village of  Săpânța,Maramures and it's extremely colorful
The tallest wooden church in the world, and the second tallest wooden structure in Europe, is found in Sapanta Peri, Maramures of northwestern Romania
The 257 foot tall church is topped by a 23 foot cross that weighs 1,000lbs
Romania’s 22,298km rail network is the 15th most extensive in the world
Bucharest’s mass transit network is the fourth largest in Europe
Timișoara was the second city to be fully iluminated with elwctric poewer
We have the 'Happy Cemetery' 3
Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building
Transfagarasani highway is the most beautiful road
We have REALLY good internet
Romania is one of the largest producer of wine in the world and the third producer of cereal in the EU
Romanian is the only remaining Balkan Romance language that still exists
During the Cold War,Romania was the only Warsaw Pact member that didn't invade Czechoslovakia
Constanta is the largest port on the Black Sea
The Palace of the Parliament in Bucharest is the second largest building in the world(after the Pentagon)
I think that you have more saunas than cars
I didn't remember the exact measurements so I just looked up the measures and I got them from probably an American site
If only we had the infrastructure for it
Didn't saw it was in pounds and feet
I've heard my mother mention this bs as well
It's interesting to see it's a thing in other countries too
It’s the same in Romania :/
That the coronavirus was created by corporations in an attempt to lower population
Man, we really do have the lowest IQ in Europe
We have this exact same thing over here in Romania
Your Orban is more creative than our Orban
> that the evil european union wants to replace us all with muslims
Wait
I thought it was the Jews who wanted to replace all of us with Muslims
Did they switch it around this time
Or, does the evil EU = Jews
Oh come on Hungary, don't leave us like this
It's not
We have Soros conspiracies too
Not good, man
Nope
Keep your crazy Orban
> Do they also play into his Hungarian origins in Romania
Yes
That's why he's perfect as a boogeyman
I also heard some conspiracies about Soros wanting to take Transylvania and give it to Hungary
How about a recycling bin
This is an idea horrible, don't think you can even know who is doing the action
In my language have conjugations different based on which person is doing the action, but in english don't have such a thing
Not have sense, many languages have a order word very normal
Love cheese because has taste good
Who's don't like cheese
Don't know what say
Love puppies
What should say now
In language Romanian, tend not to use pronouns before a verb, as the conjugation form of the verb is usually enough
Also, double negation means negation
Understand that this is annoying
Cannot do nothing connected to this
Is very hard to write in English with the structure of the language of the Romanian, but want will try
Want to say "is doing action the".

Romania is way ahead of most of you, we have been boycotting this entire millenium
Hell yes
FIFA is a corrupted institution, Qatar is way worst
No team should go there
Let them organise a championship without any big teams, and even without the last edition champions
Yeah, a bitter joke
I think the bribes are very much an important part of the situation, cause it just shows how countries that don't deserve to host such an important event end up hosting it
Without the bribes there will be no WC in Qatar, and 6k people would be alive now
There was also this news that 15 out of the 16 people that had a vote when Qatar was elected as hosting country are now in jail or facing corruption charges
That is worrisome, to put it mildly
If I remember correctly, countries like Australia, Japan and South Korea were bidding to host WC 2022
Any of them would have made more sense, although I would have inclined towards Australia, since the other 2 hosted a WC 20 years ago
Do you think the EU should remove visa free access for US citizens until their country complies with EU law
Currently the citizens of Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland and Romania do not have visa free access to the US
These 4 countries have a total population of approximately 69
3 million, about 13
5% of the EU population, or 15
5% after Brexit
This means that approximately 1 out of 7 EU citizens do not have visa free access to the US, while every US citizen has visa free access to the EU
This is against EU law, [regulation No 1289/2013] and [regulation No 539/2001] which basically say that if a country has visa free access to the EU, then it should also give visa free access to all EU countries, otherwise EU members are required to react in common until the situation is remedied
The situation is not new, the US has failed to comply with this for 15 years now, and I think it is time for the EU to respond
You still might think that this isn't an important issue, but it actually is, by letting the US get away with differential treatment for it's member states, the EU undermines itself and it's members
Just recently the Romanian president visited the US president and among other things they talked about the visa problem Romania has with the US, two years ago during another visit they talked about the same issue and since then there has been no progress
By treating EU members differently, the US can essentially "bribe" these countries with things that it offers to some members and not to others, for example visa free access, and thus they can get easier concessions in negotiations, or maybe allow US firms to win government contracts where otherwise they wouldn't have
I think it is a big issue and it's time for the EU to address it
Sorry if this is breaking any rules, but I made this post on the /r/europe subreddit, and someone suggested I should also post it here
This is an important issue in my opinion and I am curious what do you think about it
You would be surprised but Romania and Poland are actually very close to the Nato agreed %. And that didn't help the negotiations or anything
You know why
Because It hAs NoTHInG tO dO WItH It
I frequently travel to USA
I have a 10year visa, it took maybe 3 days to get
Had no issues going in and out
Do I want more rights
- yes
Do I feel 2nd rate Eu citizen because of that visa
- no
Should USA stand by it's EU agreement and lift all visa requirements
- yes
Should EU revoke USA access
- no
Just make it uncomfortable at the airport, with some extra unnecessary checks like cash check, hotel arrangements details etc
See how you like standing for 2hrs in line
Yeah I agree
I 100% agree with you
Well
isn't Netherland the only country against Romania joining the Schengen
wait
yes they are
Same here but my nephew really wants to visit NY
It's one of his dreams and it's hard to explain to a kid why it's so complicated to have a simple  family trip there
I have two other friends applying for travel visas and it's been a nightmare doing all that paperwork and going through the whole process for a god damn week of visiting
In Romania an US soldier killed a person (a somewhat band-member of pretty popular band) and guess what
Got away with it
Then again I recently saw a documentary on netflix about the honey industry in the US, and they were felling hopeless that they can't extradite a german who was convicted in the US
I was starting to think I am the only one noticing that the world has a huge lack of functioning brains in key positions
I can only imagine thousands of Florida men invading the streets of Europe wearing those flowerish shirts and long white socks with sandals
brr
I heard something about Rotterdam being the biggest marine hub for EU imports/exports and Netherland feeling threaten by Constanta port at the Black Sea
But tbh I don't see how Constanta could ever equal Rotterdam
Romania has no infrastructure for it and this development could take a very long time
From my understanding a route from Asia and Middle East via Black Sea would save a lot of money but it is also more dangerous considering the recent events in the region- so I don't think this concern is fully justified
But who knows
It's not stupid
It's economy and they are protecting theirs
The only way to change something is by having the big transport companies putting pressure on Netherland in order to save money
But who owns the biggest transport companies
Mostly nordic countries and German companies
It's like House of Cards and we are on the losing side
The sad truth is that they are asking the wrong questions
The question is not *"What do we lose"* but rather *"how can we all benefit from it"*. Europeans still have to work on this issue and I hope they will temper their egos and start working together for the benefit of everyone :)
Yes
and I think we can all agree that EU had/has some rough times
But for me it seems like a maturity transformation and if our leaders can find a way to collaborate we will all benefit
If not, we will return to nationalism and fighting for individual survival
So that is why we don't force things with US visas or Schengen or stuff like that
We know it takes time and we are doing it baby-steps so that everyone is ready for the next level of diplomacy relations
"Winter's not like summer", Traian Băsescu, then minister of transport
Oh boy Viorica Dancila wins here
- She mentioned that she used to tutor math
When a reporter asked her what is the area of a circle she confidentely said r^2
- "This misinformation is simply a lie"
- She said 2020 as twenty-twenty
It doesn't work in Romanian and it sounds stupid af
- She pronounced Boeing as "Boing". Three times
- " We can say that we will reduce democracy
uhh
bureaucracy"
- "People who misinform the EU are autists"
- "Of course we are not trying to intervene with the problems of other member states(EU members) such as Iran and Pakistan"
There are many more but they are pretty hard to explain in english (mostly grammar mistakes)
*Is in the capital of Montenegro , Podgorica*
Former Prime Minister (Viorica Dăncilă) : "It is an honour for me to be in Pristina"
And Mircea Geoană taught that he would become President , he was that confident to say : "Dear Romanians we won !" , Traian Basescu got elected instead
I think I mentioned it before
Bucharest's mayor, Gabriela Firea, had a CT done and and she found out there's a metallic wire in her colon
Well, she decided it was a good idea to put those images on her facebook and accuse the opposition (mainly the president and his party) of "inserting a metallic wire up her colon".
Now to make it worse, she has a family
I don't wanna know what her kids will think of her when they grow up and read that post
everything Viorica Dăncilă has ever said is stupid
The socialists literally voted over night to offer independence to some 3 counties that proclaim themselves hungarian
Worst move ever
Our president foamed over TV the next day haha
President of Romania literally said a week ago that an important political party in Romania is giving the west and central part of the country for free to another country, Hungary, just like that
(Ofc he was lying)
I mean
he's not wrong
Mentioning Băsescu, but not our former prime-minister, Viorica Dăncilă. What is this travesty
Ah man
I laughed so hard
Btw, in Romanian whale is 'balena'.
> It could be understandable, since in hungarian, bálna means whale, but what even is whale breeding
Hungary is landlocked
yet it still was ran by a fleet admiral long ago
This is in 'too stupid to be real' category
how do people like this end up running something like gazprom
She's basically stupider than a brick and she has scripted speeches because again, she's stupider than a brick
And slower than one, too
May whatever controls our lives have mercy on Romania
Please
And yet my dad has the balls to say that Iohannis is somehow dumber than her because he speaks slower
I mean, I understand that he is a hardcore PSD-ist and considers Antena 3 the voice of God, but come on
[She can't even speak English , leave alone Romanian]
Viorica Dăncilă would like to speak with him , I am sure that they can be friends :D
It's really hard to pick just one thing
iirc he's an ex teacher and he speaks exactly like teachers when they have to dictate in a way so even the slow kids finish writing
just take a random quote from her and it should be fine
Closing the churches
Romania is running out of our favorite drink, Mona (it is actually medical alcohol but people drink it because we are a superior civilization)
Somehow this is the most French thing I have ever read
Nah, tbh i never forget Iceland
Its the maps that forget them
Nope, it is actually a big thing in Romania to dream to visit Iceland
No, I never forget it's there
It's a gorgeous country and I always wanted to visit it, so it's on my mind a lot
I forget Iceland exists way too often, its just not involved in anything significant
Yes please give us any trains that go faster than 50 km/h
I would
But I'd want it to pass through Bucharest
Just today I saw an article about a hyperloop future map of the EU
Appareny the EC is starting to look into it
Such an initiative is impossible since it would have to pass through Romania
For some reason infrastructure projects can't fucking manage to ever be completed in Romania :(.
I do
But I am very curios that if it passes through Romania it wont be a high speed rail
only a slow speed rail:)) CFR pls
Man 50km/h is good speed
Try 20km/h with a 30 min stop every other hour
And I thought we were the only ones 'discussing' about the connection with the airport
To be fair thought we might finish the line after decades of talks in Bucharest because of the UEFA European Championship
They have my blessing then
This is honestly something SF
It's painful that we are able to build it, have the money, have the manpower but our CFR (public rails company) somehow only manages to not do shit
Whenever you see an r/askeurope post, do you skip through the comments to find your own country or browse through it normally
I usually skip to Romanian comments to find things i relate to but if im really interested i just browse normally
No bias whatsoever
Best/Tot/New are my only criteria for browsing
But once I do lock on a thread, I check to see what country replies to what country
Since not all questions have Romanian answers I do browse for my country
I do tend to skip to romanian comments
Same here
Maybe it’s a Romanian thing
Well hello there
I love hungarians replying to us Romanians and vice versa
Same but with Romanian flairs
Not quite as common here as in Western Europe since we have a lot of poor people in small villages, but most people only knows about Africa from those documentaries where they show tribes of savages with no water or food and houses made of grass
People are always surprised when I told them there are cities in Africa and internet
I was surprised once to see a UNICEF poster with a dark skinned girl that was Indian and not African
That's how the situation is
there is no such thing in Romania
I am not surprised to hear there are this kind of ads in the western parts of europe, we don't have enough money to support our selves so no one is going to donate to an outside organisation when there are so many that need help inside the country
No love for Eastern Europe
Murmur has the same meaning in romanian
I find it beautiful and calm but only in romanian, the english version sounds like someone is getting bored by saying the word
Why would the first "mur" sound different than the second one
Oh boy when I first started reading Harry Potter, I didn't have any way to watch the movies, so I read the names the way it seemed logical to read them
I thought Hermione was pronounced "Hare-me-ohn" and read Seamus the same way you did haha
I completely forgot about that
The 4th book came out after I started watching the movies but it must've been helpful to people who hadn't
Gods I wish I could experience the books again for the first time
They need to come quick with that selective memory erasal
Damn how did you go around not seeing the movies but having read the books
It's pronounced her-my-oh-nee
I remember this word from the Harry Potter books which take place in the 90s.
Never got one but we used to get a catalogue from a local furniture store at my old house
As kids we would look through and pick pages we liked most and dream about having our rooms like that
Unknown to us mom had ripped one of those pages for safekeeping and after we moved she ordered that furniture set for my sister's and mine bedroom
Sadly they neither had the neat blue color that was in the catalogue or the sea creatures themed handles anymore (it had been years between that catalogue being issued and us moving) but it still was very neat to see it in life
We still have it to this day
Yeah, I received it once or twice
I always liked looking through them, but I understand completely why they decided this
It’s 27 degrees here and it’s almost November, this is not normal
Fu*k supermarkets
My problem is that it's the third year my pickles are ruined because of the warm weather
I like my salted pickles but they can't get ready if the weather keeps being warm and I don't own a dark basement to keep them cold :((
Romania used to have sooo many snow in Winter and now you wake up with +5 Degrees
On the other hand Romania has been having pretty harsh winters recently
I feel that western europe has been spared the climate change of the 90s and 00s when eastern europe started having heatwaves and no-snow winters
I mean the climate change is horrible but I can’t complain about 24 degrees here
Minus wouldn't be normal either
That makes a good line to get more people involved in the climate strike movement
Still better than Kelvin
Generally Germans are seen here in a positive light
They have the reputation of being hard working and honest people
That said, there are still a few people who hate Germany do to conspiracy theories
To sum it up shortly: we elected a German ehtnic president in 2014 who used a campaign focused on German values
He also won a second turn in 2019
It's sort of a mixed bag here
Our president has German origins (is from a German speaking minority in Romania) and the anti-German sentiment became very evident when he was was running for the presidency
It's still there, people saying he's not "one of us", that he is not working for the welfare of the country, but for the western interests, because GERMANS
Plenty of nazi comments as well, cause Germans are of course all nazis
He's not a very good president, but definitely not because of his ancestry lol
Then there's the universal idea that "German made" is good quality
And the general stereotypes of Germans being strict and well organised, German products are good because they make things better there, etc
>Also some Slavic friends of mine, arguing that Germans are oppressive and expansive by nature and very rude, unfriendly and humor-less
Germans are literally one of the nicest people I've met, I was actually surprised by how polite and friendly everyone was as opposed to many people from my country lol
Generally no
Germans are viewed in a positive light in the current generation, and it's the same case for the older one who lived through WW2
My grandmother is from a village, next to which there was a large German garrison in WW2
The locals were treated well and traded with the Germans while they were stationed there
I know this wasn't the case in other countries, but here they mostly kept to themselves and didn't bother the locals
In contrast when the Russians came my great grandfather upon hearing what was going on in other places, took his family into the mountains and stayed there until 1946 out of fear
So they had a far better opinion of Germans when contrasting it to the Russians
Lesser evil
I haven't heard of anything like that in Romania
I'm not really sure it was ever a thing, maybe just around the war time
But comunism got us an people had poverty to make them forget the wars
After the comunism fell, school change
I learned german in high school and I got to know a lot of people interested in german culture
People in romania are chill about west European people
Many of the old people I know don't even seem to know that there are differences between western countries, they just know they are all more evolved than Romania and that is it
(I said I learned the language, but I forgot almost everything
No offense, but that language is so complicated I got to hate it a bit
But I'm not sure you can count this as anti german sentiment
The general sentiment here (among people who are aware of other countries of course, cuz most live in their own little bubble and couldn't tell you the capital of Belgium if their life depended on it) seems to be that the Germans have "gone soft".
That the current leadership of germany is too left leaning
I've heard "They should invest more in ther military"
"They should take a more agressive stance against Russia" and things like that
Not a lot really about WW2 Germany
With the people that I did talk about that period, most say "oh yes they were great civilised people" .
"If they wanted a chicken from you they'd buy it, when the Russians came they just took everything"
These people however don't seem to realise the fact that the reason why that might seem as such to us is because The Germans were our allies in the war and the Russians crossed our border in 1944 after 3 years of war in which we killed millions and millions of their people
TLDR: Most people don't know anyhhing about Geo Politics or History, many of the ones that do think Germany has gone too soft
About WW2, people live under the false impression that the germans were civilised and the Russians were savages because they can't make the difference between allied and enemy troops marching trough your land
Many view Germans not as bad as Russians
Let's not forget that our president is of German ethnicity and he won the last elections with 66% (in the 2nd round)
And If I recall correctly, even the crazy rhetoric wasn't about him being specifically German, but that he "is selling our country to the foreigners".
Not exactly
It's mainly about how everyone either leaves for germany or simply work there and come back home with money
Well, I talked with some romanians from Germany who said that all peope from the Balkans work very much in your country comparative with a muslim and the fact that you use them as cheap  manpower but after that they are smth like "Do you like my BMW
I bought from Germany" , ,,Did you see my house
I build it with the money that I worked in Germany" and things like that
:))
If you're refering to the recent Covid 19 cases and the hell that followed (including reports of working conditions) then yes, we had some news article and discussions about this in the past month and a half or so
Until now it was pretty much about explotation from italians (not all, just mostly in the south) and different incidences
Now Germany entered the discourse
The truth is that most of the exploitation is done through other romanians (of course with the german/italian/british counterpart agreeing) and are towards people coming from very poor place and often uneducated (enough)
It's basically trapping people that feel don't have any other chance
This should be a broader discussion but it's unfortunately overshadowed or quickly forgotten
There is little we can do in Romania against this if the "host" country doesn't do nothing (number one reason why after these many years we still have exploitation in Italy) and in this regards I think Germany recently started discussing on modifying some of it's laws (according to what I've read in our media)
He is ok
Some may say that he is pretty lazy for its german heritage but he's the best option so far
Yes and no
Our president was more then once compared to Hitler, of course
And some people literally believed we're going to be gassed if we elect him
And for fuck sakes he's even a sucky orator so the comparison is mute from the start
On the other hand if modern Germany would want to invade today's Romania a lot of us would probably be very happy to learn german
Just don't give nothing to Hungary
Same in Hungary
:))
Even though our health system is pretty shitty and underfunded (some state hospitals are in a really bad state) we do have universal healthcare
At least I know that if I have an emergency, I won't have to declare bankruptcy
And I did need it to go to ER in the past few years and all I had to pay was for some of my medication
Also, a lot of medication can be compensated, this means you won't have to pay hundreds of euro for a dose of insulin
Y'all need universal healthcare, my dude
Good or bad, it can be a lifesaver, literally
My country is not as economically developed as most western european countries are
That being said, the hospitals are pretty ok I'd say
The big ones I mean
Sure the American ones are better, but when I cracked the skin of my head open and had some really bad deep scratches on a lot of my body, they drove me 10km with the ambulance, I stayed internated for a night, they use anestysia on me twice and gave me a lot of antibiotics and I went for checkups for like a month
Costed me 0$ .
The treatment I recievied is comparable to what I'd get anywhere in the western world
My brother had a very serious car accident like 6 months ago involving one death, and they had to remove his spleen and he had some cracked ribs too
They kept him internated for more than a month
When shit got tough, they sent him to the capital
The total cost was some 2000€ and that was all brides
Corruption and what not
Still a lot less than what'd cost in the US
And that's costs that you wouldn't meet in say France
Overall I'd take my country's healthcare over the US's any day
The French or German healtcare systems are flying spaceships compared to both tho
Even Romania has free healthcare even tho its not great but its still there
Personally I use a Water Filter Pitcher but I think most people drink tap water here as well
I don't trust tap water because afaik it contains a high quantity of chlorine
Yes, it is
Even in Bucharest, which have a reputation of water being polluted, I never had any issue with it
I don't trust tap water, and I prefer carbonated anyway
Even if I drink still chances are higher it'd be from a well than the tap; not a fan of the idea
Don't drink tap water in Bucharest
In the rest of the country it's fine
But in my family at least, you never give guests tap water
It's somehow not polite
You have to buy bottled water for the guests
The water is good,but once you start using bottled water for an extended period of time,let's say more than 4 weeks,your throat will try to do anything it can to stop you from drinking the tap water,your body will literally refuse to take a sip
You can actually try this it takes less than a week to get back to being able to drink tap water
Yeah uncommon here, the tap water is safe, but we don't trust it
Same my brother
Although chlorine is perfectly safe to drink considering that the quantity that is in the tap water is really low
The taste might not be very favorable though
Really
What part of the country
Places where I lived (Moldova and in Bucharest) the vast majority of people would either use some kind of filter (either a Brita or something built into their kitchen sink), or would buy those 5L bottles from the store
I've been drinking Bucharest tap water and I'm still around though, so it's probably fine
Same here
I used to drink bottled water but switched to a Brita to reduce plastic consumption
The water tastes fine straight from the tap but if you let it sit for a while it gets kinda nasty
In Bucharest, we bought a water cooler like those you found in an office and would order 19L bottles for it
We recently switched to a classic water filter and drinking tap water
Tastes the same and it’s probably cheaper in the long run
I've got one better, the kitchen tap tastes yucky
The main bathroom tap though, tastes like fresh spring water, and it's always colder that whatever "cold" water the kitchen gets, so we drink that one
But we do have bottled water too, for pets that can't have tap water
And of course, lots of sparkling water
Only saw them in teleshopping, nobody actually buy them here
What do you mean with really ? You don't think those who buy bottled water or use a filtration system are in minority ? Even you said that you're drinking tap
I'm from AG :-)
Same brothers
Yeah I think they are the majority at least in the places I mentioned
I'm not a representative sample :) I've lived abroad and that's how it occurred to me that i can drink tap water
Pretty often
I feel bad because I have to be corrected by the person I'm talking to
Romanian and English are pretty similar in some aspects because they both originate from Latin and use the Latin alphabet
For example I was talking to someone and I said "introvert" just like I would say it in English, but I got corrected with "introvertit" being the right word
So yes, sometimes I mess up similar words
When I need to debate or to talk about something
For some reason it’s almost always easier to say that stuff in English
That goes for more eloquent language as well
Very often I can use fancier language when speaking in English than I can in Romanian
Everyday, multiple times a day
Most of the media I interact with is in English and most of our uni curriculum too
Oh yeah, and its extremely frustrating when you know the person you're talking to doesnt know english well enough to know that word
having learned both English and French and speaking them on a daily basis makes all my explanations to other Romanian folks trilingual
>how to ask for more pillows in a hotel
_You sir make it sound like a matter of national security
Yeah, it has some latin influences but definitely not a romance language
Not giving the old people your seat in the bus/tram
Never ever bring someone an even number of flowers (it is reserved for the dead)
Don't ever, ever say anything bad about someone's mother
Not even if it's true or if you think it's a joke
You can make fun of people's weight, religion, politics, anything you want, worst case scenario the joke won't be funny
But say anything even remotely bad about someone's mother and things will go from "hahaha" to "wtf did you just say to me" in one second
Our capital is **Bucharest** not **Budapest**, and we aren’t Slavs nor Gypsies
You sound English, are you English
In Bucharest old ladies rushing in the tram to grab a seat is like an olympic sport
I got violently pushed aside so many times by frail old ladies in tram 41
I can't tell if they had ptsd from younger people not giving up their seats, or if we, younger people, have ptsd from them running for the seat
It’s funny how this happens all the time in 41 considering you can wait 30 seconds for the next one if that one is too full
It must be the most frequent tram in Bucharest but the old ladies never disappoints
Some people really feel entitled to their seat
The maddest one I've witnessed is an old man on crutches got on the full bus, happened to stand near some lady who was sitting, she then shouts at a young girl on the other side of the crowded moving bus to get up so that the old man can go take her seat
Ngl line 41 should already be a meme or a reference to România at how infamous it is
Most of the older people only have the good memories from the communist era and they would tell you they've lived better in those times
Communism is a sensitive topic, so you have to be careful when you are talking about it with older people
My grandpa is 80, and he could tell you at least 10 reasons why he thinks it was better in the communism than right now
A very Big NO NO
By any chance, were you in germany last summer
I generally agree, I for once can’t sit on a sit if there are other people in the bus, but some of them are very rude so if it wasn’t for my annoying empathy, I wouldn’t let those
I got in a bus once when it was empty and took a seat
It got full eventually, but I still had my window seat, looking out the window
I heard some ramblings and curses to my right but ignored it, as none of those were addressing me
All of a sudden this 40 year old who was standing grabs me by the jacket and starts yelling at me, at that time a 15 year old, that she's pregnant and I don't get up, how dare I and who raised me so badly
Who's she
And how can I sense there's a pregnant lady hidden among the standing passengers in the bus if I had my head turned looking out the window and no one says anything to me
Luckily for the pregnant lady, I was nearing my stop so she could sit down
But communication goes a long way
it's much easier to ask for a seat, than expect something and getting angrier with each passing second
Yes, funerals, if you bring flowers to the cemetery, or to monuments or statues of dead people
It goes so far that wreaths also must have an even number of flowers in them
Half of Europe apparently
You should see how funny it is when women receive flowers from multiple people and have to make sure they distribute them so that they don't put an even number in a vase :)
Yeah it gets real game of thrones around rush-hour on line 41
Most of them did struggle in those times
Especially in the '80 when Ceaușescu decided to pay upfront all the country debt by all means
So food ratios started to get smaller, it was hard to get any food from the stores
People would have money but couldn't spend it on anything because there was no products in the stores
They were not able to build homes either because Ceaușescu wanted people to live in blocks
People that were around 30 years in the '80 despite communism
Older ones still praise it
Yes
They were right next to me on a plane to romania
It was really wholesome to see him practicing romanian
Damn roads, we have the fewest kms of roads in Europe
We are the country with the most population not being able to afford a vacation
Well we Romanians have quite the selection to choose from
I dont reallt have a source on this but I suspect we are the country thqt comes last in most statistics in the EU
Hey i live in Bacău
Can't remember the news report, I think it was per area
Vacation not vaccination
Condoleantele mele
And happy cake day
You can edit the flair and delete the flag
Wait why
It looks fine to me
Mulțumesc fratemiu
Well I didn't expect you to point it out :D
Oh okay
Awkward no, aggressive yes
There's a specific set of people, the "passionate for history" kind, that are also a bit of elitists/insecure that just need to teach everyone the "correct" history of the world
I was in an international school for about 2 months once and there were people from all over Europe and a couple of places in Africa and Asia
All of us were ignorant about stuff about the other countries
We had so many dumb conversations that ended up with some of us being less ignorant at the end
There were some people there that felt the need to teach everyone about their own history and culture
A guy corrected me on several stuff about Romania's history
He also kept trying to get into arguments with all the western Europeans
It's not like he knew more than anyone else or that he had better information or some shit
He just really wanted to proven that he knew shit we didn't or that we were brain washed
This dude was also white trash that almost punched a guy for trying to change the conversation
In that school I learned that you should just avoid the people that try to direct every conversation to some historical shit cuz it might be really annoying to deal with it
Stress
These are countries with high amounts of hours of work per day I believe
they got more peasants
those people live healthy at old age
I think the major factor is the laid-back attitude
I've been to Spain a couple of times and people are not stressed, they smile, they are welcoming and are just simply chill
As opposed here, everyone is grumpy, has a lot of problems which are treated with way more anxiety than in other countries and simply are not that happy
I traveled a bit around Europe, but Spain is the only place I'd see myself move in Europe because of that exact feeling of relaxation
L.E. Diet, healthcare and general public service quality play a major role of course, but the mentality is what struck me the most, at least a my age where I don't have health issues and I can afford good private healthcare
oh, sorry, must have gotten them mixed up
I will move to Estonia for the sole purpose of speeding, and then spending an hour annoying the police as much as I can while still abiding by the law
“Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Are we there yet
Cry, study en masse and bringing little portraits of jesus christ so we can pray for jesus to help us pass this exam, or beg forgiveness for our sins
We dont have any tradition of doing this but 3 years ago, when I finished my middle school (last year of hs now) I remember me and my colleagues put all the desks as a border in the middle of the class and played something that I think is called Labtennis in english (basically tennis with your feet and a football) and then we put all the tables back, unscrewed all the light bulbs
Every student got on a table and we were throwing them to each other until each one broke
The only example I can think of is Cillian Murphy in Peaky Blinders
There are a couple of scenes where he speaks Romanian and it's not that great, but I can understand what he's saying
Do you have any examples
I cant remeber a film where foreigners spoke Romanian
Genuinely curious
Agents of shield is super cringe, vampire films, vampire series (van helsing is awful, and they make that vampire speak multiple times in Romanian
Oh no
I totally forgot about the existance of vampire films set in Romania
But thanks for the info
I will now proceed to forget these exist
Good day
Haha
I find this very awkward but i still do it anyway
Glad to see it's not only happening here in Romania
Also, when i was a kid and stayed in my grandparents small village for a month or two people i would always say hello to passing people ( that's what my grandma said to me )
if the person i said hello too did not recognize me they would always ask me who am i or who my parents are
( al cui ești ?! - who do you belong too
in a very basic translation ) Fun memories
Reading the question, I thought it was a Romanian asking because this is the habit everyone here has
We say hello to random people only on the mountain
And in villages
If its someone who works on the mountain like a shepers or something then yes but if its another climber its not traditional
You know a country is big on hiking when they have a long set of rules about how to say hello on the mountain
For me in the country side we say hello but not on trails
We never do atleast and only greet back if greeted
I've heard that if two strangers meet on a mountain trail in Netherlands they have to fight until only one lives
Handshaking the guys everytime you see them, which in Romania is normal, in the Netherlands no, and here you also have to hand shake women too
Kids riding the pig after you killed it for Christmas
WTF indeed
We had this before 1989 on VCR, when almost all available* movies were dubbed by the same lady
*read 'smuggled'
Nah, is common in many European countries
Never had it but it's not considered outlandish here
We call that "șpriț".
He can't answer, probably had an aneurysm
Not really
It seems most of our ancestors marriages were between relatives, distant or not
I will try to respond kind to this stupid question
No, we hug them, women in Romania thinks is very disrespectful to shake their hands except when you meet them for the first time
That doesn't mean you should make extreme assumptions just because a culture is different
Haha, for me is uncomfortable to handshake everyone
I think you just get used to
Crăciun Fericit
Crăciun Fericit
Crăciun Fericit flăcăi!
Well i wish you a merry and a happy
I personally like this, altough I'm not sure it fits what you asked:
"Să te ia Hanul tătar
" is an old saying meaning "The Tartar Khan shall take you" and is mostly used by old people to curse people that annoy them or they don't like
We have the same in Romanian
We have the exact same expression in Romanian, with the same meaning („a șters-o englezește“)
Every time Charles tries to speak Romanian
I appreciate the effort but
I dont understand anything
Yes in romania we have a guy "iwant2c:(I think) and his melody called "catena"... fidnt understand anything(almost) from it
We've got these "trappers". They just mumble completely random words (usually types of drugs and derogatory names of women) and try to make it sound like it rhymes
And people actually listen to them
A lot
Some of them got to make a song with bbno$ where he was singing the hook in English and the guys were trapping in Romanian
I swear we didn't understand anything more than the foreign listeners
I know very very little about Hungarian, except for a few letter pronounciations, but I believe in The Usual Suspects the Hungarian was genuine, no
Only video of the [full scene] I could find
Farty five sheep
I just looked up a [video] kinda sounds like Portuguese hahah
Seems like they just straight up handed him a written speech without explaining diacritics or ce/ci/ghe/ghi
But honestly the Italian scene from Inglourious Basterds is my favourite scene from a movie, ever
Bawnjawrno
Well, you can tell he hasn’t been practicing a lot, but I could understand him, so I don’t think it’s *that* bad
In Romania they say that if you don’t study well, you will end up working at Macdonalds
What do they say in your country
ik I'm also from romania
but I've been told that I'll scrub toilets if i don't study well
In Romania they also say that you will become a builder that works hard
In Romania they also say that u will live in a fucking garbage bin if u don't memorize the entire history of Romania
Traiesc de aproape 17 ani in Romania insa nu am auzit asta niciodata
That's what my family was doing while I was a kid (though with cabbage and tomatoes), and they are probably still doing that
It's real and honest work
And standing on your knees, in the field, with the burning noon sun above you, collecting beans, really shapes you up as a kid
Hated it then, but oh man did it teach me how to work
One of friends wanted to become a garbageman because he liked being one in SAMP
Offtopic: Do British people say "arsehole" instead of "asshole"? That's the first time I notice it
It's a 20th century trend, go to a good Uni, get a good job, work there 20+ years, and then retire
People think that this is a magic formula but 21st century showed that it is a shitty strategy
Hard for some people to understand that Transylvania is a real place
This doesn't actually qualify since it happened to a friend, she lived abroad for 2 years I belive and she was once asked if there is electricity in Romania
That Transylvania exists
As a Romanian, when i say to italians that i was born in Transylvania, they ask me : "can i see Dracula
" It is a joke indeed, but EVERY person i met told me "Oh, Dracula
" after i said that i am romanian, so yea thats sad on a side because we deserve to be recognized for many other things, but people don't know anything but Dracula
On the other side, to be positive, it means that is really is a know story
Another question is :"Are you guys so poor
Now
I should stay here for 2 hours at least, but i can say that as EVERY other country, we have rich, benestant regions and cities like Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Iaşi, Timişoara, Braşov, Galaţi, Craiova, Constanţa, Brăila, ecc
,  where life is quite good, of course if you are wanting to work and to study, we are still developing
And faster than other developing countries
Our population may be getting lower and lower, but it's good, because those 19 millions who fight for a better Romania are doing their best, the fault is on the politicians and on those who vote them
And those 4 million abroad are struggling to get back to Romania, or to help their relatives who are there
Now, we also lack on infrastructure, on roads, on healtcare, but its because our corruption is as high as Italy's, maybe even higher, and of course there are poor regions
And thats normal
Romania is indeed half-broke, but the important is that its people are wanting to change
Slowly, but still changing
So, two things: we are not as poor as people say we are, and we helped humanity with many other things than inspiring an Irish dude to take Vlad Ţepeş and make a legend about him as a vampire
A romanian invented the engine for airplanes, another one invented the pen, you would still take notes witch pencils if it wasn't for him, and many other things
Bye
That our language is not russian
I had to defend the Netherlands on this one occasion lol
I just came back from a cultural exchange from the Netherlands and it was amazing
In the geography class back in the Romania, the teacher said that the dutchies don't speak dutch, but flemish
I ended up arguing with that stupid man on the fact that you may find flemish speaking people in the Netherlands, but dutch people will speak dutch
Then he said something among the lines that dutch is actually flemish or something like that
One time a guy from US asked me if the Pizza comes from Romania
“For the hundredth time, Romanians are **Latin
** We have ‘ROMAN’ in the name
This pales in comparison to the time somebody asked my mother if they have chocolate in Romania
When I was in eight grade a group in my class went in a school trip in France (some francophone program)
They were asked almost the same questions
:))
Too soon
Yeah I tend to say Transylvania when asked where I'm from because they don't automatically make the connection to Romania and assume I'm a gypsy
It's easier to explain that Transylvania is a real place than talking about gypsy statistics
Tieni un F in segno di rispetto per non aver dato uno schiaffo a quelle americane
È per via del fatto che siete conosciuti per i gesti che fate con le mani, e anche per i molti dialetti
Non è una brutta cosa, però c'è chi la prende troppo sul serio
It's because you are known for your hand-gestures, and for dialects too
It's not a bad thing, but there's who take it too seriously
Salutes from Romania
What is electici tea
Never heard of
Yeah my father had to explain that he understands what a fridge is
Wild
You guys have electricity
•-•
Are you from Turkey
It's because people can't understand why both communism and fascism are/were a lot alike in some areas while being totally different in others
Finally, you guys have potatoes
Even though Romania is higher than latvia at potato production apparently
Just jump over it lol GG ez
Some guys in Romania used it to get back at some French comedians for a "Romanian beggers" joke once
Stop throwing that type of shade
We are getting there :)
Well, lets say that the impaling thing was true, as Vlad used to impale ottomans to scare them, and that the castle is a real thing, but without the Irish guy it couldn't have been known, and without the things i said first, the Irish guy couldn't get the inspiration for Dracula
I would like that both our countries could be more appreciated, and not anyone claiming anything
Lets say it was an unwanted cooperation :P
In all fairness this was in early 2000 and most likely Romania only got in the news with it's extreme poverty after the fall of communism (and during communism) and two or three digits inflation at that time
But it's exactly the same principle
People take for granted what they see TV for 5 minutes in a 2 minutes commentary, a movie or a tv-show
Then they assume that poorer means they live in some sort of a remote african village where plumbing, cars, tv's have no use
Unfortunately this ignorance is a human trait
Just for example
I'm pretty sure that quite a few romanians (and this could very well be extentended to all europeans) think Mexico is just a bit more modern "wild west" and South Africa is a safari with starving children
And I'm saying this because I've literally talked to people who truly believed this
They couldn't care either way but that's the knowledge they had on those places based on what they've seen on 'television'. It's not about bad faith but just pure ignorance
I'm pretty sure in some remote places some pupils still go by cart
Albeit now it would be more of a choice (there should be school buses for such places)
You mean there's no yee-haw going on in Texas
Nah I don't want to lose my clients, but I will with others
ahahahah hai fatto bene, anche se una volta ho provato degli spaghetti con le polpette normali, e non era così male
Poi vabe, sono gusti

Grazie
È una lingua molto bella, e anche abbastanza semplice da imparare
Honestly I had the same misconception and until I visited Berlin it wasn't cleared up
I have to wonder why schools teach this so badly
Yes, same roots
There are many similar words both in Romanian and in Italian, like:
IT         RO
Coda - Coadă (Tail)
Rosso - Roşu (Red)
Verde -Verde (Green)
Vita - Viață (Life)
Tu - Tu (You)
Noi - Noi (We)
Voi - Voi (You)
Pane - Păine (Bread)
and many others
Let's be fair
Stalin's system didn't fall right after him for someone to be able to directly assign a body count to him
Worse of, that system kind of educated half of the world the next half of the century
In my mind they are both equal murders and there's no amount of "but Hitler killed X persons" that can convince me otherwise
exactly
now americans use ‘socialist’ when they actually mean soc-dem and it’s sooo annoying
it’s very hard to discuss this topic with them because their political spectrum leans so right-wing that they genuinely can’t conceptualise the norm being a good social security net, free healthcare and education
Mado, io la pasta senza il sugo non la mangio, cioè non mi piace
Poi se è il sugo fatto in casa si abbonda, che strano ma vero, anche se mia mamma non è italiana, lo fa in un modo buonissimo
E poi in Irlanda mi sa che i piatti migliori sono a base di patate, non ci sono mai stato, però da quello che ho sentito, poi magari mi sbaglio
Ma comunque puoi andare in un ristorante italiano in ogni paese, non sarà mai buono come in Italia
Una delle fortune ad abitare qua
anti WAX
Great decision
Anti-waxers are a danger for the entire population
Yeah, I support mandatory vaccination but I don’t have a strong opinion on it
About the anti-vax, if people want to die who I’m to stop them
I want to save those that want to live (with a few exceptions)
I saw someone translate "ciorba de burta"(liquid soup) into "burt soap"
Not the worst worldwide (I've seen some terrible ones in SE Asia and in Turkey) but the funniest in Romania was the sign posted in the Bucharest Airport around 2009
Three letters added and we entered a new dimension
Tallinn, really
When I went to Tallinn there was definitely a "tourist" vibe, especially in the very core of the old town, but it seemed very gimmicky, tourist trap-y, and overall moreso oriented to families and couples and such
Riga on the other hand had a much higher stag party and drunk tourism energy to me
Not quite on Prague/Budapest level yet but it seemed of the same principle a lot more that Tallinn, imo
We cannot get out
We cannot get out
The heat has taken the hallway and Living Room
Frár and Lóni and Náli fell there bravely while the rest retreated to the cellar
We are still holding
but hope …Óin's party went five days ago but today only four returned
The temperature is the highest to the wall at the Kitchen
The heat took Óin--we cannot get out
The end comes soon
We hear drums, drums in the deep
The sun is rising
Here its surprisingly cool
Ussually in May is very hot already but right now its very cool and with good winds and a healthy amount of rain
Right now in north-east Germany is not that bad
The wind is still cool
I'm also very skinny (~ 110 lbs) which apparently makes me feel colder
So I don't open the windows to go to bed yet
30C ..normal summer for us,we are used to it  .Hope it doesn't go higher tho
No,it's too hot
The mornings are likr 19-20°C and the afternoons are hotter it's so hot
I don't have AC so when I'm outside, it feels like my shoes are melting
I’d love to read it
With a cross necklace on your neck and an icon of Virgin Mary in your hand
The orthodox way
One of the first rhymes we sing to our kids is about stealing and getting caught
Older people say about young people that they are "born with phones in their hands", it's usually them just being annoyed with how much we rely on technology, I think
A tendency to begin a revolution and corrupt politicians :D
F yeah !
You forgot the best one, Romansh speaking swiss
also I guess it depends on what region they come from
I would be temped to say that every city here has at least a sector that would make it a good candidate
I mean we have a humongous abandoned and unfinished building in the middle of the capital
It is there since the '89 revolution
It was supposed to be the mausoleum of the comunist doctator, but they shot him and they didn't know what to do with the huge ugly building
So it just sat there for the last 30 years, and there are no plans to do anything about it
Idk
In Romania there are memes about Vaslui for being the poorest city
These are the ugliest cities based on memes:
1 Vaslui
2 Braila
3 Bacau
4 Galati
5 Tulcea
Again,idk why these are,but I based on what me father said 'bout Vaslui,I agree with it
On the contrary,the most beautiful cities are those that were once under Hungarian jurisdiction
In Romania, we have Vaslui
The ppl in Vaslui have a bad reputation of uneducated, usually drunk ppl who only wear flip flops, even on the streets
You can see why we all make fun of it
Braila in Romania, sa moara jaxi, its ugly as hell
grey and plain
vaslui is like a chernobyl without radiations and full of latinazed gopniks
what was the name of that gipsy village filled with "colourful" palaces
It was somewhere around Alexandria
Not all commie blocks were bland and depressing
Some cities had more progressive architects and more freedom to design
Sure many are in disrepair but the architecture itself is not that bad
In Bucharest though they all had to be bland and functional
However if you pay attention in smaller towns like Turnu Severin, Constanta etc, the 'golden age' architecture is quite interesting
tzeapa frate =))))))
I think there are way uglier cities in Romania, especially small and poor Baragan stuff (Mizil, Rosiori etc)
Have you actually been to any of those cities
Old parts of Bucharest, Constanta, Horezu, Craiova, Turnu Severin, Iasi are absolutely stunning from an architectural point of view
All in the south and east
I'd say the only cities in Transylvania which are more interesting predate the austro hungarians by quite a few centuries
One exception though, Oradea, small but pretty
What's wrong with you
Vaslui is not ugly at all
My vote would go to the small towns in Jiu Valley (Petroșani, Vulcan etc
Sau Vaslui lol
Buzescu is the name of the village
There are tons of those all around Romania
Try the public transportation in Bucharest, there are tons of crazy old and homeless men in the bus
To be fair
I've never been to the US but in Europe I've seen crazy people everywhere
We got crazy people, both on the streets and on TV, but the general population doesn't give a crap about them and doesn't give them attention
They don't go viral and don't get any more air time on TV
> Why does it seem that Europe has fewer people acting crazy in public than the US
The main reason for this is the language barrier: very easy to find English-speaking Romanians
Hard as fuck to find Romanian-speaking Romanians
In other words, the dumbest of my compatriots might be on the same level as some of the US ones, or some even worse, but as long as you don't understand them, their stupidity won't propagate
This shit right here
We have the worst healthcare in the EU by any measurable means, but a system like the current American one would undoubtedly lead to an obscene level of misery, suffering and deaths
Well
now between our countries indeed I can compare
It's the poor to extremely poor blanket that goes nuts
Stress and month-by-month living for a long time and then just something happens (a dear one dies, etc); and they're going crazy
I've indeed noticed that here, also
And the good news is that it kind of fixed itself once the middle-class has grown and the poor got kind of a break; At least it's not living at the limit;
As for healthcare and social programs
I think we're on the same boat
Mental health for the poor is not a thing
It costs money
Some people are still ashamed to admit having a problem, etc
But it is getting better, slowly;
It's a long one:

The third one didn't hold up that well, did it
it's also a thing on r/Romania but I am probably too old to understand it
On r/Romania it's a thing as well
but with a frog
And new decor every week
I don't get it either
Same in Romania with the frog
Its miercuri flacaii mei
Same in Romania
Was in Istanbul with a colleague, on a small ship across the Bosphorus, when a local started talking to us in English first, then in good Romanian
Turned out he never been to Romania but he worked on the Black Sea shore at a lighthouse and listened to Romanian radio broadcast for years, so he learned Romanian by himself from the radio
That explains a lot  every holiday in Romania, when we try to find deserted, lonely places in the wild, we encounter a German and his grandkids or a German family :)) Mostly in the Danube Delta
Sometimes in the mountains
They are like part of the landscape
But it also gives me a good feeling, like "*we are not the only ones trying to find some peace of mind away from this world*"
[Workers day] is the day when Romanians go out for a barbecue and I think that's beautiful
The Moldova Region, the eastern part of the country
The poorest region, Vrancea county is the center of seismic activity, floods happen almost every year
The stereotype is that it's also the region where violent crime is also the most common, especially Vaslui county
Also, similar to your example, the [Valea Jiului] region, which was historically a mining region, but it has seen a significant reduction of mining activity after 1989 which led to severe unemployment and depopulation in the area
Although miners are not seen with sympathy in Romania because of the [mineriads]
Moldova has a history as rich and sights as beautiful as Transylvania
But because there wasn't any Irish author to write a science fiction book staged in it, it's ignored by most of the few tourists that come to Romania
Edit: I see a number of people talking about the modern day Republic of Moldova
I was also talking about the Romanian region of Moldova, wrongly called Moldavia in some English literature
The two don't just have the same name
They used to be the same country
That country never included Transnistria
In all but political sense, I still consider them the same country
Both are beautiful and deserve more tourists
If you ever decide to visit this region, I recommend Iași, Suceava Fortress, the churches and monasteries in the subregion of Bucovina (which spills over in Ukraine),Neamț fortress, Piatra Neamț, all in Romania
I sadly don't know enough about Eastern Moldova, other than what I visited as a foreign tourist: Chișinău, wineries of Cricova and Milestii Mici, Old Orhei, fortress of Soroca
There are others things to see, but I can't vouch for them
Hope this long edit clears some things, or confuses you enough to learn more about the region
Moldova, especially Vaslui
Moldova itself had zero meters of highway until some dude built one meter of highway in protest
Vaslui is the poorest region of Moldova, Romania and the whole EU
People there live in [dire misery
All the parts, we are truly a crapy country thats barely holding on from total colapse
The extreme south is way poorer
Have been to both Vaslui County and Giurgiu County and I can say Giurgiu is way worse
Oh come on
It’s not a book that sets Transylvania apart from the rest of Romania
Nor the tourism associated with it
The issues of the other two regions run way deeper than how many tourists the myth of Dracula brings in (it’s also not the only reason people come to Romania either)
If you look at the history of the regions is very clear that the influence of the Hungarians and the Habsburg Empire led to a better development of Transylvania in comparison with Moldova and Wallachia which were pretty much always busy  having to fend for themselves agains multiple enemies coming from everywhere
That meant better infrastructure for Transylvania, more urbanisation, education, you name it
Yeah, we can find dirt poor places in different parts of the country
At least the people in Giurgiu are closer to Bucharest and in theory can find a job there and commute
On paper though, the north-east region is the poorest as we all know
You better
May I suggest you guys base it on [Ioan the Brave] the Moldavian version of Dracula
It's not my business, since I am not from the Republic of Moldova, but I think Transnistria should have never been part of Moldova
Some Soviet officials drew internal borders with no consideration of history or culture
This is the root of the modern problems in Transnistria, as well as Crimea and Ukraine
I was actually talking about the Western Moldova (Romania)
If you ever consider going that way, I would encourage you to check out the northern part of it
Start in Iasi to experience a relatively modern city, then go to Suceava for the castle of Medieval Moldavian rulers, check out the churches in the surrounding region (called Bukovina)
Finally, go to Targu Neamt for the fortress, and depending on the time of year go to sky or just for a hike in Piatra Neamt
Nobody has a worse opinion about Romania than Romanians
Because there wasn't any
In case you are wondering about the Irish author who wrote a famous book staged in Transylvania, his name was Bram Stoker
He wrote a novel called "Dracula".
How is this a bad opinion of Romania
I was talking about its historical development
I think the union of 1600 when Michael the brave, lord of Wallachia united Transylvania,Moldavia and Wallachia under his rule by conquering them, sadly he was assasinated in 1601 at the order of HRE emperor i think and the union quickly fell apart
Either Michael the Brave and his union that lasted one year ,or before that when he and his army got all the way to Adrianopol , there he was supposed to receive Austrian support to take Constantinople but unfortunately the help from the Holy League never came
There's an amazing youtube history series about this now
Although it probably isn't common knowledge, I definitely heard of that
I think it's one of the more famous things in Canadian history really
Along with burning down the White House
Yeah but to armchair historians and people who follow "fun facts" accounts on Instagram it was the Canadians
It feels weird when I have some products from another store with me
Especially if I forgot to ask for the receipt at the other store
I had a small panic attack when I realized I have a candy bar from a different store in my pocket and I don't have the receipt
Is that even in big cities
I can’t imagine a herd of 50 people all thanking to the bus driver when they get off the bus
We used to drink wine out of jars
(my friends and I were poor and pretty lazy to buy proper glasses, so we used jars from jam or pickles)
And I cut cheese with a butter knife
(same reason)
\*Sips wine from a coffee mug
&#x200B;
(I did have wine glasses, am not a savage,  but all but one were shattered in an unfortunate accident and now whenever I and the gf drink wine, she uses the wine glass and I use my mug
need to stop procrastinating on buying new ones)
The UK is so weird with cycling infrastructure
Like there is the National Cycle Network and it's one of the few countries where Google Maps offers cycling directions
But on the other hand, cycle paths sometimes start and stop in the middle of nowhere (or worse, in a fence, right after a left turn, coming down a steep bridge) or the markings suddenly go missing halfway through a residential area with bendy streets
Hmm perhaps you make a valid point, but it's still lacking in that regard
The example with the cycle lane ending in a fence after a bend down a bridge is something i actually encountered a few weeks ago
Also can't count how many times I ended up cycling on what felt like pretty busy roads with fast traffic only to realise at the end that there *was* a cycle lane somewhere across a field and behind some bushes, maybe on the other side of the road for good measure - but no sign to guide you towards it
Anyway, I can't complain too much, the cycle infrastructure and drivers' awareness of cyclists back home is just none
The word "dick" (pula) can be used in 40 (probably more) ways, ranging from "what the fuck / ce in pula mea" (what in my dick) to "far away / in pula cu satelitul" (in the dick with a satellite)
I can explain them all in one post so here's a link
You forgot about our ability to speak in mostly vowels
Extreme example: Oaia aia e a ei, eu i-o iau
I am pretty sure amor is used in more intimate situations than iubire
In Romanian we call it Moon as well (*Luna*), however the Moon landing gave the word for the landing on any planet: *aselenizare*. TIL it comes from Selene
In Romania we have the same thing, its called "numeral cardinal" and "numeral ordinal".
For example:
Cardinal are numbers: unu (one), doi (two), trei (three)
Ordinal are the order of people: primul (first), al doilea (second), al treilea (third)
Also in Hungarian
Hah, same with pula (dick) in Romanian
We also have "dor" in Romanian
Funny thing is that they say it's untranslatable but I see plenty of languages have similar words
Love your explanation of modal particles
In Romanian, pain would be "durere". Also comes from Latin "dolor", so yep, related
Though Romanian "dor" seems to come from a derivative of "dolor" as well
Makes sense, since the feeling of "dor" may include pain
I feel like a lot of people don't understand the question or are you all just trolling
>Also, when I'm at work, I don't give a fuck if its already bright outside
I want daylight when I'm done working
Exactly
Personally, winter time is hell on my depression, because I'm rarely outside when the sun is out
Dragnea, one of the most corrupt politicians of our country, is in jail
During the first World Cup in 1930, King Carol II personally spoke with the footballers employers do give them a holiday for going in Uruguay and participate to the event
Mind you, back then, footballers didn't had the big salaries they have now, it was more like a hobby, so they needed to have "regular" jobs too
We have Transfăgărășan- the best road in the world
And Transalpina  the second best road in the world
(Romania)
* Never in our history have we had an expansion war
Still alive today
* Around 40BC romans were knocking at our door, however our ancestors couldn’t be bothered defend the land until their leader burned down all the grapevines plantations (damn, we were chill)
* During the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia we refused to participate (alongside Albania) and publicly criticized this
* There’s almost no racism here
L.E.:
* We had the first public illuminated towns in Europe with both gas and electricity (Bucharest, 1857 and Timisoara, 1884)
Ba mă-ta
Oh that's nice
We had to put 5 soldiers unload a whole AK magazine each at the same time on the Dictator and his wife :D
How is this wholesome
Edit: now it's better
Nah, don't try
There are a lot of corrupt politicians free
We still vote for corrupt politicians because they apparently are against those we hate
apparently
What
That doesn't make any sense whatsoever
Just because they can't put all corrupt politicians in jail he shouldn't try to to put any
Even if they put one corrupt politician in jail its still worth doing
Small progress is still progress, no matter how you paint it
Well he loved Romania and it's people
but too much if you ask
everybody
He got our national debt to 0, he urbanized the country, he got everybody a home and a job, education was real back then (today we get fed a lot of useless stuff) etc
BUT he instated food shortages for long periods of time, didn't know how to manage stuff, his wife (Elena) had a doctorate in chemistry but didn't know what CO2 was, he couldn't read well (words on his speeches were enlarged for him to be able to understand them)
He wasn't an ass he had an ass hat :D [in my opinion if the communists wouldn't have taken over we would be much better off
] :3
He edited it
The unedited comment was just about their amber production
Why did you bring them up
I really can't see why you decided to mention them
Yes, they are
But Russian speakers have a different opinion
He will be free in less than 4 years
One corrupt politician in jail and, yey, the things are moving
Im not here to argue, live your lie bro
"Food
No need for food
We can eat our friendship away
" -Ceauşescu most probably
Ibiza would be a perfect place
Bucharest, imagine driving through the infernal traffic on the main boulevard around 1 pm and crashing every time, or the impending doom of the angry granny with a Kalashnikov
Alexandria, Romania
And the protagonist should be a politician
A mix of Eastern European cities would be great, it would have everything
And the some stuff that happens in rural Romania may be straight out of GTA, so why not
Bergen, Marseille or Budapest
Nothing too big for Rock Star, but it would take like 10 years to complete since they don’t only need a big map, they need a dense map, with lots of things to do
Or you can play in Focșani as Marian Oprișan and start from stealing wallets in the train station and evolve to stealing wallets from journalists who enter the PSD headquarters
That sounds interesting but the concept it’s a bit outdated, seems more like a 2000’s approach for an open world
Pretty sure is Cyprus
I think that's where they find the Apple at the begining of AC1
Probably Bran's castle, the infameous Dracula's lair
Instead of that castle i recommend Peleș and Corvin's castles
They are way more interesting
Dracula and Dracula's Castle
Palace of Parliament, it’s just a big monstrosity in the middle of the city
Bigar Waterfall- an extremelly small,  isolated waterfall that looks good only in photos
Bran castle (also know as Dracula's Castle) in Romania is overly crowded and very boring
Castle Bran its full of little Shops with souvenirs at the entrance
I agree for La Rambla at least, but I discovered a more chill one near the hotel where I stayed, it was named Rambla de Poblenou, which was actually a nice experience, not crowded, pretty chill and few people
Castle Bran is very lovely on itself, but very overrated
They sure as hell like to milk the Dracula story
I beg to differ
Growing up, I had family who lived in Bran and that meant plenty of trips in the area
However, when I returned after many years, last summer, I discovered an experience of fairy-tale atmosphere, I learned from history that I never paid attention to before, and left with an extremely positive view of the Bran Castle
On top of that, I got to share this experience with a friend from abroad and she was even more mesmerised than me
I think it's definitely worth a trip because it does a great job of mixing facts and fairy-tales in order to 'set the record straight' while, of course, entertaining with a little Dracula trivia
I've been there and got some cool stuff from the gift shop
But the thing was, I went there a day before Halloween
I didn't really think about Halloween at all at the time, but now I wish I waited a few weeks
It was extremely crowded and everyone was talking 10 different languages at the same time
They didn't even let you take pictures
Some old lady almost fell off the staires
The next day I went to Peleş castle and the experience was 10 times better
Or maybe it was an illusion of quality since I got there from what was basically hell
Compared to other castles, Castelul Bran is much smaller imo
The market right below the hill you walk up to access the castle is equally as much as a tourist trap
Yes
There are so many more other mesmerising places
People see a part of Romania and think they saw everything
I personally prefer walks or hikes, we got the nature so why stay and only see the city
Well, issue is that we dont
manage tourism well
We dont have sites or guides for them, so people dont know unless they do separate research
A shame, really
Fuck yea
That's one of the reasons why I am getting into politics the moment I am of age
You know what they say: "be the change you want to see"!
Thanks mate
Always go for the top
Might even try to become the first female president in Romania
~~I have an uncontrollable desire to impale people and drink their blood
I emigrated to the UK if that counts as a stereotype
But then, I'm not here to steal bikes, beg on the tube or as an agricultural worker
Also don't hang out exclusively with other Romanians
Never been in a horse cart either
Just walked everywhere before coming to the UK
You got me at "I don't want to reclaim the lost lands". Hello friend
Make that 1
2 million :D Transylvania will always be a sore spot: we see it as the cradle of our nation, but you guys had it for hundreds of years
And yes, Trianon took the major cities along the border from you: Satu Mare, Oradea, Arad, Timișoara
It's complicated
Yes, in the 19th century, but most Dacian tribes had been in Transylvania
The capital, [Sarmizegetusa Regia] was there, its ruins are still there to this day
Hard to let go of the thought that entire territory would be part of another country
If you want to put it in a childish manner, "we were here before you guys" :))
I never realised that you guys actually come here to visit that often
That's awesome
Not sure I'm following your train of thought
No, I'm not a Dacian per se, there is no such thing, but the Dacians are our ancestors, along with the Romans and all the migratory tribes that settled here for a longer or shorter period of time
Are you a hun
You do know that most scholars call it Daco-Romanian, right
"It" refers to Romanian, since you were wondering about the Dacian influence on the language
But that's not the point
The point is that I'm not sure what you're trying to convey
Are you trying to say Hungarians have a better claim over Transylvania
Perhaps
Are you saying that Romanians have no claim whatsoever just because the Dacian influence isn't blatantly visible
That's a lazy take
Are you saying that the Romanians as a nation came into existence in the 19th century
Not a lie
Are you saying that Romanians as a people didn't exist before the Middle Ages
Wrong
So, what is your discourse
Because I'm not following and from where I'm standing you're just throwing counter-arguments but it's not entirely clear which of my statements you're refuting
Yes, we were here before you
Yes, Trianon wasn't 100% fair but that's what happens when you're not on the victors' side
And yes, the province you had a hand in developing and whose native population you oppressed is now part of Romania
Deal with it
Well, the language stems from Vulgar Latin + migratory influences, mostly Slavic
Over a hundred Dacian words have survived and are still being used, but this is something that Wikipedia can go into more detail than me
As for cultural and historic achievements, do you honestly believe all of them went on record when Romanians in Transylvania weren't the ruling population
But check the 1848 Revolution and you'll get your names
Check Transylvanian writers like Goga or Rebreanu
Check the 1892 Memorandum
As for my phrasing, I would have put it between inverted commas had I known it would be taken so literally
I never said "over the Principalities". I also said that you took my initial "cradle of our nation" too ad literam and I specified that I should have put it between inverted commas
Now, this exchange has become tiresome, so I will disengage from it
Have a lovely afternoon
Not a native English speaker  And I didn't mind the exchange itself but it felt like both of us were becoming slightly hostile towards the end and I don't like arguing with people, especially not on the Internet where you don't have tone of voice, inflection, mimic and other non-verbal cues
Absolutely
Any iteration of Dracula really
The accent they use is utter bullshit
Or the pronunciation of our cities, it's like they took LSD before speaking them
If you ever talk to a Romanian who grew up in the early 00s, they'll most likely reference the fact that they know Lithuania as the country where Polly, from "Kids from Room 402" is originally from
I think it's a Canadian kids cartoon, but for some reason it was picked up by Fox Kids Romania and dubbed, then it became really popular
It was on every day, at least 2-3 episodes
Anyway, the annoying character (Polly) keeps mentioning Lithuania in every single situation
"Back home in Lithuania, we used to do this". I'm pretty sure she never said a specific city or village haha
[Here's an episode] so you can get an idea
Of course, the English voice acting sounds really off to my ears, because I only heard it in the dubbed version, where her voice was intentionally made suuuper annoying, to fit the character better - [here is the same scene, dubbed]
Hell no
I had to rewind that scene 5 times before I could be sure that he was speaking Romanian and still I couldn't understand what he was saying
Haven't seen it, but if you want actual Romanian in big movies, it's either Children of Men or Borat 2
I know, weird list, right
Eurotrip was the absolute *shit* when we were in middle school
It's still a great comedy, but back then it was eeeverywhere
IIRC they don't go to Spain, but it should be relateable as a European in general :)
You're thinking of Civil War, but there was only one line: "cum sunt astea, sunt bune
" (how are these, are they good
) said to a guy selling plums
Sebastian Stan only lived here until he was like 8 iirc
I heard an interview with him speaking Romanian and it was a bit rough around the edges, which he admits to
As a side note, there was an insane synchronized *woah* in the theater crowd when the big block letters saying BUCHAREST came on screen
So you know how romanian is a latin based language
well that's WRONG
Latin was based off of romanian, actually it's not romanian, it's dacian
Yeah, that ancient civilisation that used to live in the Balkans, Dacia
As a matter of fact, the Romans were actually dacian all along
But the Roman Empire was nothing compared to the Dacian empire, that streched from today's denmark to mid africa, to today's India
In fact they/we, the dacians, built underground tunnels that connect the carpathians to the black sea and Istam- uh
I mean Constantinople
But be careful, there might be aliens hiding in them now
Zalmoxis is the only one and true god but technology has corrupted people
All of this truth is kept secret by the evil catholic church in the archives of the Vatican
Transylvania is also the true Electromagnetic centre of Earth of course
□□□□□□□□
You don't even need to go too far on the internet to find people who legit believe in this stuff, more or less crazy depending on who you ask
I believe there's also a pseudo-historian on youtube with a decent following whose whole channel is based on stuff like this
I’ve heard this EXACT theory, but with Romania instead of Hungary
I'm disappointed that I had to scroll so much down to get to our (Romanian) gem of wisdom
You forgot that the Dacians also built the pyramids, invented writing and are the ancestors of all human kind (and that Deutchland means "the land of the Dacians")
And that our national poet invented the theory of relativity but he was assassinate by the jews who stole it from him and attributed it to a dumbass named Einstein
Not only this, but Jesus was Romanian too
He was born somewhere close to Botoșani or Bacau
He couldn't have been a jew, because obviously jews are evil and he was full of love, so he was Christian (somehow)
Oh and Eminescu was the best physician that ever lived
Then the jews killed him and gave all his work to Einstein to claim as his own
Hearing Funar speak (or reading from his books) cracks me up every time
Wait, people really believe the Sirius part
I saw it in another comment earlier but I thought it was made up by the OP just to add to the craziness
It's bad if you're a hardcore nationalist and absolutely against any form of globalization
Yeah
if its only within Europe and europeans
How
You didn't knew that
Yeah yeah, but did you know that the flood in the Bible started from the Black Sea
Now I'd like to see "Star Wars: Hungary strikes back".
Everyone knows it was created by the Dacians, the Dacians are the ancestors of Romania who actually invented the Latin alphabet, the Romans stole it from us
Both
My handwriting just switches cursive to the other way mid-word/sentence with every letter
It's confusing and I don't know why I started writing like this
We write the first 'a' not sure how to make it, but we do have some people who write the second 'a'.
Transnistria and Gaugazia because we have a conflict with those 2
Even if we control that land
The Great Hungarian government in the Not so Great Romania country (yes, hungarian people in Romania have their own party) actually tried to claim 'their lands' (Ardeal) in 2020 during the pandemic when all their party members forwarded a law regarding this matter
They also want their own flag and language to be used in schools and on the street as official language in that area
stay tuned
Retaking Algeria is a basic one, but I hear the most about retaking Québec or making it its own country
And if you go to Brittany, you will never end hearing about how the French stole Nantes and how the Normandie stole the Mt Saint-Michel
That guy takes jokes way too seriously
As long as you bring pizza
Do you promise to build highways
This is the first time I hear about this
I think it answers the question of how media covers this subject
Most media agencies have 1-2 articles about either the election results (the official ones from the dictator) or about protesters getting arrested
Unfortunately not enough coverage
I've actually heard about this but it's definetly not covered enough so more people can realize what's going on
Some media trusts are starting to post about it:
Also, Radio Europa Liberă has posted since yesterday night
I hope that they become
- Some (usually) white people are like "so my great great great great grandma was half irish therefore I'm also Irish"
- imperial system
- don't include tax in prices
- tipping
The credit card in the States is very confusing
I have always wondered how it works
In my country its pretty simple, but in the USA it seems like a pretty big complicated deal
How people are poor and can't afford stuff, but they live in huge houses and have a pool in the backyard
I mean, I get that prices are different in the states for some stuff
But I don't get the logic
Also, lawns
And why the fucking hell do your neighbors have a say in how your fucking yard looks like
I once saw a video of someone being shot while in the car with his family, by a police officer
My boss, knowing that I travel, asks me why I never go to the US
What if I went there after getting a tan
Why don't you use the metric system
It's so much easier to understand
Also farenheit
What's up with that
But do you like buy something and pay the same price in some installments
Or some kind of fee or interest is added to the initial price of the product
And do you always use credit card
I also heard that they check your bank or credit score or something if you want to rent a place or something
120 days maternity leave: only the mother (duh
) can take it and either 60 or 90 days -I can't remember- have to be taken after the child is born
The others can be taken either before the birth itself, or after, depending on each woman's health
21 months of parental leave (either the mother or the father can take it) paid with 85% of your net up to about 1600 euro a month
If the kid is born with a handicap, it's 33 months
45 days a year in case your kid gets sick, paid with 85% of your net (no cap as far as I could find)
This is until your kid turns 7, or 18 if he/she has a handicap
5 days if you get married
2 days if your kid gets married
3 days for a close relative death (child, spouse, parents)
1 day for the death of a brother, sister, grandparent
Not sure it fits here but in Romania one parent of choice gets 2 YEARS of 80% paid leave when they have a newborn baby
>Friday pulla as a benefit
That would be a whole lot of different benefit in Romania
I think the reasoning behind it is to take time off to handle the funeral preparation
You are responsible most of the time for the funeral of your parents/spouse/children but not for your siblings/grandparents
To be honest I never thought about it, but what /u/cdanisor said makes perfect sense
Yeah, when we had our son it was really great having my wife at home with him for almost 2 years
I forgot to mention, but there's also maternity leave for 3 or 4 months, so in total there's 2 years of parental leave
I can't imagine raising a kid with only a few months of maternity leave
It's not even about the costs, but about actually bonding with your kid and raising him up
If you're at work 8h, spend another 1-2 on breaks and commute, you sleep for 8, when are you supposed to be a parent to a newborn
In the remaining 3-4 hours each day
May I piggyback on this question and ask Scandinavians what exactly happens on Walpurgis Night
I've heard some interesting things from someone who claims to have lived in Sweden but I don't want to have any wrong preconceived ideas about it
Haha here in Romania we somehow have the Home Alone movies as a Christmas staple
They haven't missed a year since I was in middle school, that's like at least 13 years
It was fun at first but then it just became weird lol
>Apart from that, nothing special
But, I’m curious what you’ve might have heard
Yeah, something along the lines of everyone getting drunk and/or having orgies in public
Well there's like 3 home alone movies I think
And they play them on the days up to Christmas and on Christmas day as well (at least that's how I recall from recent years)
In Romania I noticed it depends
One of my close friends' family has a big Christmas dinner with the gifts and the tree decorating on the 24th
I grew up with the tree being done up about a week before, gifts being opened on the 25th in the morning  and then we'd have a festive lunch
Not sure what the "standard" is, but I think my experience is more common
Few Romanians know about the existence or Zalău, so I assume even fewer foreigners do
Of course it's Zalău, but it's supposed to be in Sălaj county, and everyone knows Sălaj doesn't exist
I would say Oradea as it isn't that popular as Timișoara, Cluj-Napoca, Bucharest or Iași. The old buildings are very well kept, there are many pedestrian-only streets and the public transport is better than your average Romanian one
You've been banned from r/SalajNuExista
r/Salajnuexista spread the truth brother
In Romanian we have the word "Stârc" (heron) which is similar to the English "Stork".
However one one is of Slavic origin while the other one is of Germanic origin
This has always baffled me and still can't accept that these aren't somehow related
So in Romanian we have the word "fain" whice mean "good, nice" and in English there is the word "fine" which has a very similar meaning as the Romanian one, and the are pronounced the exact same way
Romanian: cum = what (Cum te numești
= What's your name
English: semen
Well,I happen to know a word,but im afraid it will make this thread go from nice to nsfw
It means "with" in romanian
Was curious about the same thing, but I don't think I have seen one Moldovan flag on this reddit
There's at least one, cuz they jumped to tell me that O-zone isn't from Ro :P
Haha, that sounds super legit, I know a few people from Moldova and all of them are super proud that O-Zone is Moldovan
They are also quite pissed that the rest of Europe believes they are from Romania, as an expat I have witnessed this kind of interaction before :)
Finland
Love it
Rusia somewhere far in the north,maybe kola
Not necesarry French in general ppl who refuse to use english and assume everyone speaks their god forbidden language are toxic and cancerous it happend to me tooin r6,lol etc
Something similar happened to me in the airport in Wien
I was buying a coffee and complaining about the pretzel price
My language was very very "colorful" but the bartender said nothing up to the point where he couldn't restrain himself and started laughing really hard and replied in Romanian "you are right".
If you should them to me without context, I would have guessed they were tarot cards (fortune telling)
I’ve never seen Spanish playing cards
The French deck is the most popular here, but Hungarian decks are also used
I used to have one of those
It was a little confusing ,but it was cool
I think I had some, I don't think I ever saw the entire deck
We also call it Hungarian in Romania
It's either "cărți ungurești" ("Hungarian cards") or "cărți de cruce" ("Cross cards", named after a very popular* game called "cruce"/"cross", called like that because team members sit across from each other)
* - very popular in the westernmost part of Romania, like my hometown of Oradea
I do not know if we have this thing in Romania, but I agree
After a certain age our senses become weaker thus we become more prone to accidents
Old people should at least take some mandatory tests
Yes it's sad that some old people have to depend on someone, but it's much safer that way
They’re old, not stupid
They can drive just fine, and in the case of my family, we’d be living in a hole in the ground without the help of my grandparents
Aren't driving licenses renewed every 10 years in our country
over 25C it's hell
perfect around 15-20C
chilly around 5-15C
cold below 5C
I call everything under 15 degrees cold, and 15-20 degrees a bit cold
But i’m generally a warm weather person so i can’t speak for everyone
Depends of your definition of jacket
Like a thin one or a winter one
If it’s a thin one then 15-18C depending of the sun
15-20 is already light jacket/hoodie and jeans for me, 10-15 maybe a leather/jeans jacket and anything below 10 winter jacket, under 5 add a scarf, hat and gloves
I would say below 20 it's chilly
Then below 10 is cold
And below - 10 is freezing
But I'm also a skinny woman, so there's literally no hope for me to survive something below - 10 without 12 layers of clothes
It really depends on the location
For example when i lived in Romania i could easily tolerate -20C in the winters
(When it used to get that cold) i would say it's properly *cold* when it's around -10C
In the Netherlands on the other hand i'll start wearing my  jacket when it gets to below 10C. It feels so much colder when there's so much humidity and wind
Around 15C is probably my favourite temperature though
What counts as a *good* jacket
I could walk around in a coat and scarf in any weather if I wanted to
Uhm
It's 13 C here in Barcelona rn and I'm freezing to death even with a simple jacket
And back in Romania I feel fine at - 10 C.
So I don't rlly know how to answer that question
In Romania I had issues in summer bc I felt suffocated, but in winter I feel great
In Spain I feel better in summer (tho I hate summer still) but winter is just a nightmare
It's like it doesn't eveb matter how many layers you have on, the cold feels like it's INSIDE you
Like it comes from inside your body
Its so fuckin weirrrrrd
10 degrees celsius is fine and fresh, a bit crisp
Below 5 it is quite cold but really pleasant even if you're only wearing a sweater, that if it's sunny and there's no wind
Below 0 is cold, Below -10 is really cold
I am one of these weirdos that hate any temperature above 20 though
About the same
> and 15-20 degrees a bit cold
Depends what season
Springtime, with a bit of sunshine and barely any wind, quite agreeable T-shirt and jeans weather
Fall on the other hand, that's definitely non-consensus between hoodie and no hoodie if you watch people on the street
Ah, that sweet undecided crowd that didn’t yet abandon sandals and/or shorts, mingling with people wearing a long sleeve shirt + windbreaker
You can clearly see the discomfort but they stick to their decision
Hello, fellow *university-city* inhabitant :))
Students are the absolute *wooooorst* at this, I swear
In the middle of the winter, they'd run to the corner store in a t-shirt, shorts and flip flops
You can see the obvious goosebumps from a long way away, but they still insist on looking casual
European union flag
Maybe France sometimes aswell
I like playing France in Victoria 2
I associate Europe with blue now as well
And yellow stars
More interesting is that he's from Switzerland
Hello Australian, I’m Romanian
Is this your first winter
In Romania we have winter from december to january, but it's warm outside and sunny
Snow only for a couple of days
Holidays help in two ways, depending on your personality:
Streets are filled with light decorations, which can make you more cheerful if you are already somewhat cheerful
If you're a grumpy old man, holidays are good excuse to get drunk
Here it gets dark around 18:00, and sunrise is around 7-8ish during winter
But we make do, if there’s a winter market or festival it doesn’t matter, if there’s indoor activities again, it doesn’t matter
The worst part is when the weather’s bleak, it’s cloudy all the time, and it stays like that for weeks
No sunshine is by far the worst
I even prefer when the temperature goes below -15, usually it’s clear skies then
And strangely enough it doesn’t feel as bad as between 0 and -10
Not to mention everything’s frozen, no slush, no puddles
The weather changed though, we used to get proper winter around the start or mid November, ending in the beginning or mid March
Now
in the last years we didn’t get any snow until perhaps December, with temps varying between +5/+10 to -5/-10 at night
Which tends to be highly appreciated by the flu
So, an extended flu season
In the bright side we didn’t get any snow in March
It happened in 2018 I think and it wasn’t fun
Edit: without snow, there’s no winter feeling and no skiing
Which sucks
For this year's new years eve I went to Spain
It was warm, sunny, green, the day lasted so much longer, and that was in January
I was happy that it only got dark at like 7PM while at home In Romania it started to get dark at 4 and it was cold and miserable
You cray, man
For perspective you'd need to spend a winter week somewhere dark and wet and bleh
You will appreciate the fuck out of the Aussie climate
In Romanian it has the same meaning like in English
In Romania having big balls means being very strong and that when having sex you will c*m fast, and very, very much
How can he not say anything to his friends
That will turn them against him
I imagine winning the lottery to be news worthy
keeping them uninformed it's impossible
Aaaaaa nope
I haven't thought of that
Happy cake day
There is actually a party that I voted for and wasn't the lesser evil
I think that's a first in Balkans
The way Presidential elections work in French-inspired systems, you have pool of candidates competing in the first round
If none of them get over 50%, the top two compete in the second round
I always vote for the one like most, regardless of their chances in the first round
The only politician I would truly trust would be myself, if I was one, but even that wouldn't be 100%.
In Ro its pretty much the lesser evil, for the central elections at least
For how much trasseism, political influence and GOT-like scenarios you have in Romanian politics, you can never be sure that one party is good and one is bad, although there is one thats obvisously bad (PSD)
When choosing mayors its a whole different story, everybody chooses based on achievments/notoriety/party theyre memebers of
It could be all three, or just one of them
The more you follow politics, the more you realize all the politicians are evil, so you always vote for the one that is less so
They may not be evil from the start but power/the prospect/promise of power corrupts everyone
Literally one time - it wasn't some wholehearted thing, just "oh these people seem to have some common sense". They proved to be idiots as well in the end
Otherwise
Have never believed in any politician or party here
It's all a shit show and any tiny little person who seems normal and good in the head just gets crushed
It's all a game of bribes, money, and who has the loudest mouth
It won't change until all the current dinosaurs and their kids are dead and buried
Always lesser evil
I don't believe in politicians nor respect any
Usually is the lesser evil, but with USR I think they are good and try to fight with corruption, but they are not yet big enough to win any elections
On a national level it's almost always down to the lesser of two evils
On a local level, I'm proud to say that my hometown (Bz) made some progress
We had the same fat incompetent dude as a mayor for 16 years that bribed his way in office
All the old, uneducated or poor people voted for him cuz in election years he would give them bags of food (like rice, flour, oil, stuff like that)
Then this one younger dude came along and ran against him
This dude seemed intelligent and a good guy that genuinely wanted to do some good
It was the first time in my life that I voted cuz I believed in the candidate
And he won
And he actually did a lot of good for the City
Currently, with the pandemic, my city I'd one that has the least amount of issues
We are also in a somewhat favorable area, but still
The guy did a lot of good for the City in just one mandate
Now I think it's his second one
And we will definitely vote for a third
So you voted PSD, which technically isn't the "lesser evil", it's the most evil
All the others, even USR, are "lesser evil", some less than others
Are you even allowed to vote anyone else
And yet he always chooses
Geralt likes to think he is above things like good and evil but he always cares
I believe there are elections even in North Korea
You're in trouble only if you dare to vote anything else
We had the same system ("thanks" for that, BTW)
I feel like everyone smokes here
It can’t remember a time I went out and nobody at the table smoked
Even non-smokers smoke when drunk
I wouldn’t be surprised if 5th graders smoked nowadays
It is quite common to smoke, it is not seen very positively, but the majority of people still do it
The only enforcing done here is about smoking indoors, that has been banned a few years ago, at least in restaurants, clubs etc
i was very happy as a non-smoker, since at least I wouldn't smell (hair and clothes) after going out
Most people out of the older generations smoke
Out the younger generation not so much
It's still a high percentage tho
Declining very slowly
Here it's not rlly percieved as bad
Most ppl find it normal, but as a 14 y/o, I realized how bad it was when I heard a relative say they don't smoke (I was at a wedding) and I remember thinking "an adult that doesn't smoke
Kinda strange
" and that's when it hit me that if that thought came to my mind then smoking is clearly a problem here
I think it’s way lower than 17% total
Highly unlikely that the two groups don’t overlap
> I wouldn’t be surprised if 5th graders smoked nowadays
Umm, that's legit the most common starting point
Can't speak for anyone else, but in my experience, 5th grade was the time where everyone started being dumb enough to "prove themselves cool to others", so most of them started to smoke, skate, wear baggy clothes or general rebellious actions
It was in the 7th grade when i first saw my classmates smoking
That’s 13 year olds i think
Better for them I guess since a lot of people start smoking because is seen as cool
Well yeah, do you know anyone other than teenagers that wear things like [these] And any parent who approved of that style back in the day
Shit, in 9th grade people were already fucking back in my day
Nowadays schools begins at 6 yo, but back then it was at 7, so maybe that's part of the discrepancy
I can honestly say most of the smokers in my class started between 5th and 7th grade
This isn't common with people back home, but for the people that left the country
*Do not question how Latin our language is
It's fucking Latin, ok
(I got a German dude once tell me that German is more Latin than Romanian and I almost popped a vein)
Saying that all Romanians are gypsies
I feel like our reputation has improved in the last couple of years since I haven't heard this as frequently as before but it still is annoying
And the fact that the name Romania is very similar to Roma doesn't help either
talking about hungarians
Being called a Gypsy (atleast for thr non gypsies)
So Romania in the middle ages was Wallachia and Moldavia is now Republic of Moldova,right
In Friends there's a moment when phoebe's scientist boyfriend moves to Minsk and they *constantly* say that he moves to Russia
Which bothered me so fucking much
I mean, they have no excuse
The show takes place in the 90s, not the 80s.
As others have pointed about their language, it's also the case for Romania
While officially, the country is called "Tarile de Jos" (literally "the Low Countries") and the language "neerlandeza", the overwhelming majority of us know the country as "Olanda" and the language as "olandeza". I think many Romanians would scratch their heads if they were asked where are "Tarile de Jos" or where do they speak "neerlandeza".
EDIT: Another fun fact, the Dutch are sometimes referred to in Romanian as "batavi". Make of that what you want
Wasn't Cyrillic created from the Greek alphabet tho
Don't quote me on this but Romanian has many words of latin origin and even loan words from French so you could say we doubled our latin
We also have slavic, turkish and a few words of dacian/thracian origin like barza which mean stork or branza which is cheese
Lately there are more than a few people who credit the dacians for a lot of things and take inspiration from them
I personally don't like that, they were a group of people that existed here some 2000 years ago
This is why you can hear jokes like the dacian draco was first on the moon
"Yeah,the oldest country on the continent uses an alphabet from the 9th century but before they wrote with hieroglyphs,right
It was part of the joke(reffering to Greece,not Bulgaria),so don't take at seriously and I'm from Romania btw :)
I did not know that there are waay more videochat studios than hospitals in Romania
We have the highest rate of home ownership in the world (96%)
The Romanian word for orange is _portocală_. Now it makes complete sense
Wasn’t the first country Moldova
When you stick by neutrality, you have to be prepared for war with both sides
Hahahaha, you wish
Come at us bro
We'll throw palinca-crazed warriors at ya
Casualties will be in the millions
In Ro there are some nudist beaches and outside of that you don't really see topless women
I would say that normally there are like 5% topless women in non-nudist beaches
There used to be quite a lot of women doing it around early 2000
If you are tanning on your back and laying on your belly then most women (80%) would be topless since you don't want to get the tan lines and also if your bra is wet it's annoying to lay on it
There are some smaller beaches where i've seen a lot of women go topless and i have tried it myself with some friends
I would say most young women generally avoid it on crowded beaches because of the potential harrassment since Romania is not the nicest place for women
Your friend is wrong but in Southern and Eastern europe it is definitely more common than in Britain or the US
Personally, I only go to one or two places at the beach here and they're a bit more "free spirited" so to speak
I definitely see like 20-30% of women going topless, myself included
I think it's a thing of, if you see enough other women doing it, you'll feel more comfortable as well, so it becomes less of a "thing", and more of a "my bra is itchy I'll take it off"
Also, with kids it's not really hygienic to let them sit butt naked on the sand
In the past there weren't really any options for kid's swimwear, but now there are, so why not protect them
>For a normal job you get like 800€
Dude,how cheap are flights to ur country
Some unlucky people get less than 400€ .
And tbh,lego is pretty expensive . A small set costs over 10 €.
I saw the Indominus set once, it was on sale in a store 1y after the movie
600 and the minimum wage was 1800 at the time I think (our currency)
I always got the knock-offs Legos as a kid, biggest set wouldn't get over 50
But some pieces didn't fit, some were wobbly and so on
i don't think it is normal throughout all of europe as I've never heard of this happening in my country
but it should be normal
you must know who you're letting into your home
i can understand the early modern english text, but i struggle
i can understand some parts of the middle english text
anything under old English just looks like another language, i can't understand any of it, not even if i try
Early Modern and Middle: 85%
Old English: 0%
Early modern English and middle English are pretty easy but I can decipher maybe 2 words from the old English paragraph
I perfectly understand Middle English, but I have a hard time understanding Early Modern words
His lord’s ‘war’, not his lord’s ‘men’, I hear
In this case, the Crusades
Actually, English was originally Latin, due to the Roman conquests of Anglia
It was with migrations from Saxony and other places that it turned Germanic, much the same way as it turned French with the invasion of the Normans
Perhaps to learn a bit about [Uncleftish Beholding
No man ‘further’. There was a commenter a bit above who translated this into Dutch and modern English, and the original poster confirmed almost everything he said
I speak English, and I wonder, would ‘ridderlijkhejd’ happen to translate to something along the lines of ‘rider-likehood’?
‘Anon’ presumably doesn’t mean the r/GreenText kind
*Mostly* the same thing
It is interesting to see that ‘-ly’ and ‘-like’ have (probably) the same root
Despite that, it is thought that there was at least some partial mutual intelligibility between Old English and Old Norse
They were most certainly way more mutual intelligible than Danish and German are today, as Danish struggles to have mutual intelligibility with even Norwegian and Swedish
It's been a researched topic for quite some years, and many Germanic linguists sympathize with the idea that Old English and Old Norse were mutually intelligible
Of course we would need to pay attention to an older form of Old Norse, not the regular Old Icelandic, which is the language of the Eddas
One example of similar phonetics that comes to mind is that Old Norse originally also had the /w/ sound that later became /v/ in words like "vér" (=we), the same sound which has been kept in English ever since
Here's a [thesis] written on this topic, that elaborates on the mutual intelligibility
That's what we do on 1st of May which is Workers' Day
It's either beach, barbeque or picnic
Our former president, Ion Iliescu (the first president after Ceaușescu, also a commie) wanted to say that the Dacians come from the Thracians and went: "The ducks come from the trucks".
im very late to the thread [but this is basically english with romanian, accent sounds like]
you're weak, check [romanian politicians]
So this is why ducks sound like trucks when they're quacking
Deep undercover trucks
I mean
It's not completely untrue
Ducks can come from trucks

Our part in the Holocaust
We were allied with the Nazis from 1941 to 1944 and helped with the persecution of the jews (tho it wasn't as bad as some other Axis countries)
Vlad the Impaler
(Bad man with moustache
Not that he wasn’t a national hero, mind you, but most people from other countries don’t tend to view him that way
+forced colectivisation
+the epuration of the elites, the communist opponents and normal prisoners in harsh prisons or forced labor camps while building the Danube-Black Sea channel
+the annexation of the Bulgarian Cadrilater

[The Forgotten 1989 Ethnic Cleansing of Bulgaria’s Turks]
A normal day of forced communist countries
Yeah
I'm new to the subreddit and don't know how to make the country show up next to my comment
Honestly all of eastern europe was pretty much the same after WW2 as a direct result of Russia's actions
If you ask me a more dark event was the 1907 Peasant Uprising in which the government killed around 11000 people and had 10000 more imprisoned because they protested for their right to own property
Thanks !
Probably the treatment of minorities during the fascist & communist eras
The fucking Dacia Logan
Call some miners to beat up some students that were protesting (they called them huligans and said they were setting things in fire and were violent) all the while in a democracy
I was about to say corruption, but I think Vlad Tepes did something more fucked up: literally sticking people's buttholes on huge sticks (sharp) and letting them die (the people were sliding on the sticks until
yeah
google)
Or the whole political prisoners thing during communism
For most it was basically a death sentence
Not quite, but we have a saying in Romanian: luni nu creste nici iarba (not even the grass grows on Mondays)
Mărțișor - the red-and-white braided string we gift each other on the 1st of March to symbolize the beginning of spring
The first 9 days or March are called Babele ("the old women"), you pick your Baba and whatever the weather will be for that day, will also be for the whole year
The key mythological figure here is Baba Dochia, associated with the return of the spring
[Link with extra story]
Dragobete - love holiday, celebrated on 24th of February
There are all sorts of regional customs but I don't think they're very widely practiced, despite so many people complaining about Valentine's Day and "ew fake import holiday, we have our own traditions" every year lol
Also plenty of pagan traditions surrounding Christmas, Easter, weddings, funerals etc
Wow, that sounds very similar to our traditional 'capra' which means goat
There's a specific dance and music that accompany it around Christmas time
You can check it here:
Same for Romania, we even have a cake we only make for funerals
We do this 3 days after the death, then 9 days after, then 6 weeks, then 3,6 and 9 months after, then every year for 7 years, very popular especially in the countryside, kinda pointless if you ask me
Don't forget all the other, more unsettling, traditions we have in different parts of the country like poking dead people in the heart with a sharp stick or unearthing the dead after 7 years to check if they are  still dead
All of that to prevent them from turning into monsters that make vampires look like sissies
If I start delving into all the ways to protect yourself from such monsters, if you somehow failed to poke your dead, I'll be typing here till tomorrow
Thank you for the video
I see you mention the Morris dance and I have to reply with our 'călușari' dance which also looks very similar or at least the costumes do
Must check it out also:
Regarding the 'capra' it usually happens between Christams and the New Year's Eve
The 'capra' groups visit then to usher in the festive spirit so people accept them in their yards and offer them sweets, hot tea etc
Well to make sure that they stayed dead
Isn't that part obvious
If they are not there then obviously they turned into strigois or worse
And strigois are not somethig that you want to meet so you got to know if you should start investing in protective charms and stuff
Yeah vampires are little pink sissies compared to a strigoi or a moroi
If the dead people don't stay dead there's also a chance that they turn into "pricolici" (pronounced: prikolichi)
That's some sort of combination between a vampire and a werewolf and is, again, something that you don't want to deal with
Depends who you are asking, but they can be thought of as lesser strigoi
The scary part is that they look like people but like to devour them
I think the best visual representation of one would be  in the "A night to remember" trailer from Witcher
(Not sure what type of monster that one is, but it's pretty close to what a moroi would be)
I mean, there are also:
- werewolves
- witches
- balaurs (huge dragons with multiple heads)
- pegasus horses
- ogres
- dragons
- all sorts of fairies
- tueaday demons
- normal demons
- undead (also come out of graves but are harmless when compared to strigoi)
- solomonari (dragon riding, weather controlling, overpowered wizards)
- chimeras ( called zgripțuroaice)
- giants
- basilisks
- ursitoare (some sort of beings which come to newborns and bless/curse their life for no reason)
- vâlve (spirits that can be good or evil)
- vântoase (wind spirits)
- zburator (translated as "the flyer" but it's actually some sort of cupid)
- zmei (this one is a more complex being which can take many forms, including human forms, forges and uses tools and weapons, likes to marry young girls but their natural form is either a dragon or a balaur
Haha yes, in the dub they use the word "capcaun" (ogre in Romanian) so the concept was/is not something new or foreign to kids
(We have some fairytales for children that can easily be rated M, but I think Hungarian fairytales are much more hardcore)
Yup, we had a channel which aired animated versions of Hungarian fairytales and I used to enjoy them a lot
Thinking back, I have no idea how they were allowed
Those are exactly the ones I've been watching too, but dubbed
The only dish that I know that literally all Romanians like is boeuf salad
If you don't eat that, you don't belong here
My GF doesn’t like “mici”, and in Romania there’s no barbecue without “mici”.
Romanian who hates pork rinds
A Romanian who doesn't eat sarmale
A Romanian who does not blast manele from their car/bluetooth speaker in a bus
The Hungarians in Transylvania
I would one up you with a fin that also likes people and is very close to other ppl
Sarmale
I don’t like it either
Looks a lot like barf, disgusting
Many people dont like them
No idea, but everyone loves it
What is it called over there
People may or may not like boeuf salad/sarmale,but if you don't eat mititei, we prepare the stake
What kind of disease do those people suffer from
*clutches pearls* THERE ARE CHILDREN HERE
The Sun (soare) - masculine
The Moon (luna) - feminine
The sun is male: Soarele
The moon is female: Luna
Sun (in romanian "Soare") is masculine
Moon (in romanian "Lună") is feminine
in romanian we got sun: soare (masculine); moon: lună (feminine); and earth: pământ (neutral
masculine
the same word refers to land (or lands) as well which is neutral but the earth does not have plural which makes it probably masculine
but it's most likely neutral
couldn't be bothered to check the dictionary)
"Soare"(male, the sun) and "Luna"(female, the moon) in romanian
In our folklores (part of our culture) almost everytime the sun is a woman and the moon is a male
And for Earth it depennds on its used name
Earth- masculine/neutral
Terra- feminine (altough this is only used by scientists or science teachers)
Yes *Pamant* (Earth) is neuter
Un pamant, doua pamanturi
In romanian Nutella has feminine gender you can't argue it
Same in Romanian: Soarele (the sun, male), Luna (the moon, female)
Yeah, same for us: Soarele and Luna
hello fellow sarma eater
Hello there fellow vampire
Now that I think about that
The Sun is a male, the Moon is a female and their son the Earth is transsexual
:-D
Hellow fellow mamaliga eaters
That would be the interwar era
Which really wasn't. The 20s were ok
Sure, we had corruption, election rigging, no universal suffrage and bad working conditions but things were ok-ish and we had potential to improve
But the 30 is were shit hit the fan
We had an incompetent King who fucked up our electoral system even more by making votes officially meaningless as he would put in power whoever he wanted, the economy was going downhill, We had fascist groups gunning down each other in the streets, politicians getting assassinated and in the last 2 years of the decade we became an oficial one party royal dictatorship with  an incompetent playboy as our dictator
In Romania, "the golden age" is used to refer to the communist regime
Some use it ironically, some don't.
I mean probably in the interbelic period(1919-1939) ,because the romanians developed a lot in that time and the capital Bucharest was called "Petite Paris".And I do agree
Communists called the reign of dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu (1965-1989) "The Golden Age". But that's used mostly sarcastically today
Many Romanians would consider the years after WWI as the greatest because the country was united, including Bassarabia (modern-day Moldova and parts of Ukraine)
The country was an important player in regional politics
The economy was doing well, though it was mostly based on agriculture
Things went downhill fast when the Great Depression hit, which coincided with the rise of nationalism, Christian Terrorism (Legionaries), and a weak "Playboy" king
On top of everything, Soviets and Nazi decided a big united Romanian country does not fit with their plans
For Romania it is probably the period after the First Unification, from the 1860s to around 1930
It was the most culturally significant era in our history, economically we had a really good situation, being one of the biggest oil and gas producers in those times, and the monarchs really built a lot of nice places in the country, like Peles Castle, Sinaia and lots of buildings in Bucharest
And while we did have most of the same problems as today (corruption, communist leeches, bad infrastructure) we were really developing fast, and we actually had a middle class
1919-193o, right between when we **finally** reunited the country and Carol II came along to screw it all up
Romania became the most influential military in the Balkans probably, developed wealth and industry, and finally had (basically) total ethnic unity under a single flag
During communism, the communist party tried to convince people that the communist period was the Golden Age of Romania
I can agree but I can mostly disagree on this
While Romania has improved its economy and people were having jobs, some fundamental human rights were not present which led to the Revolution
Personally I think the start of monarchy was the golden age, and I might be a crazy monarchist but I could see many people actually agreeing on this as that is the time most institutions were formed, Romania got its independence, united and acomplished the dream of Romanians , many things were done and no one wanted it to end I guess
I’ll tell you what wasn’t a golden age: Communism, even though so many idiots here classify it as that
Not exactly
The golden age for Romania certainly was the 70s. Before Ceausescu decided to pay loans back and ration everything, Romania was quite a country of plenty
Most people worked 7 to 5, had good wages, nobody was homeless, and you actually had stuff to buy
People going to eat at a restaurant was a common thing, not a luxury
And even censorship was weakened during that time and western culture started getting in a bit too
I really feel like Romania as a whole was so much better in the 70s than it is today from the point of view of wellbeing of the people
explain that to the retards who mourn him still
Indeed
And, because the focus was that everyone needs to have a job, most people had very easy jobs where they didn’t have to do much
A totally different focus than today’s world where you must work 120% on minimum wage or you’re fired
Insane compared to what
To current condition for many people, it’s certainly not insane
A lot of people, illegally
When you're paid miserably and you having food next month depends on having the job, you don't risk complaining to police if the boss says "you're gonna work more than what's in your contract or you'll get fired".
Romania nowadays is full of corruption and it generally is the go-to country for cheap labour in Europe
I don't think you're spoiled
You really don't have to pay that much more to have a good experience, you just need to do some research and plan stuff out better
I don't have a horror story, but I will share a funny memory from two years ago
I got a bed in a cheap hostel in Budapest - super nice location, and the place was decent for how cheap it was
When I get to my room I see it is actually a very large room divided by thin walls, each compartment with two bunk beds
When I got to my compartment there was a heavy smell of feet, socks and wet stuff
I got in, there were 2 South Koreans in there and of course I looked at them and their feet with disgust but saluted nicely
Then I fell asleep for an hour or so because I was super tired
When I woke up the two koreans were gone
I started unpacking my stuff properly when another korean showed up, with bags and everything
When he entered I saw on his face exactly the same disgust I must have shown to the other two guys - his face was saying "omg this filthy european smells like an animal".
I think this was 2 or 3 years ago
My family and I were coming back from our holiday in Greece and we stopped at the parking lot of a big hotel in Serbia
I took out something to eat something and then I accidentally locked the keys inside the car
We had to call some mechanics, who forced a small opening through the front passenger door and then used a long wire, shaped into a hook at the end to grab the keys
The whole ordeal lasted around 30 mins, during which a crowd of around a dozen people had gathered to see the events unfold, amongst whom 3 or 4 people who most likely wanted to steal something from the car once we managed to unlock it
Once we managed to grab the keys we took of as fast as possible, therefore avoiding any further complications
Another one happened last year, while driving towards Greece
I unknowingly ate some bad pizza the day prior and then vomited every few minutes for about a third of the road
Even after I stopped vomiting I still felt very weak due to dehydration
This is the day that I would definitely say was the most uncomfortable in my life
Not my story,but the story of a camily friend pf my parents
They want to the beach in a vacantion and leftbtheir kids in the room to sleep while  they watched the sunrise
and someone got  into the room without  making  waking up anyone and stole all the money,the car key and  the car
Very nice story
Not even Romanians that love how their heads are a part of their body will not step foot in Craiova
I'm very sorry for your experience
Ugh man I'm really sorry
I'm romanian and I instantly cringed when I read Craiova
Please go to Transilvania or Bucharest next time
Waha festival if you like camping
That would have been way too much
I dont k ow the full details of the story,but I gess they got everything back in the end
Not in my hometown but in the city I'm studying, the vice-mayor told the citizens to get out by the windows with the vacuum cleaners to "clean" the air
not in my homecity but in the harbor town many boats overturned and tons of cocaine have spread  and they floted to the shore and were discovered by an old man who called the police and it was a very big national scandal:))))
But adding the necessary energy for powering all those vacuum cleaners
I doubt that is going to do more good than harm
The Maramureș region does not get enough love, it has beautifull monasteries and lovely nature
I fully agree
I always said that if i have enough luck in life i would buy a small apartment in Gijon an retire there
All of Asturias is beautiful
I'd say French and Spanish
German is way too hard and Russian is just completely out of this world for me
Try Hungarian, Estonian or Finnish if you're into killing yourself
:-P
I think you're wrong here
But let's ask somewhere and check who's right
No French versus German though
Spanish or Italian versus German
:-)
True
Languages from the same "family" are easier to be understood
For example, for me Italian or French are (I assume) like Latvian is for you
It took me one year to understand English
Tho we have a lot of "false friend" words (words that have different meaning in my language but sound the same in English)
I assume Lithuanian is even more different
With Slavic languages I only know (kind of) the Cyrillic alphabet and that's it
Do you need a rope or
some soap
A chair
A gun
A cannon
:-P
One of my best friends is a Hungarian girl from Transylvania, she's on reddit too, and she tried to teach me a lot
it didn't worked at all unfortunately
:-/
I don't know
well I can't do that
I'm sorry
But I'm sure you can find someone if you ask on r/Hungary
I hope you are not upset
I'm absolutely sure you will find someone in r/Hungary
Not many people learn Hungarian and they will be happy to help I'm sure
:-)
Are you the guys with the phrase made only out of consonants
Or am I confusing languages here
woah I actually thought she teaches Spanish everywhere (except for Spanish-speaking countries of course)
This is my favorite fact about czechia ️. Your weird aversion to vowels
Awesome fact and brilliant username, man
But I do appreciate it
I can't pronounce this shit, but that doesn't mean that I don't find it cool
Ceausescu probably
a close contest between Nicolae Ceausescu, his wife Elena or Ion Iliescu
An entire party (PSD)
Depends whoever you are asking
Some might say Antonescu (ww2 romanian non nazi field Marshall) and some idiots might say Ceaușescu (last communist leader)
[Carol II]
Politicians, leaders and kings
Some examples:
King Carol II, Nicolae Ceausescu, Liviu Dragnea, Viorica Dancila, Ion Iliescu, Vadim Tudor
Note: some of them were loved during their period of rule but now, they are hated by new generations
I think Hitler should be excluded from this kind of question because it's too obvious, just like every question involving video games in which Poland flexes the Witcher
Followed closely by Iliescu
Not even close lol
Ceaușescu is seen as positive and the best president we had by more than 50% of the population
Saul Bruckner
Ion Iliescu
Petre Roman
Adrian Năstase
King Michael
Would be a realistic list by the amount of damage they did
Edit: Number one should actually be Gheorghe Pintilie, born Pantelei Bodnarenko aka Pantiușa
We can hate Iliescu from birth till death
He will just refuse to die
The entire f*cking government not only Dăncilică
Elena Ceaușescu, Orban (some of them) Ion Antonescu (i really don t understand why he s so hated) Iohănnuț
and the rest of PSD's hierarchy
Their joking
He is generally viewed favorably even if the rehabilitation attempts failed
It really doesn't help that the soviets validated his anti-bolshevism really hard
Antonescu was voted the 5th greatest Romanian of all times in 2006 by the people
The biggest threat to Romania was Bolshevism, and he fought the best he could for Romania before being betrayed by King Michael
He is indeed considered "one of the less terrible fascists" because he didn't try to kill most of the Jews from Romania
But, as you can see, the bar is extremely low (He still killed a lot of them)
That disgusts, disturbs and disrespects me
Why would you see King Michael as hated, I mean sure before his death many communist old people hated him ( including my parents ) but after his death I think everyone woke up from all of that hate ( again, including my parents )
Personally I don't see him being hated
It’s disgusting to see how much people love Ceausescu
King Michael didn't do much
He naively believed in the allies and thus shortened the war a little, but the end would've been the same
Moreover people seem to love him
If he doesn’t die during this period he will never die
Immortal communist dinosaur
A conservative pseudo dictator that is smart and refuses to leave his seat preemptively will create a realy shity power  vacum when it happens(Or if he is assassinated it will be even worse)
Also general oppression and international isolation
Is the same thing as he said
Why is Elena Ceausescu hated
And Iohanut, by counting his votes, he doesnt really seem hated
Ion Antonescu participated in the Holocaust
The whole political class, to be more accurate
> King Michael didn't do much
Exactly
Antonescu kept the country safe, otherwise we would ve been annexed by the soviets
He had nothing to do, he had to be hitler s dog, Hungarians already wanted all of Transilvania not just the northen part, Bulgaria wanted all of Dobruja not only southern Dobruja (Cadrilaterul) and Russians wanted all of Bukovina and Moldavia not only Basarabia and Northern Bukovina
He has to do anything Hitler said otherwise our country would ve been divided between them
If that small talk happened a couple of years ago, they are most probaly reffering to how he was better then the respective power at that time
Or they were communists
And we ended under the soviets and participated in the holocaust
Historical hindsight is a really big thing when talking about Antonescu because yes he was a nationalist that tried to do the best for the nation, but he was also an anti semite military dictator that legitimately wanted to colonize the transnistrian governorate and saw only the economic problem of the holocaust
A good man he was not and we should not try to rehabilitate him
PS:The only thing he deserves nowadays is to be judged for what he actually deed and not for staying against Stalin's USSR
Would ve ended under the soviets anyways though
And we ended under the soviets **and participated in the holocaust
Well, funny enough, I did my Erasmus in Poland and I was told I had a very good accent in Polish
I only knew to say some basic sentences and to excuse myself for not speaking Polish, but apparently I had such a good accent that people thought I was taking the piss when asking me something and responding with "sorry, I don't speak Polish". It's a hard language, hard pronunciation, but it can be manageable though
As for Romanian
I think it's not that difficult
Grammar is easier compared to most Germanic and Slavic languages, only Romance languages might have a harder time
It's a very phonetic language too, so once you know the rules, it's easy
Now depending on which is your mother tongue, there are usually 4 sounds in Romanian that foreigners might have a harder time repeating:
1) the thrilled R. If you have it in your language, then it's all good
If not, it's easy to spot a foreigner by this
2) diphtons and triphtongs
Romanian has many combination of vowels that might be hard to foreigners to reproduce
The best case I can think of is "oa" as in the cities of Timisoara, Sighisoara etc
3) ă. Some sort of schwa in Romanian
Many languages have this sound, but they do not really have a letter for it
If they do not have it, they will usually have a hard time pronouncing it
4) î/â. This one reflects the Slavic influence in our language
It can be found in several Slavic languages, so for them it is easy, for the rest, not so much
Hard on all levels
Grammar: Except the fact that we also have a lot of gender pronouns, nothing too hard
Yet we somehow manage to not have an equivalent for "it", which makes Romanian not the best country to be non binary in
Accent: I've never actually heard a lot of foreigners learn Romanian
The biggest problem I've seen is putting too much accent on vowels
In Romanian *most* vowels except the one with the accent are more on the silent side than for example English
I'm no expert tho'. Don't quote me on this please
I read that many Romanians in Spain have a pretty good accent in Spanish
Yup, Hungarian seems like a very difficult language
However, the Hungarian accent in Romanian sounds very funny
What about the romanians living in italy
I heard that they have a very good italian accent
absolutely not
because not everyone has a high paying job, so those who are working minimum wage would have to work more hours to get the same salary that they'd have if everyone was working 5 days instead of 4 days
Why not reduce the work of the service industry too
I worked as a pharmacist some time ago and it's really unfair to have to keep a place open every day of the week until 10pm, just because *maybe* someone will come in
The beginning of the week was mostly dead after 8pm for us
But we just had to spend another 2h doing literally nothing
Not to say anything of the wasted time spent on Sundays
I mean, I know it's idealistic, but how about not treating the service industry/any other kind of retail as slaves to the consumers
Some jobs have "dead times", instead of spending an hour or two in a coffee break every day with your coworkers, you could consolidate that time into one extra day off
And since you'd have less time at work, you'd be more incentivised to actually work and get things done
I mean, you get paid for the work you have to do anyway
So if instead of spending a few hours every week of doing nothing productive, why not use that time to chill
A tighter schedule usually means more productivity, just because you have less time to spend in coffee breaks
Who said it has to be by force
It doesn't have to be dramatic, you know
It can easily just be an option available that some people could take that slowly reshapes the way people view work
Also, the culture of going to a bar/restaurant at any hour could be slowly and gently reshaped
We don't need to start a freaking revolution + a little bit of genocide just to get people to act nicely to the service industry
Well, that's true
And as someone suggested in another comment, it would be nice to have the option
I, for instance, work in research, so sometimes I work 10-12h a day for 6 days a week and then other times I don't really have anything to do, cuz I'm waiting around for results from other people
It would be nice for people to be less rigid about the amount of time everyone has to spend at work
Not really
In my contract it says I should work 9-5
And the work is in such a way that even if you have just reason to skip work, you're still viewed in a bad way
France - for convincing other empires to let us establish a country of our own in 1859 (Napoleon the 3rd, merci beaucoup
) and then supporting our independence dreams (1878)and our unification  (1918 ) despite other wishes of the neighboring empires (looking at you Russian Empire and your plans to reach Mediterrana)
Then again France was a big advocate in getting us in the EU in 2007 (undeserved I know, but we really appreciate it)
Thanks Netherlands for keeping us out of Schengen so that we can keep our corrupt politicians in check with justice and other sensitive topics like this
Not in Europe but thanks USA for having us in NATO and basically having our back in our relation with the difficult eastern neighbour
And yes, President Wilson  for breaking the old Austro-Hungarian Empire after WWI and promoting people's right to self determination
Italy and Spain for welcoming our immigrants in their countries and provide a home to millions of us looking for a better life
And not at last, Greece and our Balkan brothers and sisters - we love you guys, we're the same in spirit, and that is deeply embedded in our nature :)
Pretty much all of western Europe:
- We got lots of big companies investing here as we are cheaper
- A mentality that helps us fight corruption as much as we can
- Great food and vacations
- Hungary for giving us Transilvania
(Just joking, calm down)
I would like to thank Bulgaria for being the poorest country in the EU, so România isn't.
anytime man
ur welcome bro
>Hungary for giving us Transilvania
(Just joking, calm down)
I almost spit out my food with laughter :D
Happy cake day
TECHNICALLY, kürtőskalács was invented by the szekely, the transylvanian hungarians, so TECHNICALLY you should thank Romania
Just kidding of course, but Transylvanian Kurtos is the best
The hungarians make a second hand kurtos
Fuck French
That language hard af
None of my teachers even try to explain it to us
Only Google does it
I can mostly understand all other romance languages when written ( let's say around 90% because, besides romanian, i've also studied french and latin), but when spoken I can't really understand a lot
Strangely enough, I am Romanian, i know the language, and I know Italian too because I lived there, but I cannot understand ANY other language which many understand knowing one or the other
Most of my friends in Italy understand Spanish really well, whilst I can barely make out a half sentence, not to talk about French
I always liked French until I had to study it in middle school in Italy
I barely passed
Also, I can't understand French written or spoken
Maybe spoken a bit better than written
But just enough to maybe make out a word here and there
Thankfully English is pretty international, otherwise, I'd have a load of issues when travelling
i can understand a little bit of italian if i concentrate enough
Yes, I can pretty much understand most of the French words someone is saying or writing but sometimes when they talk too fast I can just pick some words
Afterall, the lexical similarity between Romanian and French is around 75%
French is understandable sometimes, but many of the more complex words and even some normal ones just dont make sense to us
Its quite a jump from "la stanga" to "a gauche"
Me personally I can't understand French that good, neither written or spoke, but I can understnd Italian written and spoken
It's hard to tell why you can't understand romanian, but we're able to understand (somehow) italian
Our vocabulary is 70% from latin
Meh, not really latin but french
Even though, I can barely speak french :D. Except some basic sentences
Hmm
We kept and adapted the latin grammar, maybe that's the reason, but I don't think so
Do Italians study latin
A streak of bad luck is making it easier than it sounds
I has shitty teachers at math,which I was supposed to excel,French,music and art
Let's just hope that I am not gonna start hating the last 2 .
Romania
How do I add a flair
Nevermind found it
Daily
Seems there’s always something big going on in the USA
Fires, hurricanes, protests, COVID response and, of course, Trump
And this is just in the last week or so
r/news is for USA news, r/worldnews is for USA news and the tv is also for USA news so too damn much
Maybe it's just me but since Trump took office we also have "Breaking news" type of stories
News about the US was a daily thing everywhere even before but before I fell that I never saw the top headlight "Breaking news" type of story outside the national election days or a mass shooting/terror attack (and even then only if it was a slow news day nationally)
> First of all,do you believe that this actually exists
Well, it exists in the same way the "Common Asian identity" or the "Common African identity" exists
it's very loose
&#x200B;
> Do you believe that we can create a new Nation,a new "Superpower" just by agreements,good words and peace
No offense but I would rather have USA as the Superpower, not Europe, especially not Europe lead by Germany
Why are soo many Europeans obsessed with being a Superpower
Why can't we be more like Switzerland
&#x200B;
> Do you really believe we can build a federation only through good words and good intentions,not even having a common language to begin with
You know there is a saying about good intentions
I don't think we can build a federation, not like this
The current structure of the EU is very undemocratic, it's a technocracy ruled by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels
First, we need some serious reforms before we can talk about a federation
Here I very much agree with Yanis Varoufakis, even though I'm not his biggest fan
I for one whenever I think about this something like a family tree pops into my mind
I'm Romanian, then, coming from the southern part I feel more close to the Balkans, then Eastern European and then European as a whole
I do believe in a European identity, but not something like a nationality, more like a family group
Just like how we have the romance family, the germanic family, southern slavic family and so on, I believe in a higher European family
As much as I would like an European superstate, I don't think it would be too feasible, at least in the near future
What makes Europe great and what helped every European nation throughout history was the competition between small groups of people
That's why I feel that for Europe, a system that brings closer every group of people, but at the same time promotes a peaceful competition between them would be the best system for Europe
If we're good at it, why not promote it
Instead of a big group of people that work for a man at the top, a small close-knit family that lives together and in which every member does its own thing, but still contribute to the overall happiness and well being of the family would be best
A national identity is built,and so is the European identity,I am sure that by 2069 there will be a federation
I believe that, although there is commonality of some aspects between European peoples, there is not enough to justify the creation of a new state
For a European federation to be created requires a great number of people to admit that they, their forefathers, their national heroes, and all that they have stood for in the past, are wrong
Even in Spain, there are separatist movements
Even in Britain
To form a confederacy of European states means that all of these people must suddenly be happier
Furthermore, it means that almost every national hero of every nation must be made guilty for defending his nation’s sovereignty or for harming his brothers, if a federation is what is right for Europe
Bran castle
It is nice, sure, but it doesn't warrant the attention it gets
There are far more beautiful castles and fortresses in Romania
With that being said, Bran is in a beautiful area of Romania that is definitely worth visiting
i wouldn't say its overrated, it's definitely worth a visit, the bran castle gets the most attention, but there are more cool castles in romania that don't get as much traction as they deserve, my personal favourite is the peleș castle which is sinaia
The Old Town in Bucharest
That is legitimately the only place I see tourist guides talk about on YouTube aside from the Palace of the Parliament
I looked up on youtube to see how are foreigners presenting Bucharest and for 20 minutes straight he just walked in the Old Town showing the PotP only when it was visible from one of the streets
"Exploring Bucharest" my ass
>Disclaimer: I hate it when people label a city/country as a whole as "overrated" or <another negative label>. They're toursity for a reason, and life outside of tourism also does happen in those places
This
Cities like Paris, London or LA are famous for a reason, they hold special bits of history and culture and they have places that you won't find anywhere else
Plenty of people have heard so much about those locations and want to go see them in real life, and there's nothing wrong with that
Even if you end up disappointed, it's better to satisfy that curiosity than to regret not going
Hell, maybe you'll absolutely love that landmark and have the time of your life there, despite the negative stuff people say
A tourist trap is something that advertises itself to be more authentic/local/interesting than it really is, for the purpose of money
Just be aware and educated about what you're visiting and what to look out for
After all they're just normal cities that exist in the same world as our hometowns, there are all kinds of people and attitudes there, and they are not what they were 50-500 years ago
Because it’s way cheaper than Mamaia, like half price
Worst thing is Vlad the Impaler never even lived there
If anybody is interested, Poenari Castle is actually were he lived
Castelul Huniazilor ar trebui vizitat de mai multi turisti
E un loc foarte frumos
I live in the Netherlands since 2019 and Amsterdam is my favourite city, except the very touristic part
I wonder why Ducth people hate Amsterdam so much, lol
Hahah it's called the *Little* Mermaid for a reason :P
Exactly
It's okay to not enjoy a place, but it's also important to go with realistic expectations
I agree
It's sad because Romania has quite a few creepy places but the only one that gets attention is Bran Castle
If you want to show her some real strange stuff show her Hoia Baciu forest
Eu l-am vizitat si consider ca se merita
I think it’s much more extreme in the UK
London literally feels like a different country
I lived in Birmingham for 3 years and I moved to London and i don’t feel like i’m in the same country
Our Goulash-eating friends to the northwest
Some people believe their in the past and continue hating on hungarish
Hungary of course, and people who call Bucharest Budapest aren't helping
Hello hungarians
Bulgaria
We are constantly wrestling for the bottom two places at the bottom of any european top when it's about something positive and at the top 2 position when it's something negative
Hungary or Russia
Hungary, of course
Is there *someone* that didn't try to conquer us
Besides that, apparently lots of people have beef with Hungary and them with us
United States, Canada, Mexico, Panama-
We have a lot, really, but notable are Hungary, Russia, Bulgaria, and Turkey, because we want Transylvania, Bessarabia, Dobrogea, and independence
Well then
Hungary I must say ... or Russia
Nah Hungary
There are wayy too many Romanians here
Also regarding Transylvania i say we let  the true people decide
The vampires
Hungary
Easy
Yeah, here many people hate hungary because they "claimed" Transylvania
What did Vietnam ever do to Moldova
The thing is we are rivals
And there is only one way to find out which one is better
We put the Orbans in an arena
The one who survives is the winner
Even in Walachia they haven’t got to good of a name, even if we haven’t interacted that much
We care for you, Transylvanian bros
Gotta get that sweet kurtos
I see no russian here, they must be afraid
You wish
Bulgaria is Romania's Dinkleberg, two equally shit countries yet somehow those damn Bulgarians over the Danube always give out the better impresion with their fancy tourism and good PR, damn you Bulgaria
Come on how bad can it be
Hopefully they kill each others
Win win situation
It wasn't me, man, i dont know
but those hungarians are talking shit about you, brothers, you must do something
just break my heart, those bastards
Yeaah, but our Orban will die better
Ah, the good ol' switcharoo and blame Hungary
Gold
Party like it's 1849
Hold the phone
earthquakes coming more and more in the Balkans
Oh no
Not a repeat of '77
Part of me understands it but part of me doesn't... What do you mean by "also his wife"
Ahahaha now I get it
there's this nice little poem my grandmother taught me "sare n-avem, pâine n-avem dar canal la mare avem, şi se plimbă cu bărcuța Ceauşescu si Elena"/ "We don't have salt, we don't have bread, but channel to the sea we have, and riding on a dinghy are Ceauşescu and Elena
" Quite nice to see the other side of Romania (the Hungarian part) cause I'm part Hungarian and nobody will tell me anything xD
I really wanna go to Disneyland, and the Paris one is the closest obviously, I live in Spain but
I don't really like it
I wish I could rather go to the biggest one in USA lol
And as for other tourist places
I really don't see the appeal in visiting the capitals, in any country tbh
I think that capitals are usually the most boring part of every country
Most capitals are rather similar and very touristy
I feel like it's better to go to more traditional places
Like Instead of going to Barcelona I would tell someone to visit Playa de Aro which Imo is prettier lol or even Tarragona
And in Romania instead of Bucharest to visit places like Sinaia, Sighisoara
I don't feel the need to visit Paris, Rome, Madrid, Lisboa
I think there are much more beautiful places than those in said countries
I'd be curious to see how many tourists come for Barcelona-specific things they are interested in (such as Gaudi's architecture or Camp Nou) versus general stuff like beaches or parties, or just to tick Spain off the travel list
Same for London
Tbh Barcelona itself seems great for people who are genuinely interested in Barcelona-specific things (like Gaudi's buildings for an architect, or Camp Nou for a football enthusiast)
But I assume these people are just a small percentage of the total number of tourists
There are flights that can land in other places of Romania, we don't only have an airport in Bucharest though
And fine, if you want a quick 2 days vacation
But Imo if I was gonna take only a weekend vacation I would just go somewhere in my own country or to a a neighbor country rlly close than go to a different country that's more far
If you wanna really visit a country you need to go with time
I don't know any Portugeuse but i remember someone telling me "pula" in portugeuse means "jump".
In Romanian it means dick
And i remember something about a portugeuse singer singing a song with the word "muie" which means "blowjob" in Romanian
Edit: I forgot to mention the word "Cum" which means "How"
The word "Nervos" in Romanian means "Angry", which is pretty different from the English word "Nervous".
We would usually call these "false friends" when learning a language:
Romanian: librărie | English: bookstore
Romanian: bibliotecă | English: library
Romanian: desert | English: dessert
Romanian: deșert | English: desert
Romanian: drujba = chainsaw
Russian: drujba = friendship
It is like that because during communism, a soviet company Friendship was the only and main producer of chainsaws, so we adopted that word for it
Cocina in Spanish meand kitchen
Cocina in Romanian means pigsty
“Geci” in Romanian means jackets
“Geci” in Hungarian means jizz
Related to pezevenk, we have the word pezevenghi in Romanian, which means something like naughty
In Romanian it’s close enough
We have “curva” meaning the same as in the Slavic languages, while for the Spanish and Italian “curva” we say “curba”
Also romanian: cald (warm) and german: kalt (cold), are pronounced the same but mean the exact opposite
In the past couple of years I realized that yes, I in fact do like living in my country, which is my home and where my friends and family are
And even though there are issues, I started to look at them with the mindset that issues exist everywhere and we should try to solve them as much as we can
There are plenty of countries with more issues than mine, and plenty with a lot of the issues solved, but that have other kind of issues of their own
SO I am fine home :)
Nevertheless I like to travel very much and I'm looking forward to the restrictions being lifted
How do people put their countries next to their names
I want that too
Anyway, I don't see how to answer this question
Im Romanian but studied in Italy since I was ~7 and now I'm in UK, which I want to leave and maybe try out Ireland before coming back to Romania
Reasons:
Immigrated in Italy because parents did so,
moved to UK cuz things in Italy got bad,
I wanna move away from UK cuz I believe Brexit is bad, and in staying here, I am condoning UK's choice
Ireland is close enough, speak English so no trouble learning new language, I heard they're doing very well economically, and strangely enough all the Irish people I met are really cool & friendly
+ I have a weak spot for reds and I heard Ireland is full, so might even find my soulmate there, but I'm kind of a weird person, so I think it'll be just as probable as finding it anywhere else
So yeah, here's my life on a plate for y'all
I love my country but I hate the uneducated people from it
I visited England one year ago and I fell in love with the Victorian architecture and if i would choose a country to live, I would probably choose England because of the architecture and because of their accent which is so elegant
I love living in Romania
Yes, it has it's own problems, but it has so many beautiful places, beautiful people
I would NEVER leave my country to live in another
The country is not too bad, it could be way worse
That being said, I'm in a way forced to move out, can't really form a family here and I wouldn't want my children to be subjected to abuse
Spain is looking really good, not just scenery-wise, but as a people too, which is what interests me most
We're still researching things, but so far Gandia and Ferrol seem really, really nice
There is a big thing here
"I can't wait to leave this country".
Well is not the same for me - I always loved Romania and I would never like to leave it
There is also a cliche here (and it was commonly used in the past) how, as eg, "In Germany the salaries are much better and everything is much cheaper
I can't wait to move there and leave this s**th**e".
No, but I don't have anywhere else to go
Everywhere else is either crappier, expensive, or the Internet is slow
I gotta say, as a romanian living abroad, I feel you
Today was a normal day, woke up, started working, and as I am working from home, i put on some music
And some random Romanian rap song came on, and I suddenly bursted into tears, thinking of how much I miss home
You leave thinking of better 'prospects' and once you're there you realise how much your country means to you
Piggybacking on your comment to mention that even though I mostly agree with you and things are somewhat fine, lately I fear they took a turn for the worse
Our parliament just [banned gender studies] meaning they want to ban all educational institutions (including universities) from "propagating theories and opinion on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex". I can only imagine that banning discussions about gender identity, consent, sexual education etc will only rise the violence against the LGBTQ+ community, and young girls and women
On top of that, during the lockdown, women's reproductive rights have been reduced to 0
In the begining there were no hospitals in which they performed abortions (and there are still very few open to this procedure now), our internal affairs minister told us to give birth at home instead of going to the hospital (wtf
Currently half of the population is paying taxes for what, to carry unwanted pregnancies and be told to give birth at home
I feel like this is only a preview for what's about to come and we are taking after the Hungarian and Polish model
I have to admit, not one single place screamed 'you should move here' to me as Iceland did
Driving for 10-15 minutes on a highway without a single car coming from the opposite lane is one of the more soothing sensations out there
I want to move to Ireland soon
(current history is Romania - Italy - UK)
And I actually am curious how much is rent
I looked around a bit and prices seemed OK
I mean, in the UK you can get £1000/month for a house which
Well
Can't say I *love*, and on a website I found prices around €800-600/month
Even €500 if you really wanna risk it going low
Was I lied to by the almighty Internet
Also, where can I find a proper list of Irish universities
There's quite a few lists for UK unis, but I couldn't find many for Ireland
Thank youuu
>at least people who violently oppose the 'third gender' are not taken seriously
And we basically don't talk about this anymore
I wonder what went differently in Romania
I feel like we're on the same boat
A couple of years ago we had this referendum to ["define family" in the constitution] Currently the constitution uses a gender neutral language to reference marriage, and although gay marriage isn't permitted yet, it provides an opening for potential recognition
The association (the "coalition for family") who pushed for this referendum wanted to change the wording of marriage to "an union between a man and a woman", thus making gay marriage unconstitutional
Fortunately, people boycotted the referendum, but not because they're all so for LGBTQ+ rights, but because the proposal was ambiguous an left room for further amendments that weren't explicitly stated, so
yay for corruption and hidden agendas
This Coalition for family isn't really being taken seriously but right now they're taking advantage of the current shaky ground to make room for their extremist views
They push for a "traditional" family, they are against abortion they want to ban adoption by single parents, and they generally have a very aggressive stance towards anyone that is not sharing their views
Unfortunately they're backed by the church (how surprising
>But damn, banning an entire academic field
what happened to free speech
It's ironic given how often alt-right people complain about violations of their free speech
Exactly
But try to explain to one of those that free speech isn't the same as hate speech
>And I always tend to think about Romania and Bulgaria as the same thing lol How are things going with LGBT rights in Romania
Do you feel like society is getting more accepting
I personally feel optimistic about Bulgaria
We Romanians feel the same about Bulgaria
I think generally the population is starting to open up to the idea of LGBT rights, but I fear that this bill will take us a few steps back
We signed petitions and we are hoping that the president will downturn it
Recently there was also a bill to introduce sexual education in schools but it was severely botched so not much will change for now
Overall I dunno man, I feel that so much money and energy is being wasted on this bullshit instead of staying out of other people's bedroom and focusing on educating and feeding the poor
Thank you, I'll note this for later, I plant to move by August if possible, so will have to hurry up with preparations
Thank you
I expected a longer list, but often less is more, and it just simplifies the whole process
Do you also have a rough idea about the cost
In UK it's like £9
500/year I assume it is something similar
I assumed all these high costs come as standard in capitals, I was just looking at a smaller city not-too-far-but-not-too-close to Dublin
Similar thing goes on in London: 1small room goes for ~£800/month, or so says my friend
But I do see your point, for a small room, from ~€900 or whatever the equivalent would be, to €1500 is nearly double for same standard
Historically, a terrible place, between the Ottoman Empire, Russia Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire and add some Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth to the mix
Now that everything is pretty much calm, we can enjoy the nature, as we're pretty well placed having access to lots of mountains, the Black Sea, the Danube Delta and so on
We have resources, we need the right people and we should be doing better and better
Russia's sphere of influence is a bit too close for confort though, that would be the worst thing
I mean, it's something
Our neighbors are not THAT bad, we have almost all types of terrain, bunch of rivers, pretty nice lakes and much more
As far as position in the continent goes, we kind of tend to be forgotten sometimes
We're a bit left out I think
Shitty, everyone and their mom came here basically
I think only Poland has a worse situation than us since they don't even have some decent mountains to hold back invasions
I always felt like we are in the wrong position
Just look at the language
Northwest: Hungarian Empire
Northeast: Russian Empire (and everybody else to conquer Ukraine and Basarabia)
South: Ottoman Empire
Yep, perfect
This has in no way ever hurt us throughout our history, not even once
We have a pretty meh relationship with our neighbors to be honest, as in we neither hate, nor love, we're just chill
Things get a bit hot every once in a while with Hungary, but other than that we're pretty chill
Somehow that makes me feel worse
Romanian here, moved to Germany for university 5 years ago, currently doing a PhD in Belgium with no intention of ever moving back
Like others have said, it's a matter of feeling like where I was born wasn't where I was meant to be
Romania felt in many ways small
small minded people, few opportunities  for what I knew I wanted to do (research/academia), large scars left by communism that I do not have the patience or will to deal with
It felt as if I would have wasted my life away if I had stayed and I wasn't particularly attached to any family or friends to compel me to stay
Being gay was also a huge factor cause I wanted to be able to live a happy and honest life with myself and those around me and Eastern Europe doesn't really allow for that
I love your profile pic
Same here
I moved from Romania to the UK when I was 13
Next year I will take my A-levels so I can move to Romania and pursue my dream to become a pilot

You have a lot of courage
"A face treaba mare" - "To do the big job" or something like this
We also have the little job when we pee
One that is subtle I use is "Ma trece".A good translation might be "It struggles",since "It passes" does not make a lot of sense
What does a Saxon accent sound like to be different from a regular German one

Dacia was the most 'successful' model, followed by the Lada 1200 and Skoda 120
Trabant trailed them at a distance :)
Back in the days: Of course it was, we were part of the Eastern Bloc, after all
Today: very rare, you might see them at retroparades, or being driven by some Moldovan visitors (I live near the border)
Moskvitch would like a word
Anyway
The Lada was meh, I don’t remember it being too appreciated, the real prize was the rear engine Skoda
The Niva 4x4 was a very rare sight, and we already had our ARO (same rust levels) which did the trick quite well
Not only Moskvitch, there were also Volgas and others, but I think that was the holy trinity until 1982/83 when Oltcit started to get traction
Oh yes
The Volga’s! Tanks on wheels, chugging petrol like a Kamaz truck
Then the Oltcit suddenly appeared, a fancy sporty car (for the time) that would get its distributor wet in any puddle, fun times

Honestly, so many dark stories
I remember I loved reading the disney stories books
Except they weren't the disney versions, but the original ones
I had huge books full of these stories, illustrated for children
I remember loving it and reading them before bed
Lol
Also tons of other older Romanian books with stories for children that were very dark
I remember one of my favorites was one about some kid that was converted into some sculpture by a fountain
I don't remember much more but I just know I loved it
It was depressing
Also, remember loving one about a poor child that tried to make some money by selling matches and if I remember correctly her father
Would always treat her like shit and only use her to get some money and she would stare through the window at happy families into their houses and I remember it broke my heart every time I read it
And so many more
I hate that these types of stories are frowned upon now
They're so good
I will 100% make my kids read them lol
Also, so many songs that I got taught I Romania or poems that were dark and meant to scare children into behaving well or being aware of stranger danger lol
Idk, I see kids nowadays doing some stuff that me, my colleagues, and my childhood friends couldn't even grasp when we were their age
So, anything that was dark then seems just meh today
Edit: oh, wait, I didn't read beyond the title
You were not talking about irl stories, my bad
Well, the little mermaid was dark (the original story by Andersen)
She traded her status to chase a guy who friendzoned her
Then she was given the choice to kill the guy to save her own life, but she chose not to (it's basically kill or commit suicide)
But I guess kids nowadays read it to, so maybe is not too dark
Lol
Also, the 2 kids actually die, unlike some other tales where they just get swallowed whole and are saved later
Plus, he cuts their heads and puts them on the window sill so the mother can see them and hurry inside thinking that they are waiting for her
As a kid I never truly realized how fucked up this story was
This sounds very tame Imo hahah
Yeah same for us, I don't think anyone ever associated it with skin color
In the Romanian story, she asks them to only open the door if they hear her sing
>!The Wolf changes his voice to trick them
The middle one always gets, he blows his cover by saying "Bless you
" when the wolf sneezes
And he also splatters the walls with their blood
There are similarities
>!In the Romanian version, there's only 3 kids
The wolf fixes his voice by having his teeth and tongue sharpened, not with honey
>!He actually decapitates the two older kids, and leaves their heads by the window so the mother thinks they are waiting for her
>!The goat makes him fall into a pit and he burns to death
>!The story ends with the goat and her friends having a party
Yeah
Why do I feel like I heard/read different variants of this story lol
That's the version I remember too tbh
You probably were told this story when you were young
It's written by Ion Creangă (or John Branch if you feel like over-translations), and in this thread I learned it's probably inspired by the German one
I would imagine there are other versions as well
If he hadn't lost while running for President, [this dude] surely would have won
Imagine a battle between two immortal beings
In the left corner the queen
And in the right corner putin
It shall not happen
I'm going to hell for this, but women will start crying and demand the rest don't hit them  because of their gender
Almost kissing people on the lips because in your country you start from the other cheek
(Romanian in Austria and France)
I had a lot of misunderstandings because of what I consider to be manners and red flags
For instance, we have a German guy in our group that constantly talks about others behind their back
He will eventually say those things to their face, but never as harshly as he did
This for me and for my other eastern friends is a big red flag
But for southern Europeans and other Germans not so much
That sounds rude as hell, wtf
And it's one sure way for people to seek to avoid your company
>These people are not liked in Germany as well, maybe the defenders were just polite
The defenders would say: but the person finds out what he said/was told eventually
Which was true
And he wasn't a lying backstabber per se, more like a gossiping bitch
But I felt like that completely broke the trust I had in these people
All of them
>Germans are usually very frank
This is one think I actually really appreciate in my other German friends
Although I had to tell myself repeatedly that they don't mean harm as very sincere people are sometimes seen as rude in Romania
I definitely fucking avoided them after seeing their true colors
Yes and no
There are things that I like better in western Europe
Things that make me more comfortable with who I've become
Notions and ideas that helped me evolve into a happier person
And I'll ever be able to go home and be the same person again
I also feel the need to ask for those things from my peers at home too
There will also always be a part of me that will not fit anywhere except in Romania
But I've found that Ro is not the only place the peasant in me fits in
That part of me that gets homesick is pretty much satisfied by my eastern European friends
They were brought up in similar conditions and left their countries for similar reasons and now they've evolved in similar ways
I'm never gonna fit in somewhere 100%. And that's OK
I do not take part in most of our culture
I dont like speaking my language, I dont find myself enjoying life here
Absolutely
I feel incredibly out of place here and have my whole life
I want to leave first chance I get, not only because the country is a socio political shithole but also because I just don't like being here
Yep
I dislike most of everything mainstream and popular here, and what I oike is deeply unpopular here
Also the mindset here feels very diffrenr from mine (not in a bad way)
Really I don't feel like I belong
It's not that I don't feel like I belong, it's just sad to live here, which makes me think I'd "fit" better somewhere else
Under 18, and i prolly will
The states seem like a nice option to pursue what i want
I live in the capital
Thats worse than small cities imo
Im under 18 anyway so i wouldnt be able to
Prolly gonna study abroad and take a job there
I am not looking for the american dream or whatever, but other countries to me dont seem too appealing or friendly to what i like in terms of laws and whatnot, and personally, while i think my country's beautiful, i dont see what i want to pursue that viable with the current circimstances, especially here
It depends really
Yeah, it's immature, but from time to time and in informal circles is by no means frowned upon
On the contrary it's a bounding mechanism
Peach schnaps, mmmmm
Nope
Have you ever visited the UK/Ireland
This probably goes for most countries, but telephone booths are so rare to see nowadays
Depends on the city
In some areas they are still common (which is very unfortunate)
Yes there are some, made almost exclusively by Baptists
I've seen one that had some Bible quotes (can't recall if there were more) but stuff like "Hell is real".... idk
It's funny that even if 95% of the population is Christian here, I rarely saw this kind of billboards
And even those were quite neutral
I’ve saw some of them on the highway but not much elsewhere
Someone else from Ro commented that there are some in the west of Ro
In my part of the country I've never seen anything like that
It would be super weird to see something like that, tbh
And how does he get the money to pay for them
Does God have a job, an inheritance
Or does he use his magical power to put them up
Where have you seen them ? I havent seen anyone
I can confirm it, saw them in the north of Romania (Suceava & Botoșani)
They are along the lines of „You haven't read any book if you haven't read the bible”. Made by Baptists or other Protestant groups
Haven't seen Orthodox billboards tho
seen none in buch
Wow, I haven't seen any
I’ve seen a few going in and out the city with texts like “Iisus te iubeste” (Jesus loves you)
In Bihor there are lots of them
Usually you can see a few at the entrences of cities
Timisoara and Cluj-Napoca have them from what I've seen
I think Timisoara also used to have one north of the city centre squares - not sure if it's there anymore
I am from Suceava, so you are spot on :D
Well, lucky you
There are a few, mostly as you drive out of the city
Edit: I found [some] [photos] They are all linked to  According to [this blog] the first one is on Centura and was paid for by the blog owner (who seems to be a Baptist pastor)
I am from Bihor and I haven't seen any :(
On Centura Oradea there are a few
I read the Italian labels on products when there aren't any available in English/French/Ro
I haven't died yet because of this, so I guess I'm doing OK
French or Italian, both have a simmilar vocabulary to Romanian and simmilar grammar (looking at French)
The issue is Romanian is a phonetic language, so everything is read out as it is written, unlike other Latin languages (looking at French, again)
If we only take into account the amount of understood words, I’d say French is more understandable than Italian, but I feel like communication in Italian is easier for someone with no prior knowledge, whereas French is kind of a pain, from a Romanian perspective, ofc
Well I'm kinda biased because I actually studied Spanish and we had French in school
But Italian, Spanish and some French
Italian is super similar and you really don't need to know it to understand the instructions on a product or ingredients on a label, etc
Because I speak some Spanish, Portuguese is quite easy to understand as well, it's like Spanish with a weird accent
Also heard quite a few words we have in Romanian
French is the hardest
I can usually understand the general idea of a text but it's hard to really comprehend something
When I see German written I feel like: ok fairly similar to English
When someone speaks German: Dafuq is this
I heard English and Dutch are pretty similar aswell
Did it take long for you to learn it
Oh that’s cool, English is probably the closest language to Dutch
Though Dutch might be closer to German
Some say Dutch is like a mixture of English and German
Alcoholism, barbecues, complaining
I just don't see Romania without these
Staying close to the family
Back during communism families would have about 5 children each so yeah
.  That's a lotta people going back to see mama and with children of their own
The food and alcohol, they are so good, that no one will ever want to replace them
I think that's true for us too
Plus homemade sausages and the like, they are the best
My girlfriend is polish and keeps saying Romania is like a slavic remix of ancient Rome
I was going to this year but the pandemic said no
Maybe next year
Do you guys have pituști
(I saw it written as pituski too) They are like red, flat meatballs made from very spicy/hot meat and you grill them
I love those so much
Mititei or Mici (both romanian words meaning "little ones" / "small ones") is a dish from Romanian cuisine, consisting of grilled ground meat rolls in cylindrical shape made from a mixture of beef, lamb and pork with spices, such as garlic, black pepper, thyme, coriander, anise, savory, and sometimes a touch of paprika
Sodium bicarbonate and broth or water are also added to the mixture
Served with mustard or salt, and a cold cold beer
Shawarma, basically a kebab thing with fries, lettuce, pickles and many condiments
(Mustard, Ketchup, Garlic sauce etc
Also, our Bagels and stuffed corns are to die for
LUCA, MATEI, PAUL, the best bagel and stuffed corns (mostly with cheese and ham) producers
And they are also pretty cheap
We have them in many flavours
Also, pizza is very popular, and most Romanians think we make better pizza than italians
I'd like to add that the reason they are pretty unique is that the sodium bicarbonate gives them an interesting texture that makes them like a fluffy and kinda gummy delicious meat cylinders
Is like eating a tender, meaty marshmallow
> and sometimes a touch of paprika
Blasphemy
I love langos
Exactly
Also, I think we should mention bagels
They are so many types and so good
It looks like there's a lot more vegetables mixed in with the meat and it mixes well with curry as well apparently, I doubt our dish would taste good that way
Also, in the pictures some of the *kofta* was spherical, you could get the death penalty in Romania for doing that to our *mici*
Kofta are a type of kebab, ours are not,but too add a good chunk of romanian cuisine is inspired by the turkish cuisine
Yes
We have tough ones, soft ones, with poppy seeds, with sesame seeds, with sunflower seeds, with sea salt, with all four, we have sweet ones filled with jams, chocolate, pudding or all three, we have thin pretzels, thick pretzels, pretzels with coconut and honey, pretzels with walnuts and sugar syrop (mucenici), pretzles with just honey, round pretzels, traditional shaped pretzels, swirly pretzels, pretzels with pretzels etc
God damn we love our pretzels
They're dirt cheap too
Luca, Paul, Matei, va invoc
The qofte basically just a meatball
The thing that makes the mici different from qofte is the bicarbonate sodium, it gives them a different taste and feeling (the mici are a lot softer)
From Wikipedia : "In 2013, with new European Union regulations regarding food additives coming to effect, there was a fear that mici producers will be forced to stop using sodium bicarbonate (E500) an important part of the recipe
" Romania protested because "According to producers, removing the bicarbonate sodium from mici would leave the dish unrecognizable, nothing more than a meatball

Will do
Having one, not sure, but it's kinda weird displaying it
Only public buildings usually do that
(TL;DR at the end)
From my point if view, I don't think it is weird to own a flag of the country
I am living far away from Romania and when I go home I take my flag with me because I go back to Bucharest near the date of the  National Day of Romanian Flag
Now, call me weird or whatever, I am here to answer because I feel like this question suits me the most
Last year, I arrived a day before the Flag Day and I decided to march from my house to the "Tricolour's Square" in Bucharest where there was a ceremony and there is a huge Romanian Flag, all by foot and the distance is pretty big but I was enjoying it
As I was walking with my flag (I have to specify it was not a small flag made out of paper, it was like one of these flags you see outside official buildings) I had people reacting to the flag and asking me questions
To my surprise, no one opposed to the actions, in fact I had a lady asking me if she can take a picture with the flag
Someone even came to ask me why I have a flag , I told them because I was not expecting every Romanian to know when the flag day is
I had policemen wave at me
A group of Turkish people asked if they could borrow the flag for a photo in front of the ex-Royal Palace, now Art Museum
I don't know if that really answered the question but what I am trying to say is, even if it might be weird, people would still be curious and some of them might even join but they will never boo you or think you are racist or anything like that
How would I have reacted if I saw someone do the same thing
Well probably the same as the other people to be honnest
TL;DR : It is not weird to have one, might raise curiosity if you display it
It's not weird in Romania to have a Romanian flag
on the 1st of December (national day) everybody puts their flag out the window so as we have a lot of communist buildings all together when you walk down the street you would see walls of flags and only flags
quite beautiful
it's kinda odd seeing a flag on someone's house, not alot of people fly it, you sometimes see them in rural areas, but not so much in urban ones
except if its the 1st of december, then its pretty normal
I have seen houses in rural areas that have one on display, but it's not that common
I think it's fairly common displaying one on the 1st of December and 1st of May, I always see lots of them in people's windows or on cars
This is such an underrated joke
I think it is [this] photo
This has been taken in 1987, showing how we moved an entire block of flats with people still being inside
It was moved to make space for a boulevard
The building had a weight of 7600 tons and still exists today
the union of 1918
I feel everyone knows this one:
Biggest empire to ever exist is now represented by this guy
Who do you think is rolling in their grave right now
I would've said the portrait of young Mihai Eminescu (our national poet, for anyone not aware - shoved down our throats from 1st to 12th grade), because that's in every single school book, paper and whatnot
However, going on wiki I learned that it was [taken in Prague, by a photographer named Jan Thomas] Foiled again
[This one] of a young man taken during 1989 revolution is quite known also
Fuck
This is quite recent history
'The relocation operation took place on May 27, 1987, and the process was more complex, consisting of splitting the block in two and moving diagonally through translation of both sections, on an inclined axis of 33 degrees, 50 minutes and 40 seconds'

There's a [statue] of the woman
U mean [this one
You should use him to generate power
The "used to be" was implied :P. And represented here in this thread, not in general
Whoa
Where is this
I think it's in Varberg, Sweden
Corruption
We can’t have poper healthcare, roads, infrastructure etc
Lots of incompetents, usually from the ruling party, in charge of everything
Wow, you guys in commentaries have really "first world problems".
The rate this is improving at is proportional to the rate of population replacement, sadly
Some people just don't see a problem with corruption
Romania likes this, Romanians dislike this
Same here
But I would say it's the worst in the public sector and smaller companies
I feel like in big companies this is not as bad
Romania has 19 million people, and I don’t think we ever “made ourselves heard”.
>Some people just don't see a problem with corruption
Because it's inside us since long, long time ago
We have normalized bribery (doctor, teacher) and the classical saying "he stole, but he also built".
This nation is uncurable
It’s more at the middle towards the top
It’s getting better anyway, I don’t think you can bribe police now
While I agree that things are dire, I don't necessarily share your pessimism, and I don't think it's very productive
But I understand that it may be frustrating if you've been battling it your whole life
I've had my share of frustrations and moments when I wanted to forget about the whole place
I don't think attitudes are not changing at all, just that they're changing very slowly
But even looking at how stuff was 10 years ago, the level of awareness around corruption is much higher, and way more people think it's not acceptable
And we have better mechanisms to enforce it and fewer incentives to be corrupt (for example if doctors are paid ok, which now they are, they don't need to be corrupt to afford food and housing)
Maybe in large part because of some diffusion of ideas with people working (not stealing wallets) abroad
Are we at a mentality comparable to western nations
Will we be there in 5 years
Clearly not
But will we *ever* get there
Yes, possibly
I pay 6€ for 30GB, with 2,8GB available in roaming
Ah, and basically unlimited minutes in all networks
For some reason, the most vivid reminder for me was when i was walking in front of the old communist party HQ in Bucharest
I remembered a picture from December 1989 with tanks in the street, people holding rifles, and the University Library next door half burned down
And this was not ages ago, my parents were around to remember that
The war in Transnistria as well, I have a friend whose dad was a war correspondent there
We profited off helping the NATO campaign in Serbia for a fast track to the EU and NATO, supported by the British
I don't say this proudly at all, but it's what happened, and it happened during my lifetime too
I've met people with VERY strong opinions about that
These events, just like the world wars, shape every aspect of where we live and who we are, the language we speak, where we go on holiday or to work and study, who our friends are
Of course it's otherworldly to think of the cities and towns you know laying in ruin, but the fact of war itself is not
I agree with you but the last european war happened in the 90's
You know, I can't really tell
As I said, some people have very strong opinions, but on both sides
Some say it was a smart move to provide a base for NATO, because they supported our EU membership
Others say it was a betrayal or our neighbours and that Serbs had a historic right over the lands they were fighting to preserve
I suspect it would tip in favour of the first, but I don't have any data to support it
Personally, I think EU and NATO membership are all good, and support people's right to self-determine (always - be it Bosnia in the 90s or Catalonia and Scotland today), but wish the cost would not have been a bloody war
NATO even failed to stop some of the worst bloodshed and civilian casualties as far as I know
We have quite a few old units but none of them are in use anymore\*. Most of them live on through literature and popular sayings
Here's a few examples:
*verstă* (comes from Russian) = roughly 1 km
*funie* = roughly 27 km
*stânjen* (from Latin word *stadium*) = 2,23 m
*palmă* (the distance between the fully extended thumb and pinky)
*șchioapă* (the distance between the fully extended tumb and forefinger)
*deget* (width of a finger) - some people still use this one
*pogon/iugăr* (from the Ancient Roman unit *jugerum*) = roughly 6440 sq meters
*vadră* = approx 15 liters
*oca* (entered Romania through Byzantine influence) = 1,5 liters
Up until the Union in 1859 between Moldova and Muntenia, these units were used in both areas but had slightly different sizes (the ones I mentioned above are the metric equivalents of the Moldavian units)
Alexandru Ioan Cuza passed a law that attempted to standardize these units and bring them closer to the European metric system
There is a popular story of him going in town under disguise and busting the shady vendors that were using a smaller size *oca* than the official one
Therefore we have the saying ”*a umbla cu ocaua mică”* (not very widely used though) = to lie or cheat
Edit: \*correction, seems like they're still alive and well :D
Pogon  .
It's use for measuring areas
It's around half a hectare (a hectare is 10,000 square meters for my american friends) .
Its exact measurment varies because it was mostly used to determine land proprieties like forests and agral land, so an exact measure was never really neded as a few meters never bothered anyone
One modern calculation puts it at around 5011 square meters
Romania has something called "prăjină" which has many meanings, but used in agriculture it is the equivalent of aproximately 25 square meters
(25
293 to be exact)
There are two that come to my mind now
The first is "litră" . Nowadays is used only by some old people
It is used to measure mass or volume
It is defined as being 250 ml/a quarter of a liter when measuring volume and 250 mg/a quarter of a kg when using to measure mass
"Arul" is the second one
It's used to measure surface when talking about farming/agricultural land by people in rural areas
It is equal to 100 square meters
There are others but these are the only ones still used, at least by people from where I grew up
Many people in Northern Dambovita still use Pogon/Prajina to measure their properties
I think the Pogon is only around 5000 square meters, but apart from that yeah that's about right
Since it was used for forests and large fields, exact precise numbers varied, as a few meters didn't bother anyone
The only exact measure I've seen for one is 5011
7 meters
My pet stone is 9 kilograms don't make fun of its weight you asshole
That's right
I took most info from [here] and the metric equivalent is pretty rough and varies from region to region apparently
And some famous guy in literature also used to think that a few meters of land didn't matter :P
The Colosseum, the Parthenon and the walls of Constantinople for sure
Maybe the Red Square
For natural wonders, Danube Delta and Mont Blanc
Versailles
El Escorial
Sagrada Família
Seville Cathedral
Mount Athos
Palace of the Parliament (Bucharest)
Ciorba (a type of soup)
When I was a kid I hated it and now is my go to meal
It's incredibly easy to make, it has a shitton of variaties, is very tasty, very filling and it can also became a comfort food
I've heard that a big problem with Irish is that the Latin alphabet really doesn't work well with it
Is there any alternative
Any bagel place
We don't have any as far as I know and I'm really curious about what a bagel tastes like
Not here
The most common word is still just "mail" or "e-mail".
Yahoo
Mail is still the most popular in Romania
We commonly use "mail", since mail is called "poștă" in Romanian, so when you say "mail" it defaults to email
Everybody I know uses the word gmail and not mail ok they use both but rarely mail
I think it's an European thing
I mean, in Romanian snail mail is poștă. So the word "mail" as it is in English didn't previously exist in our language
But it does now and it's the short from email
Because you know, it's such a terribly long word
You are the first person I hear that uses gmail for generic e-mai instead of those 2 I mentioned
Do you say I sent you a gmail on your yahoo mail address
Where does this happen
I mean in conversations i use gmail when its not about other mail sites
Hungary
Turkey
Russia
France
And Bulgaria or Greece
(this is if we don't count Moldova)
Turkey
Hungary
Austria
France
Russia
France did not really have that much of an impact on our history politically or even culturally until the end of the XIXth and the XXth century, but Romania has this crush on France and you'll certainly learn at least about the Revolution, Napoleon and his wars, WWI, WWII and everything after WWII
Most probably when learning about the Middle Ages France will pop up as well
The Ottoman Empire (Turkey)
Hungary
Russia
Austria
France
All the countries are looking at one another saying Germany
Ottoman Empire
Austro-Hungarian Empire
Moldova
Russia Empire
Germany, France
Turkey (Ottoman Empire)
Moldova (being part of a medieval Romanian state for so long, then coming back into the country after WW1)
Hungary
Russia
Poland
I'm shocked that we are not mentioned in your list
I'd say Russia (USSR)>Turkey(Ottomans)>Hungary(Austro-Hungary)
I'm from Transylvania and it is probably true that we talk more about Hungary in general
In my himetown for example Targu Mures (Marosvasarhelyi) mostly everything has mixed history and you learn all sorts of stuff day to day (at school is sort of a "standard package if you will)
From ehat I can remember we learn some facts about everyone at school ,but in highschool at least for me was like 60 40 hungary and turkey respectively(besides romanian history ofc)
I'd say we learn more about Turkey since we were their vassal states for most of our history
Maybe people in Transylvania talk more about Hungary/Austria since they were occupied by them for most of their history
No, I think these 3 countries are presented equally, depending on the historical period
It’s a regional thing
Where I live there are a lot of Hungarian people, and we talk a lot about Hungary, though in the east and south it’s different
Where I live we had schools with Hungarian classes in them, meaning for each year between 1-8 there were 2 or 3 romanian classes and one hungarian, each with about 28-30 students
Under those years the hungarian section had a bunch more extra lessons, like hungarian literature, hungarian grammar, hungarian history, besides the more general ones
So our class had both a hungarian history and a romanian one, and each of them kind of told different stories
Between years 8-12 I went to a completely hungarian school
There we only had one history class, and it glassed over history though a hungary scentric view imho
Just ban EA games, problem solved
No, because we wouldn't have access to any game developed by the Americans
Ban lootboxes from games made in the EU
Hell yeah
How do you guys envision Europe in 100 years from now
From different perspectives: culture, politics, economy, demographics
I think there will be steady progress
I don't think EU will fall apart and I think it is very very unlikely another war will start inside the union
As long as extremist political parties are not becoming more powerful
EU will probably try to have good relations with US and China and will prosper on its own
I only wish we had more respect and empathy for one another
Maybe East Europeans will not be seen as second-class citizens anymore
maybe
The Might Union of Greater Romania will be at power once again influencing politics in the Balkans and Eastern Europe
Although I see Romania becoming a more developed country in the future with declining birth rates
Moldova will cease to exist and so will many smol nations
Hopefully the EU will no longer exist by that time
Omg same I clicked so fast bc of that lol
At least it's not fungus
I too want to see this future
Hopefully, your prophecy is the real deal
Is there a good reason for not wanting a federal EU
Don't know, I find very little reason to travel right now
I can interact with people from most of the world in my city and also eat their food
Cultures are already very similar in most of the world where there is no major crisis happening right now
Seeing random decorated walls and buildings is not something that I would spend thousands of Euros on, so the only real reason to travel is to enjoy nature
A federalized EU would be able to protect the natural wonders that we have much better and would allow for a more optimized way to spend the money you say "is being thrown away".
I also don't agree with the fact that the money is thrown away (although, it could use an optimized process and less bureaucracy)
My country is a prime example, the growth we've seen during the last decade due to EU funding is unimaginable and has a lot of positive effects on the EU as a whole
We supply a lot of the human resources that other countries cannot, due to an aged population, so much so that it is becoming a problem internally
I don’t know if you got the reference
Do you have a source for that
Or at least some sort of arguments on how it does that
This sounds like fearmongering and doesn't really make much sense
I see what you mean, we used to have those unions too and I heard they were beneficial to some extent
I think we still do have them but few people know they even exist
Still, I think that's something you guys can easily adapt to, if lawmakers wanted to
Moreover, why would the Scandinavian model not work everywhere else
I would like to see an EU where that model is implemented at a large scale, as it is the best one we (humanity) have so far
A federalized EU would be able to impose it much quicker
EU wide minimum wage is a lower threshold which would prevent member countries from going below a certain amount
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I never saw anything about not being allowed to have a higher minimum wage
There is no logical reason for the EU to drag member countries (or any countries for that matter) down
On the other hand, a federalized EU would allow a somehow coherent fiscal law, which would help it develop much quicker from an economical point of view
This would most likely stop all the companies from moving their HQ to the US and will boost the innovation market enormously
Is there EU regulations or reasons that I am not aware of for making unionization mandatory
Or any other way to counteract the effects you were talking about
I am sure it works right now because of the higher degree of education among the citizens, but I doubt that any Scandinavian country could survive long term without adjusting the model and make it work regardless of that factor
We can't implement anything like that here yet because the worker unions have been smeared in the media almost into nonexistence because the miner union decided to attack the capital in the '90s when the government decided to close the state owned coal mines
People still have a bad reaction when they hear about them
Nordic countries have the opportunity to experiment and adjust the model and make it more future-proof rather than try to slow down progress for the sake of keeping the old one running
Maybe I'm to dumb to understand the reason behind your view, but am always open to ideas
I am really interested in the subject of a federal EU and I know I might be biased because my country would benefit from it a lot
One other thing I wanted to point out
If there was an EU wide minimum wage, people might not leave for other countries because they can't make a living (of course with the condition that the minimum wage allows for a decent life)
The only people who would be moving would be for higher paying jobs or studying
I would even vote to implement a UBI system sooner than we'll need it
Automation technology is evolving at a rapid pace and lots of workers simply won't be needed in the next 1-2 decades
I was not aware of that regulation, thanks for bringing it to my attention
2 things I want to address though
First one is that fiscal experimentation in our country could lead to actual death caused by poverty
Our politicians are still, in large percentages, very limited in terms of mental capacity
I wouldn't trust most of them to be able to read and understand a text longer than 1-2 pages, let alone make experiments
That, and we don't have anything to experiment on
Mentioning worker unions is political suicide and no Romanian politician would touch them (see Mineriada if you want to learn more about why that is)
Scandinavians are electing better politicians who would be able to successfully improve the model
The only way we could ever have strong unions, is if they are forced on us by the EU
Secondly, I don't think being ok with the status quo is something any country (or individual) should do
There is always room for improvement
Again, I am aware that I might be biased about it and not get the full picture
Still, hearing anti EU arguments which are also logical is a breath of fresh air
I think we had many through the years, many random people end up in a meme because of the stupid things they said
just to name a few that pop in my head right now:
-  "capitala angliei meme" (literally translated as "the capital of UK meme" this poor girl got asked this question during a prom contest and she said Russia )
- " ce'i fa asta meme" (literally "what is this meme" a random guy on an obscure Romanian tv show saying this to his wife, the true flavor of this meme cannot be explained)
- "Cristi meme" (it started with this drunk guy being "attacked" by a dog, he keeps calling for Cristi who is the owner of the dog
Also, our politicians do so many stupid things, most of them become a meme sooner or later
Vadim Tudor is a never ending meme, although this man has been dead for years
I got 4 Moomins key rings left after I went to the Moomin Museum
(I bought 12 of them, but the rest I gave to friends)
Moomins rock
\m/
How about the "nu apă" (no water) meme
I think we had many memorable memes, seriously we could make a long list of them, I just posted the first that came to mind
also: "lasă-ma sa îmi beau apa minerala" ( "let me drink my sparkling water" (a drunk guy trying to tell a reporter about the fire that started at the bar he was at)
idk why but we seem to find humor is the dumbest shit
And the Viorica Dăncilă memes are still alive
You forgot Codrin , the living meme :))
Ce facem alexandru
(What are we doing alexander)
Inoata chelutu( its a dog swimming and its pretty trash)
Also
Stefan de la craiova(Stephen from Craiova, its a ghetto singer that is and was pretty trash)
Sister country, Moldova
Otherwise
hard to say
Probably Serbia is also a good bro
Bulgaria might be as well a candidate since we joined the EU
Hungary is that sibling that we like to pretend it’s adopted and we have nothing in common with, but we are way more similar than we imagine
Moldova is our little sisters
She is not the smartest but she is cute, though her boyfriend is quite aggressive
Those drunken chaps across the Prut river, the Moldovans
Moldova,same flag,same language
It was historically part of Romania
Some would say Moldova
But that's just like Deadpool's arm surviving after being cut and growing into a separate Deadpool
I would say Bulgaria
Romanians and Bulgarians are basically the same, just speak different languages
Like brothers, we fight all the time, for the stupidest reasons, but we also do everything together
Definetly Moldova,they speak exactly the same bar a few borrowing from Russian and they have a simil culture to ours
And I would also include Italy
This is so wholesome to read I love it
What if Lichtenstein decides to invade Switzerland
Statistically, they are the strongest military in the World, having negative war casualties (80 people once went to war
81 returned)
Bulgaria is like a brother in suffering
We weren't born brothers, we didn't intend to become, but we traveled the same road together and we'll probably get wasted together
I remember hearing this somewhere: "Romanians fought every neighbour they ever had except Serbia and the Black Sea"
You can be ours, we buy cheap liquor from you so I don't see the problem
>weren't born brothers
The Second Bulgarian Empire was sometimes called "The Wallachian-Bulgarian Empire" and at one point even spread to the North of Moldova
We and Bulgarians go way back
Further than either one wants to admit
Well, France used to be our momma up until WW2 too
We are indeed a difficult to understand bunch of people
They also hold half of Bukovina, and they force Romanian kids to go to Ukrainian-only schools
I was thinking Russia because it was in URSS
That you know of
They're planning the invasion in secret
And after
I consider France as being one of Romania's best friends
Yea but
Cheap liquor, you know
Russia is more like her aggressive pimp
Romanians call it "The Romanian-Bulgarian Empire", which is wrong because the term "Romanian" is relatively recent
"Romanian-Bulgarian" was coined by Romanian nationalists to suggest that Vlachs had a bigger influence in the Empire than they probably had
Similarly, I assume Bulgarian nationalism pushes for the name "Second Bulgarian Empire" to suggest Vlachs were not involved at all
The truth is probably somewhere in the middle
From what I gather, Vlachs and Bulgarians coexisted for centuries
Even from the Bulgarian Wikipedia (which I assume is bias towards Bulgarian narrative, same as Romanian is) mentions that the revolt that lead to the creation of the second Bulgarian Empire had Vlachs (from North of the Danube) involved
The degree Vlachs had any influence in the empire is a subject for historians to decide, hopefully without nationalistic bias
For the first few years, it seems to have been referred to as "Wallachian-Bulgarian", most notably by the Pope
Also, Arab chronicles called it just "al-Awalak" (Wallachia)
So there were people other than Romanians that called it that
In modern times, I agree it should be called just "Bulgarian", since it was definitely mostly Bulgarian
Afterwards we had an abusive dad (Russia) :( now we are in foster care with the US
I don't know how to break it to you, but I don't think they see it in the same way
Neither do us to be honest
You can have cheap liquor without ethnic cleansing
Obviously I wouldn't expect all of France to now go crazy and get out with Romanian flags and celebrate Romanian values but there are definitely people in France who appreciate Romanian culture
There are some who don't and there are some who don't even know where Romania is
I think the same thing applies to Romania
After all, there are many historical facts that bonds these 2 together, so even if it might not be very present through people today, they are very good friends looking back at all the stuff that happened
The Little Entente, the CFRNA, France-Romania Season etc
But what about the Ukrainian kids in Romania
Do we have any Ukrainian schools
It is if you don't allow them to also learn in their own language
>foreign language
That's the problem
A family who settled in Cernăuți (Чернівці́) before 1775 would have had to speak Romanian, since they were in Moldova
Then, they were suddenly part of Austria
Fast-forward to 1918, and the region became part of Romania
In 1940, for no reason, Stalin occupied Northern Bukovina and makes it part of Ukraine
Without moving again, that family lived in 5 countries, having to learn 4 different languages just because "YoU shOUlD LeaRN the LAnGuaGE oF ThE counTrY whERe yOu LiVe
Considering there are still villages with Romanian majority, after 70 years, I seriously doubt ethnicity played any part in Stalin's decision
It may have been more like:
Stalin: "OK, we tricked Romanians into giving us this random region
How should we sell it
Stalin advisor: "There are a few more Ukrainians there
We can claim that's the reason"
Stalin: "Brilliant
Advisor: "But the border doesn't match exactly
Stalin: "Now you have to commit suicide
Do you need any help
That WikiPedia line references an article that has nothing to do with the 1930 census, and is instead talking about the 2001 Ukrainian census, with some references to events from the 1990s.
That being said, it could be true for all I know
The more important question is: If Stalin cared about ethnicity, why did he leave villages with Romanian majority North of the border, and Ukrainian majority to the South
Why not also take parts from Maramureș (Мармарощина), where there are even more Ukrainians
And I am telling you ethnicity played no part in that
Otherwise, the border would match the ethnic composition and would definitely not include the Herța region which was always part of Moldova and even now has 91
5% Romanian population (According to [Ukrainian Wikipedia] and 2
3% Moldavian
You're basing your argument on the actions of someone you call a madman
Spaniola nu o știu foarte bine dar ce pot sa zic e ca am înțeles în proporții de 70-75% din ce ai zis
Pentru mine, cea mai dificil de inteles limbă e catalana
Pare o combinație de franceză si spaniolă. Creierul meu nu pare a intelege ca e o limbă diferită. Spaniola am învățat-o de la telenovele, pare cea mai ușoară de învățat, deși  majoritatea zic ca românii înțeleg cel mai bine italiana
Hmmmmmmmm
Eu nu cred că o persoană care vorbește franceza/spaniola/italiana va putea să mă înțeleagă.
(I bend the phrase a little bit there, hopefully it's more understandable)
În primul rând, sunt mai idiot așa că probabil alții au înțeles mai mult ca mine, dar m-am prins de ideea generală. Aș zice undeva pe la 50-60%. Din franceză înțeleg mai mult de obicei
Interesant experiment totuși!
în română pot înțelege aproximativ 70% din italiană și spaniolă, fără să le fi studiat
franceza o pricep cam 20% pentru că avem cuvinte împrumutate de la francezi, dar portugheza nu o înțeleg aproape deloc
Vai de capul meu
Noi Românii suntem destul de diferiți de restul lumii vorbitoare de limbi Romantice (?) Influențele slavice si cele turce (?) au afectat foarte mult limba vorbita acum multe veacuri de catre Daco-Romani
În concluzie, nu cred ca voi care veți citi aceasta scrisoare (?) scrisa la 6 dimineața (Italieni, Spanioli, Portughezi, Francezi sau
Catalani
De cand este aia o limba
) veți intelege ce vreau sa zic :D
Am înțeles cam 60% din ce este scris
Româna are un procent mic de latină, acesta fiind 30,33% , mai are 12% latină savantă și multe cuvinte din franceză si italiană.
Bun,probabil că am îndeplinit primul obiectiv, dar la compunere nu știu ce să scriu
Fraternitatea dintre limbiile noastre e cel mai prominent arătată, cel puțin în română, prin folosirea de cuvinte uzuale cum ar fi casă . Româna este cel mai slav latin dintre toți.
Italiana este cea mai ușor de înțeles,după acea Spaniola,Catalana,Portugheza și pe ultimul loc Franceza
Como sé tanto rumano como español y catalán, tengo una gran ventaja en frente a los demás para entender los demás idiomas romance
Entiendo casi perfectamente el portugués y el italiano escrito, y bastante bien hablado
Ya que hay palabras que se me pareceran al rumano, o al catalán o al español
Y me resultará familiar de una manera o otra
El francés es más complicado para mi
Eu am înțeles tot ce ai scris, gen 99% (logrado e singurul cuvânt pentru care n-am traducere), în general 100%. A înțelege limba scrisă e mult mult mai ușor decât limba vorbită.
Stres
Palavre
Voce
Aici m-am pierdut
Eu am înțeles 100%
yeah mostly also because we have slav influence in our language
as we say, Romania and Moldova are a latin island in a slavic sea
Ce mi se pare amuzant e că am inteles aproape tot comentariul tău în spaniolă, în ciuda faptului că româna e greu de înțeles pentru alți vorbitori de limbi romanice
La fel și cu italiana, majoritatea italienilor nu ne prea înțeleg limba datorită influenței slavice, poate si datorita lungii separări de mii de ani de romanța vestică, însă pentru noi italiana este cea mai ușoară limba de înțeles
Înțelegi ce zic
I observed that despite romanian speakers can understand a lot of what's said in another language, the reverse isn't true
For example, I understood 90% of what you said
(I never studied spanish)
Yeah, pretty much :D
Tu ai propus un exercițiu foarte mișto
i speak romanian and i understood everything you said
How did I understand 90% of what you just said
But Hungarian its not Slavic
Aaaaaaah, makes sense now :P
hungary is a boat in the slavic island who wants to join the latin island but it's not allowed
An admirable attempt, but no
"You proposed a cool exercise" :P
Thats quite unexpected
Stealing the bride (taking the bride from the wedding and taking her wherever she wants) and asking for a reward from the groom (most of the time alcohol) to bring her back
Similar, is stealing the bride's shoe then asking for a reward ( most of the time alcohol)
Brides going out of their way to not see any other bride doing their wedding day as it is considered bad luck
Also, at every wedding I've been to people danced the conga line
Is the conga line what we call the penguin dance
the honking thing is also available for funerals from what i've seen
Yep same here
You basically pay for your food and some extra for the bride and groom
Wedding stationery always includes the envelope people are supposed to put the money in
It's not necessary to be before the wedding
Doing this in the middle of the party is funnier
Also, she doesn't need to be searched for
The husband/best man need to pay for the bribe (usually alcohol)
For some reason everyone also always dances to el meneaito
ALWAYS
That is a tradition
Add our emblem to it
I'd say it's a necessity since the flags of Chad and Romania are almost identical
It causes a lot of confusion so something has to be done
Probably some animal symbol on it, like bears or wolves
Or if we're going extreme, the Dacian snake with a wolf head in the colors of the current flag
Someone pls do it
Different emblem, altough the flag itself it's naturally similar since we're the same people
But then it's not really a kingdom is it
Romanian as well and I'm here to say it depends
My friend can't leave her parent's house because they make her pay rent and doesn't have the money to move out
Although, I personally think it comes from abusive relationships, it still happens in our country too, it's just that no one really talks about it
I was waiting for some Northern European countries contributing to this thread, my own impression was that kids there are expected to ‘move out’ or ‘be independent’ by the time they are legally considered adults
A friend that got a two year masters in Sweden was telling me about that, and I always wondered if it was true or not
Interesting, we have the exact same saying in Romania, passing them a glass of water
Sounds very ...sane
In my experience even normal parents have a hard time to resist the temptation to control their kids as they grow up, with the “as long as you’re living under my roof
“ argument, but on the other hand never actually doing something to empower the kid out of said roof :)
Living in Ireland I always thought that the president dogs are national pets
They are very cute and friendly and it's always nice to see how they interact with guests
Sadly one of them died a few weeks ago, and the news broke all the records on Ireland's official reddit page
Our president has 6 cats in his residence in Sibiu, he is a soft cat lover
Italian with a Russian accent seems to be the most popular
Like a Portuguese person speaking italian while drunk on wine
Somehow "romantic", even tho it sounds like butchered russian
Something in between Portuguese, Italian and Russian
And that it sounds interesting
For me, Greek sounds similar to Spanish in terms of accent and flow
The most difficult Latin language out of all of them
I saw people say that it looks like elvish when written lol
Came here to say exactly this
Asked all my foreign friends, I got the exact same description
Eu am auzit ca spaniola cu italiana
I tried to read that out loud and laughed my ass off
I've heard people say it's basically Italian with an russian accent
My german teacher is german
He speaks very nice
But that might be because he speaks slower and clearer to us than he normaly would(we just started b2)
When i went to germany and wanted to speak german people would go full speed until they realised they needed to go a bit slower and clearer so i could understand them
Omg, where is this from
And "omlette du fromage" of course
Intr un fel
I agree with the choking part
Thank you serbia for being our only neighbour country that didnt try to conquer/take something from us
Thanks to Germany for making the best cars
Thanks Austria
And also Hungary
As someone from Transylvania, although the past might have not been the best, because of the Austro-Hungarian rule, I'm thankful because we now have pretty good infrastructure and awesome looking cities
Oradea and Sibiu are great examples
Thank you France
Merci la france
For  [French military mission to Romania (1916-1918)]
In the name of all of the EU, thank you Sweden for Pewdiepie, Minecraft, great music, Paradox games, great scenery overall, IKEA, northern lights, clean cities, the Nobel prize, attractive women, not being at war for over 200 years, Spotify and finally your damn meatballs
Love from Romania
Thank you
uhh Italy for
uhh colonising Dacia in 106
Truthfully speaking Serbia and Bulgaria are our only frenemies
Everyone else bordering us is our outright enemy (bar from Moldova maybe)
From Berlin to Warsaw in one tank
Thank you for joining together the EU
As a linguist, thank you for maintaining your own language (Schwiizertüütsch)
For anyone studying Germanic philology, your language (and definitely not a dialect of Hoch Deutsch as some would like to assume) is always so interesting to hear and read about
I didnt knew about the arad forest tbh but in my city we have a monument for the 224 serbians,croatians and slovenians volunteers who  who died here in ww1
We call it "pyramid of serbian,croatians and slovenians heroes"
The best compliment you would hear from a balkan to a fellow balkan is somethimg like "thx for bot trying to kill me*
Dobrogea/Dobruja and around ww2 you guys get southern side, ofc no hard feelings but we are still salty that the best beaches are there
Well i live there and with all the respect i'm to lazy to learn bulgarian
In my opinion that's the best you can get in this part of the world
Not 100% friends but definitely not enemies either
Kinda like friends with benefits(?)
Yeah tbh even if we take a look at the history you know vlachs and bulgarians had a pretty well relationship during centuries so yeah why let the fact that we fought around 3 wars against each other in the last 100 years tu ruin such a good relationship right
I sometimes do, but that’s really because I don’t want anyone to bother me
People do lock doors but I personally never lock it,I literally don't own keys to my apartment for 6 years now,I have nothing you can steal

I'm in Germany now and all I hear is talk about a potential lock down
Another lock down will not effect my job, but it will keep me away from my family on Christmas
Which sucks, but you know
It is what it is
At the moment
Our explosion of covid cases and the upcoming parliamentary election in december
I could work from home
If the boss would let me
My contract here ends next month and I'm dependent on her for my PhD diploma as well, so I *really* can't afford to upset her
Germany, I think, it's planning a lock down, but not yet
>However, it seems the Dutch are completely retarded when they're young
I think this applies to young people everywhere
And it's infuriating
If I'm not wrong, Babeș-Bolya University or University of Bucharest
In Romania all the good universities from the big cities are the same, then you have the rest
Hardest to get into is definitely the medical university in Bucharest
Also because if you're not super great, like most students, the yearly fee is immense
But I don't know about prestigious
I don't really know a lot of people outside my bubble (art) so I haven't really heard from people who give a shit what uni you went to
Maybe law
The one in Bucharest
Just because it's hard and a lot of students are rich and got in on status
For England: Oxford/Cambridge > Imperial/LSE > UCL/Kings/Warwick/Exeter/Manchester, and then everything below these probably couldn’t be called prestigious
For Romania: UMF (Bucharest) > UPB (Bucharest) > UBB (Cluj) > ASE (Bucharest) > Unibuc (Bucharest)
For social studies I think the most prestigious is the Carlos III in Madrid
Kings, Warwick and Exeter are far better than Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, etc
I'd definitely say PUB
It was always on top of UniBuc in my circles
Plus the campus is awesome
I haven't really heard that many compliments for/about UniBuc
As for the University of Politechnics, however, I've heard many good things (since its also so diverse)
UniBuc has many crazy teachers/lecturers and they're known to have many useless mini courses on each profile
For me all the big important universities from Iasi,Timisoara,Cluj and Bucharest are the sme
I really do not think that there is a big difference between UniBuc and UVT or Medicine from Iasi and Medicine from Cluj
Not so well known but USAMVB it's just amazing imo
Campus is cool, dorm rooms not the best but not the worst, most importantly great proffesors and labs 'n stuff
Manchester and Durham are overrated
As someone who went to a fine arts high school as well as the fine arts university, like 70% of the teachers drink too much lol
The worst were always in sculpture and painting for some reason
Same with Poli though, lots of useless courses because they can't just fire the old farts with outdates courses
Poli sau UT cluj

Hi, if you
re from Hannover, do you know anything about the Leibniz Uni
Any info about the Elektrotechnik department would be great
Theoretically it
s part of the TU9, but it often gets overshadowed by the bigger guys in discussions about STEM unis I feel like
How does it compare to KIT or Aachen for example
Asking as a prospective student :P
That's awesome, ty for the detailed answer
Do engineers find work in the quantum mechanics department, or are there just mainly phycicists
I don't remember them having an engineering masters directly related to Quantum mechanics
Do you know any other universities that might have a good Elektrotechnik department
I'm interested mainly in smaller ones(not TUM and Aachen
maybe Ruhr Bochum
) but I'll take any information I'll get
Thank you again for replying, you've rekindled my insterest for Hannover and german universities in general
Not necessarily uninteresting, but I have yet to learn more about Bosnia
For me it's Belarus
Don't know why it sounds just like a downgraded version of Russia
And if I want to see a version of Russia, i would rather go the Mother Russia itself
Honestly, I consider Belgium to be a part of France, but I’ve never been there
Hei
Bratislava is cute af
I really liked passing through your country
I think most people will find that Romania and Poland, along with other countries in the area, are quite interesting and different from what Western people are used to
From natural landscapes to city experiences, it's something worth seeing
I've enjoyed London but that's as far as I've been
I'd want to revisit sometime, but I'm afraid visa restrictions would make me double think the effort
True
Moldova is basically an invention of Stalin's. Not that Moldova as a region didn't exist per se, but as a separate identity from Romania
It's a complicated situation nowadays
I agree
Best tea makers in Europe
I guess he means that it depends how much you're into it
If you come from the Netherlands or Hungary where there is nature, but somewhat more limited, seeing the nature in the Nordic countries would be cool and worth the big budget, but if you've already got amazing nature in your country or in cheaper nearby countries, visiting the Nordic countries on that big a budget would mean that you'd have to be pretty into it
Besides Finland maybe, for some it's just not worth the money trouble I guess
I'm just assuming that's what he/she meant
Quick unrelated question: are Norwegians into the whole sunny beach trying to get a tan experience
Like it's something often talked about when planning vacations
No, don't worry
I understood
Yes, I understand that
I said limited nature because the Nordics of course have all sorts of things that we do not have
They have a lot of cool mountains, icy beaches, you can see the northern lights, you can ride with reindeer in the wilderness etc
I didn't mean it as an insult
Sorry if it came out that way
I guess it is a very nice change of scenery for Norwegians
I mean I come from a country that doesn't have light winters, not usually anyway, and not in my opinion, and pretty hot summers, and we still flock to the sea side, whether ours or Greece's. Haha
You do have beaches of course, but it doesn't get as hot and touristy as Spanish, Italian, Greek beaches
I stand corrected
I stupidly thought it was in Lapland
Yes, you're right
Thank you
Just mentioning someone's mother's dead relatives is an insult in Romanian
How corrupt is your country
In Romania, we have many problems with corruption and this is the biggest problem of our society
What about you
Very corrupt but the future looks bright
As of late, corruption in Romania has been curbed, but there's still a lot of work to do
Nearly one year ago (May 27 2019), Liviu Dragnea, leader of the Social Democrats, the most corrupt party in Romania, that has ruined Romania for the last few years, was sent to prison
His absence left his party without any capable leader, so they lost the presidential elections and their government fell
With all this in mind, Romania is still a corrupt country and we mustn't let our guard down, because PSD can come back anytime
Anyway, the parliamentary elections in 2021 will decide Romania's path, so I'm looking forward to voting
According to the corruption perceptive index Romania is at 43/100 which is not great, but not as bad as I expected
Of course the OP is Romanian
I agree whit you since im from romania too
PSD are corrupt as fuck, regardless we have elections to put PNL and USR officials in power so future looks bright for now
Like our new transport minister has started using EU funds which means hes clean since they are harder to steal ofc
Overall pretty corrupt but its gettin better
On a scale from 1 to 10
Maybe a "wtf".
I wouldn't call it "the biggest" problem
Corruption is just a natural effect of something else: lack of education, lack of emphaty,  pettiness, arrogance, etc
Those are the "biggest problems". Until we, as a society, understand that politicians and authorities ARE our mirror, until we, as a society, will change the way we are and the way we educate our children - we will solve nothing
We can protest, we can write on Facebook, on Twitter, on Reddit and on the f*cking Moon if you want - but it will change nothing
We need to start educating people around us, even if it is hard and sometimes it seems nearly impossible
Very, but you already know it
This is like an underground corruption:))
How's that football stadium in Orban's village doing
At least our prime minister Orban is doing fine for now
Yes, in general, eastern Europe is more corrupt than western Europe
I admire Switzerland, I've learned French with the thought that I would visit this country
I've heard that you have problems with the integrity, Wallonia and Flanders aren't so united, so your situation is not easy from this point of view
Interesting you mention Romania
I can't deny what you said, the biggest problem is corruption, as I said in the description, which is the result of the society's thinking, we aren't able to understand that a possible public function must be a  reason of proud, in general, but, for us, is just an occasion to steal as much as we can
The biggest inconvenient is the incapacity to change our minds to follow the country's interest
For every corrupt political personage, there is a successor, and our hope is that we can defeat this succession
When we'll be able to understand that our country will be as we want, but we don't understand that we are the possibility to change
That's so annoying, why you don't protest
Romania won something after protests, except the attention of the media, maybe you'll be able to change something if you try to eliminate those parasites
Good luck, I'm waiting for better news from you, greetings from Romania
Let me guess, the first is Romania
:))
I totally agree, the situation is quite difficult in Serbia because the mafia is together with the politicians and the politicians are so glad to support them with a law or something, the same thing here in Romania, nothing new for me, just the scales are different, Romanian mafia is incomparable with the Serbian mafia, you would win in this category:))
It's pretty evident
I didn't know that the situation in Slovakia is even so difficult, I saw some comments from your compatriots and the situation is similar to our development, deforestation is a big problem too for us and the politicians are so annoying because they are fools and they don't even care if we know that they steal, it's all in our faces and we can't do anything, except to protest occasionally
It's enough:)))
That's pretty cool, I've heard that you are the happiest country in the world too
Probably , there is a link between these qualities
Yeah, these were my thoughts because we have a spiritual link with the French speaking region, especially with Lausanne, because our King had lived there, it's like a reason to be proud to recognize that I'm Romanian there
Yes i get that but im curious when you made your list why you chose romania specifically
Just askin btw
Normally, I'd have to be happy, but I feel a little sensation of discomfort because I should consider me lucky that the politic class from Romania isn't the worst
So I have  to support the anti-corruption until we  will be all of us non-corrupt
Thanks, it's one of my biggest frustrations, so I have to find my words to damask this incompetence, our generation must be the solution, I'm so hopeful and I really think that the teenagers have the possibility to deny the system where they have grown
Our situation is promising, the government had fallen and the new government is composed and conducted by the liberals, it's like an air mouth for us, but we have elections in November and this time I'm voting age:)))
[Numa numa yey
On a serious note, I think it might be [Ciocârlia
[Rapsodia Română] is also a good contender I would say
> Also i have to mention this too: Nightwish - The Greatest Show on Earth
I'm still butthurt about what happened with Tarjia to this day
Some of my favorite classical songs too
Oh don't get me wrong, Floor is a fantastic singer, but I grew up with Tarja, that version of Nightwish is what forever remains burned in my brain
The ridiculously thick accent, the awkward moves, the scene presence, the voice - I love all of it
Actually with songs that were originally sung by Tarja and now are also performed by Floor, in the new versions she can properly enunciate the words and the song is actually intelligible, but I think that it loses part of that charm for me
I love it when singers have an obvious, thick accent, kinda sucks a bit that so many singers are gravitating towards that generic Americanized accent
I've lived in Bucharest for the past 7 years, moved there from Constanța (quite a large city on the Black Sea coast)
I absolutely love Bucharest: it's noisy, overcrowded, very hot in the summer and not the cleanest
However, the underground network is amazing, the parks are awesome, there are a lot of leisure options (theatres, cinemas, malls, concerts) and the salaries are probably the highest in the country, what with it being the capital
Then again, the real estate market is quite expensive too
Nevertheless, I wouldn't move anywhere else in the country
Living in Bucharest
I grew up in a small city, where everyone knew everyone and you basically knew every single building to ever exist
Moving to Bucharest was
overwhelming I'd say
It's noisy, extremely crowded, and good luck finding a parking spot or driving more than 7 km in 30 minutes
I soon learned people kind of find their way around the crowded areas( I remember I was really surprised seeing people ride bikes, in most of the cities in Romania that's like being sentenced to death penalty on your way to work)
Also I noticed not many people know everything about every single sector, most of them just know their sector
The metro soon proved to be extremely useful, basically saves you so much time and connects the entire city (almost)
Someone pointed out the pollution and I have to agree, it is pretty polluted but it's also a lot cleaner when it comes to littering in comparison with other cities
When you get away from the super crowded area, Bucharest can actually be extremely beautiful
I always thought there was a nice combination between old and new
Bucharest feels like a 2 million inhabitants village
Idk, it's a decent place overall, slowly becoming more modern, hopefully we keep on this path
but the hellish traffic and all those winter nights when we had no heating or any running water, were absolutely no fun, I really wished I could move anywhere else, but job opportunities keep us in Bucharest
I think it's interesting to see how wildly different a city can feel for different people
I've lived here my whole life and I kind of hate it
Pretty much biding my time until a good enough opportunity arises and I'm out of here
Born and raised in Bucharest, I can attest I’ve never found a small city appealing, they lack the urban noise, the rhythm, the traffic
Smaller cities seem to die off in the evening, I can’t shake the feeling everyone’s away on vacation
Couldn’t get used to the quiet
Kind of like March and April when life almost came to a standstill
Even when traveling abroad in larger cities I feel at home, especially because of the crowds, the flow, traffic, familiar noises
That’s the upside of being late to the game, we weren’t early adopters so the technology had time to mature and competition amongst ISP’s drove the standards up
That’s perhaps one of the few aspects where the consumer actually benefits
I shudder reading horror stories from other countries (like the US) when it comes to internet
yeah same, bucharest born and raised and although i love it and love to explore it, it just doesn’t feel like such a big deal
i have friends that live in other cities and they keep saying that bucharest is such a jungle, where
it’s so quiet and boring sometimes, i even feel like i see the same strangers
nothing is unexpected or intriguing
i can’t wait to live in a bigger city to actually feel the city life
Germans are suspiciously quiet about this in the subreddits I'm lurking in :)) then again, as I'm not a German speaker, perhaps I'm missing out on some
How is your infrastructure generally speaking
I had a good laugh at this list :))
Here’s my thoughts:
You should know that many people aspire to reach your level
At least you have roads, we have so few and crowded that every roadwork feels like a heart attack, it completely blocks everything
We know bureaucrats as well, it’s how many employed in the administration justify their paycheck
However, our prognosis is usually “it’s either going to take a long time or we won’t be able to solve it”. Unless we ‘grease the wheels’. So you’re stuck with delays, but things happen in the end, we’re stuck with a system that protects itself and looks designed to help corruption flourish
Sadly, we’re similar here
Trains are late, the infrastructure is crap, as a result of years of defective policies meant to benefit some in the detriment of many
The internet is great, and cheap, but in some form or the other we do suffer from monopoly too
Probably the prices are adjusted a bit to our income level as well
On the other hand, none of the ‘good and cheap’ subscriptions available for households come with a lower limit
Everything is ‘up to’ but the minimum guaranteed speed is awful
People just don’t notice that, it’s pure chance
If you want your own dedicated IP and need a guaranteed bandwidth though, we’re talking totally different prices
In excess of 100EUR for a minimum guaranteed 100mbps symmetrical connection
What's the largest infrastructure project you wish the EU would build ?
Trains
I mean, an interconnected railway system across the EU
That would be fun
Blue trains with stars on them
That would be pretty
I like trains but I would build it for the cargo infrastructure more than for passengers, imagine delivering anything via electric trucks only on the "last mile" and everything else just via train containers
That actually sounds really cool
Don't worry, Romania has been trying to cross the Carpathian mountains with a wide road for almost 100 years now
Progress -10%. You won't be last when you finish it
That would be something, would you settle for a tunnel tho ?
Considering that Sicilly doesn't even have road to Italy, and how much closer those two are ....id say well have to way for the swedish-finnish one for a while
Are you unhappy with the way EU money are spent
If yes, it's because they're danish money spent outside Denmark or because you think EU founded projects are inefficient or corrupt
My notification only showed "finally putting enough funding into crack" ....
Screw that minimalistic crap
I want[ Orient-Express styled] high-speed trains
Let's ride in style
Imagine going from Cluj to Bucharest in 2 hours
Lads, as a german and a dane, would that tunnel actually improve trafic over there
I always wondered if being so close tot he other route would affect it's results
Let's suppose the tunnel is a good thing, that brings more prosperity
Then the tunnel is good for the whole EU as a part of that prosperity will increase some EU taxes and EU trade
Actually that would be awesome
I want trains with flags on them
I think aerodynamics might be against you there
Imagine going from Bucharest to Valea Prahovei in 2 hours
For us it must be Zalau county
It's a small county in Northern Transylvania, basically it's just forest and one town, I've never met anyone from there and never seen a car with their plates from there
Well, Vaslui doesn't exist because more than most Romanians ignore it's existence because they feel ashamed of it
In my country is a maximum security jail listed on map but i never found it and i think it doesnt even exist
> For us it must be Zalau county
Zalău is the town
Sălaj is the county
This is just proof of how meaningless it is
I’ve been here once during a work trip
The “city” is very small but at least we afforded a nice 4 star hotel since the prices were very small
r/Salajnuexista There is even a sub to confirm
Zalau, zalau, toata lumea-i din [Zalau]
No more Vaslui, the world has progresed past the need for Vaslui
No, because you simply deny the existence of your fellow Hungarians in Romania, then
Damn, true, I messed it up
With only like, 60 people
I was wrong apparently, the county is called Salaj in Romanian, the main city is Zalau
That's how unknown it is to us, we don't even know which one is the county and which one is the city
Well cousin, here comes Ferdinand the first
Why's he here
Nobody knows
Zălăuanii
Jur că e prima dată când aud cuvântul ăsta
Nu m-am gândit la cum li s-o spune
I'd say probably Transylvania, but then again I've never been to Salaj so I don't know which region they're closer to culturally
This "Bielefeld" is a death void where they send all the students who dare question the facts
The Hungarians can take Vaslui at this point and nobody would notice
Suna la fel de ireal ca si judetul Zalau
I say we give it to the Bulgarians instead just for the meme
It would really fuck up their economy
*laughs in Romanian*
Carol, Ferdinand and Mihai
Last one is still in use but you would never see anyone named Carol or Ferdinand
Decebal, Burebista, Traian, Mihai, Vlad, Stefan, Carol
Limited choices for Romanians
And Elisabeta, Maria, Elena and Ana for girls
If you were to add the name of the voivodes (who are called princes in English, but practically speaking they were basically kings) we could also add Ştefan, Vlad, Mircea, Alexandru, Petru, Rareş, Vasile, Radu and a couple of others
All of these are very common male names in Romania
Ferdinand would be so original tbh
If we count voievods, we get many more options
If we count empires that ruled us over the years, we gain access to Bulgarian, Turkish, Russian, Hungarian, and German names
I had a friend named Carol in grade 1-5 before i changed schools, but i swear i never heard anyone named Carol after that
Ferdinand never heard, Mihais are plenty
Yes it is
Carol I's German birth name was Karl
Carol is just the Romanian translation
Just like Maria is sometimes translated to Mary in English
Those are **so much** more common than the male ones
I think it's still used but most guys named Ferdinand are probably Roma
It was until the last monarch broke away from the branch, now it’s called “of Romania”
or Carl
Dora was translated as "Dora discovers the world" (*Dora descopera lumea*) instead of "Dora the explorer" (*Dora exploratoarea*)
I think we are a bit the odd ones out, but Dora teaches Spanish in here if I recall correctly
Also in dubbing because Romania dubs kid shows and some sitcoms the word dollars is often replaced with our currency, but that's mostly in newer dubs
How do we say mashed potatoes
Some people say "piure" which reminds me of french "purée" but then you have people who say "pireu" which sounds really ugly to me :))
Smântâna is delicious and deserves to be anywhere
All shoes are papuci, fight me
People argue about that
Indoor s.--> papuci
Summer s.--> şlapi
Its Feminine in Romanian too
No need, you're right
There is also Guguștiuc, which isnt really about translation as much as its literally named by the sound it makes (guuu-guuu-știuc)
And the Leneș, the sloth, which translated to "the lazy".
Micul Alexander, which is the ring necked parakeet, translates to "The Small Alexander".
Vaca Domnului - Authentic Moldova
Let's not forget "Pisica de mare" (Sea cat) which means stingray
I'm still confused, to this day, in what way did the people who named it think it's similar to a cat
Also Câine de mare, sea dog, which is a small type of shark, nursing shark i think
Yeah but at least [it kinda looks like a dog]
~~Romania~~Moldova: O-Zone - Dragostea din Tei
No YouTube link needed
The following is enough to already have it in your head:
Maya hiii Maya hoo Maya haaah Maya haaah haah…
Edit: fix country after drinking coffee
Thank you u/vingt-et-un-juillet for poinitng it out
"Connect-R Eu vara nu dorm" in 2012 for sure
every beach there was this song playing
also at u/vingt-et-un-juillet
I never understand why people always say the band is Moldavian
The band released their first album in this trio formation only *after* moving to Bucharest, and then they stayed in Romania for the rest of their career as a group
[Wiki]
"In 2002, O-Zone moved from Moldova to Bucharest, Romania, hoping to gain more recognition
There, the group became an instant hit band with their upbeat song "Despre Tine" ("About You"), which held the top position on the Romanian Top 100 chart for three weeks in February 2003
I think it's fair to say the members are Moldavian, but the band is Romanian
You are 100% right
Thank you
Now I have drunk my coffee
I thought  *I should mention the country as it's not mine*, then wrote mine
And everyone forgets about Stereo Love too lol
I really can't understand that reasoning, for the arguments I gave above, but whatever
Just as I don't understand how the news always refers to Sebastian Stan as "the biggest Romanian actor in Hollywood", as he only spent the first 8 years of his life here, can barely speak the language now and has been living and has built his entire career in the US
He's a *Romanian-born* American actor
The same IMO goes for O-Zone
[Our highways are falling apart]
The highways are terrible
The government pays a few times the cost for a km and there is no quality
Another badly executed project is the extension of the metro system
A new rail line should have been finished in 2011
As of 2020 it is still worked on
We can barely build any type of highway
But Moldova has it even worse
The ownet of Spartan, a fast food restaurant joint, constructed a meter of highway on his land, then made a huge event where he would releasr to the public "The first meter of highway of this country" or something similar
The subway in the capital, specifically the Militari branch
It has become an inside joke by now
Well here in Romania we have the Gouvernment
They did double the work just to compromise it
Madness
I like my mountains
In Romania, ID cards are mandatory
The fine for not making one once you're 14 or not renewing it when expiring is huge
They were 2 weeks ago
Now most can't be budged or care
Still great days for supermarkets
Now no
Everyone already freaked out two weeks ago
Now it's pretty normal
Yea a few weeks ago everyone was buying canned food and toilet paper to last for at least 2 months
Now it seems that the people have calmed down
Tons of flower, oil and sugar
(Romania)
That's underestimating it
What could one person do with all that meat, tho
Where do you even store it
Do these people think Poland is gonna close its borders and bam
no more meat in the country
Same shit is happening over here and I get equally confused about it
stonks
Zombies can slip on wet toilet paper
You can distract them by throwing the tube
You will need entertainment when the internet breaks down
Those are my guesses
Our word is short, it's simple, but it has an immense meaning: **Dor**.
You can't translate it
Not exactly
It's a word found in our most beautiful writings, from stories to poems
But what is it
Well, it's longing, but it's so much deeper than that
You say it when you miss someone or some place (such as your home) in a way that leaves your heart aching and your soul empty and yet at the same time, there is a subtle, sweet happiness in there
*Dor* is what a soldier will feel when thinking of home, of his family, of his wife, parents and children
It's what they will feel when thinking about him
*Dor* is what you feel when you think of your parents and grandparents, who may have been gone for a year, two, or fifty
*Dor* is what you feel when you finally managed to cook that dish just like your mother used to make and all you can think of is her
*Dor* is that little ache in your heart when you live in a different country and from time to time, with a sad, melancholic smile, you think of
*home*.
*Dor* is short, it's simple, but for us, it's one of the deepest feelings in our hearts
I like Dor, in Romanian
You see it has 2 or more meanings
The meaning that can be translated is from Latin popular “dolus/dolere” which means pain and the word can be used as “ ma dor bratele” = my arms hurt
Now, to the other meaning, which I love is .. well ... untranslatable :) . But it means missing someone badly, lust, the need to see someone you love
( imi este dor de tine = I miss you a lot)
Spoken by a romanian the word is very very powerfull and sends a lot of emotions
So, a short but powerfull word
Cheers ps: I also like “ie” which is a traditional shirt
Тоска (pronounced 'toska')
The word doesn't have a direct translation in English, but the best definition I could find was the one by writer Vladimir Nabokov:
"No single word in English renders all the shades of toska
At its deepest and most painful, it is a sensation of great spiritual anguish, often without any specific cause
At less morbid levels it is a dull ache of the soul, a longing with nothing to long for, a sick pining, a vague restlessness, mental throes, yearning
In particular cases, it may be the desire for somebody of something specific, nostalgia, love-sickness
At the lowest level, it grades into ennui, boredom
"Dor" in Romanian
I've heard that a few times here in Romania
What does it mean
I have never ever heard of toska in Romanian
There had to be a bulgarian somewhere in this thread to say that Cyrillic isn't Russian
It's not a Romanian word, but I like it a lot
How did something as random as "pig god" even come into being
"Vasile" and "Marcel". They sound terrible
Vasile
I mean it used to be an extremely common name and it still kinda is to some extent, but it's the most peasant sounding name I've ever heard
If your name is Vasile, you got at least 2 pigs, 1 cow and 10 chickens, a big bear belly, and very poor dental hygine but you still like to smile a lot, especially while drinking rachiu or tuica
Cornel, Ion, Olga, Carmen, Vasile, Vasilica, Viorica
Gheorghe
Thanks God I am also named Dan
what about Eugen or Septimius
The pen (Petrache Poenaru)
Insuline injection (Nicolae Paulescu)
The Coandă effect (is the tendency of a fluid jet to stay attached to a convex surface
It is named after Romanian inventor Henri Coandă, who described it as "the tendency of a jet of fluid emerging from an orifice to follow an adjacent flat or curved surface and to entrain fluid from the surroundings so that a region of lower pressure develops
") (Possible first jet engine designer) (Henri Coandă)
Gerovital (Ana Aslan)
The reaction engine, the jetpack, amphetamine, the fountain pen and many more
The first jet engine - Henri Coanda,
Ejection seat - Anastase Dragomir,
Insulin - Nicolae Paulescu are the first that spring to mind
Uhh
Fountain pen, the first reaction engine, ejection seat uhh
early VTOL thingies
And a bunch lot more I guess we are pretty Inventive
The Ball Pen, some say we invented the airplane
Also, we had the first city to use street lamps
Its romanian sorry
Also [Aurel Persu]  the first to place the wheels inside the body of the car as part of his attempt to reach the perfect aerodynamic shape for automobiles
>a controversial claim disputed by some and supported by others
>Some acknowledge Coandă as the discoverer of the Coandă effect but give Hans von Ohain the honour of designing the first jet engine to power an aircraft in manned flight
I'll change it to Coandă effect , but in parantheses I'll keep "possible the first jet engine designer" and add the definition of thw Coandă effect
Arguably the jet engine was invented by a Romanian inventor, Henri Coanda
It's wasn't a jet engine as we know them today, but it was propelled via a jet of air and it didn't have a propeller
This was showcased in 1910
Yes it is search nicolae paulescu
Here you can find a section of the engine
Yea this is what i meant to say
I am stupid sorry
Have a nice day
The structure of the education systems
By this I mean the amount of years/credits required for certain diplomas, the standards of quality and the requirements to obtain certain diplomas
(edit: I'm mostly referring to higher education, nothing between kindergarten and high school)
Ex: in civilized Europe you don't really need to publish a scientific paper to get your PhD in natural sciences
In eastern Europe you need to publish 3-4 depending on the faculty you do your PhD in
This, of course, results in all doctoral candidates publishing very quickly shitty paper in shitty journals
They could instead build their work over some years with others in their lab and publish higher quality work
Edit: my example is just to show how different the requirements can be
My point is that because the requirements are so different it can become difficult to get similar positions
I mean, as EU citizens we are free to travel and work anywhere in the EU, but my 5 years of pharmacy training are not the same as the 5 years of pharmacy training someone in the west did
So how am I free to travel and work if my diplomas are meaningless outside of my country
Well, my problem with this disjointed higher education we have in Europe is that you are allowed to move around the EU, you're allowed to get a contract or a PhD in other EU member states, but they can't actually hire you because they don't understand your diploma
The PhD thing was just an example of what differences there are
The difference between west and east is that in the east *it is a legal requirement*. And you can say whatever you want about the environment in your institution, but as long as it's not a legal obligation, you can find a way around the expectations of your prof
Good luck with your work, guy
You're focusing too much on the example I gave
I'm mostly thinking about getting a job or getting into a higher education program
In Ro for pharmacy I did 5 years, uninterrupted, with a total of 600 credits (iirc)
I came to Germany to do my PhD and they were fucking confused about the no of years and the facts that my diploma is called "bachelor/masters", although I have the exact same no of credits as pharmacy masters in Germany
The credit system is similar in all of the EU, I think
But it's not really taken into account tho
And to finish the diploma it would be nice to have at least similar if not the same requirements, just so the diplomas can be equated somehow
Not WW2 "collaborators", but we have a word "securist" for people who collaborated with the Communist Secret Police (Officially "Departamentul Securității Statului" - "Department of State Security", Unofficially called "Securitatea" - "The Security")
It is sometimes used as an insult even to people who didn't collaborate
I mean we don't really have smth like that cuz we were fascist ... we usually use "nazist"(nazi)
You can also say "legionar" not really sure what is the translation which was the name of the fascist people in Romania
If I call you a communist, you have my guarantee that it’s an insult
The most well known video games developed in Romania are probably Assassin Creed Rogue and Watch Dogs 2
Oh, and also most of the Fifa games
Gta and counter strike games are hella popular for the "older generation".
Now I think it would be minecraft and league of legends
Well all FIFA games since 17 were developed here according to Wikipedia, and I'd say those are pretty popular
Developed in Romania:
- Asphalt 5
- FIFA 2017 - 2021
- Assassin's Creed Rogue/ Altair's Chronicles
- Chessmaster
- Ferrari GT Evolution
- Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon:Future Soldier
- Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix
- Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X 1 and 2
- Men in Black - Alien Crisis
- Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell
- Ghost Recon Wildlands
- Ghost Recon Breakpoint
- Watch Dogs 2
You guys made Space Engineers
Man, I loved that game
Control is my favourite game of the last 5 years <3
It is but has a big working branch in Romania too
EA has a large development studio in Bucharest, which, starting with FIFA 15 or 16 has worked on the FIFA series quite a lot
I actually have a friend who is a lead developer at EA and is mainly assign to work on FIFA every year
Same with Watch Dogs 2, Ubisoft is a French company, but has a well established development studio in Romania, studio that has worked on the Tom Clancy series and others
But yeah, the question from OP is a bit tricky
The games have been developed in Romania, but not by Romanian companies
For some 100% romanian games I will go for PC building simulator and action squad, decent games, also a small mobile developer has made a game called "The walls" it's a little unfinished and quite easy to win but it's good and another one called just tap or something, haven't tried that one but it looks promising
I like it a lot
Some of my friends have seen it
I am planning to binge watch it all once i have a week off :) cheers from Ro
My friends been bugging me to watch it for a while but I didn't find the time to yet ..I heard good things
I've watched the first season before all the hype started
I honestly find it a great show, the casting absolutely genial and the story is just incredible
I would like to thank Serbia for being the only country we’ve never had a war with
Id like to Thank the EU for helping us as a relatively new democracy
But also all our neighbours Hungary, Serbia,Bulgaria for being good neighbours with amazing food
I want to thank Serbia for not trying to invade us
This is so wholesome
However, I don't think that someone has anything to thank my country for
But I would like to thank Serbia for my Herman's tortoise
We have them in my country but it's illegal to own local fauna, so a foreign turtle is just fine
I love her lots
I'd like to thank Bulgaria for their tourism, they're definetly more smarter than us
And for their rose everything
I've been this summer there and bought a lot of rose scented stuff
I'd like to thank Ukraine (I live next to the border) for their cheap cigarettes, alcohol, sweets and everything else
I'd like to thank Hungary for
umn
well
sigh
their kurtos kolacs I guess
And for making us more united
I'd like to thank Serbia for never invading us and having our backs
I'd like to thanks Moldavia for their wine, cheap tobacco for rolling and their Bucuria sweets
I would thank hungary a bit because they brought kurtos kalaks to romania
Tbh,most of theneighbours of my coumtry were some assholes to us for most of our history
So I really can't say "thank you"  to any of them
Of there is a caountry that actually helped us ,im sorry if i forgot it
Its almost 12 o'clock
I don't know if it has a translation in English, but a local soft drink in Ronania is something called "must" which is basically a grape juice before turning into wine
Probably Adria Cola
It's a very popular bootleg Coca-Cola
I honestly don't know if we even have any, if another romanian could tell me i'd love to know
I used to think nestea, lipton ice tea, fanta, and fuzetea were only in romania, then i found out i was a dumbass
Frutti Fresh still exists and has a less sugary taste that most drinks
Note-it is one of the cheaper drinks,as in a 2
5l bottle costs 5 lei(just above an euro)
I haven't seen anyone drink Adria in a long time, not even old people who used to buy it since it was cheaper than regular cola/fanta, all I see now are people laughing about how bad it tasted lol
I don't think talking about Ceauşescu is taboo at all here
Chances are that if you watch some news channel you'll find some politicians comparing other politicians with Ceauşescu or his men, if you go to a park you'll hear some old people getting nostalgic for that period
You can freely talk about him or that period without getting any weird looks, now if you openly support his ideals that's another story
Love him or hate him, Ceauşescu was a big part of our modern history and we just accept it
Wish some people would get over the mindset of that period but I like to think we're getting there
Its not tabu at all, we just hate them
The only "nostalgics" are the ones who profited from the regimes
It's what youngsters call stupid old people
You're a commie
Also old people LOVE to talk about the "old times" back before '89 during Ceaușescu ruling and how perfect everything was and because they were some brainwashed little mouses they still believe it to this day
Or as an adjective: My dad is such a communist sometimes, he won't let me go outside
A lot of old people think Ceausescu was better than what's now and people talk about him quite often
It's pretty common to talk about it and compare the upsides and downsides
Most people that now look back fondly to that period either had family working for the state or were lucky to never have pissed off the state
On point
5% of games have Romanian language option so I prefer english becuz I can understand everything
There are few games in Romanian and the translation isn't good, so I prefer games in English
Well, Romanian is always the first choice of a studio to translate games into, so it’s always an easy choice
And the translations are always absolutely flawless, too, of course
Pretty much English,not only games translation but also everything else that is possible because jokes or other things usually get lost in translation
English
Very rarely I see something translated in Romanian and if it is, it usually is poorly
Game list (no order in particular):
Monster Hunter World
Planet Zoo
Jurassic World: Evolution
GTA V
Plague Inc
Minecraft (modded)
Saurian
Platypus
Nova Drift
Primal Carnage: Extinction
And others I play more rarely
Whenever a game has translations, there are some generic things
English is Better in video games
I prefer in English because most of the time it doesnt have Romanian transalation and when it has, its just so weird
The reksio games were also translated into daco-romanian
Wait what
It was a series of games that I used to play in my childhood which stared the polish cartoon character Reksio
The games were dubbed and everything,not just subtitled like most games nowadays
That's cool
Many people born in cities do look down on the ones who live in the countryside and the term “țăran” (person who lives in the countryside) is used mostly as an insult
As many stated before, countryside people are mostly seen as backwards and uneducated who have been politically indoctrinated by a political party, PSD, in Romania’s case, via unemployment benefits and false promises like bringing their kids back home
On top of that, one more negative sterotype aside from being poor and stupid is that many are alcoholics and wife beaters (wich sadly is backed up by many news stories)
The ones who move to the city for work or go to study there are also not very well liked by the city folk, either, especially if they’re from Moldavia, Romania’s poorest region, and are moving outside of said region
Well, Romania has a lot of vilages where the standards of life are amazingly low
But it also has some quite deprived cities
Being able to live in a city or close to one is sometimes just a step or two above the poverty in God forgotten rural settlements
So, basically, divide, yes, there is
Are rural people seing city people as stuck up
Idk, but from what I know most rural poor families would like it for their kids to find a better life in the city
Are city people considering rural people dumb
Yes and no
It is actually a great problem in our country
People in rural areas tend to be dumb because there are lots of villages where there aren't schools, or the local school is on the verge of crumbling, or it lacks basic things like a toilet or a heater
Basically, the actual economic clases you can find in Romania are: <1% really really rich people, middle class people, poor people, extremely poor people, people so poor that they somehow live only on the approx 20 euro per month they get for being poor, and people with literally no money that die by famine if crops don't grow or if their cow dies
More than half the population lives in a combination between post war times and the middle ages
Same thing here
People on the country side actually like the city
So they go to spain, italy or germany
I agree and I’d like to add that countryside people don’t like city people either, a lot of them think of us as some capitalistic sinful idiots or something like that
Adding on to this, in Bucharest we call people not from Bucharest as “provinciali”, and while not a **super** derogatory term, it’s mostly used to portray people from the rest of the country in a poor spotlight
How did disco polo become a political issue out of everything possible
Please enlighten me, it actually sounds interesting
I wanted to mention that as well, but I didn’t want my comment to become a text wall, but you’re right
Same here, many older villagers see cities as a sort of place that morally corupts young people, especially girls (fata de la țară devine fată de oraș)
We barely even get snow in my city
This Christmas it was 13° C outside (although it's quite a bit colder now at 5° C)
Ammonium nitrate, 20 tons, a truck rolled over and an hour later exploded killing 18 and injuring 13
2004
As per number of victims, probably Flight 371 crash that killed 60 in 1995
An Airbus 310 flying to Brussels
[Ukrainians reading this thread]
So there's this one depot in Targu Mures that has 5 times as much nitrate as the Beirut one
And it's 2020
We really should stop the actions of some guys in the past rule our present and future, cheers mate !
Aren't the top telenovelas Mexican though
Or I guess we can thank Spain for Mexico
>I wish that there were milk bars
Have you heard of
cheese
Me, most of the things I eat contains milk
I sometimes am lazy and hungry and I drink a whole 1L carton straight from the fridge
Extremely refreshing and deals with my hunger
I love milk, 2l a day min
I dont like milk but I am chugging water like crazy
I drink at leas 6 litres every day and when it is summer I can easily drink 10 litres so
I like milk and eat  all milk products except milk chocolate , not a fan .
Yuck water
, fish fuck in it you know
Nah leave it its funny:)
I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt
I think in Romanian, we use "Honolulu" when you want to say someone is far away or in the middle of nowhere
The alternative is "Patagonia" but that is less used I feel
In Romania we say "la dracu in praznic" that means "at the devil's charity". Not really a charity more like a dinner table you do for dead ones to romember them, commemorate table or feast in his name
It's with the devil in the corn field
(la dracu-n păpușoi)
Romanian - Plopeni, Machu Pichu, Marte (Mars), la dracu in praznic (where the devil gives you free food- but in a ceremonial way after somebody dies)
My favorite middle of nowhere expression is
La pulahara - it means something like at dicks end ( pula is dick and hara sounds like sahara)
Or another vulgar one that I like is: la dracu în praznic ( at the devil's wake )
In a formal setting you can use: în Patagonia ( in that region in Argentina )
Edit: another good one is în cur cu satelitul ( in an ass on/by a satellite
Or in fairy tales we use the expression: peste 7 mari și 7 țări ( over 7 seas and 7 countries
I've seem Romanians use Honolulu for this porpose or more commonly  the expresion "la dracu in praznic" where dracu is roughly translated as "the devil" and "praznic" is a religious thing, a sort of gathering of people that feast in the honor of a saint and it takes place on the day that saint died
Since the devil is both immortal and unholy it's imposible for his "praznic" to exist
It's kinda oxymoronic
So we have
La- "at"
Dracu- "Devil"
In- "in"
Praznic- "feast"(if we shorten the explanation)
So we get " At the devil's feast" which sounds pretty cool in english
Romanian:
"At the devil's praznic" (basically a meal you give to people after a funeral)
"Near devil's mother"
There are other versions,but these two are usually used
I heard Honolulu many times when referring to some God forgotten place here
> "in der Wallachei"
As someone living in Wallachia, I find that mildly interesting
I'm wondering about the origin of the phrase
Never heard Honolulu used but Patagonia defiantely
And „Palestina”, more widely used by old people
As a guy originally from Wallachia I am happy someone heard of us
Lol, when i was thinking of where the middle of nowhere would be in Romania, a random poor village in the romanian plains ( former Wallachia) came to mind
I think it's because apart from some urban centers the region is hands down depressing
I was also thinking about "la mama naibii" which means "at the devil's mother"
But also "Cucuieții din deal" and "La cuca măcăii" which, as far as I know, cannot be translated
I've also heard people use "Honolulu" or "în pulă cu satelitu" basically meaning "in the dick with a satellite"
Thay's weird because I never heard Patagonia used, but always heard Honolulu
Maybe more of a recent regionalism, but the most common among young people is "în pizdeea".
First time I see someone from the netherlands asking me not to be defiant
I did know that, yes
Pulahara : dick + Sahara
>I have an auto-immune disease and I'm on immunosuppressants
This sucks, man, I wish you all the best
Don't forget your training
Take a deep breath, maybe 2, and think of yourself as one of your patients, maybe that will help reduce the stress
Mass resignation
But shouldn't hospitals and government institutions have a different supply chain then consumers
I would assume they need larger quantities than me, and would not buy disinfectantant in a 1l bottle from the supermarket
I understand
i thought about those disinfectans used to clean surfaces, in spray bottles or something like that
There are non of those left here either, stores are empty
It seems you refer to those hand disinfectants
It is not as bad here yet, but i wouldn'tbe surprised if it is going to happen in 1 or 2 weeks
I tries buying, but was too late
I use some of that usually to mop the floor an clean surfaces in the house (washing machine, door handles etc)
I still have some left though, should be enough for the next 2 weeks
So you know how everyone makes fun of Italy for switching sides in ww2
Yeah we did that too
damn, laughed way more than I should have hahaha
EDIT: someone give this guy a medal, i'm poor lol
You got me, not gonna lie
I gotta say this actually made me laugh
No, our king staged a coup against Ion Antonescu and switched to the Allies
Yeah, they’re good
We eat them also in Romania
My grandmother also used to eat snails but my mom did not pick up that habit
Well, I also live in Romania and I never knew we ate snails so yeah, that's pretty rare, at least in my region
Cuz they would stick out as a sore thumb among all the old pretty buildings
And besides this, Europeans are not huddled into a few metropolitan areas with just desert in between (this is my ignorant image of the US)
In Europe it's more common for people to hate living in a big metropolis
And it's not like people live in the suburbs and work in the big city
Most city are medium sized and are well connected to each other, so it's fairly easy to live in one small town/village, work in a medium sized city and go in the weekend to the bigger city for shopping/fun
What I'm trying to say is that the population is much more spread out on the land and I don't think people here care that they don't all live in the big city
All the people I know that do live in big cities (Paris, München, Bucharest) they kind of hate it there and dream of moving out
Don't be an ass
Just because you have zero knowledge of a thing doesn't mean the thing isn't well known
Belgian cities are quite famous for how pretty they are
"Cine nu-i gata, îl iau cu lopata
" (The one who isn't ready, I will take him with the shovel
Pregătit sau nu, vin acum
(Romanian) (Word-by-word translation as the expression is “Cine nu-i gata, îl iau cu lopata
Gata sau nu, vin acum or cine nui gata il iau cu lopata (whos not ready im geting he/she whit the shovel sounds dump ik XD)
Looks like we got quite a bit of lopata's (lopeti in Romanian)
Am venit aici crezând ca sunt singurul român
Romanians assemble !!
Si eu
No, we are gonna shovel them out
No we won't
FEREASCĂ SFANTUL
Romania and Eastern Moldova are technically separate countries
I feel like Moldova kept a more of the older Romanian/Moldavian words
If none of us adapted, it would be harder to understand each other, even though we would recognize the words
For instance, a penalty kick in football is called "lovitură de pedeapsă" in Romania, but I heard Moldavians call it "pilitură de osânză". I recognize all the words, but I had no idea what the expression meant the first time I heard it
It would be amazing if Moldovans would adapt to standard Romanian because they keep using some strange expressions and weird words that sound very funny to most of us
We don't mind people from Moldova who speak romanian with their accent and some different words
It sounds pretty good actually, and singers from Moldova that use their accent are very popular and well regarded in Romania
That had to be a joke
Pălitură de osândă. I think that was a joke about how Moldovans use old or different words for basically everything
The words are synonyms but oviously "a păli" is used mostly in rural areas, and "osândă" is just an old word no one uses anymore
After a Google search I found this: [
Why does every single neighbor of ours is against us, I mean I know we had problems in the past, but that's just history
( I'm from Romania)
i dont understand why bulgarian beaches are more appealing to us romanians than our own, if that counts
Hmmm
why tf didn't Rep
of Moldova unite with Romania
What’s stranger re timezones is India uses 1 timezone although it’s large enough to fit 2 timezones, that is the sun rises/sets 2 hours later in the west
We share a border with a country that speaks the same language, but sometimes I can’t understand a word they say
They're mad we don't use a slavic alphabet
We're literally the odd one out, Latin amongst Slavics/Slavs
Never been to Bulgarian beaches, but I'll try to help
It appears to me that they invested more in resort type of things that cost only a bit less than here, but give to the average Romanian cheap person the feeling of going abroad for the summer holidays
Pentru ca numa acolo au vacante all-inclusive cu vreo 15 mese pe zi :)
Well that was deep
Lol me neither
The worst situation is when they're trying to overtake but they can't so they get visibly frustrated
So you’re saying Hungarians in Hungary are not against Romanians, only the Hungarians in Romania are
Shocker
First thing first I'm talking about the country itself hating us, not the people in it
Hungary hates us because Transylvania
Ukraine hates us because they are basically Russians, they are against Moldavia and Romania uniting
Moldavia hates us because the Russians brainwashed them to make them think that they're russian, which made them hate us
Bulgaria wants Dobruja, and we've also fought them
The only one who is neutral towards us is Serbia, because we were on the same side all the time, but we are not Slavs, so they don't care that much about us
Also Turkey hates us, we've had a long history of you massacring us and we massacring you
fair enough, i always hear people saying "omg lets go to the golden sands in bulgaria"(if thats what they're called and always felt like our country was never good enough for holidays
thats true lmao
Yep
There's nationalists in every country
Yeah, sorry it was like 4 am also woke up at 8 AM, as I was very tired, I forgot that Ukraine wasn't Russian anymore because I play a WW2 strategy game a lot, at that moment my brain was still thinking about that
We call dish soap "Axion" this is the only thing that come to my mind
here, in romania we call every type of sneaker ,,adidas" so actual adidas sneakers are calles ,,adidas adidases"
Well we have 'afidași' for trainers and 'pempărși' for diapers
That's all I can think of lmao
Adidas - all trainers
Jeep - SUVs
Pampers - Diapers
In Romania we use the same word for hairdryer with the exact pronunciation and we don't even have ö in our phonetic inventory
"Dero" , "Xerox" , "Pampers" , "Adidasi" , "Scotch" ,"Jeep", "Lego"
Ha we call it feon too
Had no idea it came from the Fohn
Zmeu tends to be the old, archaic, story telling kind of dragon
Otherwise it’s currently ~~translated as~~ referring to a kite
For dragons, like you’d name the ones in Game of Thrones, the word is ‘dragon’
But yes, there’s an uncanny resemblance between German and Romanian
> In hungarian, "üveg" means the same material, but also means bottle
Same in romanian
"Sticlă" means both "glass" (material) and "bottle".
Not stupid, but it pissed me off
I met an elderly couple from the UK on a boat trip in Amsterdam
At first they seemed nice, but the old man tried at one point to pronounce the name of a Romanian band and he did a really bad job, so I said that I have no idea what he's trying to say
Then the old lady said "wow, we know more about your culture than you do".
I didn't think much of it, but then I realized what band he was talking about
Ciocârlia for anyone interested
As we were talking about this band he started confusing it to Goran Bregovic
When I tried to correct him, he said "no, trust me, I know more about it than you"
They were both laughing, but I thought it was very unfunny and it kind of pissed me off
In Poland, a bunch of English tourists got drunk af and one of them pissed next to a pool table, because he was too lazy to walk 20 meters til the bathroom
He also tried "making it ok" by shouting "I'll pay for iiit"
Romanian, my mother says she saw somebody trying to haggle down the price in a marketplace
There isn't any coffee
Lol I thought they were also selling coffee
Yes it does, provincia/provincial(from the countryside)
Basically means you are low class
But in actually the biger cities in the wester part are cleaner and have a better standard of living imo than the capital
Pretty much the same in Romania
The word is "provincie".
Same in Romania ("provincia")
Another large town in Romania however "patented" another word for people outside of that town: "vinitură"
Same word in Romanian
"provincie" is almost always used derogatoriu
Bucharest is a big city so there are a lot more poor areas than in cities like Oradea, Timisoara or Cluj, but make no mistake, Bucharest is much richer than all of those
The GDP per capita is twice as high than any other region
“Provincie” means “province”, which in turn refers to the “outside of the capital city”. Definitely not “countryside”. I know Bucharesters like to think Bucharest is the only city in Romania, the others being just larger villages, but let’s not forget that a lot of them folks in Bucharest are in fact _provinciali_.
The standard of living takes more info account that the gdp
purchasing power, safety, healthcare, cost of living, property price to income ratio, traffic, pollution
This all count more for a person's overall confort .
Don't get me wrong when taking into account the property price to income ratio Cluj has become hell
Was working in Marrakech , me and my friends were at McDs, the girls stayed outside while me and my friend went to order
He is a pervert ,talking sexual things all the time
Many girls  in line, infront  of us there is a girl really good looking
He begins  (ofcourse we're talking romanian) "man look at this girls ass, suck a beautiful ass, imagine you play a bit with it, give it some kisses then stick your dick in it" to wich the girl turned around and gave me a short look
( i found it a bit strange but in the many years working there i've never seen romanian tourists)
My friend continues with " look at the other one ,how big her ass is, it's  alot of work an ass like that ,you get tired fast" . The poor girl infront couldn't take it anymore and turned around and started talking in romanian to us how we should be ashamed and how we are giving romania a bad name
We wore both mouth open speech less and we stayed like that  until we  went back to the girls and told them what happened
They laughted their asses off
Since then i never talk anything  bad in public doesn't matter wich country i'm in
add romania to that list
Germans have no sense of style
Sorry
I moved to Germany and my first thought was "oh, wow, they're very free and comfortable over here", but then I realized that they just don't have any interest in clothes other than the obvious need to cover their bodies
Even the "stylish" Germans look shaggy and disheveled
Even during nice/fancy events they wear hiking shoes
Or ugly ill-fitting pants
There's no sense of what works for what body type, it's just "I like red and this is red".
And of course, all the teenagers in my town dress the exact same
Like not the same style
The same clothes
I put very little effort into my clothes/style, but there *is* an effort
As in I think about what works and what doesn't beforehand
Also I buy specific clothes that work for my body type
And the Germans at my work think I'm super stylish
The eastern Europeans do not think I'm stylish, btw
The easterners think I'm normal
Edit: in all fairness, I had some German students that had really lovely styles
And they looked comfortable too
Visited Iceland a couple of years ago in February and it coincided with the most massive snowfall in the past 70 years
It was also really cold and windy and I kept gawking at people wearing tennis shoes, skinny jeans that barely reached the ankles and light jackets
Meanwhile, I was all bundled up with about three layers underneath my thick jacket
(before corona) i was on the beach and i just walked in bulgary to get better tobacco
sometimes life is like that
Yeah before corona, once a month I'd get a cheap plane ticket to wherever
Milan, Berlin, anything that was on offer at the time
Spent the weekend then came back home on Sunday night
Also I live in Bucharest, I know a really great fish restaurant on the Bulgarian side of the Danube, takes me an hour and a half to get there by car (because of traffic not distance)
I'd go because I love fish
Before Corona I went to other countries in the EU pretty often
For holidays and also for work
I think maybe 4 times a year
I live now in Germany, pretty close to the Czech border (about 3h drive)
So I would go there pretty often
Edit: as a practical example, I used to go once a year to some Czech city to get a haircut, because haircuts are stupid expensive in Germany and because the Czech are more artistic and have better customer service
I'd say I don't go as often since I don't live close to the border, but at least 3-4 times a year
It's also really common to live in a country and work in another, my parents are Romanian but they work in Italy, they come back home for holidays sometimes if their jobs allow it
There are also people that live in Italy and every morning cross the border to Switzerland to go to work
Yeah, in terms of borders it's actually pretty easy( you only need your ID) but a lot changed from country to country, not even the Slavic countries have the same exact culture and tradition or even language
It's actually pretty nice knowing you can experience a completely different culture in just a few hours
>18€ best of big Mac in Geneva
My poor ass had a heart attack reading this
See you in the afterlife, guys
I'm afraid to ask, but
What's wrong with Perth
Not French, not in France, but there's an Arc de Triomphe in Bucharest and I see it regularly enough
I wouldn't drive in Bucharest if I had the choice though the monument itself is nice
Bucharest is just something else
The only rule is that the bigger car has right of way
I dont like going down there
I don't remember Corsica being that crazy when I visited (2x) but this is exactly how some friends described driving in Sardinia :))
Shout-out to people that don't care about the color of the traffic light and pass nonetheless
Is the only place I saw people doing this, to such an extension
Sounds like Pissaladière
Until very recently I wasnt aware that the word *cizma* (long boots) is loaned from Hungarian *csizma*.
wow am învățat ceva nou astăzi
Seriously
Ive learned something new today
Thanks
Exactly
I never thought about that until we talked about your long high-heeled boots
:-)
Hungarian
Hungarians ate the largest ethnic minority in romania (about 6%)
Excluding English,it might be French in Romania
Or Russian/Serbian for the fossils
Hungarian because of Hungarian minorities
Or Gypsy language if thats a thing
If you mean minoraty leanguage, then magyar, rromani and german
If you mean studied the french and secound german
I think more people speak French and German as a second language than Hungarian due to them being extensively thought in schools all across the country
Also for the Szekelys, Hungarian can be considered a first language not second
That's like saying Portuguese is mutually intelligible with French
Being part of the same language family doesn't make the languages mutually intelligible
I understood the question as the second most popular native language spoken
As a second language, probably french then
They're taught extensively in schools, but they're also taught badly all across the country
It's extremely rare for someone to have learned French or German in school
Maybe mostly the people who study philology in college
damn hungarians
I remember I watched a docuseries a while ago with a guy traveling around Ireland trying to use only Irish, facing day to day situations such as grocery shopping, checking in a hotel, renting a car and so on
Needless to say he had a lot of trouble
Not really
Firstly Romanian is a romance language, it's very similar to Italian and Spanish and that makes it quite easy to learn, especially for the age group that emigrated there (mostly unqualified people in their 30s and 40s in the early 2000s)
The number of Romanians in Spain went down significantly due to a mix of economic issues post 2008 crash and the fact that most of them were only there for seasonal work
In Italy things were a bit different because more people had permanently emigrated there leading to a stable, larger expat community
More and more Romanians are choosing countries like Austria and Germany these days for economic reasons
I guess you're no longer Hungary
I'm sorry
Wow I had quite a bit of trouble googling it, but then I just entered the magic term tg4 and there it was, first video result
[Here is the first episode
I know but it's more of a convenience thing than a language one since most of them work in the tourism sector
TL;DR: Skip to 3rd section, first and second are somewhat offtopic
> into Year 7 (so, they've just finished primary school)
*insert "do you even know how little that narrows it down
" meme here*
Different countries use entirely different school systems
In Romania, if someone is in Year 7 of school, they are typically 13-14 years old
It vastly depends on where and who, if they had computer experience and so on
People assume that knowing how to tap a squircle shaped icon and playing with a game = universal computer knowledge
That comparison is basically identical to equating someone's knowledge of using Windows Calculator to knowing how to use Visual Basic for Applications macros in Microsoft Excel
They're entirely different things
On an iPad, you tap on the App Store blue icon, you click on the Games text or rocket icon at the bottom, you tap a game, and you click the big blue "INSTALL" button
After that, some magic happens, and a new icon appears on the Home Screen
There is no concept of files involved, no installer, everything is hidden away
Meanwhile, switching to Microsoft Windows, you first have the concept of the Start Menu, which is like the Home Screen but not really
What you would expect to be the Home Screen is actually the Desktop, and then you must know about files to understand how to use that
On mobile devices, especially on iOS ones, each app manages its own container of files
When you open Microsoft Excel on an iPad, you don't get a file picker where you must navigate folders to get to your desired file
Instead, the app presents you with the files its managing
Furthermore, on mobile operating systems, you share things
On desktop operating systems, you have to deal again with folders and file types
While all the desktop stuff seems trivial, it is only because we're used to it
I am often helping people without computing experience, especially old people, and I get to see how it is from the perspective of the unknowledgeable
To finally answer the original question, not a whole lot
Kids in the city are likely to own a computer
For kids in the countryside, it's highly unlikely
Kids in rich families are almost guaranteed to have computers
Kids in poor families, only if the family makes some sacrifices
Kids in **very** poor families, they have to worry about food first
And owning a computer is a pretty big prerequisite to being computer literate
Once you own a computer, hopefully also have an Internet connection, a cracked version of Microsoft Office 2007 and hopefully some curiousity, it's pretty easy to get going simply by experimenting
I am 14 (when school starts I'll be in year 8) and I'm still not confident in my computer skills; I never used a pc, I do have a laptop, but I don't use it that much
I can kinda do basic stuff like create a word document or using PowerPoint, however I still have  *a lot* to learn, I'm also rlly concerned about the fact that I don't know how to properly use the laptop or pc, since I know very well I will need it in the future
I'm sure I can find some tutorials on yt, but I'd like to learn more
I am now trying to teach myself, I hope it will turn out ok
I would give you an award, but I don't have reddit coins
There was actually a whole study/interview thing, which stated that Romania's youth, aged 16-24, mostly dont know how to use a computer for basics
Only 54% answered that they can
And basics are browsing internet, browsing files and using apps like word, zoom etc
Its sad :( we are among the leaders of internet power and quality, yet half of our young dont know how to use it
It was kind of popular among people younger than 40 about 5 years ago, but people got bored of it, and you barely hear of it now
That may be because ecstasy has become the most consumed drug here, especially at music festivals
Fairly popular amongst teenagers, still very taboo amongst older people( even medical marijuana )
It is very popular, but it's illegal
People who are afraid of law don't want to have anything to do with it
If you try it your family will call you a degenerate and will shame you for it until you die
I lived in Birmingham for a while and I could smell weed more than I did cigarettes in Romania
Literally every bus stop and park smells of weed there
it gets annoying
Romanian is mostly pronounced exactly like it's written so different spellings are uncommon or not very dramatic
Examples: Andreea/Andreia, Teodor/Theodor, Elisa/Eliza, Mihael/Mihail
Basically if two diphtongs can sound similar, or if the "s" sound tends to morph into a "z", or if there can be a silent "h" somewhere
With modern or foreign-inspired names, the sky is the limit haha
Mălina/Alina/Arina/Aruna - they're essentially different names
I’d also add Isabela/Izabela
Daiana is a legit Romanian name, and if it's an Italian school the probability for that girl to be Romanian is pretty high
Yes, that's exactly how Polish looks to most other countries
How are you supposed to pronounce "szczy"?
I’ve been learning English since 6’th grade, through high school and again some specialized courses in college
I’m now close to 40 year old and I just realized something
You know those spelling competitions
I sometimes see kids on TV or in a movie doing their best at spelling unusual words
Without any relation to the post, my brain decided that now is the time to ask ‘are those contests a thing in English native speaking countries
Are they real
Do they really exist
Did any of you non native speakers go through a spelling class
I don’t remember such a thing happening in all my learning experience
Agreed
Please excuse my english
Such poetry, much amaze
Thine language be excused
my parents & I left Romania, and everyone leaves Romania really
we live in the US now but honestly after I finish school here I’d like to move back to Europe
maybe not Romania (beautiful country just corrupt)
It a actually is quite simillar
Word by word, “Cale ferată” means ironed way
Same in Romanian
We add "feroviar". Although we use Cale Ferată (ironed way) to mean a railway
Yeah the Carpathian mountains
There are some areas that are inaccessible so there are no villages close
Yes, plenty of wilderness left, although it is threatened and reducing by the day
Logging, development etc
If you want to see a cool documentary on it watch Untamed Romania on Netflix
I think it wouldn't shock anyone anymore
And tbf, if we were to elect someone born somewhere else that *can actually speak the language correctly*, would be so nice
I'm honestly tired of politicians that could barely finish high school
Yes, because we are racist
He is
He’s German
Coaie sunt atat de multi handicapati care il injura pt numele sau dar in principiu nu cred ca majoritatea are o problema cu el avand in vedere ca e deja la al doilea mandat
We don't have that sort of paper, but Digi24 (TV channel) pre 2017 was the only halfway decent one
Maybe not that much
I mean "The Duck in Chains" might refer to the fact that they want to enchain the fake news and make solid ones instead
Now probably Recorder
Wow, I am surprised that someone outside of Romania knows about Recorder
Yes, it's true that they have some fantastic stuff out there, but at the moment, they are mainly focused on local governments, outside the occasional documentary
But they are definetely my favorite Channel
I am Romanian but living in the Netherlands
Tried to add both tags but only one is being displayed
Scuze de confuzie :D
Sorry for misinterpreting your flair
Iti urez o zi a prajiturii buna
Probably Serbia
We’ve been neighbours since forever now and we never fought against each other
Not so relevant now, but for the 19th and 20th century I would also say France
Modern Romania wouldn’t exist as we know it today without the French
Probably Moldova because we used to be a country and most of Moldova's population wants us to be a country back
I guess our Serbian and fellow Yugoslavian brothers (not counting Moldavians because they are blood related)
Just like with Czechoslovakia we were very emotionally affected by what happened there and, regardless of our regime or allies, we supported them in anyway we could
I don't know the reasons but I can tell you we truly like all of them
In the middle ages we were surrounded by three major nations: the Habsburgs, the Ottomen and the Russians
Habsburgs took our Transylvania, the Ottoman Empire vassaled us, that leaves us only with Russia, as our oldest friend
Definetely not best one, but one indeed
I think they helped us unite
Our current best friends are Moldova and Bulgaria
Moldova, because, well
and Bulgaria because we share a lot of similarities, we both entered the EU at the same time, we are neighbours etc
Germany is the guy that fucked his crushes Austria and Czechoslovakia, but he also wanted to fuck Poland
She didn't want that, so he raped her and Poland told that to the headmaster Mr
Allies
We like you too :) I am from Timisoara and during the weekends (such as today), you can hear more Serbian than Romanian in the central area of the city
Good to see more Serbs come visit here and I hope the reverse is also true
There's a saying: Romanians have fought woth all their neighbours, except Serbs and the Black Sea
No Russia for us :)
Russia
Our friend
What did you smoke bro
I mean if it was WW2, then it should be Romania since we not only wanted to respect our alliance and provide military help despite being already rather pro-German, but we also helped the Polish govt and army escape Poland through Romania and we kept the Polish national treasure safe during the war
I would probably see that coming somehow, as more and more Moldovans come to Romania
Not unless there are made major reforms, our economy grows and we convert into €.
They helped us unite
We can relate to that
Pretty shocking we get along so well for being in the Balkans :) cheers to that
We love you too\~
Uhm no, Russia opposed the union between Moldova and Wallachia, France helped us unite
Well we know who else isnt Slav and you really dislike them a lot
It depends
for some there are 2 such countries, for some only 1
Well yes because they are cheap and the fabric is good
I mostly don't care about t-shirts
i think yes
I would say
Stupid
As in we joke about ourselves being stupid, others being stupid, stupid situations, stupid outcomes, stupid solutions to difficult problems, difficult solutions to stupid problems, etc
Maybe this is self-deprecating
But it's mostly about lack of intelligence or knowledge
Also we're smart asses
We're the guy that goes "well, can you
" when someone asks if they can have whatever
Dark and nihilistic
Sometimes I wonder if people are joking or are just criticizing themselves
I’m kind of positive guy so the balance it’s hard to see for me
A lot of insults and attacks
Intonation and pronounciation play a big role in how funny the joke is gonna be
I think Romania is one of the funniest country ever we make fun of everything
We have some words like "haz de necaz" which translates to make din of a bad situation
"Misto" making fun of someone and others I think we have the most curse words too
We have a saying in Romanian: "a face haz de necaz", which roughly translates as "make fun of misfortune". Most of the time is self misfortune
I think that perfectly describes the kind of humour that exists in Romania
Miserable life in Sweden
Wow
Couldn't have described it better myself
I understand
I was about to say I didn't recall such things happening here but then I remembered our national treasure, Vadim Tudor, ex MEP and senator, when he was alive (until 2015) he would frequently yell and curse out people in public disputes, often calling them really weird insults (like crazy chicken, hell midget, rabid bitch, cattle with shoes, vomited crow
these don't really make much sense in english but oh god the dude was comedy gold) or even straight up swearing on live TV (typical romanian swears like fuck your mother's dead relatives, calling people handicapped as an insult), [here] are some of his best moments of this kind, he and his weird insults became a very well known meme for us
He probably sounds awful but he was actually a really well read and knowledgeable person, much more than most of our actual politicians, he actually came really close to becoming president in 2000 (2nd place) and he's pretty well liked within the country
Well Ceaușescu had another kind of breakdown live in broadcast
In Romania, we had Corneliu Vadim Tudor, but I'm sure you can count it as a nervous breakdown or just Vadim being Vadim
Here is a sample: [
Ah yes, there was this political debate and a politician (?) got mad and throwed his water in the face of a woman who took part at debate
And people judge you for not having better performance than other politicians before the pandemics time
While I agree he was an excellent meme, he was a terrible politician
A bit of a fascist if you ask me
I was also thinking about Vadim, but can you really call that a mental breakdown or just Vadim being Vadim
Usually, a mental breakdown implies a change in behavior
there was no change with Vadim :)))
He wasn't a terrible politician, but let's just say glad he didn't get to dictate the foreign policy and declare war on Hungary
That Iliescu, a corupt politician that grabed power at the 89 revolution, is older then earth and will never die
Also the Dacians created the time machine
Dacians invented TVs, math, the internet, Space travel, etc
There is a group of people (small and pseudo-intellectual/idiotic) that claims that dacians invented the Latin language
So the meme is that dacians invented everything
There's also a joke that goes:
In France archeologists found cave paintings and determined that the French invented art
In England archeologists found metal arrow heads and determined that the English invented metallurgy
In Romania archeologists found nothing and determined that the Romanians invented the wifi
I sell Golf 4
The Gouvernment
The Szekelyland
Iliescu never dies
Jesus, does he live at the Palace of Versailles
Sadly for you, we exist

This is *killing* me
I've been laughing for waaay too long
Different spellings in different languages
English says ‘Bucharest’, Romanian says ‘București’.
*raises hand*
I apologize for my ignorance but is a chocolate bread the same thing as a croissant
I mean, i love garlic, but to each his own, right
I'm not interested even in the politics of my country
[Hoia Baciu Forest] this place is not only haunted but paranormal activities of each kind are reported every year like ghosts, portals to other dimensions, UFO activity, gravitational anomalies and even witches that uses the forest for special rituals using the high mystical aura of the place
Its a very popular spot for tourists, ghost hunters and alien hunters but most locals would prefer to keep distance from that place
In Romania we have the famous [Hoia-Baciu forest]
Hoia Baciu Forest
It's a haunted forest where people seen ufo's, ghosts, witches and different paranormal things
It is right outside Cluj-Napoca so it can be visited while visiting the city, which is absolutely superb
How popular is underage drinking in your country
Here, in Romania, once you get into highschool (around 15) the drinking parties start and once you hit actual legal age, you already have countless drunk experiences, or, at least, that was(is, as I'm not 18 yet) experience
About the buying of alcohol, at any shop which is not part of a chain, I'm sure they would give any alcohol to a 5 year old
How about your countries
Edit: Thanks for all the answers
This is my first post on reddit and I'm on vacation right now and it makes me happy to see my notifications overflow, although I can't answer to everything
I'll try to upvote everything :)
Let’s be honest, we Europeans love our alcohol
I think it’s pretty hard to not had tasted it at least once before 18
my dad used to give me sips of beer when i was 4
In Ireland they take it really serious
If you're under 18 it is against the law to purchase alcohol, drink in a public space, pretend to be 18+ in order to buy it, be in a pub after 9 or 10pm
At home alcohol cannot be served to <18 without the consent of a parent or guardian
I spend my adolescence in Romania, so I can relate to most romanian opinions
I got drunk for the first time at 13, my dad used to give some (5-10ml) before dinner to prevent food poisoning, quit drinking at 25
I was a social drinker, didn't like to get drunk and I hated in the morning after
Don't like the beer, hate the taste of vodka but I wouldn't say no to a glass of nice dry wine from time to time
I'm 16 and I have never tasted alcohol and I never will because personally I've seen how it can ruin peoples lives when misused
I might have an unpopular opinion but F Alcohol
here just say "i buy this drink for my father" and that's it
Excluding supermarkets
That's 100% accurate,(I live in Salaj,which is an average region,so I can't really talk about other parts), but just going at night around the city you can see the problem
Even some of the 'most enlightened' among highschool students get shitface drunk so much they are barely able to move
I used to drink a lot too, but I've been 100% sober for the past 6 months
As for the 5 year old buying alcohol,I was at a  Carrefour once and a kid was in front of me, he had all types of shit on the conveyor belt like cheese and milk and a yes, a 2
5L bottle of Beer
The cashier was a young girl and she had a sticker saying that she was new so I thought she would say something,a few seconds pass and an older chasier comes and looks,I look at her,she looks at the boy and comes to help the girl
I thought, "Something is gonna happen".She scans the beer like it's no big deal and let's him go like he just bought water
meirl :)))
18 is the legal purchasing age, not drinking at home age
You can drink at home if you are 15 and your parents are dumb enough or ignorant enough to buy you alcohol
Though, I don't like underage drinking, and the only time I ever drank alcohol was a small sip when I was 14
Damn, had no idea there was a country in Europe where there is no drinking age
Haven't actually thought it would be like that in countries more towards the west of Europe
You are kinda explaining more in detail the situation here with this comment with a few exceptions
Ironically enough, right now, I'm with another 7 people(family and friends) at a tavern, in Greece, having a mythos :)
Yeah, I'm always mindblown in a way when I hear Americans talk about drinking before 21 like a crime
It's kind of the same here, but i feel like it also depends much on your group of friends
I also have friends in my group who don't drink at all
Didn't mean anywhere specific but I guess at home it's even earlier, as was in my case
Field
That doesn't seem a friendly environment for a teen to experience the effects of alcohol
When you just want the experience u don't even give a shit anymore
First time I was curious about drinking was at 13 I drank at home alone a quarter of a jack bottle among some other booze taken from my parents
I hated Jack and I hate it now but I just wanted the experience
And why change it, like ppl say, it's just part of our identity seems like
I don't think it's such a big problem since drinking  is part of the culture in many places of the world, but drinking as much as going into a comma, yea,  that's not quite ok
It's a constant surprise reading these comments :O
Had no idea so many countries had their drinking age down at 16
Same for me
I started drinking at like 13 from leftover alcohol in the house
I was stunned to find out my parents had noticed but didn't say anything :)
It's nice to have someone teach you as most parents, as I'm noticing, just let you go with the flow but I liked to experience it myself
Smoking problem is here too
I have not and will never smoke
I haven't even tried a puff but 75% of my mates had already started or tried to snake at around 14
Your own opinion and people should respect it
I am the same with tobacco
Well, I wouldn't know
My reddit age is 2 days
I think u can figure out my region from my name :) Its the same here, I'm in arguably the 2nd best highschool in the city
About the kid, I would've thought he was shopping for his parents since he had all kinds of products
Yea, I'm leaving Scotts alone :)
Have never heard of such thing as drinking at 15
The only thing I hear in Romania is 18, 18 and 18
Same here, smoking is a big problem as well
Maybe you should go outside more (:
No he didn't
I omitted this part because it didn't fit in
He didn't have enough money so he runs out of the store,I went to a different cashier and got out before he came back,if he did
I will if I'll find it anywhere
Thanks :)
Waaaait, so you are telling me that if I go to a store and put a beer on the counter, the cashier is allowed to call the cops on me
Mad shit
The main parties are the following:
PSD (Social Democrat Party) - the party that is essentially the descendent of the Romanian Communist Party
They are known to appease old people by promising to raise their pensions (and sometimes actually doing it)
After they get in power, they do close to nothing related to any of their promises or political spectrum alignment and instead put their family in state jobs and inflate contracts to pocket the difference
PNL (National Liberal Party) - the party that publicly supports the free market, small businesses, cutting pensions and not raising the minimum wage
Apart from that, when they come in power they kick the people from PSD out of state jobs and put their family in those jobs
They essentially do a switcheroo
As I like to describe them - _personal opinion_ - they're PSD but they don't even raise pensions
USR and PLUS (Save Romania Union and Freedom, Unity and Solidarity Party) - two new parties founded to essentially take on the old corrupt parties and finally do something for the country
They had a decent success at the European elections and, despite having some internal struggles, - _personal opinion_ - they're the best we have for now
They are in the process of merging into one party named USRPLUS
PMP (People's Movement Party) - after spending two terms (10 years) as a president and seeing his former party - PDL (Democratic Liberal Party) - disintegrate and then reform as PNL, Traian Băsescu created his new party
I don't know much about their policies
ALDE (The Alliance of Liberals and Democrats) - same as PMP except instead of Traian Băsescu it was Călin Popescu Tăriceanu after being kicked out of the party he was formerly in
Until PSD lost the government a couple of years ago, ALDE was in alliance with PSD
UDMR (The Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania) - a party that represents the Hungarian minority in Romania
Many people informally say - _their personal opinion_ - that they are an internal terrorist organisation because they frequently demand that a region in the centre of Romania where Hungarians are the majority needs to become an autonomous region, a thing that is unconstitutional
I would also add that PSD has been quite ultranationalist in the last years and also anti-LGBT
Not to mention they had some anti-EU speeches last year
Italians wear clothes to hide strings of spaghetti growing out through their skin, like hair on normal humans
When they need to cook pasta they just lift their shirt and cut the amount they need
True story
In Romanian the standard one i would say is "fie", but in my (Transylvanian) dialect, I'd say "no binie", "no" being a filler word being used the same way as its equivalent in Hungarian or Polish or even German, "binie" being a dialectal version of "bine" meaning "good"
"În fine" could also count, even if as translation it works more as "Whatever", at least around Bucharest its more of a "fair enough", same systematic usage, at the end of arguments or discussions
"În" means "in", "fine" i think refers to final, so kinda means "in final".
i think "treaba ta" works in this context
I'm not even from Transylcania and I often use 'na'.
Given names ("prenume") and family name ("nume de familie" or simply "nume")
When a marriage takes place, the spouses choose which will be the family name out of their two
Except in rare occasions, both spouses will take the chosen name
Children will then have that family name
At divorce, the person who changed their family name at marriage can choose to keep the current family name or revert to the pre-marriage one
The given name can be any name, as long as the letters used are part of the Romanian alphabet
The - (dash) symbol is also allowed
An example of a commonly given name that uses the dash is "Ana-Maria".
Although people with multiple (commonly only two) given names almost always choose one they prefer and call the others "middle names", the concept of middle name doesn't exist legally
In formal communication, the family name is always written first, which is the opposite to most English-like countries
When someone presents themselves as "Datcu Ion" (random name chosen), "Datcu" would be the last name and "Ion" the first name
We don't really have the concept of "middle names". The family name is the last name
All your given names are considered "first names".
In school and other official scenarios, the last name is used first, which doesn't make sense since the word for last name in Romanian is "**pre**nume" which literally translates to "before name".
We usually get one or two first names
If you're my father, you'd ask around what name to give me, settle on 3, but can't decide on which, and have everyone who sees your son's full name say something like "Wait
You have 3 first names
WTF
The wife traditionally gets her husband's last name, and so do the offspring
Though there is nothing legal preventing other arrangements, it's just not common
The most extreme Romanian name I can think of is of a former Prime-Minister, who has 3 first names (Călin Constantin Anton) and a hyphenated last name (Popescu-Tăriceanu)
Some very outdated institutions may ask you to write your name with your father's initials between the first name(s) and the last
At most, that could be considered a sort of middle name
There are some common-sense rules on names you *can't* give to children, like you can't use obscene words, but other than that you can name them anything you want
Well first it's your surname (usually it's your father surname) + name + your middle name (if u have one)
Exemple: Grigorescu Ioana Maria
Grigorescu is the surname, Ioana is the name and Maria the middle name ;-;
dead
I'd go pet me some fishies at the bottom of the black sea
i would probably be a tailor, making dresses for the rich and dreaming of wearing them some day
Based on my family linage I would be a farmer living under the Austrian Emprie, probably married (21) with somebody as poor as me, with a child
Married working on some farm with 4 kids at age 20
Probably a blacksmith,mostly because my grand-grandfather and grandfather were blacksmiths
How patriotic
Accurate
Well, aren't you fancy
And alive
Unless you try really hard and believe in yourself
Get well
Long live the Emperor
I support the Republic of China strongly, yes
The communist territory is illegitimate, and should be known to be illegitimate on a global scale
I know it's a typo, but "Easter Europe" brings me a smile
Sadly, that's the only thing about your comment that makes me smile, since you seem to be right
In romania we say he lives in Lapland(Laponia) and sometimes at the North Pole
The North Pole of course
He hunts the Coca Cola Polar bear with a rifle that shoots candy canes
Basically, wherever he wants, isn't he super rich to be able to give away gifts for every child on the planet
But for now, I think he's in Laponia
Probably in a sauna, chillin'.
Ok, I don't really know the details as I'm not Christian and I haven't been raised in a family as such, but here in Romania we celebrate both Christmas and Saint Nicholas
On the eve of 6th of December kids are instructed to clean their boots and in the morning St Nicholas would have left sweets amd oranges in them
If they are not clean, it would be a stick
And on the Christmas itself they celebrate the birth of Christ and the Christmas with the usual gifts
Roma culture still has some
First time
This does not sound very "german" are you using Italian/ Spanish or Romanian project managers
That's hilarious
In Romanian, we have "dor", which is used when you want to express the feeling of missing something
It could be another human being, an object, another emotion
It can express nostalgy, love, melancholy
It is a very porwerful word
It is a noun however, we have a different proper verb for "to miss smth".
E.g. Mi-e dor de zilele cu soare
(Rough translation: I miss the sunny days)
2nd e.g. Am așa un dor să te sărut
(Rough translation: I have such a desire to kiss you)
There is a saying we use quite often, "Spor la treabă!" or its abbreviated version, just "Spor
" whenever someone says they're gonna do something that requires time or patience or hard work or all of them
It could roughly be translated to "may you be productive" but it's quite a loose equivalence and it always frustrates me that I can't find a better alternative
I'm including an example for clarity
A: I'm gonna start working on my essay
B: Spor
“Aoleu”. Like a more urgent and dramatic version of “Alas”.
Sisu is ‘Grit’.
Uimahalli is ‘Poolhall’.
Update: Uimahalli is not ‘Poolhall’, but ‘Poolhall’ should totally be uimahalli
I love architecture so I wouldn’t name any building a “monstrosity”, however the obvious answer is the Palace of Parliament
That think is unnecessary big, opulent and in general it’s existence seems pointless
The Former house of the people
The nowadays  palace of parliament ( Romania)
[Catedrala Mântuirii Neamului (Romania)]
Oh god i so hate those communist blocks everywhere
1947-1989 was just the worst for romania
Yeah, and a priest usually teaches
Although in my high school we had at one point a guy that wasn't a priest, but had a PhD in religious studies or something
In my experience religion class is so-so
I had crazy bigots and I had normal individuals teach it
Most of the priests that came to my class were pretty normal and we would talk about random stuff
Mostly about our issues as teenagers, like popularity, how to be an individual, how to prepare for adulthood
We had a priest teach us about bureaucracy (how to get your first ID)
It was basically just an hour of random discussions
They do but it's optional and at least in my highschool u can choose between orthodox and Catholic
They teach it for people who ar religious and are interested in learning stuff about it
yes, it's a dandy time to do your homework for the math class that follows
Yes, but only Orthodox Christianity in most schools and most teachers are dumbasses that deny the existence of science and medicine
Luckily religion is optional but most kids take it because it improves their grade average and you can get a max grade by just showing up
Yes, but not sure why
It's not mandatory, but if you don't want to do it there are papers to be filed (i.e. you don't opt to do it, you only have the option to request not doing it; it's not mandatory in the sense that you don't need to give a reason for why you don't want it)
Most students do it though, since those classes are usually a joke (no tests or time consuming assignments) and it's basically a guaranteed full mark course that pumps up a bit your semester average score (pe, music and visual arts are also guaranteed 10, but those are mandatory)
Yeah, Romanian schools have 1 hour per week which parents can opt-out their kids from
It’s the same as Italy, though depending on your luck, if your parents don’t opt you out and you get a nice, indifferent teacher, you can skip the class and only come at the end of the year
Yeah
They do
Idk why they teach it
Perhaps to  teach kids about god
If thats the case,they are kinda failing
In my school we do, and i think almost all of romanian schools do
Because religion is a big part of Romania
I'm not religious but i go to the religion classes
Yes, unfortunately
And it's because the church has a lot of power here, and there's *a lot* of religious parents who would go berserk about religion being removed from schools
The power of the church isn't as in-your-face as in say, Russia, but it's definitely there, in more subtle ways
To give you an idea, the Romanian Orthodox Church ordered a huge mural to be painted over because it depicted St George in some random non-religious context
The mural was in a plaza with the same name, where there is also a church with that name
They deemed it to be offensive to the orthodox Church and blasphemous
Now, the mural was fucking ugly if you ask me, but the point is not my personal taste, but the meaning behind this action
Yes, we don’t know why
Probably so the priest/teachers get some money
They should teach religion history, that would be something else, even useful
They do
And you can choose whether you want to do it or not, (but your mother, grandmother and other relatives will try and shove the religion down your throat if you dont want to anyway)
Same system in Romania as far as I know
I don't approve
Haha here if you debate the teachers they get angry because you don't accept the word of God
At my highschool we mostly went to visit a church and got a 10 for it
The teacher was indeed bonkers and I've argued with them on at least one occassion but we didn't do anything in depth
Priest teachers are aboslutely insane
I had one tell me we shouldn't believe in medicine cus it's just doctors being selfish and wanting your money, so you should give that money to the church
Some other priest asked one of my classmates, who didn't learn her prayer for that day, if the reason she didn't prepare for the lesson was because she was busy s***ing her boyfriend's d. Obviously, nothing happened to him
From what i know religion is optional
Man, in high-school (and I went to an art high school, N. Tonitza) we had a teacher one year who was fucking insane
She was this old witch who did not want to hear anything against God, ever
She made us watch a graphic documentary about why abortion is a sin and we would go to hell if we did it
Most of us were extremely outraged, a girl got a panic attack from seeing upclose videos of dead fetuses
Being the type of high school this is, you can imagine how this went down
We made a scene and went to the principal and she got kicked out, thankfully
But the sheer fact that this crazy old lady was hired baffles me to this day
Our religion teacher tells us in every class that evolution is not real
Fun times
They do teach about history of religion and other big religions, but just in 11th and 12th grade
>It's optional in terms of "everyone is signed up by default but you can opt out of it if your parents sign a huge stack of papers and get to reason with the religion teacher and principal, both of whom will try to advise against dropping out and convince them that they're wrong and the school knows what it's doing".
It's like this in many other European countries, like Italy, Poland, etc
Look around this thread
But you are exaggerating a bit
It is optional in the sense that you only need one paper signed by a parent and no reason or explanation beyond that
Sure, like 10 years or so ago, it was a bit more difficult, but this is history today
In my highschool u sign up for it at the beginning of any year like any other optional subject
Now you have to sign up for it
Exactly
Why are some people exaggerating in order to prove that Romania is bad and is the only one that does these stuff
Your parents sign one paper
No big deal
Might be an isolated case
I graduated almost 5 years ago and all my parents had to do was sign a paper
I took religion though most of the years because that's just another easy maximum grade to add to the overall average
Well, the right to not do the class is assured
I don't deny though that some schools/teachers ignore this right (though nowadays it is rare, since they might lose their job)
It seems to me that the priest is maybe doing this because he is afraid of everyone quiting and losing the extra money from teaching
It is illegal though to force the kids to do it and not accept those papers
Forcing kids who don't have the religion corresponding to the class is even more so
The parents of the children at that school are free to seek a lawyer and sue the school
tell him to watch [eurotrip] in preparation for his trip
Is it not in Spain
We even have this in Romania
Huh
This is a weird habit I have too
I wonder if it has anything to do with interacting with a lot of Germans as a kid and basically growing up on your media
Not all clothes tho, just socks and underwear
Not so much, it just gets strangers to strike up random conversations with me a lot
Cluj Napoca, Iasi, Timișoara something else but not Bucharest listen to me NO BUCHAREST
Brașov - big city, central position, a good example of multiculturality
I would make Romania have 3 capitals
Each for the three historical regions
Bucharest for Wallachia, Iași for Moldova and Cluj-Napoca for Transylvania
Build a new one on the ruins of Sarmizegetusa
It’s the oldest recorded capital we have
Hahah but imagine tourists trying to pronounce Székesfehérvár lmao
Why on Earth would we move our capital to a city even closer to the border like Timisoara or Iasi
From a defensive point of view it would be awful to defend
We would want a city in the center of the country, so something like Brasov would be the best option
Move it to Constanta for the lulz
All of Bucharest seems to move here for the summer anyway so why not make it a permanent move
Look at cities like Berlin, Vienna and Bratislava they are all on the border
It is a nice city actually
That's a cool name then haha
One thing is for sure, if Romania and Hungary changed capitals nobody would ever confuse Bucharest and Budapest again lol which happens a lot
Hahah a former hungarian city have you ever heard of Napoca pr Napocaum
In Alba Iulia are no hungarians
Yeah, so what's your point
Look at Brazil for example
The former capital of Brazil was Rio de Janeiro and it was a coastal city
It was then changed to Brasilia which is in the center of the country
This has a number of advantages, from defensive to administration
It would be therefore more beneficial to have a city like Brasov as our capital rather than say a border city, which could be more developed, but harder to defend and run the country from
Yes, it's still an argument
There's an obvious advantage to having your capital at a considerable distance from the border, as opposed to having it right next to it
If it was at the border it would be in a significantly more dangerous situation, as it would quickly become a war zone and if the enemy takes it, the entire command of the country would be crippled
Why risk it all when you could put your capital in the center of your country from where you could better run it from and also defend it better
Read my reply again
The answer is yes and I explained why
You don't want your capital city to become a warzone and endanger the entire command structure by having it there
Every country it's important in its own way
We are important because of the cheap labor mostly
Also Eu imports our wood, which is good for EU, but not so much for us because the high demand makes som business people from here to cut our forest illegally
Having one of the best internet speed in the world brings a lot of IT companies
We have a port on the Black Sea connecting europe to Middle East and even more meaning that a lot of trade goes through Romania
Not to forget our landscapes, Danube Delta ([second biggest delta in Europe and the best preserved on the continent] ),and so much more
You can watch a documentary on Netflix named [Flavours of Romania] if you're interested in seeing more about Romania
So important that if we would not be in it no other country in EU would notice
Eh, I'm pretty sure there are more than 1 black sheep
I recently watched a video about an incredible underwater tunnel project between Helsinki and Tallinn
It seems some already use the freedom of movement to commute
Please explain how it's EU's battery
It sound extremely intriguing
9th place
In the current system, our guarantee is that we can veto EU decisions on foreign policy
That being the case, I like that we have someone that actually leads us at the moment
The unanimity thing is a double edged sword
On the one hand  it risks blocking EU, as it does on sanctioning Hungry and Poland (we can't take theirs voting rights)
On the other hand, I do believe it helps in assuring small countries that theirs priorities are EU's priorities
I thought you had something like UK's lake-battery (they have two connected lakes that are used to provide energy when demand is high and store it when demand is low)
They are generating electricity, not storing it
When I read battery i thought about storing
The British pump the water back to store it
[There is a great video by Tom Scott about it
Well over here it is free, but not really cus we have to bribe the doctors
It is not uncommon for people to bring wads of cash to the public doctor
The downside, in my opinion, is having all these tax money in governement's hands, trusting it to organize an efficient healthcare system for everybody
If corruption is high, you end up with a weak medical system that eats alot of money and having to also pay for private healthcare, more expensive for you
I still believe "free" healtcare is the way to go, just making sure corruption level in your country is low
Well, in Romania there's this capitalist mentality of squeezing as much money out of you as possible
So when you need to get some analysis done you have 2 options: you go with a note from your primary care physician and get it for free, but in a month or 2 (at worst), OR you pay for it completely out of pocket and get it done right away
This happens because getting back the money from the government (for the medical center that did the analysis) takes some time
You have to submit the paperwork once a month and you get the money back in another month or something like this
So that capital is basically "blocked" for a couple of months
And if you love €€€, you'll prefer "clients" that pay out of pocket and you'll prioritize them
In some situations this can happen with a doctor's visit as well
But it's never been more than a month's wait for me
Ever
In Germany, one issue I noticed is that "people keep going to the doctor". Because most medical things are free if you have a doctors note and insurance, people go to the doctor for anything at any time
So in a small town, for a specialty like gynecology it will be super difficult to find a "free spot". When I arrived in my small German town it took me about 24 phone calls to find a gynecologist that could take me as a patient
And I have a friend that had some dermatological issue and all the dermatologists in our town were booked for the next several months
So she had to go to the next town (20 min by train) for a dermatologist that could see her the next week
So here, in Germany, it's pretty difficult to get an appointment with a specialist in a small town, but not that difficult in a bigger city
And this disadvantage is not that much of a problem, when you have so many other advantages that can help you overcome it
Like in Germany you get 30 days of paid vacation, so if it's a dramatic situation, you can just take a day off and go to another town and then move to a doctor in your city
And the public transportation system is great (compared to Romania) so you can even go to the next town over and come back before lunch
Edit: the "people going to the doctor all the time" was how a German dude explained to me why I can't find a specialist that can see me in a week
Nobody middle class and above uses the public healthcare system bc it’s so shit
At least in Bucharest, most people use private clinics - no waiting times, excellent care, hospital chains all over the city
Or gifts, like expensive wines, flowers, or even food
I'd youre in a big town, like Bucharest, but have a family farm somewhere, doctors will prefer to have some natural eggs and meat from that farm rather than the hormone filled ones you'd find in super markets
Sauce: we did that with my grandpa's oncologist
Even if we already paid for treatments, we brought her foods from his farm
She helped him beat cancer once and live for 5 years more
We have only respect for her
Well my grandfather has a chicken farm in covasna, maybe I could bring down some eggs
It used to be common as putting on shoes, especially in the communist period and it's something that stuck with us
People used to do it to get better treatment, better beds/room and extra attention (especially as the staff was/is not enough to cover all patients)
The problem comes from both medical staff that expect/accept the bribe and the patients (or their family) who give and also insist on giving the bribe
Nowadays less and less are expecting money/gifts, as their income was increased and we had it covered by news, called out on social media and so on (it was always illegal, just overlooked and socially accepted)
A relative of mine, that works in medical care, arrived at work one morning and all the staff was eating apples
It was because the family of a patient couldn't accept the idea of not giving money to them and just came with approx
10 kg of apples and left them there
Heard the apples were really good
Wdym shit
What are you referring to
But ask first
We asked before giving her things like that
This is a good idea if youre accustomed to that doctor and they know you
Considering they'd need special ways to take those home and store them, so if you bring eggs at 10am and rhey leave at 10pm, the eggs may go bad or things like that
Ask first, they'll mostly be happy to receive good food
Heard a story of someone who received a whole live chicken in a bag and had to keep it in the office somehow the whole day
Ah, well
sadly, yeah
Romania is very corrupt and people are always greedy
A lot of doctors are also crazy
health care here isn't great, at least public
Private is worlds apart, but it's also extremely expensive
It's not all bad, just don't get sick
Polish words are like babies invented it
Other languages: “Why can’t you just be normal
Polish: *Czscréamsz
Every European language has it's own lovable quirks
But Hungarian, oh boy
Luxembourgish sounds like a failed fusion of German and French
When Finns speak Finnish it nearly sounds like a robot to me
Hungarian is weird, but I’m Romanian so I only know
“Kurtoskalacs” “Basz meg” and “gyere ide”
What is Basque
Nobody knows
Sometimes Swedish pronouncinations are really weird
(One time someone said Det är -> De-e)
Dutch
It makes NO sense sometimes
I often ask my friends if I said something correctly or not and they are actually unsure sometimes
(Especially with de/het)
It also sounds like the drunken child of german and english
The german counting system really fucked my mind during the first years
Literally every other language: one hundred twenty three
German: one hundred three and twenty
Is there any other european language that does this
(apart from austrian or other german dialects)
I've been living in germany for 7 years now and still can't use the cases correctly lol
We are 90% Latin
I knew Romanian was gonna be in this thread but damn didn't think it would be the second top comment
As someone who learned German (Hochdeutsch) as a second language, I find Swiss German much easier to understand than the gibberish spoken in Bavaria
The north regions are pretty weird too
Hochdeutsch is a hoax
- Hey Romania, are you a latin country
- Da
This is the most accurate description and it makes sense
I think it's due to the low amount of vocals they use
Hahah, you're right
It's like toddler babble before they learn to talk
Imagine learning an entire language,master it like a god to then travel to that country and get slammed in the face with the slang

Ugh,it's so weird
Well "Romanian:the forgotten romance language" doesn't exist for nothing
Two events,and both have to do with USSR and Romania,during and after WW2
The white fountain massacre
1940,a good couple of thousand romanians tried to escape after the soviets annexed Bassarabia
Right before they crossed the now installed border into Romania,soviet border guards caught them and opened fire
Men,women,children,elder,sick
It didn't matter
They shot them and buried them in a mass grave
And it was denied it ever happened untill 30 years ago
You know
To add insult to injury
The other is the russian deportations from Bessarabia into Siberia
That's even more personal for me,because I lost a big part of my family because of those
Long story short,my great-grandmother was deported with her parents and all 6 of her siblings
She was the only one to return
Why were they deported
Because they were rich peasants(not Jeff Bezos rich,they just had land or bred farm animals),who had their wealth because they worked hard for generations
And the fact that they existed was an ideological challenge to the communist party
So them and others in their position were deported
How many
Nobody knows for sure
Most modern estimates place the death toll around 250
000 people dead in the span of 15 years(1940-1955)
Civilians,not combatants
All because they worked their asses off for generations
The fact that me and others lile me who don't know much about these things is somewhere between our fault and the fact that we couldn't learn this information anywhere
Most of the information was either expunged from records when the deportations stopped or was never recorder at all
Add to that the fact that the communist regime in Romania and the soviet regime in Moldavia made it illegal to research this for almost 60 years,and it will be a subject that few know about enough to start research it
As of today,Russia denies either incident happened and that researching the topic will bring nothing but "unnecessary tension between the two states"(in Voronin's words)
The geo-political version gaslighting
Bold of you to assume that I know anything about history
April 1986 - 3
6/10
the 50's were tough for Romania
the regim started a process of geting rid of the "enemies of the state". this is the time in which most of the upper/higher class, intelectuals and thinkers were wipet out , sent to political prisons or forced labour ( from which most did not return), because the commies wanted to create the "new man". This period of time did alot of damage to our future society , we lost our informal leaders and the echoes of this period are stil felt today in the way our society behaves and what kind of values it cherishes
School starts at 8 am, lessons are 50 minutes long, with 10 minute breaks except for the one at 11 am which is a 20 min lunch break
Most days end at around 1 pm or 2 pm, but it's not uncommon to have longer days especially in highschool or if you have an extracurricular activity
Usually each group of students of a certain grade/year (the average school has like 4-5 classes of \~30 students of the same grade) spends the whole day in one room that's assigned to them, and each teacher would go there for their lesson
There are exceptions like chemistry which can be held at the laboratory instead of the usual room, or English where the class is divided in 2 groups and one group might move to a different room
Sometimes classes are divided on certain subjects like third language, for example one kid might study French but his deskmate studies German, therefore language lessons are synced so that each student can go to his lesson of choice
I'm not sure if the afternoon shift still a thing, certain schools have or used to have some students start at 8 am and other students start at 2 pm
I think it was due to the high number of students and not enough rooms, but many people were against this system
Here, it varied from school to school
I can't remember exact numbers, but I think it was similar: 45 or 50 minutes "school hours" with 5 or 10 minutes break
If breaks were just 5 minutes, there usually would have been a "big recess" of 10 or 15 minutes
When I was in high school, the school had enough room for all the students, so we would all start at the same time (8 or 9 AM, I think)
In primary and middle, at a different school, we shared the classroom with another grade, but one would use it in the morning, while the other in the afternoon
(e.g, 1st graders could use it in the morning, from 7:30 AM, 6th graders could use the same room from 1:30 PM)
Wake up at 6:00 cause my school was in the other side of the city from where I lived, freeze to death in an overcrowded bus station (if it's winter), take the bus to a metro station, then take the metro, which is somehow even more overcrowded than the bus, then take another bus, then smoke 3 cigarettes on an empty stomach cause you were too lazy to cook breakfast, start school at 8:00, get bullied and called names by teachers so old they could die any minute, sneak out of school to smoke a cigarette every break (10 minutes after 50 minutes of class), maybe skip the last hour of class and go have brunch, go home, get yelled at by your parents
Fun times
In Romania we have 6-7 hours of school per day:
Classes start at 8 and they last for 50 minutes, and a 10 minute break after
This cycle repeats for the rest of the day
Afternoon classes are very much still a thing
But some start even at 10-11 am
Ill give you the example of my highschool, which is grades 5-12
(CNB George Cosbuc in Bucharest)
Morning shift starts at 7
30 and ends the latest at 13
45 minute class, 5 minute break, two 10 minute breaks every 3 hrs
Afternoon classes start around lunch, but there are exeptions, like some classes starting at 10
Classes end the latest at 18
Same break system
Biology classes are mostly done in the labs, we dont have a chemistry lab, Computer science and Computer tech classes are done in the computer labs
For English, we are divided into 2 groups, one group stays in the class, the other group uses the demi-sol rooms
We also have English/American natives, as we are a bilingual highschool, grade 9 and 10 have two groups, grade 11 and 12 the whole class
Same would happen if the class is split on third language, my class is all German, but the other classes are half n half usually, so they combine with other half n half classes
We have 6 total 'groups' per year, of around 30 people per class
3 "Real" (maths, computer science), 3 "Uman" (literature, writing, language)
Its a strange system in Romania with these, you have set classes you cant choose, unlike USA or Brittish systems
The "profile" you choose dictates what exams you take
For example, "Uman" students  dont take a maths exam, but they have to take geography or history exam
"Real" students have the hardest math exam, along with computer science and computer tech (unless you take the ECDLs, then its the same as getting a perfect on the tech exam)
All profiles take a Romanian Language and Literature exam
Only difference is that Uman peeps have a few extra books to read (which is unfair since Real peeps still have to know 30+ books by heart, but our system is far from good)
> Morning shift starts at 7
30 and ends the latest at 13
45 minute class, 5 minute break, two 10 minute breaks every 3 hrs
Damn bro that's a tight schedule
And super early too
Is this a recent system
Also, regarding your last paragraph, I gotta add that aside from the theoretical-oriented highschool (which has the Real/Math and Uman/Humanities profiles and sometimes a Stiinte/Sciences one too, focused on biology, chemistry etc), there are schools with other profiles available: arts, sports, economics or certain professions/crafts
Yeah, every group of 30 students has a code like "IX C" (grade 9, third group) and a "homebase", a certain classroom where most lessons are held and it's the teachers who move around from classroom to classroom
Some teachers have their own specialized classroom or laboratory, mostly chemistry, physics and biology but also geography or history, and that's when students are moving around
It's not the norm in Romania, but my high school actually did it the same way as yours
No clue why
At first we thought it was just because the teachers were lazy and would rather have us walk around than them, but it still doesn't make sense, cause the teachers have to go to the lounge every break to switch registers (like the notebook they use for every class to keep track of attendance and grades) with the other teachers that would have to teach to the class they just finished teaching to
Again, no idea why they did this
I was quite the heavy smoker in the last few years of high school, so I'm actually quite surprised that every break I managed to switch classes, drop off my stuff at the new class, sneak out of the school grounds (we were not allowed to leave until the day was over), smoke a cigarette, sneak back in and make it to class before the teacher did (otherwise there would be trouble)
Yes, what u/Sector3_Bucuresti said
Interesting about Moldova though
Does this mean that every student has their own different schedule
Is there more freedom to choose which subjects you take
Its tight but we finish really early, and it goes by fast since youre still half asleep in the morning
Its basically the winter program, but we use it all year
Also its not that bad to be this early, i got used to it
Im a lot more active and attentive in the morning, even if im sleepy
The afternoon program just ruins your whole day
You have to leave home at 10-11 am and you get home at 8pm
Whole day, gone
Yes, im sorry i didnt mention the other profiles
I was mostly reffering to Cosbuc, which is purely theoretic with only Filo ans Maths-CS and next year were getting a Sociology and a Natural Sciences class
Anything is better than the afternoon shift
Yes I forgot about the Sociology profile too
There are so many of them lol
Hah, interesting
I don't think they would have trusted us with the registers, knowing my classmates, some grades would suddenly "improve" and some absence marks would suddenly "disappear". We were not allowed to touch those registers
So the same group of people but a different classroom for every lesson
Similar to faculty groups, right
This is interesting, I've never heard of this system at highschool level before
Hehe, the time when the Drawing (Desen) teacher left the classroom for a smoke and left the register (catalog) in there
We didn't touch the grades, as the teachers had them written in their personal notebook as well, but we did some work on the absemces
The army tried to stage a coup against Ceaușescu in 1984, but it failed because the military unit who was supposed to carry out the plan was sent to harvest corn
In 1989, the dictator at the time and his wife got sentenced to death for economic sabotage and genocide
They were both executed by a military firing squad on Christmas Day
Autumn, 1984, masterminded by the general Nicolae Militaru, who would later support Iliescu
It's also in 1984 when the basis of the future FSN was created, it was just called different back then (the Committee of the National Salvation)
Militaru admitted this in a BBC interview in 1994
Also, The 1989 Revolution was supposed to start in Iasi, but was nipped in the bud, then it broke out in Timisoara
It's pretty documented, but not really mainstream knowledge
Do you have any source for that
Burned the shorts or the people
>which is similar in several romance languages (finestra, fenêtre)
Similar in Romanian, but not quite
Here it's "fereastră"
Easiest answer for a Romanian - 1st of May (Labour Day)
But only when the weather doesn't suck
It's almost illegal **not** to have a barbecue either in someone's back yard, or if you're more working class, in the nearby "spot" (meaning near a forest, lake or any open meadow somewhere)
For example where I grew up, it's near [Ceala Forest]
[Here's what the peak of a normal 1 Mai looks like] It truly is massive
Supermarkets will literally *run out of meats* in the morning, on several occasions I had to go to 2-3 before finding what we needed
By noon, city streets will be empty, everyone's settled down somewhere
We usually have [mici and other stuff like sausages and chicken thighs] on the grill
Or [frigărui] if you're not as lazy as most people (including myself)
The day we move to a foreign country
Jokes aside, it’s probably May 1st
On the one hand it’s Labor Day and the grill-loving people have barbecues
On the other hand it marks the beginning of the summer season, so the other folks head over to the seaside (oftentimes for barbecuing, indeed)
It really is an experience
I always say that barbecue is my favorite meal in the world, not only because of the food itself, but because of the atmosphere around it
Some of my fondest memories are barbecue-adjacent
Whether it was Ceala forest with my classmates, day-drinking and popping sunflower seeds, or on 1st of May on a friend's "shack" in the middle of an field
Football, badminton, huge car speakers providing the soundtrack
> Also every year there's an article in the local news outlets that takes a couple of photos of empty streets of cities that look like ghost towns because everyone is barbecuing somewhere
That's better than we get, here *every single year* there's articles about cops giving out fines to dumbasses who start fires on the ground like [this]
But I love that we have this holiday tradition in common with you guys
I really really hope this year it won't rain, because Orthodox Easter is on May 2nd, so we get a 4-day-weekend that includes May 1st
Damn, she really *did* hate the working class, huh
My father is romanian orthodox and celebrates Christmas on the 25th of december
My mother is russian orthodox and celebrates on the 7th of january
Me and my brothers get to have two christmases and not in the depressing way of saying that
Romanian here
24 th of December is the period when you have Christmas carolers coming over and singing all the cool carols
Usually it is the busiest day, things sorted out in the morning all the stress as it is in a way the finishing touches of all the work with food and stuff like that
Present are also given in the evening
The following day it is more relaxed and you spend time with family
I m from the north in monastery central so quite religious area so people go to all the religious celebrations in the night
I don't really
In highschool we used to go caroling with my highschool mates, so we would go to everyone's house and the houses of teachers we liked
And of course get really really drunk and eat a ton of food
Past years after uni, i assist some of the carolers that my mom receives as a teacher and with former classmates go to a certain amount of houses and see if our livers are still competent ( no they are not )
Also winters in the past 20 years have been complete and utter crap in my area
Climate change
Can you find a picture of someone who, if you saw them on the street, you would instantly recognize as your co-national based on their features
Inspired by the [facial features thread] that u/wojic posted
I looked for pictures of men and women until I found the most instantly recognizable pictures
I figured that logically, the easier it is to spot someone who belongs to your nationality, the more "typical" features they have
For women I found this [girl] and for men, I found this [footballer] If I would have seen them on the street, I would not doubt for a second that they're Romanian
That guy you use as an example for Romanian men looks like he's related to me
Try to find someone who you'd be 100% sure is Norwegian
What helped me when I searched (at least for finding the footballer) was entering first names + cities
If you try out combinations of Norwegian name + a Norwegian city you get plenty of pictures of regular people
> As for a face I would instantly recognize as Spanish: here
Wow, amazing example lol
> but every once in a while you do see a face that makes you say "that guy is 100% German for sure"
I get that feeling from [our president] It's normal, he's Saxon, but his facial features are a world apart from your average Romanian
I hope others agree with me lol
My idea of what the "typical" Romanian might be different than that of someone from another place
In the southern part of Romania (Wallachia) you'll sometimes meet people with jet-black hair and that look half-Turkish/half-Romanian, probably from mixing during Ottoman days
It's much rarer that you find the same features in Moldova or in Transylvania
I found an [example here] (although it's very low quality)
Edit: [Much better example]
It's not crazy to say that people from certain regions have more typical facial features
Areas around the Bran Castle, the cities of Brasov, Sibiu and Constanta
Compared to countries in the west we don't get that much tourism, so it's not that bad
I really dislike 'tourist traps'.
The beaches I think, but we have many castles were tourists go too
Went to Galicia, had an amazing time, and not very touristy
Hope it stays that way
Next on my list is the mudejar architecture in Aragon
Which is so completely different from the rest of France
I hate Paris but love the rest of France
Thessaloniki is awesome
Very lively and fun place
I sometimes go to spend the weekend there
There aren't that many tourists outside of the high season
I hope it stays that way so people in the know can enjoy it
Don't skip the museums
They are underrrated
Out of curiosity, is visiting the Hungarian-speaking areas of Transylvania a relatively popular thing to do among Hungary Hungarians
Your loss tbh, Oradea is super close to you guys, it is a wonderful town, and is included in a circuit of Art Noveau cities in Europe
It's really quite nice
Also try Alba Iulia and Bucharest
While I'd love for tourism to develop more, because it brings in money, I actually prefer it this way
I do not want my favorite places in my country constantly swarmed with tourists
Some of the most beautiful, relaxing interesting spots are so because there aren't that many people
I'd argue for the inclusion of Bucharest's Old Town in the list
Constanta sort of of sucks if you want to go the seaside
Imo go to Neptun-Olimp or Vama Veche
Honestly I dislike it, and while there are a lot of tourists in the summer, it's mostly us going there not foreigners
I'd not skip Bucharest it has some top notch museums, and really good night life (Coronavirus not withstanding) Also don't be a tourist and stick to the super touristy Old Town
There are so many more old parts worth visiting
Totally understand you
I really don't get how Venetians tolerate such mass tourism
It's super crowded even in low season
Interesting
On a tangential note, I wonder, does the Transylvanian Hungarian dialect differ much from the Hungarian spoken in Hungary
Are there any linguistic differences
Also, for what it’s worth, I think I understand why most Hungarians opt to visit Transylvania over other areas in Romania
a) compared to other areas in Romania, it’s geographically closer to Hungary
b) visiting areas that have a significant percentage of Hungarian speakers probably feels a lot closer to home than visiting, say, Bucharest
c) Transylvania is architecturally prettier
I imagine that, for the same reasons, visiting Southern Slovakia is probably a lot more popular than visiting Bratislava
Well we know the names, but if you ask to locate them on a map we won't probably know
I definitely recognize all the names
I know some random info about some of them
I could even point out 4-5 of them on the map
But of course I keep confusing cities with states (I though Pennsylvania was a city and Philadelphia a state)
And I have zero idea where the desert ends and where the mountains begin
I also had a conversation earlier this week with my mom and we literally couldn't think of another river in the US except for Mississippi
People here don't know them because they don't really care,as for myself
just don't ask me about capitals
Yeah but it's not taught in school or anything, at least where I'm from
We hear about them in movies, so I'm guessing most are familiar with the names
I for one have a keen interest in the American southwest and know quite a lot about those states
Also know a lot about Florida because I've family there and visit often

Ah, the power of context and, in case of the first word, accents
If Non-Europeans countries count then either Japanese or Korean, those makes Romanian grammar seems simple
French
I hate it
It has some words that have no equivalent in romanian at all
I know 3 languages
English, German (not that good) and Romanian
Out of these, Romanian is the hardest
Romance mixed with slavic plus some dacic origins
Ah yes, don't forget our Turkic, German and Hungarian influences
Second is German, mostly because I have a shit teacher that only comes for 15 minutes out of our 50 weekly minutes
Hungarian, i dont wanna be an asshole, but everytime i hear someone speaking it i just start to laugh
Totally
It's like an alien language
Nothing sounds similar with what you expect
it is a very difficult to learn
Well England was conquered by the normans and they ruled it for a while so English is close to French at some degree
Scotch
Lol
1066 at Hastings, William the Bastard who was norman defeated Harold Godwinson and conquered England
Richard Lionheart for example didnt even speak English and spent very little time in England
>You're forgetting that William invited his Barons from Normandy to settle Britain and impose the feudal system, and that most serfs that served these Barons were still English and spoke Old English which has very little, if any, French influence
First of all, I agree with you that William brought with him his norman nobility and that the peasantry spoke the old English but the nobility spoke Norman which in time evolved to an Anglo-Norman dialect of English
Because of that a lot of words relating to ruling comes from french like government, castle, judge, crown
Also there are words like chamber and room, buy or purchase, shirt or blouse that are synonyms but originate from different languages
You can watch Oversimplified video of the battle of Hastings in which he explains in more detail
>Focus, we're not discussing legendary characters that likely didn't even exist, we're discussing linguistics
Very little correlation between the two
I strongly disagree with this
Richard the Lionheart was a real king, Richard I who ruled England from 1189-1199
He was known as the Lionheart because of his bravery and prowess in battle in the crusades, he is a real character, maybe some stories about him are not entirely true but he was a real person
>On a similar note, do you agree that Romanian is close to Russian to some degree
I mean after all, more of Romanian vocab and phonology is of Slavic origin than English is of French
About this, Romanian has slavic and germanic influences but it is not close to Russian, we have a saying "Romania is a latin island surrounded by a slavic sea". Romanian is closer to latin than to any slavic language because the majority of the fundamental vocabulary, which we use every day, is almost 60% coming from latin
I may be wrong here about the procent but the idea is that the majority comes from latin
Yes
It made the continent safer by diminishing tensions between member states
It also gives my homeland opportunities to develop in many domains by offering us european funds to use (but this depends on whether our politicians want to take them or not)
EU has it’s part
It’s not just schengen and not all european countries are in schengen
Romania is not in schengen but is in EU since 2007, and since then, we don’t really need a passport, just our ID Cards, because of EU
And this makes it much easier to travel
Seems like the appropriate Australian way
We have a tax on magic
Do I need to tell more ?
These are some: -vaccines cause autism
-our German-born President is a Nazi
-We are not accepted into Schengen area because The Netherlands want the port of Constanta
We are having a permit for using magic xD
Although not that popular, in Hungary there are some people who deny the existence of Lake Balaton
Some people believe the revolution was entirely orchestrated by the cia and that they used psychotronic mind control machines to tell people what to do, my former history teacher believed this
Another thing is the idea that the dacians where the ultimate civilisation, people say that they created lasers and invented writing, that the Atlantis was in Transylvania and that they actually taught the romans their culture and language, these people also claim they built huge underground cities populated by giants, an entry to such a city they say is the entirely natural rock formation known as [The Sphinx] which they claim is man made and not shaped by the wind
That the 1989 revolution to overtrow the communist regime was a coup organised by the United States
Also that the mosquito spray that they drop in cities to kill mosquitos and other bugs actually gives you cancer because for some reason the government wants you to get cancer
Also a lot of things regarding the Carphatian mountains
From Aliens to Hidden Nuclear bombs lef there by the Ceausescu Regime
Wait what
I had no idea about this
It's a tax rageted towards gypsy "witches" that can read the future in card or a crystal globe, or heal you or curse somebody you don't like or lift curses(all that kind of bullshit)
There are many superstitious people here that use their services, so the govermant said why not tax it because money is good
Plus: i think that you have to register yourself as a witch, if you don't you can be charged whit tax fraud i think
Plus Plus: they wanted to pass a law that if your prediction din't came true you could face 3-6 mounths in PRISON
I don't think it passed tho
Edit: to make it clear they pay taxes to the state like a normal business
If they get paid 100 lei for a prediction the state gets somthing like 20%(i don't know the percentage)
witches pay 16% income tax
That's all I know about this "magic taxation law".
It is a law sience 2010
No, it's not your fault, only some Romanians try to blame the other European countries for what is going wrong
You learn something new every day
Ministry of Misthyc Affairs
I don't think I've ever used the English wikipedia
I use english wikipedia for almost everything
I use romanian wikipedia when I'm looking for stuff about Romania, like touristic objectives, or when I want to compare the info available or check for translation (though the english-romanian pages aren't properly linked
For example I was looking for brown bear in romanian and the wiki page is "ursul" -simply "the bear", the info was about the bears in romania which are brown bears and when I switched to the english version it was about bears in general, not just brown bears
Also the brown bear english wiki had more information than the "ursul" romanian wiki
I use Romanian Wiki for local stuff or translation (Google translate has no idea most times, but searching something on Romanian wiki and changing to the English article is incredibly good)
Everything else, English Wiki
Once you have a good enough comprehension of English you will gradually stop using your country's media and other things
For me it's the other way around
I find the English one so much more complete
I only use the Romanian one when I need to read something that's Romanian related
It’s normal
The water in cities is usually good despite what some might believe about the one in Bucharest
idk
opinions are mixed in here
I know some people that drink tap water and some who dont
I personally choose bottled water because tap water gives me some pretty bad burning sensations in the stomach
Tap water is not  good everywhere in my country
We don't trust local authorities to give us clean water
Most romanians don't drink tap water
But the tap water is good in most cities
Bucharest, Romania
Level of pollution is through the roof (well higher than usually) caused by multiple things, people burning trash outside the city, residue pond from a pig farm was set ablaze, and other sources of pollution even though traffic is extremely low in the city
The rest of the issues are Corona related and tired of that topic to be honest
- Abandoned houses
Idk if anyone else in my city really cares about them but thay really bother me, they're so ugly and filthy, they make the whole city look worse than it already does
- stray dogs
You can't even go outside at night without fearing a herd if those stinkers
All jokes aside, having a Moldavian accent can disadvantage you if you want to find a job in Bucharest
Mostly, it is rather funny hearing someone speaking with an accent
A stereotype goes like this: "Moldavians are considered lazy and uneducated people or even farmers who can't write
". It is a problem for people who want to move in Transylvania, Muntenia, Dobruja etc
All the dogs are nice during the day, during the night tho
that changes
Well its damned Scandinavia, of course it s shit cold lol
What do you mean by "don't let them use it"?
They will switch the conversations to English, they will turn their backs on me and leave or they will punch me in the face at "hej"?
I've heard of all of them
But a couple of years ago Bydgoszcz, Szczecin, Essen or Wuppertal were unknown to me
Bydgoszcz, Poland was the city for me
Never heard of it before
I'll go look it up right now :) Edit: Don't know a lot about polish cities since I have the most knowledge of this kind from football and they don't have the best teams
Edit 2: Actually it was the only city I hadn't heard of
i know all of them , probable because people know the west Europe cities by default and as i live in east Europe i know eastern Europe as well . Bochum was the first city i don't know where it is exactly .
PS: when i was a kid i used to read geography books so i know Europe by heart , mostly .
[Bydgoszcz] the first and only from that list I never heard of
I'm not sure if I heard of Malaga before
I definitely didn't know about Bochum
Murcia
To my shame, I'd always thought it's a region, not a city
Yesss come, it's good for a roadtrip
Cheap food, cheap hotels, good sights
What more does one need
well Iasi has it's flavour as it's more or less the cultural capital of Romania even if this is probably a big overstatement .My point is Iasi used to most important city in Romania after the capital . But due to lack of development it's not prospering as fast as western part of RO . But you can find a lot of nice sites like palace of culture or the omni-present churches of Romania .(Also it was the capital during the occupation of Bucharest during WW1) .
Galati it's a industrial city , i mean it has it perks , you can go near the Danube , see some architecture but nothing so special to worth coming to visit it from Czechia .
Craiova idk what to say , never been there .But from what i heard it's not the best turist spot in our country
If you want to visit i recomand the monasteries as they are something completely different from what you have seen probably ( a lot of people will recomand cities like Brasov , Sibiu , Oradea , Cluj but they are like the daily middle-age->modern age central european cities) .Or maybe if you like nature you can go to Danube Delta
For car trips Transfagarasan Road it's a must ( Top Gear said it's the best route , probably an overstatement but not by much)
idk about Espoo but i can bet there is a bigger suburb in Paris that isn't counted here even if i might be wrong .
Roughly half of Romania is West of the Carpathians, which is considered Central Europe
Eastern Europe is only from a political point of view, geographically it is quite central, given that Europe goes all the way to Ural and Caucasus
Nah it’s like the sound of a whip
What is written is exactly what you read, it's a phonetic language
It seems most people can't understand that
Also, you'll be annoying if you will keep repeating the subject in the sentence
In Romanian, you don't need a subject for the sentence to be grammatically correct
If you keep saying "I" and "You" you'll only annoy people
We say "raining" instead of "it's raining" because nobody **is** raining, it just is
If you get these you'll be mostly fine
The order of words can be easily changed, it's not a big deal
You can say both "big sea" and "sea big", it sounds different and you may imply something different, but people will be understanding
Don't trust a Romanian man to tell you the real words for example Hello = Salut they might replace Salut with dick head or many other obscene words :3
We dont really use pronouns like I or You (Eu and voi)
Never pronounce the I at the end of a word
It's quite easy to learn the basics (especially the reading part), don't worry for the complicated grammar, others can understand you even without mastering it
And please, try to firstly learn how to pronounce ă, î/â, ș and ț.
Hello nu insemna Sug pula
Eu asa am inteles
I hate that so much
[Pro-drop language]
Actually Romanian still has five of the  cases  "nominativ", "acuzativ", "genitiv","dativ", "vocativ".  And depsite having those the language still has plenty of rule exceptions
We also use a lot of contractions, even in formal writing,  as some of them became the norm
Despite this using the non contracted form is just not a custom, but it's not grammatically incorrect
Mare mare sau mare mare tot aia e :)
Pai normal ca asta inseamna
Oh boi :3
Oh, i didnt knew about that, thanks
A ok credeam ca am inteles gresit
We all use the metric system
Unlike somebody out to the west ._. ^I ^never ^get ^Fahrenheit
Well yes I get that but not even Fahrenheit
It scares me ;-;
When you yawn "put your hand at your mouth or you are gonna swallow me"
When you ask what we are going to eat and the food is not ready "roasted patience"
When you forget the door open "do you have the house on a slope
/do you have a rock at your entrance
When you dropped something on the floor "it's down cause I looked up and it wasn't there"
When you hit your pinkie toe into the table "God is up and is watching all of us" (this happened literally 1 minute ago in reverse,feeling great)
When someone's crying : Stop pissing your eyes;
When youre drinking too much water : Youre gonna have frogs in your stomach;
When you forgot the door open : Is your house on the side of the hill
Some funny phrases utilised by Romanian mothers:
If you get hit "That's going to be ok  until you get married
If you have a powerful headache "Cineva te-a deochiat"(which means that you were admired by someone, expression which I have never supported)
If you don't salute "Hello, hat, cause the master does not have mouth"
If you forget the light on" Your mother doesn't work at Enel" (Enel is the company for electric current)
If you forget what you want to say" That's means that it wasn't important"
If you did something idiotic "That doesn't matter, you're my kid all the time, even if you're idiot"
If you get out in the city with a girl, the first question of your mother will probably be "Did you kiss her
"( So cringe)
When standing in front of the tv: Have you eaten glass
When not closing the door: Don't you have a door at your home
When not eating enough: Eat more, look at how skinny you are
When you leave the door and the window open or god forbid TWO WINDOWS OPEN: Do you want to make us all sick
HUH
Our mothers tend to be ironic
Also:
When you walk barefoot on cold tiles: "Put socks/slippers on or your stomach will catch a cold
When you leave both a window and a door opened or, God forbid, two windows opened at the same time: "Close the window or else "te trage curentul" (also a way of saying you'll catch some cold)
If you cry: "Do you want me to hit you to give you a reason to cry
If you have a stomach bug or any kind of ache: "Drink some pălincă "and it goes away"."
If you tell her you're bored: "Grab your behind with your hands and jump
If you do something really, really bad: "I made you, so I'll be the one who'll kill you
I literally never heard #4
In Transylvania we have a lot like:
When you don't finish eating everything on your plate: _"The only reason you're not finishing your food is because you don't want to do the dishes
Whenever you yawn: _"Put your hand on your mouth,  you nearly swallowed me"_
Whenever you're standing in front of the TV my mom would say: _" Look who just got out of the glass fabric and thinks he's transparent"_
Whenever you try to make a point against her: _"You'll understand  once you have kids"_
And one from my dad, when my mom left the window open for too long: _"Honey I think the neighbors have their own heating too_"
For us is: "Am I speaking in Russian
/Am I speaking to the Turks
We also use the chinese one
And i thought this was a romanian thing
You can't say no to Nana
you just can't
The sugar one is amazing, never heard of it before
I do not understand the lift one
Is that a common occurrence in Belarus
People born in lifts
Oh yeah,the crying one is pure Romanian,forgot about that one
Also when you have an ache: "It will go off by the time you' ll marry
Also if you stand in front of the television while they’re trying to watch something: “Do you work at the glass factory
As in your house is tilted and the door is hanging
Yep ..that's exactly what it is . Especially old women are crazy about it
Oh yeah
Or "Did you eat crushed glass
> Gaia
In Romanian culture Gaia is diurnal bird of prey and when children misbehave parents will tell them "Lua-te-ar Gaia" or  "Vine Gaia si te ia" ("May Gaia take you" respectively "The Gaia will come and take you)
We also have the expressions "Se tine de tine ca gaia" ("He/she follows you like a gaia") when talking about a person that you cannot get rid of, or "M-a luat gaia" - "The gaia took me"/"I fucked up".
We banned Mickey Mouse in 1935 because they said it terrorized children (not in use today)
We banned scrabble in 1980 because our dictator thought it was “overly intellectual” and “a subversive evil
” (not in use today)
I can't think of any weird laws that are still in use sorry
If grandma gives you food, it's mandatory to eat it
It's not official law but everybody knows it
In 1935 Mickey Mouse cartoons were banned in Romania because they were so badly drawn they scared children who watched them
Well of course a dictatorship is gonna be scared of smart people, poor dumb people are a hell lot easier to manipulate and keep under control
Well ours preferred us dumb because no smart person would ever side with that dumbass (his wife had like 4 classes, but called herself a "teacher to the romanians", held a big position in the parliament, basically collected faked college diplomas from every place in the world they visited, claimed that "she had a phd in chemistry", all "her scientific papers" were written by other people and a lot more + he wasn't much better, he had like 4 classes too I think, when he went hunting he had other people shoot the prey because he couldn't event do that, he thought a poem roasting the shit out of him was actually praising him and showed it to the whole country, thought that paying back government debt was like paying debt back to a friend and, also, much more) I'm glad they were killed, people like them don't deserve to live
ai mei tot sunt de parere ca ceausescu a fost ultimul cel mai bun conducator al romaniei,aceleasi argumente: 'eram cea mai bogata tara' si 'nu iti era frica sa umbli pe strazi noaptea'.
Da, sunt multe persoane mai batrane care inca cred chestiile astea din pacate
Acum poate ar trebui sa-i intelegem si noi ca asa au fost crescuti sa creada, dar e periculos daca isi cresc si ei copii cu aceleasi opinii ca, doamne fereste, ne trezim ca de maine in 5 ani o sa protesteze reintoarcerea comunismului in loc de coronavirus =))))
Sper ca tu nu ai cazut in capcana asta totusi, exista multe dovezi care ne arata ca era doar un prost, nimic mai mult
El incepuse sa contruiasca Palatul Poporului de azi pentru cand o sa-l vizteze regina Elizabeta a Angliei, da' la saraca femeie ii era sila de el
Cand au fost Ceausescu cu Elena in vizita la palat regina s-a si ascuns a doua zi de ei cand ea isi plimba cainii in gradina doar ca sa nu trebuiasca sa mai aiba o conversatie cu ei si faptul ca a primit un telefon de la presedintele franteti sa-i zica sa inchida toate bijuteriile si lucrurile de valoare pe care nu le vrea disparute cand vin ei pentru ca pe el l-au furat nu le-a ajutat imaginea
wow,dintre ce povesteau ai mei intelesem ca el avea o imagine destul de buna in afara
sincer sa fiu cand eram mai mic ma convinsesera ca a fost un conducator bun,ma bucur totusi ca am reusit macar de unul singur sa invat ca nu a fost chiar asa
Yes, apart from some groups of letters, every word its spelled as it sounds
For the most part
Recent loan words are usually pronounced and spelled as in their original language
E.g. laptop, pizza
Among older words, I can think of "kilo", which if you never saw written, you may write it "chilo".
Romanian too
I sometimes say the word slowly out loud if I ever get confused about how to write it
This is how children are taught to write
They learn the letters and the sounds they represent and then "here you go, Timmy, say the word and then write it".
In romanian it's almostf 100% phonetical,except for a few words such as "eu" which is pronounced as "ieu", "este-ieste",  "ea-ia", "ele-iele"
Same for Romanian
We have a few exceptions, but other than that you spell it how you hear it
>French is a nightmare for that
As someone that struggled to learn French, it warms my heart to see French people acknowledge that it isn't an easy language
The throne (tronul)
The library [Romania]
I always ask them to pronounce "Oaia aia e a ei
O iau eu". These are 2 valid sentences in Romanian, they mean "That sheep is hers
I will take it". But, as you can see, there are only vowels so it does sound like someone is having a stroke
Anything with â (phonetically  /ɨ/, if that helps)
Native English speakers look like they're choking when they're trying to do that
It also hurts their throat so it's funny
But for people from other countries I go for "oaie" (sheep) cuz it's a lot of vowels and it confuses people
Also words with triphtongs (3 vowels into one syllable) like "leoaica" (lioness)
Or I try to get them to say "copi", "copii" and "copiii" (copies, children, the children)
It's not difficult, it's just funny cuz the people tend to fuck up the first one, which is also the easiest
None,we have like 5 foreigners that speak Romanian
A classic romanian tongue-twister is "Capra crapă piatra-n patru". It means the goat cracks the rock in four (pieces)
> sorry to any Romanians here if the spelling makes your eyes bleed
It doesn't have a correct spelling because the words are made up for the song
Frate/fra - brother/bro
Coaie - literally means testicles lol
Definitely have more, these are the most common ones in Bucharest
In Romania we call eachother testicles (coaie), it's not offensive whatsoever between friends, but I'd never call my mom or older people that
"Frate" and "fra" are also some common modalities to address to your friends
That could be something specific for latin languages
:)))
In Romania we use fra too, short for frate (brother)
Frate is another common one to use
Some people use a more vulgar one coaie meaning balls
Hmmm
well "frate" , "coaie" , "ba
(usually continues with smth or not)"
Yes
Frate is the Romanian word for brother
However, since we have a lot of Italian influences, fratello became a thing in the past (maybe) 20 years
Til that fratello comes from italy, i always tought it is the gipsy version of "frate".
According to Romanian folklore, Armenia is home to dragons which can produce precious stones from their saliva
Romania hates a lot turky because their empire tried to conquest the for 800 years
In Romania, besides the normal New Year fireworks, there's the Sumedru Fire (  - sorry, on mobile, I can't format the message properly
The problem is that some fuckers also put car tyres on the fire
They don't do it in cities, but the rubber smoke smell is felt in the middle of Bucharest
Between January 2018 and November 2019 our prime minister was basically a Karen that could barely speak the language
Although nobody admited it, she was basically a puppet for the leader of the Social Democrat Party, who could not be prime minister since he was accused of corruption in an on-going process
She was previously a member of the EU parliament but before that she was a teacher in some village
[she was not very good at maths either]
Hungarian king Luis II drowned in a creek after losing the battle of Mohács
Let's not forget the Finnish soldier who overdosed on meth and skied 400km
I already knew about this , but I tought that there were only 4 , not 14
yup, the same happened to us lmao
I remember when she went to Montenegro,she confused the capital Podgorica with Prishtina
Also the way she said 2020 was hilarious
[Neither at English]
"Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ? Yeah this Carol guy looks legit , let's just put him on throne"
Or when she was asked what the area of the circle is, that was pretty awkward, or when she went to the US amd was literally ignored by everyone
Well we did not really have any ridiculous moments in our history before 1989, so I thought I would include something interesting that happened in the last 30 years, since there is enough to write about  :)))
Yes , she did xD
I haven't heard about his until now
Care to share some info
The circle one was a good piece of comedy
Didn't know she went to the US tho since I don't watch the news often lol
It was barely covered by TV outlets because it was painful :)))
I read about it online
"Dracula"( Vlad the Impaler ) was never imprisioned in Dracula's castle ( Bran Castle ) is just a thing to attract tourists, he was imprisoned in Buda (Budapest
Don't know if you did know , but we have a cemetery called ["The merry cemetery"]
It is famous for its brightly colored tombstones with naïve paintings describing, in an original and poetic manner, the people who are buried there in addition to scenes from their lives
The Merry Cemetery became an open-air museum and a national tourist attraction
Here's an epitaph in English :
Under this heavy cross
Lies my poor mother-in-law
Three more days should she have lived
I would lie, and she would read (this cross)
You, who here are passing by
Not to wake her up please try
Cause' if she comes back home
She'll scold me more
But I will surely behave
So she'll not return from grave
Stay here, my dear mother in-law
Most history books will tell you the Romanian people are a mix of Roman colonists and Dacian local people of old
That's probably right – but when you look up the reason why the Romans occupied Dacia, you generally learn the Romans were expansionist and they wanted the Dacian gold
In truth, they ended up occupying Dacia because the Dacians kept pillaging territories in the Roman empire (in today's Bulgaria)
Who does that
That's a really intresting fun fact, thank you for sharing it
Czechoslovak Legion
More like Chadoslovak Legion
There are coffee plantations in the Canary Islands as well
I visited both a tea plantation in the Azores and a coffee one in the Canary Islands and I have very nice memories from both
I know that thing, but i didn't want to explain at questions like "where is buda" "it was a prison or a city"
And things like that, so i said Budapest instead
I suggest to go instead of Brasov to Rasnov and Sighisoara
Brasov is an intresting and beautiful city but i am in love with Sighisoara bcs is the only medieval fortress/city who is still lived in this part of Europe, i think it would be nice to walk on the norrowest streats in Romania just like in Medieval era and to see the walls still surrounding the city
Brasov is an amazing city and i suggest it for its medieval style and arhitecture and Rasnov is a old fortress which was built by the Teutonic Knights
Also Rasnov is only 20 km from Brasov and Sighisoara is like 100km further you can see this site if you want to go to this places and rent a hotel room [Trivago
ro]
That's interesting and you are right , I didn't knew it
I don't think we have or I don't saw anything like that here in Romania
We have but there is just one troop for both boys and girls, i'm new in the troop so I don't know everything but it's cool
They organise camps and I heard everyone talking about a really important one in Arad where most of the scouts make the promise because in this camp there's a day-long hike
But it's cool
In Romania there are lots of forteresses called  'castre'(singular:'castru') and they are not in very good condition since,you know,2000 years ago,but they are there
And you can visit many of them as museums
There's too many to count, but the one I find most interesting is this one:
The foot of the bridge on our side of the river can be visited, along with what remains of the Roman town and garrison that was meant to guard it
They are found in the city of Drobeta-Turnu Severin
It was a marvel of Roman engineering
There is a scale replica to be seen in the city's center, very nicely done, I think it's quite new
Romania has the ruins of [Colonia Ulpia Traiana Augusta Dacica Sarmizegetusa] I think the biggest reason people don’t know about it is because of the name
In Romania a lot of them are in poor condition
Mainly because the peasants "borrowed" materials from them
But it's also because nobody gives a shit about them
One of the pillars from the bridge that went over Danubius is in the poorest shape ever
Even the walls that are supposed to protect it are cracked
While in Bulgaria,it's so preserved that you can mistake it's age
Don't believe me
Our history teacher told us that when building 2 supermarkets they found a Roman burial ground
You know what they did
They buried it back and built the supermarkets
While in Bulgaria,which is supposed to have a worse economy,they built glass domes to protect the ruins
This thing happened after the 2000
The supermarkets are still there
That’s not a ruin though
It’s still a functional building, just like how the Pantheon of Rome is not a ruin because it was never abandoned
Amazing that those buildings are almost 2000 years
[Current one] and a few from [this] and [this] playlist
Spotify must be really confused when I slide in System of a Down or Rammstein in between
Well
Manele here are associated with the Roma community and you know how Roma people are seen around these parts
But fuck that I will get down to [this ]   like there's no tomorrow
Omg my girlfriends and I were obsessed with that dude as teens
AHAHAHHA I was so hoping someone from Scotland would link that song
That's a good fkin song tho, no guilt there
100% listen to it on a monthly basis
It's more like a joke now but
"If you can fix it with wire it's a pity to use screws'
If it rains, something will get wet
On anything else, there's always someone who disagrees
Not really
It's just that most people that are unable to get a job (or too lazy to do it) go start begging in Western Europe, so people think we are all like that
The bigger cities in Romania (e.g. Bucharest, Cluj, Iasi, Constanta) are pretty much first world cities, and the others are pretty communist-influenced, but still on the right path and not as underdeveloped as most western people think
Yep, this entirely
And there are places like some villages where people live in the old ways, thought those are rare
Most villages have Internet now from what I know, but I live in the field area, I don't know how mountain areas are
It ever happened to you to speak few minutes with someone in English to find out they are actually from your country
Idk about you but I can spot a Romanian talking English from the first sentence
A few times on the internet
IRL it happens sometimes in Greece or Bulgaria when the waiter know Romanian but they were not from Romania
LOL yes
I once called customer support for a problem I had with the warranty of a device
The agent introduced herself, the name sounded really Romanian, I didn't think of if initially and initiated the conversation in English, then after a few lines I asked her if she's Romanian, she said yes; and that she worked for a callcenter in Greece that offered customer support for Apple in SE Europe
Posted this one before:
>I was living in China
While I was paying my rent another white guy walked in and was trying to settle an issue with the building administrator
I helped him as much as I could in my broken Chinese
Between the broken chinese of 2 white guys and the broken english of the building administrator we managed to settle the issue
After that I chatted with the other white guy in english about what are the best chinese translation apps
Before I left I asked him where he's from
Romania
Romania
Romania
Romania too
Cue laughter (in romanian)
What about an online conversation
Let me guess,you are working as a spy
Months or years,wow
Plot twist,he was just a drunk English man who touched that level of drunkenness where you know all the languages from the world and you can read someone thoughts,so you know in what language to speak with them cause you hear in what language they are thinking
by their profile picture
No, because packages aren't left on the porch
If you're not at home they take it to the post office and leave you a note with which to pick it up
UK here
Depends on where you live in town to be honest
I lived in a place where I wouldn't dare have a package delivered if I were not at home some years ago
Where I live now, I order shit when I'm on a two week holiday away
Delivery man leaves it by the door and that's where it grows cobwebs till I'm back
Or If I'm away for too long one of my neighbours would take it into their home and hand it over when I'm back
I do the same for my neighbours
Chișinău maybe
Ploiești, Romania
Probably Târgoviște, apart from the small tower of the old city,  it’s only 5 to 10 story “communist flats” which are bland gray flats designed to as many people as possible
The town itself is very polluted with trash everywhere
My mother says: Warsaw
Alternatively, Bratislava
It's hard to call it bland or boring though
Bucharest is anything but bland boring or souless
You could call it ugly, eclectic or messy but it's a city that never sleeps and there's always something happening
Sorry you had bad weather
We have a lot of words that change meaning because of a misplaced letter, but they're not exactly common
You won't hear anyone talk about them on a daily basis because these are extremely formal words that belong in a specific type of vocabulary
However, we have some pair of words that people always get wrong and they stir a lot of confusion
- literar = referring to literature, literary
- literal = basically spelling a word
- reflexie = your reflection in a body of water, for example
- reflecție = a meditative state where you think about your life or problems idk
These meanings aren't as shocking as those in another languages, but people still can't tell them apart to this day
In Moldova I hear people mixing up these:
* orar (schedule or timetable)
* oral (same as English, both meanings: "in speaking out loud" like an oral exam and "with the mouth")
But I want to point out that we have what seems like an unusually large number of homonyms:
* copíi = children, but cópii = copies
* masă = "mass" (in kilograms), but also "table"
* sare = "salt", but also "he/she jumps"
Pray tell then, what's a homonym
Hint:
Definition of homonym
1 grammar : homophone: the homonyms there and their
2 grammar : homograph: The words lead, as in the metal, and lead, as in the verb, are homonyms

Conclusion: all of the above actually fall under the definition of homonym
Edit: also, stop being a pedant
the students with good grades go to uni for free here (covered by the state)
most people fall in this category
you need to pay a tax if you either:
-go to a private uni
-dont get on the state covered spaces
to those the cost varies from about 600€ to 800€ a year
it's pretty good I'd say
Most state owned universities have a set amount of no pay spots available
Out if everyone applying, the top students are chosen to fill those in
If you need a place to live, if I'm not wrong, there are some unis with the rent equivalent to around $10/month, but you need to share the room and conditions aren't the best in general
i assume this is only for Danish citizens
i think so, though you should google it to be sure
Fruit and vegetables are very cheap during the season, it can be as little as 15 €cents for a kilo
In general food is quite cheap in South-Eastern Europe
Edit: Depending on the operator, with 3-8€ you have unlimited mobile data, messages and minutes
Internet
Fixed broadband - 8€  for 1Gbps
Mobile data - 2€ for 50GB
Everything
humans are cheaper here
Internet
Good food
Lots of stuff if you know how to look for it
Lots of software that shouldn't be free, but it is
At least we have these
~~Also in romania that's the case
I personally do not have unlimited data, but at least 100gb of 4g traffic every month for 6 euros~~
&#x200B;
Wrong thread
Also in romania that's the case
I personally do not have unlimited data, but at least 100gb of 4g traffic every month for 6 euros
I have unlimited mobile data for 5€.
In what country exactly
I definetly want to know where this is happening
More like 18€ for the fastest one (Fiberlink 1000 from Digi,corect me it i’m wrong)
Food is cheaper and better in Germany
So how much does a good pizza cost
Why
Edit: I ask because I have friends who visit Switzerland specifically to buy laptops or other electronics
They say it's cheaper even when you factor in the travel
God damn that's terrible
I'm on a monthly subscription and I pay 10€ for 6gb
There's been a lot of random offers so got now I have around 100gb though
My boyfriend who's on a prepaid sim has a way better deal, 4€ for over 60-100gb
I have "unlimited data" (but actually limited to 50gb in 4G) with Digi for 2€
Why would you say that
Isn't the average salary/living standard the same as in Romania
It feels like the food in Romania is better quality than in western europe
They are called eurocents so I improvised an abbreviation
As of [here] it's 40 lei  ≈  8
People keep saying this but whenever I go to a store in a german city the food is expensive and bad
If you are talking about the locally farmed fruits/veggies, then I agree
But imported food, not so much
What store
I have tested Kaufland and a few smaller ones like netto
Oh, I see the prices are the same in Romania
A pizza is also between 4-6€ in a good but common restaurant which is not located in one of the big cities
This sounds terrible
I personally have been to Bulgaria and everything seemed reasonably priced, perhaps just a little more expensive
I hope just a few doctors quitted and that the situation can be managed
Netto is especially terrible
You can't even find a good non-sweetened yogurt in most of them
You have no idea what you are talking about apparently
Yes, if I am inside
Yes, but when I'm inside
They are great in Minecraft, but not that safe/convenient irl
I love the sound of thunder, if that's what ya mean lol
Nah
I dont
I hate them always make the ground so wet
I live in countryside and its annoing
No doubt in that
They're even worst in BOTW
Don’t know if it was mentioned already but roumanian has this thing:
untdelemn = butter of wood(it is an old name for sunflower oil)
More like an expression: Am futut o câcare din-aia urâtă = *literally* I have fucked a shit of that ugly = I took a massive shit
You also have ‘handshoes’ for gloves

Salut, numele meu este Ioan,  este o plăcere să te cunosc
De unde ești
Hi, name mine is John, is a pleasure to you meet
From where are
Buna ziua,numele meu este Radu și va urez o zi buna și sanatate tuturor
Good day name my is Radu and i wish one day good and health all
Buna, ma cheama John
Incantat de cunostinta
De unde vii
Good, John’s calling me
Delighted by meeting
From where coming
(I specifically picked the most stupid yet correct translations)
Bună, numele meu este Ion, este o plăcere să te cunosc
De unde ești
Salut ma numesc Ionuț, este o placere sa te întâlnesc
De unde ești
HI my name John, it is pleasure to you meet, where from you
Salut
Numele meu este Ion,îmi face plăcere să te cunosc
De unde vi
Hello
The name mine is Ion,it makes me pleasure to meet
From where come
Edit:In Romanian,we also use "mă cheamă",simillar to italian
Well, if I don't care about your feelings, I can say that "it hurts in my dick".
you can also : ma cheama Ioan-they call me Ioan
Should be name my*
You didn't translate every word literally
Vă = unto you (pl
) - hard to translate, English doesn't have the dative case
Tuturor = all (there is no "to" in the Romanian sentence)
It should be "myself call John", since the pronoun is omitted and the word order is different
>ma cheama Ioan-they call me Ioan
There's no "they" in the sentence
It's "myself called Ioan"
Thank you
I tried to keep the words 1-1                                                                                                              Edit:Thanks
Yea it's a pain to translate it literally into English because some cases simply don't exist and it's really hard for me to even explain them to English speakers
Humans
They are numerous, known to prey on other animals like boars, bears, and are far more damaging to the environment than any other pest
There’s a saying: Romania is a fine place, too bad it’s populated
The brown bear, by force
By sheer agressiveness, probably the boar
Ocelots loves to play with snakes, but the three types of snakes: naked, solid and liquid are proven to be stronger
I am quite surprised that you have adders in Denmark, here in Romania they are kind of associated with warmer places, as far as I know you only have to really think about them in places like southern facing low sub-mountaneous rocky spots
tho I guess your winters might be somewhat milder
Edit: Nevermind me, I'm stupid, I was thinking about the horned viper which is much more dangerous
Adders seem to go way up north
Yeah, I looked it up afterwards, and realised I was thinking about a different thing
We have both adders (according to Wikipedia everywhere in Romania) and horned vipers(more in Southern and Western Romania) and I think many of us forget they are different species, especially since there is a lot more "hype" shall we say about horned vipers as they are much more likely to kill you
Thinking about it tho, I do remember my dad telling me when I was maybe 10 years old that adders are nowhere near as dangerous but should be avoided too
TIL they formed EU to keep the invasion numbers low
Well in Romania the head of the government is called the Prime Minister (now Ludovic Orban), he is the one the communicates with the every other part of the state as the representative of the government
He is named by the President (now Klaus Iohannis) after consulting with the party that holds the majority in the goverment if it exists else  with every party in the government
The President has the power to accept or reject laws proposed by the government, in addition, he representes the countries intrestes abroad, is tasked with upholding the constitution, and he is also in charge of the military
Counter-question: is it common to own a flag (of whatever) in the EU
There's an Europe Day
And they fly flags
First I've heard of it
I guess at least in my area they don't to it
When I was a kid, I remember looots of people would fly flags on National Day (like literally every window)
Recently though, when you see one it stands out, because it's rare
But again, this is mostly about what I see in my town/area
I'm not sure about the rest of the country
Tbf I know about this just because we always had an assignment at English and French classes in school about Europe
I think the EU flag is anyway on almost all public buildings next to the Romanian one, so I don't know if anything special happens tomorrow
Ooopsie
I had no idea there was an Europe Day and definitely didn't know about flying the flag
I have no idea if people do it here tbh I never noticed
There are definitely EU flags on public buildings along with the local flag tho, but that's all the time

Whoever's running the Swiss and Norwegian government would probably do wonders for us
Merkel for Johannis (our president is German so it would be a German exchange)
Mostly because she's an engineer (I think, in any case she has some higher education) and right now in Ro there is this wave of anti intellectualism
And I hate it
I doubt it would change or help things
But I just wish we would have educated people in power
And not the kind of education where they paid x money for the diploma

Take our Orban

I love how you can make an entire sentence sound either latin or slavic
We got a phrase made up of only vowels:
Oaia aia e a ei
(that sheep is hers)
And I think in check there is a phrase made only of consonants
Edit: Czech
i love the swear words, one of my favourites is "go back into your mum's coochie"
We can curse about everything i mean we have a lot of curses and is easy for everyone to be original when they curse
A lot of compatriots hate it, but I like how much we use diminutives, they're absolutely everywhere, I think they're funny, heartwarming, sometimes over-used and condescending, but I still like that we have them
It's so common that not only people use them without realizing it (even the ones who hate the usage of diminutives), but in some instance the diminutive is used exclusively
For example egg white is "albuș de ou", where "albuș" is the diminutive form of "alb" (white), but no one says "alb de ou", it doesn't exist in the language
Or like, "grădiniţă (de copii)" = kindergarten which is the diminutive of "grădină" (garden), but no one says "grădină de copii".
Same for furculiţă (fork), lănţişor cu cruciuliţă (necklace with a cross), minciunele (little lies, it's a [desert] cuişoare (cloves, literal translated to "little nails"), scorţişoară (cinnamon, comes from the word "scoarță" = (tree) bark), şerveţele (napkins), periuţă de dinţi (small brush for the teeth/toothbrush), pufuleţi (corn puffs, small puffs)
We do that to names as well: Maria, Mărioara; Ion, Ionel, Ionică, Ioniță; Angela, Angelica; Marin, Marinel; Gherghe, Gheorghiță.
I'm from Romania and we speak Romanian (Română) here
What I like about this language:
-its musicality
Romanian has a great deal of musicality and it is very easy to write poetry in it, because of this
We can easily make rhymes that sound really good in a poem
Also, the Romanian music sounds really good, even for a stranger
You probably know the "Numa Numa" song
That song is in Romanian and it's really catchy
-the cussing words
Romanians have some inovative ideas when it comes to cussing
That's why you'll hear a Romanian say : "f*ck your mother's onion", "you are so dumb that you smell" or "f*ck your mother's cookie". I know this sounds terrible in English, but trust me, in Romanian has a lot of sense and every word can be connected with cussing
-the dialects
Romanian has some dialects that sound really pretty and I love them
-the way it reassembles Turkish and Russian at the same time
I speak a bit of Turkish and some Russian and I've realized that it is very easy for a Romanian to learn the both of them, because this language, even if it is a Latin one, has some Russian and Turkish influences
Some of our most complicated words to pronounce (especially for foreigners) are the number between 11-19
Words that, if you were to learn the language, would be used very often
They're so long that even we have short, casual words for them
In fact, optsprezece (18) is the word in the Romanian language with the most consecutive consonants
I don't get why we made them so complicated
Not interesting but rather useful is the Latin root which helps a native Romanian to learn easier romance languages
On the fun side, we are super inventive (and as a side bad side effect grose) when cussing
And I’m not speaking about adding a single word like f*ck in front of substantives, but rather developing entire processes and adding random stuff to the cuss words
I love our cuss words/sentences
We have a cuss for almost every possible word
You meant Czech, right
It doesn't have to stop there though
Oaia aia e a ei, eu i-o iau
(that sheep is hers, I'm taking it away from her)
Baba dăruieste hrană viteazului războinic
- only words with slavic origins
It means: The old woman gifts food to the brave warrior
Lol, yeah :P
Bătrâna oferă mâncare curajosului cavaler
This is the same sentence written only in words of latin origin
Fascinating indeed
razboinic=/=cavaler
But it's close enough
Croatia has an awful lot of words for which I found some interesting coincidences in Romania
For example I remember that the word for boulevard (or highway) was something along the lines of “cale larga”. That means “wide path” in Romanian
The accent in the eastern part of the country sounds very slavic so they can do it with almost any sentence, regardless of word origin
The south of the country has a lot of turkic influences
From accent to food and to some extent culture
They have a way of talking which to a non-speaker would sound almost like a turk faking an accent
The western part has Hungarian and German influences
This can be seen again in the language, food and culture
Disclaimer: the cultural differences are very small, and are a result of the 3 regions being ruled by various empires throughout history
You could use "luptător" instead of "cavaler"
the words are synonyms of one another and they can all be used in everyday speech interchangeably
Well kinda
Cavaler=knight, but it comes from cavalerie
So in a way cavaler=cavarly but cavarly=/=cavaler
[Aspic (Piftie or Răcitură)]
[Porc drum ]
Back in the day, at the begining of December, rural families would sacrifice a pig and since there were tying times they would try to use up every piece of that pig
So you can imagen that there are all sorts of tasty recipies
For Aspic they use some of the meat but most importantly pig’s feet that when boiled they create a lot of gelatin, which causes the dish to thicken like a jello when cold
For Pork drum it’s basically a mixture of selected pork parts such as meat with some fat on, liver, tongue and rind, in aspic with spices and garlic
It’s normally cooked using pork stomach as casing (thoroughly cleaned and boiled)
I find them both very tasty and I think that at least Aspic is present in a lot of other Balkan countries as well
But I think people find them disgusting because of how they look and the ingredients but I advice everyone to at least try them
At Easter traditionally we slaughter a lamb and you make all sorts of food from all parts of the lamb
You have lamb steak, there's a sort of mince meat dish from the organs
all good so far
But one of my grandmas used to make also a lamb soup which contained the lamb's head
The whole head
With the eyes and the tongue and everything
Which my grandpa used to eat with a lot of delight
I still retch when I remember him eating the eyes
I find anything meat related kinda gross and I can barely eat chicken and pig
And tuna for fish
But only canned
So I find pretty much anything animal related gross, but if I had to choose one that's eaten in my country it would be "ciorba de burta" which is tripe soup
My mother tried to feed me that lots of times and I tried it once and never again no matter how angry she got
It's fuckin disgusting
Just the sight of it makes me want to throw up
And ugh the smell
Nasty
I was thinking about salata de boeuf initially but fuck it, you win
I've eaten pork drum before but I'm not fucking touching piftie
I hate răcituri so much
The texture is just disgusting to me and makes me wanna barf
Everyone around me loves it and they always tease me for not eating it
Rabbit meat doesn't sound that disgusting, don't get me wrong it's kinda weird but it isn't disgusting, on the other side I can't say the same for birordo
Loved Haggis back in Scotland
I also enjoyed Scottish Eggs
Haha,  you find salata de boeuf disgusting
I have to admit that that is a first
because up until this point every time I said that everyone was like whaaat
I personally don’t like it because I  find mayonnaise disgusting knowing it has raw eggs in it, and since we not only use mayonnaise in the mixture but we also glaze it with it, is what makes me a bit sick to my stomach
I know what you mean and I feel you and since it is more like a holiday dish I think thats we are safe
They look like big meat balls
Pretty much boiled eggs covered in haggis
They sell them at Tesco
Delicious
No, it's an entirely different thing I think
Edit: I think I might be in the wrong here
Could you explain what this lamp does, please
Nepotism in Iceland
Thanks for explaining
We messed up after 1945 but now we are good, not much architecture remained in Bucharest tho
Communism happened
Lost some territory to the North, East and South
Oh, and our trains run slower than they did 100 years ago
Buuuuuut, we have the best Internet (long story, just think of it as magic) in Europe
And we’re (barely just) part of a loving family called the EU
Also, communism sucked ass
(Romanian
World War 2 came, communism came, they took a part of the country, (Moldavia,) and we’re still waiting for them to come back
Now let’s march on Chisinau
Also, don't ask about Bessarabia and Northern Bucovina
Yeah, better not mention about them
I live in Bucharest, and I love it’s architecture
But a lot of it’s interwar and prewar architecture was destroyed by Ceausescu to build its commieblocks, Palace of Parliament and Unirii Avenue
Romania definitely Pipera has Offices and a lot of modern buildings, soon the Area around Romexpo will be turned into a center of commerce with huge modern buildings lol
We don't really have something like that, apart from some office buildings in Bucharest
Communism still prevails
Yeah we do, what are you on about
Cluj Napoca and Bucharest are prime examples of modern architecture (while still preserving the historical architecture of the city of course)
What is the shortest place name in your country
For example, pretty sure in Sweden it's Å, and in Romania it's Ip

Understood everything french, guess i have that going for me
Opened the Spanish one,I was able to understand like 80%.The rest of 20% I was able to understand from the context,but not really recognizing the words
I will try to translate the first sentence into english, I will put a questionmark after the words I'm not sure about

As Romanian, I was exposed to foreign languages from a young age from movies and TV
Growing up, I was watching Cartoon Network in English, even if I didn't understand much of it
Then, my grandma was watching South American Telenovelas, so I picked up some Spanish
Now, English is the only foreign language I truly know
But if I focus, I can understand other Romance languages
Italian and Spanish are the easiest
French is the hardest for me, but maybe not for other Romanians who learned it in school
It's really hard for me to grasp how Romanian is the hardest for so many people
It's almost like Italian
From a Romanian perspective, Portuguese is the weirdest (as in can barely understand anything)
Spanish&Italian are easy to understand
French has a lot of useless letters, but ignore them and it gets easy too
For spoken languages, I guess Spanish is the easiest, then Italian and French just sounds weird
I surprisingly understood a lot, maybe it's because there were common words that are used in most of the languages or because I can easily understand the meaning without understanding the words
I opened up one of each except for Romanian(mother tongue) and french( which i speak as a foregin language)
I had no trouble with the italian page, understood about 97% of it (page about Roger Federer), again not much trouble with the spanish one, i'd say i understood 85% (article about Eithne Ni Bhraonain) I struggled a bit with the Portuguese one, I understood say 60% (It was about Marinha bizantina, the navy of the biazntine empire) and I barely got any word from the catalan page about Blairsville
Read the first paragraph of the article about Europe, here's what I found:
Spanish was the easiest one, though I should mention that it's harder to understand spoken Spanish than written Spanish for me
Italian came in on number 2, most Romanians would tell you this is the closest language to Romanian but I don't entirely agree with that, as I stated above I think written Spanish is easier to understand but spoken Italian is easier than spoken Spanish
French and Portuguese came in a tie on number 3, I do have to say that this wasn't completely fair as I studied French at school so I still remember some of the words
Lastly, Catalan was the hardest one to understand, it's an interesting language but I had the hardest time trying to understand what was written
I'm a Romanian with pretty much no exposure to other Romance languages, and as opposed to other Romanians, I learned German in school instead of French
French I understood around 10-20% (and also mostly due to my English vocabulary)
Spanish around 50-60%. Italian, I was actually quite surprised, 80%. Portuguese 50%. Catalan 40-50% and Galician 50-60%. Poor Romansh feels left out
This was the first time I've read Catalan and I can't believe how similar it is to Romanian
In French, it was an article about a Canadian hockey player
Quite easy to understand as I had French classes at school
Spanish a small article about a town in Utah, except for the word *ubicado* it was understandable, also the first Spanish article was a very small article about the Letonian football cup(2 rows)
Italian the article was about a Roman arc in Verona
Harder to understand than Spanish
Portuguese it was an article about the Olympic games, I could understand most of it considering the topic
Catalan: An article about the movie Before I go to sleep
Interesting language
Galician: About the chemical element Oxygen, understandable
I understood pretty much everything about their Old smuggler whisky in spanish
I kinda understood most of everything other than the Portuguese and the Galician ones
I understand more in spanish than italian somehow
did someone even open the romanian link tho
Italian and spanish are pretty easy to understand too
I think Portuguese is the hardest one for Romanians
All you need now is a cigarette and a chunk of cheese and you're all set
Because Romanian also borrows from slavic languages
>  până la moartea ei în 1050 când era căsătorită cu Constantin al IX-lea
Until her death in 1050 when she was married to Constantin al IX-lea
It's a shorter way of saying: She died in 1050 and she was married to Constantin at the time
I can understand written Italian really well (no prior contact to Italian otherwise)
We have a similar word for most words in Italian
If you ignore all the useless letters that produce no sounds in French it becomes really easy to understand
Isn't romansh Germanic
Even Romanian
We have *patrimoniu* in Romanian, but I wasn't sure if heritage was the correct word for that in english
I had no idea what *bairro* means, in Romanian the word for neighborhood is *cartier*. Also we do have *comună*, but it's a little different, it's a rural area, made up of one or more villages with the same mayor
I kinda knew that *caballito* must be something related to horses, because in Romanian we have *cal* which means horse, and *cavaler* which means knight, and I know the spanish word for that is *caballero*, which is close to caballito, but I wasn't exactly sure what it is so I left it
Not at all
It's a Rhaeto-Romance language, closely related to Friulian and Ladin
>volumului prezent este o continuare a Hobbitului
means this volume is a continuation of the Hobbit
So you were really close
lucrări indeed it means works and in this context, it can mean books as well
&#x200B;
>**fantezie** înaltă
I've never heard inalta being used like this
Usually it means tall, here it means high
&#x200B;
>în timpul celui de-al doilea război **mondial**
it means during the second world war
Telenovelas
If you don't watch them, your grandma/aunt/sibling watches them
My girlfriend got kind of fluent in Spanish that way
The thing with Romanian is that we have many ways to say the same thing
Kind of like German but not that exaggerated
For example:
"Me encanta"
Normally translated to : "Îmi place/Ador" BUT one can also say "Mă încântă". When you read the second one it sounds almost exactly as in spanish
It also has kind of the same meaning
The "Îmi place" looks very similar to Italian
They have "Mi piace".
Thanks man
Yup, people are (or at least used to be) crazy about those
We even produced Romanian ones and they were really successful
The older ladies are especially interested in telenovelas
Would rather not eat for a day than miss an episode (old people use cable TV)
I just found it weird when they kept all the transformers names except for Bumblebee which was translated as Bondar
In Romanian they translate "Death Eater" from the Harry Potter series as Mortivor, mort = dead, -ivor  as in carnivore or herbivore
I find that translation pretty weird
That's why i never read the books in my native language
Urzeala Tronurior for Game of Thrones
Yes since I’m passionate of architecture, it’s a big lose culturally and as a simbol of resistance of human creations over the time, it being built in the 13th century
But it also can be rebuild
Not with the same materials, but there are projects in recent history that made it seems like the destruction never happened, like the old town in Warsaw
I am from Romania and my mom barely slept last night because she kept thinking about the fire
We were all very affected because France is a really big part of our lives (my dad used to work there and we went there a couple of times) because it’s such an important country for Europe
Never been in France, but this was so hard to watch
I know that it can and will be rebuilt, but the sadness remains
Meh
Personally, I am saddened by the news
However, since Romania is orthodox, I don't think other Romanians would really care
Shut up man
You are the like some news agency :"your house in on fire beyound salvation, how do you feel
All great things when destroyed literally become history
They should rename it to *Notre Gone* and collect the tourism money
I've had both German and British teachers as a child
None could keep a class quiet for more than  2-5minutes
They were way to well behaved and we weren't picking up that they were angry
One of the German teachers broke down once though, so we got to hear an authentic "NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
NEIN
". The 2 british teachers I had for 3 weeks in third grade are in my top 5 favorite teachers
We call it claxon too
From my perspective as a linguist who specializes in Germanic languages:
Dutch and Flemish are *not* the same thing, but they do have a very common recent ancestor
Depending on what dialect the speaker knows mutual intelligibility could be close to 100% or just partially mutually intelligible
Afrikaans descended from Dutch (from the Hollandic dialect) and retains some mutual intelligibility with it (and with Flemish to a lesser extent)
Since Afrikaans has a more regular and simplified morphology/grammar etc Dutch speakers can understand it better than vice-versa
You'd think Dutch and Flemish (and even Afrikaans) should be close to Luxembourgish since all 4 of these are considered Franconian languages, but Luxembourgish descended from the same branch of Germanic languages as Central and Upper German languages (Elbe Germanic), and because of that it retains way more mutual intelligibility with German, but not that much with Dutch
Now Low German and Frisian (and English too) are considered North sea Germanic, however all of these underwent influences from other languages
Low German ( or Low Saxon) was influenced by German and Frisian by Dutch, so mutual intelligibility is held at a lower percentage
Now I'll give approximate grades of mutual intelligibility from A - very high to E - very low, assuming that we're mostly talking about monolinguals
For:
Dutch speakers: Flemish - A/B, Afrikaans - B, Frisian (assuming we mean West Frisian) - C, Luxembourgish - D (or if they're from a more Germanized area - B), Low German - C
Flemish speakers: Dutch - A or B, Afrikaans - B or C, Frisian - C/ D, Luxembourgish - D (due to similar French influences), Low German - D
Afrikaans speakers: Dutch - B/C, Flemish - C, Frisian -D/E, Luxembourgish - D, Low German - D
Frisian speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C/B, Afrikaans - D, Luxembourgish - C/D, Low German - D
Luxembourgish speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C, Frisian - C/D, Afrikaans - D/E, Low German - B/C
Low German speakers: Dutch - C, Flemish - C/D, Frisian - C, Afrikaans - D/E, Luxembourgish - B/C
Transylvanian Saxons speak another Moselle Franconian language, just like Luxembourgish
They were brought over by King Géza II of Hungary from Luxembourg and The Moselle river region (and then some others from other regions in Germany), and if I remember correctly, they were called Saxons as it was a sort of common term for Germans as most German miners in the Kingdom of Hungary were from Saxony
Now for the language
Since I'm from Transylvania I had the opportunity to hear some bits of it and phonetically speaking I would say it's closer to Dutch than to Luxembourgish, even though lexically speaking it's very similar to Luxembourgish
Same goes for German across Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Liechtenstein; they speak German officially, however the spoken languages are quite different
In the case of Dutch and Flemish, there's been a lot of convergence going on in the sense that regional languages have been fading into mere dialects, which understandably will make the urban class not really see the distinction between the two, however rural areas still retain much stronger differences
Some native speakers will claim "it's just a dialect/accent", but linguistically there's more to that
Native speakers don't necessarily posses scientific knowledge, which is why, in the case of Hungary for example, people will claim the most outrageous things about the language, despite them being native speakers
Many would claim that Hungarian is Hunnic/Turkic/Mongolic/Sumerian/Scythian/language isolate and would deny the scientific researched fact that it's a Finno-Ugric language
Think about it this way: a mechanic will understand the ins and outs of a car better than a racecar driver
Your last point is pretty much what I meant actually, West Flemish being a different language for Hollandic Dutch, because of course there's a dialect continuum across these Low Franconian languages, wherein two cities next to each other will mostly speak the same languages, but the more you travel the more the differences result in different languages
I go hyperactive and spontaneous when in an English speaking environment
I'm usually a quiet and chill guy

Bucuresti is pretty hated by other romanians as far as i know
I moved to Groningen 2 months ago and just visited Amsterdam
At this moment, Amsterdam is so cool and beautiful and with excellent public transport, I regret that I have chosen Groningen and not Amsterdam
Does that indifference change when you find out that Bern is your capital
^(/s)
The people, not the city
The city too
Exactly
The only thing I don't like about my city is that it seems that most of the people from the rest of the country move here and I would get past that if the people that move here would adopt the urban lifestyle and not continue to live here like they are still in a rural region
And on top of that, they make the city unnecessarily crowded
>m quite passionate about my city, so if you need any more info or tips about what to do in Groningen and/or why it is one of the
I would live in Amsterdam, I like big cities
And yes, I hate the touristic streets around the main station and redlight district, they are like a Disney Land for ***chavs*** from England and ***cocălari*** from Romania
But Amsterdam is not just the city center
I pay a huge rent in Groningen too because I could not come earlier to find a  cheaper room so I had to rent an expensive student room from SSH
Yes, the good part of Groningen is that everything is reachable with the bike in a short time, however, the sad part is that the city can become pretty boring
I understand that you love your city and you may feel like the city has a very good amount of events, but for me is not the case, I find it to be a provincial city with some crazy students that like to party in the same 3-4 clubs (sunny beach, COPAS, Oost and Kokomo)
So yes, I kinda regret choosing this city to study, even though the University is very good and it is good that I reach the Uni very fast, so this is the good part, but as a lifestyle, city life and so on is a huge turn off for me
Please do not take this too personal, is just my opinion and probably I am just incompatible with the lifestyle from here and I am probably more compatible with bigger cities
&#x200B;
Edit: Yes I know this CNN article, but this top can be pretty subjective, for example, I do not understand why they consider Apuseni mountains to be the best place to visit from Romania
Yes, Apuseni are beautiful, but IMHO we have more beautiful mountains and regions in Romania
Can confirm, both
They are shitty for my taste too, there are few underground clubs in Groningen that offers a better healthier scene, as you remarked
Oh, we've kind of lost count of the number of Cabinets that have collapsed over the past 30+ years, since Communism fell *facepalms*.
In recent years, the most
I don't even know how to call it, famous
Popular
Also painful as hell was in the aftermath of the [Colectiv nightclub fire] that happened on October 30th, 2015
Only in the previous legislature (2016-2020) 3 governments fell by no confidence votes, which is more motion of no confidence passed than in some countries’ democratic history :))))
Thank you, I kept looking for a good word and this one simply eluded me
Fun fact: One of the governments was brought down by it's own party with a motion of no confidence
Which is both tragic and hilarious :))
I don't really watch the news
What happened
Happened a few years ago, PSD mate a motion of no confidence agains the Grindeanu or Tudose governments, i dont remember which one
The one before Dancila
The situation here is weird with the wealth gap
Somewhere around 30%-70% (educated guess, so don't hold me to that number) where the first group lives a normal life at 2020 QoL standards and the rest live either in poverty or in rural areas like in the medieval ages
When you visit, you usually only see the top 30% of the people
If you are in that top 30% you are expected to speak at least English
A lot of people also know French or German
If you are in the bottom 70%, speaking correct and fluent Romanian is seen as a win
Fun fact: A lot of our politicians come from the bottom 70%. Easily corruptible and uneducated
Most of my friends *think* they can speak English fluently
When I visited Croatia, I had an easier time speaking German than English
italian is also a pretty popular language among romanians, due to its resemblance to romanian and the immigration/emigration wave to italy
so a lot of the not-so-educated-romanians that emigrate to italy don’t know english, but they know italian, which imo is a very interesting thing
also hungarian is popular in the west, as well as romani
so i’d say that it’s kinda like this: (keep in mind it’s my personal assumption)
-well educated people know at least three languages, romanian, english and another one of choice
and it’s seen as “lazy” to not know at least b2 english
well educated in romania would probably mean someone with more than a bachelor’s degree (for people in their thirties, as people in their forties studied for five years, not three in college) so bachelor for 40+ years, master’s for 30 and younger
-well educated old people (60+), don’t know english, but know russian and/or french
-normally educated people, with or without a degree (i think here it matters what degree they have, like someone who goes to business school just to have a degree, no offense though) or they dropped out of uni, or they never went to university in the first place
i think it’s expected of them to know english, at least b2, too
especially if they’re younger than 50
-normally or highly educated people that are born in the west, they’re much more likely to know german and/or hungarian, depends a lot on their upbringing, their parent’s origins though
-some normally educated roma people know romani
they can know any of the languages above, depends on where they live and their income
a lot of them don’t know romani though, because they’re forced to dislike their origins and hide (romania is extremely racist when it comes to them)
it’s expected of them to try their best to be “white”-passing, so some don’t even identify as roma
-normally educated young adults and teenagers know english, mostly b1-b2
it’s also expected of them to know english, since it’s taught in school, from the first grade to the second year of university, also it’s far easier for them to learn it, since it’s “the language of the internet”
-less educated people probably know a little english, a1-a2
-a lot of less educated people can’t get a stable job that would give them enough money to not live in poverty, so they emigrate to italy, germany, spain or england
thus, they’re forced to learn a little of the language spoken in the country they emigrate to, a1-a2 level mostly
it’s not unknown to become fluent though, especially in italian, and especially if they plan on staying there more than a few years
-uneducated people, sadly, barely know romanian
it’s also a matter of privilege, poverty and racial segregation
someone born in a middle class family is expected to know english
someone born in poverty is either expected to know nothing or be a mastermind
i think there’s stigma around most things in this country, and it’s not taken for granted to know english, but it’s expected in most cases
knowing more than english is never expected, it’s a bonus that a lot of us would love to have, it’s not as rare as one would think, though
there’s also the idea that we know more than we actually know, a lot of people that think they are fluent in english when they actually are not
or fluent in romanian, but can’t write an academically correct paper on a subject of choice
notes: read this as education=scholarly
it’s a comment on romania, which has extremely affordable and easily accessible higher education
those unable to go to university, excluding personal exceptions, don’t go due to poverty
so they’re still under the category of uneducated, but it’s no longer a personal choice, it becomes forced by the state
There is a large group of people who are hating on the language mixers
Was to lazy to put it into this much detail, thank you for the additional insight
I considered a1-a2 level as not knowing the language when I made my assumptions about percentages
It's still probably off by a lot
i know exactly what you mean
Someone could monologue in french for hours and i'd understand 99% of it, but if i had to reply back, words don't come to me
I would be offended
Unless you're a really good friend and you came by several times
Or if it's like a child under 10 yo
But if you're some person coming to my house for the first time and you opened my fridge, I'd be offended
I don't bring my guests on the kitchen, so why did you go there
What are you looking for
Can't you just tell me what you need instead of going around looking for it
Depends
For family, good friends, etc, they _know_ when they're friends enough with me that I wouldn't mind
For anybody else, it's odd
if the person is not a close friend and or relatives, I’d think it’s weird
Say I host a party and friend of a friend or partners whatever, they go through my fridge, that would be annoying I guess
Bulgaria - their beaches and the whole touristic culture there
myself because i would like to see other countries as well
We'd actually like it if Serbia gave us back all politicians, businessmen and pieces of shit that got political asylum there so we can throw them in prison, we'll keep our garbage cans here where we can watch them
*"so no child could be named Leo Messi
And what if Leo Messi wants to name his child Leo
To be totally opposite with the Spanish rules, you can name your child whatever you want
I’m sure there must be some rules but as far as I know those doesn’t seem to stop anyone
So you are not limited to choose only Romanian names as foreign names are extremely popular among parents now
There is also very common with Roma people to name their kids after celebrities, especially the football player so no rule here
The gender thing is not a rule also, there is a distinction between female and male names (female ones usually end with “a”) but as I said, foreign names are popular so there are names quite a few female names that don’t end with “a”.
And I really think you can’t use offensive names but I also saw someone online who’s name was “Vaca Grasa Verginica” which means “Fat Cow Vergin” (yes with e)
I live in Spain and had no idea about any of these
As long as when i have kids they allow me to use super uncommon names and middle names it will be fine for me lol
If not I would just give birth in Romania where from what I've read there's not a huge criteria
The Germans specifically are screwed
My neighbor's name is basically John John
I can't imagine how he was made fun of while in school, but now he says no matter who's calling him (in a formal context or not) it sounds like they're friends and he likes that
Also, I've met many people while in school with awful names they were made fun of, so there isn't any rule or nobody is enforcing them
I'm kinda glad that's the case with romania bc my name list is full of very uncommon and old names lol I think like half of europe wouldn't allow me to use them
And I might even use 2 middle names depending on how much freedom I would get from my partner for names hahahah
From what I've heard tho they review each case by its own and decide if they allow the name or not if it could be offensive or cause tons of hardships for the child
I assume his favorite song is “Ion Ionule”.
I assume Its Grigore Antipa museum in Bucharest but we have some really good natural museums
People will probably say MNAC (contemporary art museum in Bucharest) or something, but my favourite museum EVER is the Pharmaceutical Museum in Cluj Napoca
I loved it, it's located in the first pharmacy ever opened in the city - something like the 1500s if I remember correctly
Its beautiful and super interesting
That one is my favorite
No but I have Tatar neighbors and when they don’t want their girls to understand what they are arguing about they speak either Tatar or English
From what I get their kids understand Tatar so it might actually be for neighbors, we live on the ground floor and you can hear them up to the 5th one
No,but they do speak other languages when they're drunk
My grandparents used to speak a mix of Bulgarian and Serbian when they didn't want us or my parents to understand
I think it might even be helpful when speaking with older generations as chances are they don't speak English
And I think most of them will appreciate the effort
The same thing goes for younger generations that speak English
We know that not many people speak Romanian and that it is pretty hard to learn so trying to speak it might give you some extra points
I'm yet to see someone who gets visibly annoyed by a non-native trying to speak Romanian
The only non natives I've heard speaking good Romanian were some Italians
Also a few Africans, of all people, which I don't know exactly why but it's always cool to hear them speak
Pronounciation wise, it is a pretty easy language to speak if you're familiar with the latin way of reading letters (the grammar is the hard part) ,  so for people who speak Spanish, for example, it isn't hard to memorate some phrases and say them when needed
For English speakers, it is a little more difficult
"Scuză-mă,  știi unde este hotelul Continental
" (Escuse me, do you know where Continental hotel is
Would be said the same as if written "Scuhzahmah, shty uhndeh esteh hohteluhl Continentahl
" in English
So if you're ever lost and really need directions, just go to some groups of teenagers or people in their 20s and say "Sorry, do you speak English, I need some help" . That's a sentance that virtually everyone born after 1990 will understand so it shouldn't annoy anyone
It should take at most 3 tries before you meet someone who speaks decent English
I am extremely sorry to have to say that, but when doing that please try to avoid the Roma population
I'm not racist trust me, but generally speaking you have to know how to talk with those people if you don't want to be hurt
I'm  one milion percent sure it is this [mesmerizing] smell
[Mici/mititei] good stuff
As a guy who lives and likes to go cycling in the rural areas, I would say there is a lot of horse shit smell
That was a joke, please don't feel offended
Or pastramă. Either would work well
I was about to suggest onion, but you're right
Most of Romania's counties (or județe) have a decrease of their population
The only regions that increase in population are Bucharest, Ilfov County (which is surrounding Bucharest) Cluj County and Timis County
Romania is decreasing quite a lot but people will return eventually i think and i may do as well
In the summers we visit Moldova for some relatives and the village are very empty and its like a ghost town which is really depressing
Moldova has it worse i think then Romania because big cities are increasing in population whereas Moldova does not
Just to piggyback on this comment, Romania has lost around 5 million people to emmigration since the 90’s. A couple of years ago, there were more Romanians moving to Germany than Syrians
You can definitely tell that all these people are gone, especially in the rural area
In my grandma’s village, somewhere in Eastern Romania, there’s basically only old people left
4 million more like
property prices are quite high in the areas I've mentioned (especially in my city Cluj-Napoca) but idk about other areas probably the prices are lower
In Brasov the prices are also rising
Brasov starts to be atractive from what I've seen and the city is getting a better look imo
Cluj and Bucharest are major IT centres
Cotinous growth for over a decade, shit top of it jobs etc
The cities are becoming quite pricy but there are a lot of oportunities in IT
Yeah the city is investing more into the turism stuff and it got a facelift compared to 10 years ago
Yes, the life is comfortable
Right now i still work(from home) decen salary, even though Bucharest is expensive af, but life is good
If you plan to come beware of the salary
Negotiate it after taxes, since we pay about 45% to the state, from gross salary
What is your opinion on cannabis
Should it be legalized
Yes, I have no problem with that, but there should be restrictions of how much you can buy, Romanians are big consumers of anything (mostly because during communism they didn't had much) and, of course, not allowed in public spaces
Personally, I will never try it but I'm fine with those that want
definetly yes
for Romania it would be a massive source of income, which would help a lot:)))
Yes, i am in favor of it
To be honest I think it should be legalized, it is just that it has a lot of medical value and it's better then alcohol which is already heavly consumed, cannabis is actually consumed a lot ilegally and It is also "criminalized" in Romanian, in fact I belive they tried to take the punishment for possesing it to up to 10 years imprisonment a few months ago, which seems very dramatic
If properly regulated it could even be an interesting
I couldn't find the differance between Hungary (Ungaria) and Bulgaria (same in romanian) because they sounded the same
* I taught Finland was Germanic
* I taught that England, Scotland and Wales are all separate countries
* I taught that the Netherlands are part of the UK
* I taught that Germany is bordering Romania
* I taught that Belgians speak Belgian, Swiss speak Swiss and Austrians speak Austrian
* I taught that Switzerland and Poland are Nordic countries
* I taught Czechia is Germanic
* I taught Hungary and Albania were Slavic
* I taught that Greece was somewhere in Western Europe near France
* I taught Moldova is the whole Moldavia
* I taught that Bosnia and Lithuania are fictional countries
* I taught that Russia is in Western Europe
Also Hungary (Ungaria) and Ukraine (Ucraina)
Same here
I always mixed them up as a kid
Pffft
I thought it was the second coming of Persia
Same
London, Paris, Prague, Budapest, Istanbul
Or alternatively, some smaller less touristic places:
Bergen, Delft, Como, Dubrovnik, Sighișoara
The most touristy cities are popular for a reason
You should see the classics:
Rome Paris London Barcelona Istanbul Vienna Amsterdam Venice Moscow
This is a route that I've done and liked it a lot: Dublin, Edinburgh, Paris, Amsterdam, Vienna
Or a southern one:
Lisbon, Barcelona, Venice, Heraklion, Istanbul
True, was thinking the same when I mentioned it
But compared to Paris or London it's still ok
I mean first list is quite mainstream, but if you haven't seen them before then you cannot miss them
The others are just little gems I have uncovered while travelling
There's plenty more, but I was trying to provide some variety (like Como is next to a lake, Dubrovnik next to the sea, Sighișoara is a medieval fortress, etc)
Personal preference
Not even in dates all the time
It’s the formal way but probably most write them without 0
I have been in Dubrovnik in mid July 2 years ago and I didn't find it that "wrecked" with tourists
It was actually quite alright to visit
Of course I was talking about the London attractions, everytime I went there it was very crowded and suffocated with tourists
I don't remember standing in line in Dubrovnik for a single thing, while in London this was a common occurrence
Here in Romania a decent cheap coffee is Fortuna
Otherwise I get at least Delhaize brand single origin coffee - favourite is Costa Rica
Obviously I'd prefer getting my coffee from a local roastery/coffeeshop I like but I just can't afford it
I'm currently in a relationship with a Syrian man ( he is half circasian)
We met in my international highschool
He's travelled so much and lived in loads of places so he hasn't been really raised in Syria
He loves food and introduced me to wonderful middle eastern dishes
He ans his family are incredibly kind hearted and i was quite in awe at the level of community bonding that exists in Syrian (and middle eastern) society
His  stories are simply mesmeriaing and seem surreal
We definitely care about family in romania but it seems like for them community means family and i find that very beautiful
I am romanian and my boyfriend is british
Never thought that I will have a relationship, ever
but here we are, after one year and a couple of months
We’ve been together thru ups and downs, and I am not giving up on us so easily
We have a saying “ ce-i al tau, e pus deoparte” which means that what is yours, is set aside
I found what I need on earth, without even searching .
He’s stubborness is on the highest level of all and I am the sensitive one
Even when he is wrong, he is still right
at least I let him live thinking like this
I didn’t cooked him a romanian dish, because he is very picky with the food, but I will find something that will be suitable with him
He learned a few words in romanian and he is very proud about it ( this makes my heart melt)
Is very hard for him to be surrounded by romanians, especially at a party, when we completely forget about the fact that he is English ( it happened once, I still feel like shit about it)
I am very happy when he is correcting me, even if I still try to find arguments in my defence
My family is more than thrilled to meet him, they start learning english so they can have a conversation with more than 5 words
He never made me feel like I am foreign, even when I made mistakes, and for me this means a lot
I love him to bits
In my opinion, I think we have to love that person  for who it is not what is is
And love means a lot
saying "panaramă" (slut) instead of "panoramă" (landscape)
I've only heard it once but it was the only funny language mistake I've heard so far
One guy at the French section at our university got me laughing really hard
He was in the Romanian section in the 1st year, despite speaking a very very basic Romanian and he kept making translations from French into Romanian in his head, he would always pronounce Romanian words in a very French way
He was clever because he managed to make some really good associations between Romanian words and French ones and could find out the meaning, even when the words weren't so obviously connected
One funny time was the word "fut". He heard us saying it a lot and in Romanian it's the conjugated form of the verb "a fute" (to fuck), but he associated it with the "fut" from French which is the past simple version of the verb to be
So he got confindent enough to use the word and came up sentences like "Eu fut la secretariat, dar era inchis" (I fucked the secretary, but it was closed" :D We actually laughed our asses off, but only after 2-3 days we decided to tell him what it actually meant
Same in Romanian
I don't think we have any words containing "nb" unless they're compound words somehow
So writing "Istambul" is a frequent mistake
A lot of people also say "imbus" and it's acceptable haha
I think it's mostly an american thing
The naming of an age group (like the "millenials" or stuff like that) is quite a very recent thing (and not a very popular one, I hear it more often on TV)
It’s an American thing mostly
But I can say (from my experience of observing people) that in ex-communist countries there is a big  difference in mentality between those that lived in communism and those that were born after that
no and yes
In here we have 5 generations:
Old people that most people believe that they shouldn't vote
Not so old people, some are cool, some are not
Middle aged people who are your average joe
Teens that either are the downfall of romanian society or their salvation
Kids too young to care about this crap
The Hoia Baciu forest is one of the creepiest places in Romania
The trees grow in a weird way, there is a zone in the middle of the forest without any trees at all and photos of UFO sightings were taken there in the 1960s. Really weird place indeed
As someone who has lived a few kilometres from the forest for most of his life, I can say that the most disturbing thing that I ever witnessed there was an old couple banging in their car
I think people hearing or seeing things in Hoia might be closely tied with the fact that the oldest techno / EDM festival in Romania has been held there since the 90s. I hear there’s a ghost called Molly roaming the forest
Isn't it like the Most haunted forest în the world
Cam dap
liiykmma balls
Ive heard about it
its a suicide forest not haunted
Can't speak for Denmark, but here it feels more acceptable to say "fuck" and "shit" than the Romanian translation
* a. *A* *ei* = hers, belong to hers
* e. Short form of *este* = it is, is
* o. Feminine form used in a lot of phrases
*O* *femeie* = a woman
For masculine it's used *un*. *Un* *barbat* = a man
EDITED
O (female form of "a"/ "an")
E (official but informal short for "is")
There aren't a lot though
Silly question there, but interesting nontheless
Well,tehnically no,but yes
e-  the short form for "este" - is
Not really a word
"A" can mean "Oh"
O (one) in romanian
‘A’, which translates to ‘Ah’, ‘E’ is ‘is’, and ‘o’ is ‘an’.
We sometimes use "e" instead of "este" which means "it is"
> Czech has a couple
More like four couples
:-)
No wonder since I think in Transnistria Ukrainians are the plurality or at least second numerous ethnic group
Russians are the third
Of course
Having Ukrainians as a third of the population and being located in Ukraine in a way - you're on their part of the Dnister- does that
Are you mixed too or part of one of those three ethnicities
Of course if you want to answer
:-)
Here it's not really taboo if, let's say, a friend gets a new job and you ask what his salary will be
Bringing it up out of nowhere is just weird
It's not rude if you're close
However teachers are surprisingly secretive about their salaries
Well, I'm an airforce pilot
Given the fact that I am 21, I get paid a lot more than all my friends
I've once made the mistake of telling them my salary, and it only led to some really awkward moments of 'I'm really tight on money, would you mind paying for me
' like every week
Since then, when I am being asked, the only answer I give is 'enough'.
Older generations are still uncomfortable talking about these things (in our case because of the secrete police and how they hurt people without explaining why, so everyone just keeps to themselves every kind of information)
Younger generations are super comfortable about this
I had a conversation at work once with my other coworkers and a manager about our salaries and she tried to explain why corporate made certain decisions and why I (with less experience) had the same salary as one of my coworkers (that had more experience and had started with a smaller salary)
IMO it is
The same amount of money has different worth to different people
Focusing on some numbers can be misleading
I may have mortgage, while you don't. You may have other responsibilities that I don't.
If you are not happy with your wage, take it up with your manager and/or look for another job that pays better
It's a pretty common thing here, like small talk
Since 45% of our pay goes directly to the government, it's a common subject
It is rude
Black olives
I rarely see green ones around here
We (me and my family) prefer green ones in Romania
Black olives so far, because people always use them on pizza
When i was little i was very fond of black olives that my granpa would get from the market
Now i realize they were the cheap stuff full of iron gluconate
While black ones are predominantly available in supermarkets, there are also green ones, at least 2-3 types along with the black
Green ones are also preferred when filled up with other stuff, cheese, hot peppers, etc
But traditionally in Romania, as a kid I remember large tin cans with black olives from Greece, those were the norm in the 80’s and 90’s
Romania also, but we prefer green ones
In Romania, the president can just agree or disagree to some decisions the government, parliament and senate make
So the president acts like a watchdog and keeps some powers in check to not let them abuse their power (sometimes)
There are a lot of cases when the government or the senate try to pass shitty laws that would negate some of the progress Romania has done, and the president stepped in and rejected/challenged the laws they wanted to pass
This is possible because the president comes from a party that is in opposition, and it's kind of a good thing
But if the president comes from the same party as the majority party, it seems like a useless position because then he/she would just agree to whatever they pass, so his/her power is nullified
The president is ***supposed*** to make sure there is balance
When I was 12 I would get my bike and go to literally other cities with my friends,and I was one of the anitsocial kids,you can imagine the rest
Neacșu's Letter is the oldest known text written in old Romanian, dating back to 1521
It was written in Cyrillic, but it was late transcribed in the Latin alphabet which makes it readable by romainian speakers nowadays
I remember when we first saw this text in high school and were absolutely baffled by it
There are many words we don't understand today and the majority of it sounds very strange, but I think most people could understand at least half of it and get a raugh idea of its contents
Letopisețul Țării Moldovei is also a big headache
In Romanian we use the expression "are sens" (literal eng translation is "has sense")
Well, instead of using our saying, we use a literal translation of the English saying "makes sense"... the meaning is the same but it's sounds quite weird when you are aware of it
exactly same thing in romanian .
It completely makes sense to me
Also I never heard anyone say has sense instead of makes sense
same in romanian: actualmente
> hewwo
H-hewwo senpai OwO
Weeeeeeell
It happens a lot that I hear people speaking in Romanian in construction sites in Germany
So when I found myself lost in Amsterdam's outskirts, I walk by a construction site and yelled "does anybody speak Romanian
". A guy that looked like an engineer, that was a few meters away from says "you don't have to shout" in Ro
I asked for directions, thank the dude and that's how you get around foreignen cities
I was living in China
While I was paying my rent another white guy walked in and was trying to settle an issue with the building administrator
I helped him as much as I could in my broken Chinese
Between the broken chinese of 2 white guys and the broken english of the building administrator we managed to settle the issue
After that I chatted with the other white guy in english about what are the best chinese translation apps
Before I left I asked him where he's from
Romania
Romania
Romania
Romania too
Cue laughter (in romanian)
This is the complete opposite but still relevant to the title
I was on a flight from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur by myself
I just so happened to be sat in a section with a massive tourist group coming from Russia
Everyone else on the plane was either Middle Eastern or Malaysian
Everyone around me for like 5-6 rows was from this group
And I looked just like them
The Russians were very talkative to each other and friendly and there was a lot of cross group communication, people walking back and forth
Every so often someone would walk down the aisle, stop, talk to the people around me, but I never said anything cause I don't speak Russian
So they must have thought I am not friendly or something
All of them had at least another person they knew, like family or friends
I was there all by myself and it was a really strange atmosphere
At some point some very friendly guy just outright extended his hand to me and saluted me in Russian
I shook back and said "I'm sorry, I don't speak Russian". At that point I heard two girls behind him exclaim a very loud "oohhhh". None of them spoke English though, weirdly enough, so I never found out what kind of group it was
Yes we have [this] and I think they're planning to change it in the following years with something with a chip in it to work with electronic systems
In Romania we have something like [this] Which is ok but the main disadvantages it has are the fact it's fairly large(roughly 8 by 10 cm) and that it dosen't have your birthday written on it
It has the "CNP" or personal numeric code and your  date is written in it
That's a real problem when you leave the country since people abroad don't know how to translate that code and get your birthday
Also I should mention there is a photo of you in the left empty spot and some numbers in the lower area
You get it at 14
You have to got to a police station and register
They take an unflattering picture of you and some days later you can pick it up
[It's bigger than most European IDs
Yes, and it is required by law to make one when you turn 14 and renew it when it expires
You can see an image of it [here]
As to what it contains, the latest one has:
- series and no
of the ID Card
- personal numerical code (_CNP_)
- the photo of the person
- last name and first name
- nationality
- birth place
- home address
- the office where the ID Card was issues
- validity date
- machine readable code at the bottom
Didnt they want to also make it the size of a normal bank card
so it can FIT in wallets
Mine just hangs out, stored with the cash (men's wallet, very small)
Please, PLEASE have them actually do that

Analysis
Yeah I just renewed mine some weeks ago
But I don't think it'll be done very soon
Our "elite" are against chips because it's the devil's work and they will steal your soul or whatever
So it might not even happen, who knows
I wouldn't be able to say, but I'd like that very much
The man, the myth, the legend
Yes, now that I think about it it's pretty inconvenient that it's not clearly written
It is really cute I agree and I hate that I lost all my stickers now
It does look more readable to my Romanian (so like, quarter-Slav
) eyes
It uses the 5G waves to give you Corona and enslave you to the overlord Bill Gates
Hah I know, right
Every time I see one of those cool cardholders I'm like "hmm this thing is cool but my id
I second this
Wallet shopping (and gift giving) with a Romanian ID is a real pain
There's a trend currently that's popular amongst the more uneducated people that this corona virus is fake, that 5G is dangerous, that Bill gates wants to steal their temperature and shit like that
It was the same with our national health insurance cards that got a chip so you can scan them, people were like "Uh no, muh soul, muh health, you're the devil" and stuff
Basically it's brainwashing of the masses but it just seems like they're brainwashing themselves
I can see where they come from, it’s about the size of a passport, but the sluggishness to switch to a one size fits all ID + driving license + medical insurance card is absolutely dreadful
Speaking of which, can anyone ELI5 why the name changed from Pozsony to Bratislava
The Slovak name for Pozsony used to be 'Prešporok'. The name only changed to Bratislava in 1919 iirc
Interesting
Of note is that this rarely occurred in Romania, with big cities like Oradea, Cluj, Timisoara, Arad etc
all keeping their original names
I started to learn English at school in 5th grade ( so at about 11 years old ) . This combined with the fact I used to watch a lot of movies ( all of them subbed, none was dubbed ) helped me to make rapid progress
I always considered English the simplest foreign language
In high school I had 4 English classes per week which helped a lot
Today I can understand English perfectly, I watch YouTube videos in English without the need of subtitles, if I watch an American movie I watch it without subtitles or with English subtitles, I do not need Romanian subtitles
I am at a point where I understand the language perfectly, I don't translate the words in my head or something like that, I understand almost as well as my native language
My pronunciation is good but not that good, I cannot imitate an American accent or any accent
My native accent is not very pronounced when I speak but you can still hear it .
From the age of 4
English classes in school, probably around the age of 12, maybe earlier, continued through high school and then college (more technical and applied to the field I was studying)
In high school I was already able to read, speak and understand, read a novel, do an essay, watch a movie without subtitles
Probably one of the most important factors for me was that we didn’t have dubbing in television in our country
It was always subtitles
Hearing the original language during the movies, or in general in any TV show, even extending to other languages, was really a boon
Dubbing was a thing only present on movie tapes, but video died quickly after 1989 and capitalism with cable TV took over
I picked French as my second language in high school (although I studied Russian for two years before) just because I was able to watch French TV, I liked it and was constantly having the TV on a French TV station
To my surprise, I only lagged behind in writing (the accents and a bit of grammar, which I was supposed to have studied already) but I was way ahead in reading, speaking and comprehension when compared to my class as high school freshmen
I learned it from TV when I was very young
I Romania all shows have subtitles
And when I was a kid, cartoons and kids shows were most of the time left unaltered, so no dubbing, no subtitles, nothing to explain what's going on in Romanian
Since I watched mostly English cartoons, I learned English
I have a friend that watched only French cartoons and she speaks French fluently now
I learned spelling mostly from video games (GTA cheat codes were a good start)
And around high school I started reading books in English
In our high school there was this little "bookshop" organized by the English teachers, where they would bring books that weren't translated into Romanian yet
The first book I bought was some Lovecraft story
i became fluent at 12, honestly i don't remember how i learnt it, i don't remember ever studying english
i guess it's from the Internet idk
I started watching TV (mainly Discovery) before entering school and then I mostly used the internet and movies
I'm a native Romanian speaker so my language is not even close to English, which  made it hard for me to understand (never had great teachers at school either, so I was pretty much on my own)
I remember the hardest thing to understand was that things are not pronounced as they are written
I started learning English because of the internet
My family got a laptop when I was 8 and from there I started watching a lot of YouTube since I was really interested in video games and it just spiralled from there
At 13 I got into anime and other TV shows that had only English subtitles so that helped
At first I wasn't able to understand anything but with time and a lot of perseverance I became pretty good at it
Now I'm 18, should've had my IELTS exam this spring but due to Covid-19 it got cancelled
It all started in the autumn of 2010 (more or less)
I was pretty young and my dad made me learn this language  without my consent
In the sixth grade i've reached a point in my english studies where i could listen to english youtubers and acctually understand like 40% of what they were saying
Therefore i started to wach youtube and after 100 episodes of Xcom enemy unknown , i started to understand english well enough to play any game and wach any movie in english
THE END
As a guy living in Netherlands, it's usually the white sneakers, jeans and wet hair that always gives it away for the Dutch girls
For the guys is the amount of industrial gel or wax in their hair
Edit: sneakers instead of snickers
Mmm, depends on what you consider an educated guess
Here in Romania we can tell with like 90-95% accuracy who is German among a group of tourists
Especially if they're old
Idk why, but my confirmation bias says that old German people's skin sags in a very distinct way haha
Interesting, I live in the Netherlands and I am pretty good at spotting Romanians
I once noticed 2 couples in Amsterdam from 20-30 meters away and was willing to bet they are Romanians
When I got close and heard the language, my guess was confirmed
I think it's partly the way they look, the way they dress and something that tells me they look Romanian, but I am having troubles pinpointing exactly what is the distinctive feature
Strippers eh
My new year's resolution will be to eliminate all activism from my life and not give a fuck in general
We have a lot in Romania
One that is mildly close to yours would  literally translate to " don't turn a mosquito into a stallion ". Basically it means don't over react, don't exagerate, don't make a big deal out of something that is not important
in romania we have "nu te uita ca mâța in calendar" which translates to "dont stare like the cat to the calendar" and roughly means "dont stare too long/dont be too shocked"
my favourite one is "a da cu mucii in fasole" -> "to put the boogers in the beans" and means to mess up but its really funny
we have "a freca menta", to rub mint, which means to waste time
i heard it comes from the ancient greek tradition of rubbing mint on tables to make them smell nice, which some romanian boyars adopted
do other Balkan countries have this as well
Well, we have
* Go walk the bear
* Don't turn the mosquito into a stallion
* Toyota
(Go away fast)
* And many more I can't remember right now
You're turning shit into a whip - Faci din cacat bici
Used whenever you make something way better than expected
Ok so we got:
A tăia frunze la câini = to cut leaves to the dogs meaning to waste time
Nu are toate țiglele pe casă = he doesn't have all the tiles on the house (roof) meaning he's crazy
I s-au înecat corăbiile = his ships have sunk meaning he's feeling down
A freca menta = To rub the mint meaning to waste time
A da la rațe/boboci = to give to the ducks/ducklings meaning to throw up(puke)
A face din rahat bici = to make a whip from shit meaning trying to do something impossible
And there's a lot more but I'm too lazy to write more
In Romania when you fuck up something we say "a face cacatul prastie" translated as to make the shit into a slingshot
"Ca nuca în perete" means "like a walnut in a wall". It means something that doesn't match/fit in with its surroundings
I also heard "Don't make an ox out of an egg".
A few others with insects / horses:
"Te-ai bagat ca musca-n lapte" = "You got in like a fly in milk"
And the more extreme one:
"Te-ai bagat ca musca-n cur la cal" = "You got in like a fly got inside a horse's ass"
Both mean something along the lines of "sticking your nose where it doesn't belong". Another way to say that is:
"Iti bagi nasul unde nu-ti fierbe oala
" = "You stick your nose where your pot is not boiling".
The Romanian equivalent of the first one is "they don't have all the bulls home".
Momentan lerne ich Deutsch, und das ist unglaublich hilfreich
Danke sehr, Mann (:
This one is so cool
We also have the first one
Our version of that is "Din lac în puț" which translates kinda like "out of the lake into the well".
the first one means to act confused in Eastern Romania/Moldova
How would it look written
I guess we have it like this because it rhymes
It's like "nu face din țânțar armăsar" Maybe for you "mosquito" rhymes with "elephant".
How did a camel saying land in your country
Also "doesn't have all the tiles on the house" or as my grandma used to say "doesn't have all the saturdays".
also "You get rid of the devil and you get his father".
i've also never heard the first one
funky
yes
it was on the tip of my tongue
The Romanian Academy (Academia Română) is a cultural forum founded in 1866
It covers the scientific, artistic and literary domains
The academy has 181 acting members who are elected for life
the academy's main goals are the cultivation of Romanian language and Romanian literature, the study of the national history of Romania and research into major scientific domains
Yes there is one, but I forgot the name of it, maybe someone can help me remember the name
It was the Institue of Romanian language, I think
Academia Română! they deal with more than just language, researching the history of the Romanian people, among other things, as well
but they are most well known for the DEX, perhaps our most important Romanian dictionary
honestly, that makes it really fun for us second language speakers
i love discovering silly old idioms online and comparing dialects from around the world
you never get that much diversity with other languages
also, you're all so lucky for not having to deal with grammatical gender and godforsaken noun cases in school
the adjective order, though
'ESASCOM' was my teacher's. still terrified of it
Ah, that's the one of course, they are mostly occupied with definitions and other grammar/dictionary rules, they are also responsible for editing grammar textbooks in schools if needed
I met a guy who thought kind of the reverse
He was convinced that except UK and USA everyone speaks at least a little bit of French
It's the lingua franca right
It's just those pesky english holding out
I think Mamaia it’s nice but it’s overcrowded and have too many bad songs so I prefer somewhere where there are less people
Mamaia is quite known in our country as the "upper middle and high class" beach resort with clubs and music and other "luxurious" stuff that you can find on every beach here, but people still pay thousands for one single location
I prefer the south though, Mangalia and its other resorts like Venus and Saturn (yes, named after planets) are very nice and has the same venues with cheaper prices
Some romanians go to bulgaria though
Romania doesn’t have a vast shoreline, but we have Plaja de la Olimp
I also find that it's too expensive for what it has to offer and it's also super overrated
The prices doesn’t seems higher than in Bucharest but I agree with the quality being low, tho there are quite a few restaurants with good food if you search for them
If you like minimal techno, i think Romania has some of the greatest DJs and producers: Priku, Charlie, Marcu Rares, Arapu and many others
Here are some youtube channels with minimal techno from romanian producers:
I totally recommend **Subcarpați**. They combine folk and techno in an amazing way
It’s probably not exactly what you wanted to hear, but after listening to the anthems of some other nations, such as those of Canada and Australia especially, I will say that they do not hold a candle to that of Romania
Also Romanian, I don't really like that kind of stuff but I'm gonna attach myself to this comment cause it's fairly high up
IMO some of the best Romanian stuff is by [Robin and the Backstabbers] Subcarpați is also great stuff
Can I just hijack this comment to recommend 2 other artists (Djs / producers) :D
Nerub and Musai Soundworks
Also for a more mainstream one, Silent Strike
Can I also add that I think Belgium has an awesome doom/stoner rock scene
I discovered so many cool bands while living there
Cowboys & Aliens, Maudlin, Tangled Horns, Miava and so on
Yesss I know them, they're great
I had the chance to attend last year's Alcatraz Festival and they had a dedicated stage/tent for local underground bands, I chilled a lot in there and discovered lots of goodies
I also went to Desertfest in Antwerp and absolutely loved it
That's so cool
:D Nah I'm nowhere near knowledgeable haha, I just love music and concerts
I got the chance to see many of my favorite bands and discover lots more while staying in Antwerp
We don't get that many concerts in Romania, much less in my hometown, so of course I had to take advantage hahah
And I'd love to taste that beer next time I visit
The only two cities that actually have a serious rivalry are Galati and Braila
Bucharest and every other City that is not Bucharest
I'd say Cluj-Napoca and Bucharest
The two are among the most developed cities in the country and major economic centers
Cluj has the reputation of being more modern than Bucharest, but Bucharest is still more important being the capital and having higher GDP
Both cities have a superiority complex that is often quite hilarious
There are talks of Cluj getting a metro station which would take this feud to the next level since Romanians from Bucharest often make fun of Cluj for not having a metro just to put salt in the wound lol
Bucharest vs Cluj - centralism vs regionalism, Paris vs Vienna, significant cultural and dialect differences
Craiova could cut in that list too tbh
Bucharest x Cluj
Timișoara and Arad have a similar rivalry, in football at least
Well, no city comes close to Budapest, so naturally no city even thinks of competing or comparing with Budapest in thr first place because it's pointless from the get go
It would be hilarious to hear any city to try and compete/compare to Budapest
On the other hand, if you had two big, similar cities in the country, you bet there'd be rivalry
Who do they have a rivalry with
That's a one-way rivalry
Cluj thinks Bucharest is its rival, Bucharest doesn't even know Cluj exists for most of the year, until Untold comes around
Not really
Braila , from my pov the swords and the clans from both the cities are some next level shit , at least imo
Local dialects are pretty much dying down
You can only hear them at the countryside nowadays
"Transylvanians have a weird accent"
Hmm
I sure do wonder why
You don't know what I mean huh
I am sorry if I seemed racist
But come on, hungarian influence clearly influenced them a lot
Oof, sorry man
Though it is true that romanian transylvanians sound weird as well
so we have something in common lmao
That Numa Numa song everyone asks Romanians to sing
It was made by Moldavians
They have a thing for meme songs, eurovision is proof
Being Slavic
(I’m Romanian
Wait, people blame Poland for those
We have latin as a mandatory subject in a year or two
Had to learn Latin as well in Romania
God I hated it
In Romania, that is 30% of our Baccalaureate grade, except it’s not easy and you don’t really have a choice but to memorize around 15 essays, 6 pages each, of text analysis
At the exam, you get one essay randomly assigned and you need to write it all down from memory
It’s usually narrating the story, adding a few examples from the book (you need to be able to write down the exact words that the author wrote), literary critiques’ words, and finally, some actual analysis (that you gotta memorize from home too)
With poetry it gets a bit trickier because you get less chances of covering those 6 pages with examples from the text and you need to add more text analysis :(
For instance, we need to talk about the ideation of death and suicide in one of the books we study for baccalaureate, along with the character traits and background (the building up part from the first part of the novel) that brought them to the breaking point
With poetry you end up analyzing just the title “Blue Flower” in 300-400 words
Basically, text analysis is all we do in high school in Romanian classes
At the exam itself you also get to answer some grammar questions, prove you have non-literary text understanding (you get a science text and need to extract data from it), and write down a 2 page long opinion essay where you talk about a randomly assigned subject (like the importance of wearing traditional clothes on a daily basis) - but these are things you should be able to do from Y5 to Y8 of middle school
We also get an oral examination part in the Romanian Baccalaureate, which you can’t fail, but you wouldn’t want to get marked with “low level” either
There, they test your smoothness in Romanian, like how easily you’re able to express yourself
Afaik you get asked about one of the books that you need to be able to talk about for the written part itself + an opinion on something
Edit: typos
Latin is mandatory in 8th grade (1h/ week) and then, if you choose “filologie” as your high school path (the branch where you study literature, foreign languages and social sciences), you end up taking Latin classes until you graduate, with 1h/ week during Y9-Y10 and 2h/ week during Y11-Y12
It’s also a subject for semestral finals once you choose “filologie”, and the methodology of the class itself sucks, so don’t expect to understand anything
You either get an understanding teacher that lets everyone pass with 10/10 (maximum grade) or some evil mummy that makes you repeat the whole year
Lucky you
We have mandatory religion classes that are entirely centered around Christian Orthodoxy, and other religions are shunned
It's, in my opinion, just religious propaganda force-fed to you from first grade until your last year of high school
And the only way to not have to attend the Indoctrination Class, as I like to call it, is to get some documents from your local religious organization (if you're Muslim, for example, you need papers from the mosque you go to) or have your parents sign some papers when you first start school
All we did in Latin was learn some verb tenses, *declinări* and adjectives
Also read and translate sometimes
Such a waste of time honestly
Damn, you got quite lucky
Our waste of time is different because our professor is very *nefutută* and she really enjoys torturing us with her useless subject (and grading us accordingly)
Guess I'm tired or sth, but even though I know of Bosnia and Herzegovina, I first thought that you mentioned a clothing store
Pretty sure Romania doesn't have any
They were never the same city to begin with plus the 2 cities are divided by a natural border, the Danube, not by a man made border
Yes, but if you look at Gorizia for example, it was once a single city but then got divided when the borders changed, in the case of Giurgiu and Ruse, they were never a unified city, they were always separated
Romanians have beef with Hungarians over Transylvania
I honestly know people from all sides, and decent people usually don't argue over it
There are some crap people who want that piece of land just for their country and hate the other country's guts
It goes both ways
Romanians have a lot of that
Of course, our narrative is the correct one, but plenty of people will say we’re oppressive slavs who never owned Transylvania and shouldn’t own Moldavia
Anyone up to a fight then
Same goes with everyone from trianon apart from hungary
Fool
You bringed a knife to a sword fight
Same here with the banat region, ofc is not known who was first but hungarians dissapeard from the region and appeard agaun during the late 18th century, till then te regions was mostly ingabited by romanians,serbs and germans(small but considerable numbers of jews and bulgarians too)
Definitely
They do call it “the CONFORT of your own home” for a reason
Yeah, mostly old clothes and those that I bought (mostly because they were cheap) but don’t really like anymore
I'm lazy
I stay only in pijamas
Yes I do, doesn't everyone
You inadvertently stumbled upon a great conundrum in language
In romanian it's spelled coNfort because it's imported directly from french
In english it's spelled coMfort because english doesn't import words, it lurks in dark alleys, beats up other languages and rifles through their pockets for spare vocabulary
Seriously though it's not known exactly why english has a different spelling but it causes a lot of problems for Romanians and especially autocorrect will freak out trying to decide which one you're trying to spell
Some theories say english imported it through other languages or that it was transmitted only orally leading to a misspelling
[I found a discussion that points out how the COMF prefix is very rare in English too so
>because english doesn't import words, it lurks in dark alleys, beats up other languages and rifles through their pockets for spare vocabulary
This is hilarious
Generally speaking, Hungarians are sensitive about everything to do with Romania and WWI so they might be offended by the "Treceti batalioane romane Carpatii" (Romanian troops, cross The Carpathian Mountains) song
Welp, we have a Romanian version of Katiusha that is
questionable
There is a song called "Sus pe malul Nistrului" that means "Up on the shore of the Nistru" and it's basically telling Russians that Moldavia isn't theirs
Also, a lot of other patriotic Romanian songs, especially those about Ardeal do piss off some Hungarians
Romanian here
Our national anthem refers to the Ottoman Empire as the ‘Barbaric Crescent’. It’s not wrong, though
[Or this]
I propose that song to be the new National Anthem
Crusader Kings: I tried Romania from different starts, also went for some others such as England and Saxony
I also play much with mods
Europa Universalis: Isn’t working right now
Hearts of Iron: Romania, many times, with repeated failure
Guatemala, many times, with repeated failure
France, many times, with repeated failure
Ethiopia, many times, with repeated failure
It seems like in Romania, Streisângeorgiu is the longest but I'm not sure
Drobeta Turnul Severin  and Câmpulung Moldovenesc both with 20 letters
Let's hope I get into an exchange program I've been trying to get into
im thinking of visiting the baltic states, do them all in like 2 weeks or so, always met nice people from those countries and im curious how they developed after the fall of communism
I have that problem too
Erasmus+? I was supposed to leave in September but it got cancelled :(
I am trying with the Flex program but I really hope you'll leave next year
Are you going to America
I wish you the best too
It's really cool exchange program for European and Asian high school students
They offer the opportunity to study one year of high school in USA
I knew I didn’t have to scroll too much to see Porto Cervo mentioned
:))
i was in a holiday trip in Greece and near Metsovo on Ignatia Odos ( Ionian Island-Thessaloniki) i have seen a truck with Iran license plate
2 American ones: one from Florida and one from New Jersey
Damn it can't we get people from more normal US states to visit us
a bright red sports car with a plate from an arab-speaking country (can’t tell which one since in don’t know what the plate said), all the way lost in some little town in Brittany, France
Two ways:
"arond" = literally "rounded a"
"coadă de maimuță" = "monkey tail", it was used back in the 90s and early 2000s, and only informally
Arond in Romanian, can’t really translate it in English
Now that you put it like this, it really makes sense :))
In football I usually cheer for Croatia or Iceland
My country is knocked out almost every time, so I will always cheer for another country
Everyone except Hungary
I would rather die than cheer for them
Any Balkan Country> Any European Country except Hungary> Anyone playing against Hungary
I always cheer for the underdogs
We are by default knocked out of any major international sports tournament, so we cheer for other countries by default
Romanian here
We’ll cheer for the other Latin countries
I second this ^
About your comment on the UK, haven't even been there or something but I just always thought if u aren't like that in a country like the UK, u end up smashing your head against the wall every day
The weather and overall atmosphere always has an impact on people
No, you cannot take the 'black sheep of the Latin family' title away from us like that
use bunq
They definitely can, but who would want to
You don't ?I thought that's quite common
Annoying little Roaming traps
Over the last few years, I've been spoiled by the Roaming system in Europe: you can use your data plan from home with no extra cost, as long as you are in another EU or EEA country (European Economic Area)
Problem is these little states don't bother
In Andorra, just checking Google Maps costed me €50
I would have spent more, but my carrier locked my Roaming at that point
When I visited Monaco, I knew about it, but by the time I realized the train entered the station, my phone already used €30 worth of data
The same will be when I visit San Marino
Lichtenstein should be different, since I believe they are in EEA
Vatican I believe uses the Italian carrier networks
Lichtenstein (and Swiss as a matter of fact) aren't different
Albeit depending on the carrier they might be cheaper
Since you are also from Romania, I just looked at Vodafone, Orange, and Telekom
Liechtenstein should have European Roaming, while Switzerland doesn't.
Not according to the carriers in my country at least
As Roaming goes, it's cheaper to go to Africa than San Marino
There's no [European Roaming]
This is probably going to be an unpopular opinion but I view Iran as the aggresor here
Iran attacked the US embacy in Baghdad
The only thing the US did was protect it's embassy and rightfully so
In the end Iran got what it deserved
There are no words to describe my thoughts
I just HOPE it was not random and US had a SOLID and well thought backup plan for this measure
Otherwise I PRAY iranians are wiser than Trump and will stick to a decent war not affecting all of us
What can I say
America back at it again
I don't know why they like having conflicts with everyone like this, but they better resolve it peacefuly
I get the same feeling because that would explain the whole discussion about an "european army" that we recently had
Russia
Hungary
They want transylvania again =))) (in reality there is no real dispute anymore)
Russia
Russia (or Hungary)
Russia
Russia
Hungary, Turkey, or Russia
(Romanian
Russia definitely
Unfortunately by proxy that also includes Hungary presently
We're in a bit of a pickle
Mader Rasha
Ukraine
Russia
Russia closely followed by those sneaky Hungarians
It's a pretty obvious choice
Crazy nation with a crazy leader armed to the teeth
Nah Russia is too busy dealing with Russia
Also you have a huge history in invading your neighbour s. This is hiatory is not that far if I think of it
In Bucharest the student cafeterias should accept only students technically
But since it's Romania, they accept almost everybody
Except for homeless people and obvious trouble makers (people who come in screaming for instance)
The food is cheap, usually decent
And the cafeteria from the Politehnică even has a cool futuro-soviet look to it and it's worth visiting
Edit: politehnica = physics, math, that sort of thing
[I can't find better pictures :(]
It's the last 3 pics in the slideshow
The song "Dragostea din tei"(Numa numa) is written in romanian, but is played by a moldavian(Dan Bălan), in fact a romanian(because Moldova is Romania basically)
The lyrics are so catchy and the melody is so cool, I strongly recommend to listen this    song
:)))
Being written in my native language surely didn't stop "Dragostea din tei" from becoming famous worldwide
Most of my favourite songs come from the 2011-2012 period when a rennasiance of Romanian music kind of happened
They are quite famous here but didn't go abroad
"Dragoste de inchiriat" by Akcent
High pitch voice dudes makes it so catchy
Not my native language, but Molchat Doma
They're a post-punk band from Belarus and I absolutely love their music
Oddly, they're known more around Europe than in their own country
Here's a link to my personal favorite:
In Romanian it's "copiuță" and it means "little copy".
Or "fițuică", which is an old word used in a derogatory way for newspapers that weren't serious (i.e. tabloids)
Also worth mentioning that the verb we use for cheating at a test is "to copy".
Yeah, you're right, that's another definition, I should've mentioned it, too
No lockers when I was in school, but we could leave our books in our classroom either on our desks or on some shelves at the back of the classroom
Nobody really did though cause we needed those books for homework most of the time anyway
But, to spare our backs we would share the load of books between deskmates (two people usually share a desk in the classroom)
For coats we had wall hangers at the back of the classroom
I used to have lockers in high school, but I don't think it's a common practice
We don't have lockers
We have PE changing rooms(without lockers)
It's very school dependent, both schools that I went to had lockers but since in my city most schools split classrooms and there aren't enough lockers, the kids in the the lower grade used them (cause their backs are more fragile or something), so I used the lockers in 1st through 4th grade but then never used them again
I try to make it easier on my back by only carrying the 5-6 notebooks, some pens and a bottle of water and make a photo of the books I need to use
Yeah,but they are only some wooden cabinets that we share . 2 people per cabinet
Nah we don't have those things
we are more old school
We have those in private schools
Even so , I don't see how they can be that useful
Yes, some schools have them but in poorer areas of the country you have to carry your backpack everywhere with ~5kg of books
Srsly
La mine dacă îți uiți cartea la școală îți iei scandal monstru
Sau dacă te înțelegi cu colegul de Banca sa ia unul carte azi altul cartea mâine, iar scandal că de ce nu ai carte
The only time I had lockers was when I was in kindergarten lmao
"poorer areas"- I live in Bucharest, and me and all of my friends break our backs for those useless books that we didn't even use most of the time
Also in my class a lot of people didn't bring the manuels for useless clasess(music, french, religion, etc)
Same :(
I also live in Bucharest and have to carry my backpack to school every day :))
Mann, I weight mine last year and it was 14kg
Million - Milion
Billion - Miliard
Trillion - Trilion
And I think we stop here
I think
We also have *catralion*. Which is 10^(6) trillions
Wow
In Romanian it's the same as in Danish, just that we use only one "L": Milion and Miliard
> 1012 = trillion = trliarde
Mistake here, it's [trilion] actually
Sounded off to me, so I looked it up
Fair enough though, it's not very commonly used :)
You actually sent me to DEX, lol
Well, truth is I too went to DEX, because I wasn't sure how much that word meant
I just knew it existed rofl
I swear I'd thought it's a made up word to describe a huuuge amount of money, so thanks for the TIL :D
Bucharest have underground tunnels around the city since the WWII (or WWI if I’m not mistaken)
The palace of parliament also have some big tunnels under it and it’s only speculated that those extend throughout the city and connects with the airport in case Ceausescu wanted to escape in a nuclear attacks
I...dont thunk we have
But we had a conspiracy thpry about some  secret tunnels under the parliment in bucharest that would lead outside the city
What makes your country stand out
Bad economy, oh wait that's like most of eastern europe, nvm
We are a fish on the map
Maybe Italy is a boot and has good fashion, but things are definitely fishy here most of the times
Bitch our country is shaped like a fucking fish
Fastest interet in Europe and one of the best in the world
And our culture is so mixed due to all the bois that wanted our precious land, that it became unique
Fuck (still with respecc) the other countries, Romania uber älles
Geography !!! In Romania you can go from seaside to plains to hills to  mountains all in the span of a couple of hours (in theory at least)
This is not considered such a big thing but for people who live in countries that only have plains, or only hills, might find this very interesting
For the other folks browsing the comments: The only Latin nation in Eastern Europe
The only reason Romania is nr 7 is that we treat beer like a nonalcoholic  drink
Men drink beer when they can't afford to drink something over 40°. Women drink other soft drinks which taste better (generally, eg I love apple cider and am not a woman, don't jump me)
We are still in the early stages of this, but they are multiplying like crazy
There are TONS of ads for videochat jobs for girls and people are even handing out flyers in universities
How do you heat the saunas
Also any statistic about how much finnish people (I want to say fins, but those are also fish flaps
) spend for sauna heating per year
Really curious
Swimming in a sea of slavs
Fast internet hi5
Finland and Sweden combined look like a floppy dick on most of the maps, not just the coin one
Let's not be so hasty about this
We almost got rid of corruption by fucking legalizing it
Good thing most people are not 100% dumb and protested
You guys scared us shitless
I am in the second biggest city here and there are no hand sanitizers left anywhere
Can confirm
I learned german grammar between 2002-2012
What I learner in the first half decade about ß changed in the last half
Now I can't always remember which one is correct so I just use "ss" instead of ß. (Eg I know Spaß has the ß but am really not sure about muss/muß)
Also your mercenaries were really good during the 14-15th century
Together with romanian, serbian and sometimes szekely mercenaries, Mihai the Brave  almost got into Constantinople and also formed something similar to modern Romania (which sadly only lasted 1 year)
Very debatable
Technically yes, but by a very little margin
We are in a political crisis which has already lasted >3 years
People are tired of it
Really hope to get rid of those snakes in power soon
Pretty much
People who lived during communism tend to also be bad at living in a capitalist society
Communism fell only 30 years ago, so still a lot of them
Isn't that what happened in the Netherlands
Dutch sounds like a German having a seizure and most words look like they were written by a person with dyslexia
Good thing they (still) have affordable healthcare to treat that sick burn
It's way less expensive than I have thought
Is this per year or per month
Yup, I think only Hungary can dream to even come close
I have seen news about lightbulbs in schools being supplied by the mayor's nephew and costing €7K per piece
This was just one example but man they are robbing the state (and, by extension, the taxpayers) blind
The only highway from Arad (western Romania, bordering Hungary) to Costinesti (our part of the Black Sea) is more than 80% in Bulgaria
Times change
Liberalism levels stay the same
I had an Austrian professor (at a German school) and besides of the accent, nothing was different
Might be he was deliberately trying to speak Hochdeutsch
Yeah, Hochdeutsch is a big fat lie I studied for 20 years
They use it on TV shows too, but it's all just a myth
Went to Germany and I couldn't understand shit
After 3 years of working closely with Germans, I still find it hard to understand them sometimes if they don't deliberately speak to me like I'm some sort of disabled donkey
Yup, I work with a certain Porsche subsidiary, with the HQ in Ludwigsburg, but they are open in München and also have offices in Romania too
I have other projects with people from Berlin (which speak differently)
The easiest to understand are people from western Germany and people who speak German as a 2nd language
We have some dialects too, but most people use the official language with few variations, which are mostly caused by illiteracy rather than culture/region
I don't think that's even physically possible in Bucharest,
In my city it will be cosidered very weird if someone does it
I went to UNI in England for 3 years and I found it odd when people did this, but I got used to it quite fast and I started doing it as well
But in Romania it would be so weird
We have multiple exits for the inner city buses and it would practically be impossible
That and the fact that people will look at you like you're some kind of a maniac if you wish some stranger a good day
We don't show empathy to one another
Only private buses
Nope, not really
Exactly the same in Romania
I am romanian working in China currently
I keep my mouth shut and I will never touch blizzard games ever again unless they do something
The reason that I keep my mouth shut is that here you can end up in prison quite easily if you have a stance against the CCP
Even my colleagues are brainwashed
Blizzard fucked up, and this is gonna affect them in the long run for sure
They tried to control the damage and it turned against them
What is "full centrism retardism"? It's the first time I hear this expression
Taking ALL the prize money
No other contestant got any money because of this
They had a very generic "catch all" rule that stated that if you do anything that offends Blizzard customers, Blizzard has the right to reduce the prize pool to 0 and take any decision they want
Still fucked up and very wrong
Because they would tell me .
France, Japan and Romania (because I'm biased)
I like how Estonia look
Romania because fish
Romania looks like a fish, aye
Lock on on the Tranzistria and Rp
Moldova Border
Ours just looks like a fish
Romania is a fish
Haha, fish go blublub
Why did you comment this
Feel free to have a look at a map
Are you seriously going to tell me that I've been looking at my *own country's map* my whole childhood and didn't see a [fish]
Do you even know which country Romania is on the map
Is this fish-shape envy
Is this what is all about
You know there can be more fish shaped countries in the world, right
It's not a competition
This will have huge impact on Europe since it will increase the refugee crisis and will guarantee more support for ISIS
It was a dick move by turkey
My opinion is that,like everyone here(except some turks),the kurds should have their own country,they deserve it because of their effectiveness in fighting ISIS
My country
right now no stance will be taken because the current goverment is likely to fall and a general election might happen
But in the future will be against Turkey
It's a very delicate issue here
Mostly is like trying to walk on eggs without breaking them - we need Turkey's military support here in the "neighbourhood" but at the same time we have been dealing with them for so long during history that we know "too much" of that force might turn wrong
90% of the "Turkish" people I met here in Bucharest are kurd refugees
Most of them don't talk about it and it's the type of topic they strongly avoid
Seems that Romania has given them asyle under some very strict terms and that's about it
Where is Vlad when you need him
We always were against Turkey
I meant in the region
But with an increase in both refugees in europe and support for isis there, we will also have more isis members on EU soil
With Americans I can absolutely every damn time tell that they're Americans
But I can't explain why
It's just something in how they speak that's just obvious
Maybe the volume
Or the attitude or the words they use
Idk
With other native speakers I can tell 80 % of the time, because there are some accents like the new Zeeland accent or some from the UK that I just assume they're Dutch or have a speech impediment
Most of the times I figure out someone is Brit/american, text-wise that is, by their complete disregard of the proper use of they're/their its/it's. Non-native speakers tend to be particularly careful of those, whilst most brits can't be arsed most of the time lol, even in office emails
In previous jobs seeing those mistakes in company emails/presentations drove me bonkers hahahaha
No biting in Romanian either
Instead, we most commonly say "a da colțul" (to turn around the corner, more or less), "a da ortul popii" (to give the coin to the priest, probably inspired from Greek mythology), "a întinde copita" (to stiffen your hoof - animal imagery, what can I say)
I don’t think we any expression with the verb to bite, not one that I can remember at least
We have “a da coltul” meaning to turn around the corner and “a-ti suna ceasul” meaning your clock has rang
+ “a-i suna ceasul” - “to have their clock alarm go off”
> a da ortul popii
Some more info: "ortul" which is the articulated form of "ort' comes from the German "ortstaler" - a quarter of an old leu or taler, and it referred to a Polish silver coin from 1600, like [this one printed by Sigismund III] in time "ortstaler" got shorted to just "ort".
When someone died you'd tie an ort to their right hand pinkie finger so they'll use it to pay their toll to the other side, it was also a symbolic payment (because an ort wasn't worth much) to the priest which would help you pass to the other side through the religious ritual that he performs
This pagan custom comes from Greek antiquity where they would place an "obol", a coin inside the dead person's mouth so they can use it to pay or bribe Charon, the ferryman who would pass them the Styx river into the world of the dead
Similar custom was done by Romans
Is the last word anapoda
We have that word in Romanian but I never thought about its origin
It means the opposite or the wrong way of doing something
The most slav of the latins
Our culture and language was mostly slavified during our time in the Bulgarian Empire, our people even using cyrillic until the 19th century, and we still share a nice amount of customs with the Bulgarians
Really our connection with the Bulgarians is underrated, our history is intertwined at so many points in time and it's a shame that our time in the Bulgarian Empires is so criminally unmentioned in our schools
We even got our independence in the same war (although we got full independence and Bulgaria only became a tribunary state)
A Romanian-Bulgarian state was actually proposed in the aftermath of the Russian-Turlish Liberation War, but the Great Powers went "no".
Clearly the handiness
If you give a Romanian guy some duck tape  and a hammer  he can probably build a car out of thin air
Also if you give a Romanian woman a potato and some onion she can feed 7 people out of it

Glad I chose to learn Norwegian and not Danish
Your language sounds sooooooo weird
I honestly found I was hearing an Italian guy mocking Arabs
Probably the cheapest on average
Here I get unlimited mobile data for 2€
I don't believe that's a real word and you can't convince me otherwise
I'd say this is a peculiarity of the germans
Very long compound words
I mean Bulgarian Empire although kind of incorrect just kind of stuck, same with how Romania (and even Moldova) is part of Balkans now
In our schools history entirely skips over the medieval era and some important parts like the Romans leaving Dacia and the Bulgarians taking over are barely mentioned
Its as if history just goes like "Romans take Dacia, Dacia is taken by Slavs, we fight Ottomans, Romania is formed". There was a thread too on r/askbalkans a while back about education systems and it seems that generally more is taught about the west than about us
It's pretty bad all around
The Bulghars were our main source of slavificstion and we also got along with them pretty well
Though I wouldn't consider myself a Bulghar fanboy
because we have big, untuaght history with it (hell, i just found out now and im 17 and in the last grade of school) and theyre our very similar neighbours
for example, a lot of dishes and foods share the same name such as musaka and ghiveci, dorada too (sea bream)
we arent too different, really, and its very important to appreciate them
I went to Crete 2 years ago, me and my brother rented a convertible to drive around the mountain roads for 1 day(bloody beautiful) and I noticed there are bullet holes in EVERY SINGLE ROADSIGN
Asked out tour guide the next day wtf is that and the answer we got was "Yeah they like shooting stuff in the mountains", we asked if gun control was that relaxed and she said "Nope but who's gonna go there and take them"
10/10 would visit again
Sarmale are a favourite in Bulgaria (though they arent named the same)
Truly our brothers
That's... long
For a second I forgot about other german speaking countries besides Germany, my bad for the generalisation
But now I'm curios, are there any other languages that do this or just the german language
I don't think that assimilating any language is a good thing, but since it happened for now we don't have much of a choice than to go with it and be proud of our language
Saying slavification didn't happen becaude we still speak a Romance language is like saying I didn't paint a wall because only a bit is actually with paint on, Slavs still had a major impact on Romanian
Early proto-Slavic groups were pretty similar as far as I understood, so there weren't many linguistic differences between say Bolghars and the other Southern Slavs at the time the migration happened
That explains why only 2% percent of the 11% of Slavic loan words we have
This is only talking about modern Romanian, which is after the big attempt to latinise our language after the 19th century when many slavic words were replaced
Previous to that an even bigger amount of slavic words were used, and Romanian was commonly regarded at that time as a Slavic language
And even if all of this were to be fake, Bolghars still had a huge impact on our history, calling me a fanboy of the Bolghars just for caring about that is really wrong
Ah yes, a worthy opponent
Yea, the people that tried to take us as slaves in the medieval age just because we didnt like the huge amount of taxes they inposed on us surely are our brothers
Nice strawman
Throwing out the fact that a food originates from one place and not from another doesn't really mean anything as to in what culture it can be traditional in
Saying "haha wine originated in phoenicia" can't contradict the fact that wine is a staple of Italy, France and Spain
Also the dishes do variate greatly across the cuisines they are popular in
Idk why you oppose the fact that we and the Bulgarians do have stuff in common, genuinely curious about that
Underrated thread of the day
A worthy oponent for the german language
We'll stay out of this one
How am I sucking their dick
Is simply acknowledging the fact that us and the Bulgarians interacted a lot during history and were most of the time on the same side sucking Bulgarian dick
And even so if it was why would sucking Bulgarian dick be bad
Either this  - old rap group who are still popular despite being way worse than their heyday in the late 90s - early 00s
or this  - old dance/ house group with a revolving door of featured female vocalists, still at it after 15 years
but my favorite is this  - new artist I first heard a few weeks ago, sounds pretty different compared to other pop singers here
According to YouTube trends, this shit:
Bine, asta in afara de dragostea din tei ofc
I came here for Înoată Cheluțu, I am disappointed
Păi aia nu mai e de actualitate, plus că ar sări moldovenii că le prezentăm artiștii drept români
Aș fi vrut să pun The Motans cu Alina Eremia - Din trecut, dar m-am abținut, pentru că e motanul din Moldova
Sorry to disappoint you
I didn't count Youtube meme songs
La mulți ani
In Romania it's definately Szekelyland,considering people there are mostly ethnic hungarians
Transylvania
Is easier to find people speaking hungarian than speaking romanian in some regions of it
Szekelyland - or Ținutul Secuiesc in Romanian
All people there are Hungarian
As a Romanian there are two regions that stick out
\-The  Szekelyland(Tinutul Secuiesc) an majority magyar region,with a seperatist movement and good food
Right now we don't get along to well,but we tolerate each other
\-Oltenia:This is definitly the Florida of Romania .It's culture is Romanian yes,but they have some weird atributes
They are known for being poor,speaking extremely fast and getting angry very easily,and when they get angry they get agressive
And well,there are numerous jokes about the fact that they always carry a knife/sword/machete/katana around from a very young age
This comes from the fact that the mafia is controlling large amount of the region,not even trying to hide it anymore
It has to be Vaslui,it's the Romanian version of Florida/Texas
Vaslui, that region is in another planet honestly
Oh and probably Harghita and Covasna as well, many hungarians live there and they are very odd to be honest
So it's not Moldova with all the grandma raping and medical alcohol drinking
Ah yes, Pula
Naww, it's not as alien
If anything I'd give the "crown" to Vaslui and environs
I'm glad to see the legend crossed international borders
Wow I see you have some pretty good skils of talking in Romanian i suggest you joining r/Romania a pot of fun and see what is happenig in here :)
You speak Romanian better than our former prime minister
In general "manele" which is more from the gypsy community but
[ this is a "disstrack" apparently
This guy is Morgz but 4 times worse
this one’s about the coronavirus:
this one’s literal propaganda for the social democratic party:
this one’s also a live performance
his name is dorel giurgiu and he was a eurovision contestant:
from the same man, we have a quick lesson in sex ed:
just a really yucky song
its title translates to “the streetwalker”.
this one’s about kendama:
this one is about fidget spinners:
this is
well, something
the video is a cinematografic masterpiece:  (title roughly translates to “i have too much money”)
this one isn’t outrageous or something, it’s just an anti-cop rap song, but the lyrics are reeeeally funny and you should look them up:
i can’t describe this song, honestly
look at the lyrics in the description:
again, it’s too much to explain
the title means “the pirate”:
funny song with funnier video:
You REALLY don't want to do this, but here  [
But if you meant 'worst' but more like catchy and viral, this was making waves around the internet the last years  [
Romanian Trap music
Its just bad
They copy trends from the US but do them shit
Romanian manele
It’s more annoying when someone blasts it from their cars at 2AM
From Spain reggaeton I would say, tho it's not really Spanish but we hear it way too much
And for Romania manele
Though I do like some songs
But most nope, most are like Romanian reggaeton lol
this is a mix between some kind of trap and cheap manele and it reassembles all the bad things in the country
Manele
Literally every song of that genre
Worse than anything in my entire opinion
Is this Backstreet Boys polish version
Oficial am murit înăuntru când am ascultat cântecul ala
We also have this artist called “Abi Talent”. He sings about almost the same things as in manele, but uses modern rap instrumental instead
I didn't know that
I only know them from eurovision and I remember liking them quite a lot lol
This is art
I think i was really lucky to not hear of any of those "singers" before
Aw but I liked them on eurovision
Würst music
Zdreanțo a venit Abi skrrr
Ik he's bad
Also Iron Maiden
Empire of The Clouds is one of my favourite songs
The whole album is so fucking good
Oh wow :))))
I have lived with my parents till 26 before I was able to save and buy my own apartment
I had a few girlfriends over many times
I have also slept at a couple of girlfriends places, who still lived with their parents
It's never been a problem, we would always exchange greetings, talk while eating after, or when running into each other
There is an unwritten rule that as long as the door is closed you don't bother one another
I guess, as long as you are polite and don't act rude, or like a dick, there shouldn't be any problems
Dude, just schedule it when your parents aren’t home, it’s not that hard and they’re mostly understanding
Neither I nor my brother brought back home a bf/gf
But for weeb virgin reasons mostly
In my hometown, in my friend group, most people were virgins before they went for university, or had some terrible sexual experiences, like a quick bj that didn't work, cuz the guy got nervous, or the guy missing the correct hole a few times, or the girl accidentally grazing the penis with her teeth, stuff like that
But after a certain age (like 16), parents just kind of understand that you want private time with your bf/friends in general and they don't really bother you
Lived with my parents until I was 30 and my girlfriend moved in with me when we were about 25
Even before moving in with me, she would spend a lot of nights there
Same thing for highschool/university years, there were two options: either my parents place or her parents place
Never had any issues
But you need to keep in mind, on average houses or apartments in Europe tend to be way better insulated than those in the US, so noise is not that huge of a concern
Sure, you need to keep it down a bit, but nothing that would impact your enjoyment
Also US folks  are way more prude when it comes to sex than Europeans
The only remarks I got from my mom were: "make sure you use condoms" or "do you have enough money for condoms
if not here is some to buy them".

When I visited Malta, I feared for my life a little bit because of how crazy the drivers are and how shitty the roads are
Plus, the hills make everything worse
"Deşteaptăte, Romăne
" mean "Wake up, Romanian
" and honestly i think it is one of the best anthems out there, not because it is my national anthem, but for its lyrics and its message
It just pumps me whenever i hear it
Here is a well done,rhyming english version on the Romanian one :3
Awaken thee, Romanian, shake off the deadly slumber
The scourge of inauspicious barbarian tyrannies
And now or never to a bright horizon clamber
That shall to shame put all your nocuous enemies
Its now or never to the world we readily proclaim
In our veins throbs and ancestry of Roman
And in our hearts for ever we glorify a name
Resounding of battle, the name of gallant Trajan
Do look imperial shadows, Michael, Stephen, Corvinus
At the Romanian nation, your mighty progeny
With arms like steel and hearts of fire impetuous
Its either free or dead, thats what they all decree
Priests, rise the cross, this Christian armys liberating
The word is freedom, no less sacred is the end
Wed rather die in battle, in elevated glory
Than live again enslaved on our ancestral land
Desteapta-te române or wake up Romanian, it's one of the best anthems in Europe honestly, also it's quote ironic seeing our current state and the government
Our anthem is not exactly about Romanian nationalism, it's about the individuals of us Romanians
My fav verses:
1) Că-n aste mâini mai curge un sânge de roman
Literally means "There's still Roman blood flowing in these hands". It reminds us of our Roman descent
2) "Viața-n libertate ori moarte
" strigă toti
Means : "Life in liberty or death
" all shout
Symbolic of our struggle for independence since we always were between some great powers: the Ottomen, the Russians and the Austrians
Similar to the Poles and how they were between the Germans, Austrians and Russians
Its the most fitting anthem in the world
In Romania we have "Deșteaptă-te române
" (Wake up Romanian
It sounds really cool
Kinda sad
Bloody amazing
Read ‘Deșteaptă-te, Române’ and tell me those aren’t the most beautiful lyrics you’ve read
OHMYGOD thank you for the metal anthem idea
And the title is fitting as well since we're all vampires
Yeah
I like our national anthem
Honestly I don't know anyone from Romania who hates our national anthem
The message is that we are eternal victims, opressed by enemies or by the circusmtances
It also says that the army is Christian and led by priests
I believe it perpetuates a defeatist/defensive mentality and it doesn’t speak to me at all
Edit: the melody is great, though
Maybe we should just update the lyrics
It sounds a bit sad to me
Agree ..we'll never wake up this way
Bruh i think the message is to stay strong and to provo the world that we are not "gyspies", or worthless, and yea, we've been under many empires, but we stood strong, and today most of romanians are under on flag
Besarabia and diaspora are missing, but its okay
At least we are no vassal, and we got Ardeal too :)
We have to start thinking positive if we want to wake up
But why
Mostly have my own in the countryside  [ .
And the Polish apples arrived
*Punga cu pungi* \- a bunch of plastic bags stored in another plastic bag
You keep saying you'll grab a bag from there next time you need to go to the store, but you always forget and end up buying another plastic bag which will be added to the collection
container for cookies that is actually filled with sewing supplies
definitely an old cross, or a painting of Virgin Mary, whether it be very old, or gifted; almost every damn person i know has those on the wall
[This] the beloved golden wall watch
In Romania every household has this kind of pot to cook "sarmale" in :
Also this bowl:
A big cast iron pot known as [tuci] mainly reserved for making polenta
Hmm barbecues maybe
Pretty much everyone has a barbecue
I was looking for this
The bag with bags sounds so fun
Mortal
We have *Sacul cu pungi in pungi
* where you can find bags ranging from the oldest textile bags from the 1970s to yesterday's "fuck I tought i had a bag" from Lidl
we have a nightlight, the type you plug into an electrical outlet, with jesus; it's kinda interesting how far it can go
A lot of our bird names are fucked up
Nightingale=privighetoare=overseer(feminine)
A ruff is literally called bully in Romanian (bătăuș),literally meaning the one giving the beatings
On top of that we have a bird called gypsy
La nani
Basically go to bed but it doesn't translate to anything childish
puf puf here
We sometimes call it fâs-fâs. :))
Hungarian has "csúszó-mászó" which basically translates as 'slider-climber'. Basically means any kind of insect or invertebrate (iirc)
I find the French word for peanuts hilarious: "cacahuètes"
>  On top of that we have a bird called gypsy
[This one ?]
Yep
one thing i've noticed about myself is that i use run-on sentences in writing
i think that gives me away as a non-native (had to stop myself from using a comma there)
in school we were taught the OSAShCOMP order of adjectives
opinion size age shape colour origin material purpose
romanian doesn't really have a set order to adjectives, so yeah, it was english
In my opinion in Romanian we "do sex"
same in romanian
a face sex can mean both to do/make sex
There's this Hungarian sweet roll (? idk if its the right term) that's pretty popular in my side of the country
It has a lot of poppy seeds and it's absolutely delicious
It's called [baigli]
As a food, used on pastries and as a nice wild flower
I have seen them in fields (where some other crops were planted) and people stoping to take pictures of them
Poppy fields are pretty widespread in Instagram photos
In Romania as well, I think it's probably shared in the Slavic/Baltic area (Romanian is Latin, but we have a lot of Slavic neologisms)
Wow, it's really funny to see how basically every country has something like this
Here we also have bird language (pasareasca)
After every syllable that ends in a vowel you add "p" and the vowel again
So "ce mai faci" (how are you) becomes "cepe maipi fapacipi"
Same in Romanian
I forgot what we called it
might've been 'bird language' like the OP
That’s the same in Romanian too
It’s called bird language
I'm literally from Romania and never heard of this ;-;
We have exactly the same thing in Romanian , we use letter P as well but the name is ... “bird language “.
Haha but how
Stii altfel de pasareasca
Ca alți oameni mi-au zis alte variante mai complicate (prima litera pusa la sfârșitu cuvantului și încă ceva)
N-am auzit de niciun fel de joc de genul lmao
Daca da, inseamna ca nu mai tin eu minte lol
Cred ca mai degrabă nu ții minte no se puedeee
Probabil lmao
Our neo-commies would let King Michael return home in 1990 and monarchy would be restored
Save Michael the Brave, so the 1600 unification of Romania would last longer, maybe even to this day
It would be interesting to see what this would mean for the europe of that time
We could've also advanced if Mutu wouldn't have missed the penalty or if Buffon wouldn't have saved it if you want , Italy got 2nd and we got 3rd they had 4 points and we had 2 if we would've won we would've had 4 points and Italy 3 ...
> I would make it so Michael the Brave wouldn't be betrayed and killed
That was one of my thoughts at first, but tbh I doubt that the regional powers in that time would have been fine with that
Thus the assassination
For Romania, it would probably be a "haiduc". Generally outlaws commiting robberies and other crimes, with a sort of "Robin Hood" attitude attributed to them, such as robbing the rich and giving to the poor, defending the lands from invaders and so on
Maybe Hajduci
Very popular in the Balkans, and are very different depending on the region
You can read more about it here:
The haiduci are outlaws who fought to protect the poor and the weak during medieval times and up untill the 19th century in the Romanian Principalities and later Romania
They used bows and later firearms,but the signature weapon was the baltag(a slightly larger hatchet with a hammer-like head as the blunt part of the weapon)
They were seen as excellent fighter,who would strive against tyranny and injustice
The "golden age" of the haiduci was during the fanariot rule(17th-18th century),when greek merchants were given the throne of either Moldavia or Wallachia by the ottoman sultan in exchange for large sums of money
To recover the money,they would place heavy taxes on the countries that were plagued by constant wars and civil strife
So many people became haiduci,robbing the lord and the boyars and givving the money back to the people
Even today,the word "haiduc" is often used to describe a rogue like individual,who fights with honor and is(to quote a popular play from my native area) "as beautifull as the sun".They were quickly romanticized,to the point where it was a common "fetish" for young romanian girls to sleep with haiduci(my great-grandma was proudly talking about her grandmother was apparently involved with such an individual)and some very famous would even bed the wife's of the boyars or even run away with them(and would only return them to their husbands after he would pay a hefty sum)
A haiduc from Wallachia was famous for the leaving the boyars with "empty pockets and a happy wife".
A remnant of those time is the tradition of "stealing the bride" at weddings
The friends of the groom would "steal" the bride(with her consent,obviously) and would not return her untill the groom would offer a reward
It's barbaric,I know,but if all consent to this,it can be pretty fun
The ransom is usually alcohol,but it's expected to be something expensive,like good wine,old cognac or even a crate of vodka
In Romania too (haiduc), but the stories about them have more like a Robin Hood vibe, outlaws liked by common people
I find it so surprising yet pretty cool that Hungary also has haiduc-types and sarmale (rolled cabbages) as a common-ish food
Maybe we’re more similar than either country likes to think
Eastern Europe was divided before Yalta, by Churchill and Stalin, no a napkin
They established which countries will fall in Soviet control and which In the UK sphere of influence
Greece was 90% western, Yugoslavia 50-50%. The rest (Romania, Poland, Bulgaria, Hungary, Czechoslovakia) got fucked
It was made official in Yalta
In Romania, Yalta is seen in a negative light because of that
We think UK lives up to the name of perfidious Albion and we don't think positively of Churchill
He is seen as the villain, because he sold us to Stalin
In Romania it's kinda sad since we lost Besaarabia forever but people don't see it as a betrayal(even tho Britain said that Romania would be treated as winning nation,because it was forced to ally with the Axis,but the Soviet Union prevented this)
I think you need to read about the pre-war circumstances of Romania and how it was forced to get on the Axis side in the WW2, because before Sudetenland happened, we were in the Little Entante alliance with Czechoslovakia and Poland (the good guys, right
But after Poland was partitioned in 1939, there were territorial claims from Axis minor allies Hungary, Bulgaria AND at the same time the USSR requested Romania's eastern regions in 1940
At that point the Soviets were not allied with the West (and we didn't had Finland's winter) so the only chance of survival was to switch to a Axis aligned party and then go all against the Soviets hoping to get Bessarabia and Bukovina back when the Nazis declared war to USSR
Terrible things which are inexcusable happened in Romania's administered territories during WW2, but then, when Soviets 'liberated' Romania during 1944, Romania's army helped Allied effort until May 1945 with heavy losses in Slovakia's Tatra mountains and reaching as far as the outskirts of Vienna and Brno in Czechia, losing 167,000 soldiers in the process
Historians say that Romania switching sides shortened the war by 6 months
After the war, the eastern regions of Romania comprising about 3 million people were lost to USSR, some southern region to Bulgaria, 50 years lost to communist rule, other 15 in a 'transition' to democracy - so yeah, we feel like Yalta was a betrayal
The deal on the napkin was done before Romania was occupied by the soviets
Even if the UK could not stop it, it officially gave a free reign to Stalin
Would it have made a difference if the deal wasn't struck
Possibly no, but we will never know for sure
Anyways, the question was about Yalta and how we see it
If it is correct or not, it is another discussion
You are right about the chronology
I stand corrected
Trains from Japan
I would copy the low level of corruption form Denmark or Norway or Finland
I want swedish school
That would change a lot of things I think
German discipline
It would get us rid or corrupt politicians as well and maybe we would actually get to sell our oil reserves
That would make the country as rich as Norway
The education system of Finland
*Wealth and power,* from the United States of America
Id like to copy Germany's work force/working people
Me too
Honestly same
I feel you, buddy
Thank you
Indeed the tube is what saves us
I also liked the one in London a lot
Sorry for that
The Nordic gang wouldn't be complete without Sweden
I don't know how I forgot about you
Any sistem is better than ours to be fair, but I think you're right
We kinda use it we kinda don't? Really, no one knows
Nope
But our government doesn't care about LITERALLY EVERYONE cutting down our forests
We have a beer ad which says they'll plant a tree for every beer they sell
Ţuica-spirit made out of distiled fermented plums that can taste great or it can taste like gasoline
Rachiu-spirit made out of distiled fermented pears that can taste great or it can taste like gasoline
Romania here
We have țuică (aka pălincă, rachiu), which is a brandy distilled out of plums
We also have vișinată, which is made out of sour cherries, grade alcohol, rum, and sugar
It is quite possibly the best liqueur I’ve ever tasted
In Romania - țuică or palinca
It is a spirit drink made out of distilled plums
Guys I would need some help with the taste, can t describe it
We have țuică,it is made out of plums,but it can be made out of any fermantable fruit really
vişinată. very high in alcohol and tastes like sour cherries
Țuica mare Turkish but most popular in România its very powerful
You guys make a pretty good vodka
Tuica face pe desteapta,hopa 3 pasi la dreapta ..
Gin is one of those drinks that you can't leave it alone
Gin is very good, but only for cocktails
Imo ofc
Unicum is Hungarian
Wow
TIL
Im Romania we make pălincă out of quinces as well and it is very appreciated
Visinata done well is possibly the best tasting drink
Sa inteleg ca ai luat niste tuica in primire
Sau mai bine  zis, te-o luat ea pe tine :))
Yes I agree
It’s so smooth and flavourful despite being quite strong
Best drink for a mildly chilly fall evening on a terrace
I live in Canada now and I miss it
might have to try and DIY some
It is fairly available
It's not that popular (considering it's bitter taste that's not a surprise), but you can find it
Me, personally i think it's decent
Being bitter you can drink it when drunk without getting sick easily
Well,not that hard
I learned it easier than i learned my own language
And  i learned it from video  games and youtube videos
Right now I am trying to learn german and comparing german with english, I think english is the easiest language that you can learn, even though your native language is not related with english
(eg
My native language is romanian, some kind of romance language related with Italian French etc
, some would say that it is also related to some slavic languages)
BTW If you have any good resources for german please let me know :)))
It's kinda hard for me to speak it, but as a whole it was pretty easy to learn
Just play a fuck ton of videogames and you're set
I speak it better than Romanian tbh
Romanian is an mediocre language to learn as a native, so I guess it must be stupid hard to learn it
It's easy even coming from a romance first language (my case Romanian)
They have a lot of french influences
Much easier than German
Also all popular media is made in English and sounds so bad when dubbed
Nope, is kinda appreciated
Not really
No,i think french is a harder languagge
nah, as a romanian who lives and studies in italy, i learnt english by myself in like 3 weeks by basically youtube and videogames
I NEVER studied from an english book, still my grades were only 8-9-10 in middle school, (in italy you can get from 1 to 10 as grades, idk in other countries) and now in high school i keep it with 8 and 9, no more 10 tho lol, but its good, considering that i never even look at my book, i just do homework on it
My other classmates can barely keep a conversation in english (im not a genius tho, i dont wanna be mean or something) just because the system here sucks
Its just memorizing and rules over rules
They make it wayyy more complex than it really is
i still make mistakes, of course, but i think thats normal
Well
depends from where are you from
If you are from a country like france or italy or spain,it looks simmilar
Its definitely not the same,but its somewhat simmilar because of the latin origin
But we have the same ammount of grammar as the german language
So first, if you dont want to dive into grammar and want to use it for just some conversation,you should learn things like  how tonsay hello,how to ask  something
Honestly, even I dont  know
Im 14 ,so dont expect the advice a teacher  would give you
I spoke so much in english online that I forgot some words
My tip is to start slowly
As slow as possible
We have some new petters compared to the english alphabet like ă ,â,î ,ț,ș .
Il fut**:)))
You're right, French is worse than Spanish, even if I don't try so serious to learn Spanish
But this is an idea for this year, I could try to learn some basic stuff in Spanish
The English was a little bit harder to learn for me than French, because they are more similitudes between Romanian and French
However, the learning of English wasn't even difficult for me, at least the basics
But, as in every language, they are some difficult problems like: the accent, the different constructions, my incapacity to learn
At first I thought they were talking about windows that can literally swing or something
As others have said these only applies to western Europe
“Bucharest” is “București”. So far I think it is the only city with an English name but it is quite different
Not a city, but all I can think of is that we call Switzerland Elveția
Between 2nd Balkan War and 2WW we had the nowadays bulgarian part of Dobrogea (Dobrujha) including the town of Silistra .We used to call it  Dârstor  from the latin Durostorum . Right now everybody call it Silistra and the former romanian name is no more than just trivia .One of Bucharest's neighboor is called Dristor due to a street from that period ( 1918-1940) that was named Dristor's street ( or Dristor way) .
&#x200B;
Also Cetatea Alba(White Citadel)  ( East of nowadays Republic of Moldova , on the Black Sea shore) belongs to Ukraine and it's called Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi .I think we lost it during Crimean Wars (but i might be wrong )
Not huge differences, but a few that come to mind:
The Hague - Haga
Warsaw - Varşovia
Pyongyang - Phenian
Nice - Nisa
&#x200B;
For countries, on the other hand:
Netherlands - Olanda
Switzerland - Elveţia
Warsaw: Varşovia
London: Londra
Not that different, but it is interesting how London is ‘Londra’ while other western cities haven’t changed that much
**English** - **Romanian**:
London - Londra
Lisbon - Lisabona
Athens - Atena
Moscow - Moscova
Krakow - Cracovia
Warsaw - Varsovia
Budapest - Budapesta
Debrecen - Debretin
Munich - Munchen
Pyongyang - Fenian
Most of the rest are about the same lol
London - Londra
Moscow - Moscova
Bucharest - Bucuresti
Copenhagen - Copenhaga
Venice - Venetia
Athens - Atena
Prague - Praga
Budapest - Budapesta
Rome - Roma
Also basically every city in Transylvania and Partium
we have more names for former romanian cities that now belong to other countries ( Cernauti - Chernivtsi or Darstor-Silistra or Cetatea-alba - Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi)
They don't have to be Romanian cities only
For example, while the English people call it Pyongyang, in Romanian it is known as Phenian
Iași is also Jassy
We also have translations for Hungarian cities close to the border
Szeged is Seghedin, Debrecen-Debrețin,
Almost the same as in the romanian leanguage we say Varșovia "ș" is pronunced as "sh" in shape for exemple
Yes, we do
Most people refer to it as Cluj
Yes, but op asked especially for English names
>  (We have a **unique** Hungarian name for most Romanian cities
For the ones outside of Transylvania, Banat and Partium, not really
ovbiously most the of the cities/towns in Eastern Europe don't have a special english name and only the capital cities have a english-ed name Kyiv->Kiev , Moskva->Moscow , Athina->Athens .So i considered the local name instead as that is usally the international /english name .
Nope, no local one
Google maps and Waze are the most popular
Personally I use Apple Maps, somehow it finds shorter ways on some smaller roads
Why not Apple Maps if you want to get rid of Google
Why is that
You must be funny at the parties
So yeah, Google is selling your data, but why would Apple (or on the same note Microsoft) do that
The money from your data would be insignificant for them and not doing that also helps their image
British Empire is the correct term
1 leu: a pretzel
10 lei: 10 kg of potatoes
100 lei: full course meal at a fancy restaurant and a pack of ciggaretes OR 1 litre Jack Danies (+/- depending on type)
Oh fun game
I don't -give the best examples but it's honest work
1 LEU - 1 cheap bread / 1 small bunch of parsley / 1 pretzel
10 - 1 block of cheapest Lidl cheese / 1 head of broccoli / 1 carton of 10 nicer eggs
100 - a cheap electric countertop grill / about 3kg of locally made sheep cheese / a pair of decent pants
1 leu - A loaf of bread or a baguette
Or one bulk cigarette
A cheap energy drink
10 lei - A kebab
But here it depends, the price of a kebab ranges from 4 lei (0
8 euro) to 30 lei (6 euro)
Or 2 subway tickets of 2 validations
100 lei - 2g of weed
Or an hour with a hooker
A decent pair of jeans or a T-shirt
1 leu: used to be a cigarette but they bumped up the prices, probably 2 pieces of gum and thats it
Maybe a loaf of bread,
10 lei: some fast food,a bag of chips and a bottle of soda, that sorta thing
100 lei: a tshirt,5 packs of ciggys (almost,its like 105),a solid amount of beer(about 30l), 2 bottles of rum, usually nothing that huge
Two months in a gym
Like a nice gym or a random one
Here for a nicer gym (with access to swimming pool) it's 100€ for one month
1 leu can also get you 10 jam candies
10 lei about 2 bags of chips or a carton of 10 eggs
100 lei can get you about a week's worth of food or 5 packs of cigarettes
maybe a decent restaurant, not a fancy one
The restaurant one is definitely not true, at least for Bucharest
Lmao where do you live
It's nothing like the prices I'm used to :))
Oh for sure, if you go and buy directly from the manufacturer it's much cheaper
But since most of us can't access that, we go for small artisan type shops, where its about 30-33 lei / kg
They usually have produce from various small producers in the country, or even make their own
București
Which prices specifically
I'm genuinely looking through hoping to see for what it stands for in my language because I don't remember this episode
Romania: no idea cause I don't even think they ever showed it on TV here, and if they did they started showing it when I was too old to watch it (and I'm only 23)
Same :(
It was on Nickelodeon
I mean, it still is
Feels bad :(((
I'm pretty sure Nickelodeon was never broadcast in Romania
Or at least not until recently
The only cartoon channels me and everyone I knew got were Cartoon Network, Fox Kids (which became Jetix and then Disney Channel) and sometimes Minimax which was a weird Hungarian thing
May be a region thing, we always had Nickelodeon too and we had a weird one KidsCo or something like it for a limited amount of time
MiniMax was always in Romanian to us
However when I visited around Transilvania they only had MiniMax in Hungarian, so as I said, may be regional
Oh, I'm not saying Minimax was *in* Hungarian, just that it's *from* Hungary
I'm from Constanța
Ahh, my bad
We only learn cursive in school
I thought print handwriting is only practiced in the US
I first learned printed-like when i was like 5 or 6 and when i got in school i learned cursive
In Romania you learn cursive and use it instead of printed-like
But i know some people who have a beautiful handwriying, even if automatically you write a bit worse when in cursive
In Italy you learn first printed-like and then cursive
But they dont give any importance to how you write, as long is it understandable
Personally e have a mix of printed-like and cursive, and many people say that for being a boy i have amaizing handwriting
Of course, only when i actually want to write properly, otherwise i would write an illegible cursive that cant even be understood by me sometimes lol
Yeah I presume OP has the same since I could probably be in moldova on foot in like 30 mins
Our countries basically speak the same language except for some regional specific dialect
When was this
I started with cursive and then learned big printed
We never learned small printed in the 90s.
I haven't been taught printed in school, I kinda teached myself(obvsly with the help of parents, siblings)
- Taxi drivers overcharge tourists
Always use Uber or any other available app
- Avoid strip clubs / night clubs in the Old Town in Bucharest
- Bran (Dracula) Castle is so overrated, imo
Vlad Tepes never lived there
- Don't give money to beggers, there's a whole begger mafia going on, especially in the city centers
- Don't buy the roses if women come to your table selling them
Also, regarding the deaf mafia, did all of them move to Hungary
Haven't seen one of those in like 10 years lol
I wouldnt call Bran Castle overrated
Not worth the visit alone but if you're around Brasov they might aswell check it out
Looks like you aren't traveling by train (lucky you)
Because that's not a taxi, it's ride sharing
They pretend they'll give the rose for free to the women at the table, but then won't leave until you give them money
If you refuse, they basically start shaming you that are cheap and make a scene
They are basically forcing you to buy roses
It works like a taxi should work maybe
But in some cities around eastern Europe, like Bucharest, many of the taxi drivers are impolite, smoke in their cars, don't use AC, drive like crazy, overcharge (have fixed prices to go in different areas)
While the so called ride sharing drivers (uber, taxify etc) are more professional because they can get banned from the platform if their score drops below a certain level
So yes, we do differentiate the taxi drivers from the "ride sharing" ones because the services delivered by the two categories may be slightly different :)
Yes, but this is not the point people are making in the thread
'Traditional' taxis suck and will try to rip you off; ride sharing like Bolt and Uber attract better people (for now)
I mean it is uncommon in Romania, not all restaurants cook octopus, but I ate them with multiple occasions and they are very tasty
Very good if cooked
If you are talking about that strange Japanese habit of eating them alive, hell no
As long as it's not alive, I'm totally up for it
It tastes awesome
It's funny that you think americans know anything about tasty food
Unless it comes with fries,milkshake and a slice of freedom,most of them won't eat it
Vaslui, and Moldova in general, for being the drunk people region
Also teleorman for poorness and corruption
Vaslui is if Alabama and Florida fucked and it was raised by alcoholic russian parents
Vaslui is the Florida of România
You could literally replace Florida with Vaslui and all the stupid news are the same :P
For Romania that would be Vaslui, where drinking vodka or rubbing alcohol makes no difference to the average citizen
Vaslui for Romania
Vaslui here is getting memed for its really agressive people
Vaslui, just vaslui
Vaslui : Beating your wife, rape, murder and others
Transylvania/Ardeal : Slow
Moldova: Drunks
Bucharest: Assholes and bad drivers
Timisoara: Folk and exaggerated "youth life"
Cluj: Untold
Constanta: Invaded by people from Buchatest during summer
And cocaine
Brasov: Invaded by people from Bucharest during winter
Caracal: Nothing makes sense there
Covasna/Harghita: Hungarians, we make fun of the hungarians there
In Romania we have memes about the Vaslui county, here happens most of the crazy stuff :))
Like this one:
Vaslui for epic knife duels and drinking hand sanitazer
Definitely Vaslui
We call it romanian Florida now
And Oltenia for the PVP sword battles
Cluj for not having a metro and being the bEst CiTy eVEr
Moldova as a whole not so much but Vaslui definitely (drunk people, poor people, rapists etc
Also Teleorman like you said, and Brăila for the knife crime (disclaimer: I am from Galați)
Would also say Cluj because they are seen as stuck-up with exorbitant rent prices
Was looking for this comment
Aprob :))
I love Cluj, it's so cool, went there last month, they got the best buses ever, did I tell you its cool
It's awesome, I wanna fuck it
It's the best
It's THE city
Oh and it's cool too
Ah look a salty Bucharest person
Is the Galati-Braila beef still a thing
Romanian Moldova
No, mainly because of the healthcare system
Our public healthcare is shit, but at least it exists, and our private system is very affordable if you have a decent paying job
The gun culture is also scary
I think John Oliver put it very well: "You did a great job of selling yourself";
That's why most people that will go to the US are either from the high-class (which, indeed, if you are rich or highly educated in a productive field -- you're golden there) or from the lower-bottem (which simply have a hollywoodian interpretation of the US);
While 10 or 20 years ago people from my country moved there because we were shitty, it's surprising to see that some people from my country are still trying to illegally cross the Mexican-US border (it's even more surprising to see some get asylium in US or Canada)
Personally, I wouldn't since the country seems so divided and focused on the wrong issues it all feels you're entire system is hanging there on a thread
On the other hand maybe I just see it this way from the outside and if you're used to it then it feels normal and safe
I wouldn't, U.S.A land of the free if you're fithy rich, you get fucked even as middle class and the health system is just
let's say a bad joke
Plus with my personality i think i'll get shot by police at  a normal routine check
I could go for a few years for the sake of better pay so i can save some money
But don't see myself living there long term and would especially not start a family there
I find it a gross violation of human rights not giving mothers the right to have paid ( or at least unpaid) leave to care for a new child or recover after child birth, some women beeing expected to go back to work the next day after beeing discharged from the hospital
As far as I understood the bank credit system (which is similar to that of China's social credit system), Americans online use the saying ”It's better to have bad credit score than none at all
” What does this translate to me: in order to get a loan to (supposedly), buy your home, buy your furniture, buy your various homewares, you need to build up these invisible useless bank points to be eligible to receive a loan
What's worse from what I've understood, American banks use a more pervacious system in granting loans (personalisations) than what I know it's being done in Romania (which says something, given we have a corrupt *governor* & his team at the national bank working with foreign banks for their benefit)
I detest the federal system or anything related to federalism (including council bi-laws)
It is neo-feudalism + bureaucracy
I'd rather have a strong parliament (*congress*), executive, and presidency than empowered local barons (mayoral, county council, prefecture/governor, police commissioner
The healthcare system
Apparently, if you're stupidly wealthy, you're nearer to having your cancer cured (*obvious hyperbole*), but if you've been beaten by life, you might as well jump in front of an 18-wheeler
Joblessness and gigs
I never understood the obsession with Americans and ”having jobs” if a lot of them require a second or third job to get by in life
To me, that is madness mixed with social anarchy
None of them, not even their politicians, never suggested about well-paying jobs without having to require a second one (much less a third one)
I never understood their terrible condition with lack of industrial jobs (no, not gigs; for some reason they're often overlapped)
I see this in Romania as well, everything is based on services & import
All of those are [bullshit] jobs
The paying system
People are afraid to talk about salaries
What's worse, apparently, their mini-bosses & big bosses are stealing from their wallet, by paying some bigly than the rest
That is full-throttling discrimination, no matter who's being discriminated, using the ”pay by the hour” scam
University/College fraternal & sorority clubs
Those are festering the principle of consolidation (corruption) that you see in elevated orders & clubs (such as Freemasonry, Rotary, and others)
Then, you hear about ”networking”, which is an euphemism for corruption-related favourtism, nepotism
It isn't an accident that American elites & dynastic families form connections via those links
The speeding limit
Americans undoubtedly have better roads, highways, express than us
*but*... even when you drive on a highway or express road, *everybody* (including those in luxurious cars) drive at the same limit of 113 km/h - 120 km/h. That is madness, they have the infrastructure to drive but because of the federal system & bad legislature, everybody is confined to 113-120 km/h mark
I've acquaintances who visited the country after being ridiculed by the embassy with the temporary visas
They visited Las Vegas
They've sent me messages that a flamboyant rich driver in his Bugatti was driving at the same speed as the bus they were in, while on the highway/express road
I didn't believed them until they've sent me photos & clips
Afterwards, they found more about the traffic rules and later told me what they've been told
And no roundabouts in traffic intersections, *why*? You solve the human chain problem in cities by adding traffic lights, but you need roundabouts nonetheless
I can't forgive the US system for not engaging in purging (hanging) the communists, securocrats, with their families
Instead, they've accepted their money & their children in schools, only to replace their parents & relatives here
And people wonder why decommunisation failed
And now they're cynically lecturing about anti-corruption, when they've helped communists & securocrats (and their families) have an easy life
No justice
I would live for one year, and that's it, for experience
I would not move there for my entire life or for a long time because I consider that US has a lower quality of life than Western Europe
You know it's bad when not even romanians would go
I asked my mom and grandmothers numerous times about those things
They always talked openly about it within reason (they didn't tell me about certain things when I was younger)
In some families, it is a "taboo" thing, not to the extent that a young woman will be pregnant and not know what her mom's experience was, but more like her mom wouldn't give too many details
Women in Ro tend to "hide from men" when those kinds of conversations happen and so it becomes this very intimate exchange between generations that can't be viewed from the outside
The idea that pregnancy talk could be considered a private topic is a new concept to me
Most married women get pregnant, and most pregnant women seek advice and guidance from those that have experience with the thing
From my perspective at least (as a female), people tend to be really private about pregnancy here, and in my opinion it can be because of the education level, as people either don’t know what to say/ ask or because they fear what they say might sound wrong (Gica contra avem la tot pasul)
Personally I never heard an en detail story of anything from pregnancy to periods or w/e, and I’m pretty sure I won’t too soon
Nobody is gonna pull you aside and tell you everything
That's my experience at least
But when I asked older women (especially when I wasn't "too young" to know these things), they would look around, make sure it's a safe space and then blabber on about it
Maybe you're in a more religious environment, idk
Barbecue with beer for me my friends and most of relatives
Here in Romania is cheese with tomatoes and maybe some eggs with some salami
Just what you find in your fridge
> mizeria
Interesting, in Romanian this translates to squalor
So basically a cucumber salad according to Google
Netherlands= Olanda (tho it's close to Holland)
Switzerland= Elvetia
Latvia= Letonia
Frenchies say Allemagne for Germany, for some baguette reason
Poland - Polonia
The netherlands - Olanda
England - Anglia
Hungary - Ungaria
Norway - Norvegia
If you want to know how your country is called in romanian, leave a reply
We call Latvia "Letonia", I'm not really sure why though
I talk hungarish tho and every country is like 90% called different like some have orszag(country)
Mostly, just a lot of ‘ia’ on the end of things
Ungaria instead of Hungary, Turcia instead oh Turkey, Polonia instead of Poland, Anglia instead of England, Spania instead of Spain, Germania instead of Germany
We’re Latin like that
Switzerland - Elvetia
United Kingdom - Marea Britanie (Big Britain)
Netherlands - Olanda
A lot of people call german something along the lines of Nemtzi
We call them Germans, but we also call them Nemți (read as Nemtzi with the e not on the i)
The Russians do it too
I heard germans used to call the
French, Italians, Spanish and Romanians Welsches, but I don't know if that's a popular term or what
Edit: Fun story the Romanians back in the days used to be pretty uncultured so they weren't smart ebough to tell english from french from german, and whenever they saw a foreigner that looked european they'd call them"Neamț" , "Nemți".
But why do you say mogyor for peanuts
Similarly to how a region of Romania, another Latin nation, is ‘Walachia’, and we were formerly known as ‘Vlachs’. It’s from a Germanic word for the Romans
I wonder if it has any connection to why Romania was called Walachia by outsiders in the middle ages
How is the j pronounced
As in English or in German
And outside of Europe theres "Birmania" for Myanmar
Close, Bosnia si Herzegovina
No, I mean that Myanmar is outside Europe
Not really
I only know one from a Romanian speaking country, that being Mall Dova (pronounced the same as Moldova) in Chișinău.
Not a terrible pun, but I was once in Germany (I think I was in Stuttgart) and there was a barber shop called "Hair-o-mania". It drew my attention because "Hai Romania" is a phrase used often to encourage the Romanian national football team (means something like "let's go, Romania". I will never now if that barber shop was owned by a Romanian, but if it was, then that name was brilliant
For us it’s either Mihai Eminescu - Luceafarul (somehow Reddit doesn’t consider this a valid link:
Or Miorița -
We have a national poet - Mihai Eminescu
His most famous work is a 98-stanza love poem called Luceafărul - - which I am now finding out is considered the longest love poem in world literature
Teachers loved the shit out of Eminescu, we all hated him because of the Shakespeare-like way of writing that had such a weird flow to it
For Romania I'll have to go with "Luceafărul" or The Evening Star, by Mihai Eminescu
I don't know what to say about it tho, I haven't read it
I didn't think of Miorița. But it"a very good choice tho
We once had a monkey roam free in Bucharest for a while, you can thank the local mafia boss for that
We  have stray dogs witch are a big problem and foxes witch eat our chickens also wild ferrets witch eat our chickens and cats that wander around all day if you have a neighbour with like 7 around
Also in the mountain areas bears started to become a problem and are getting more and more active like trashing orchids and trash cans
Living in Bucharest
For a long long time in the past we had a major problem with stray dogs
Most of them were friendly and they were minding their life
well
most of them
Until one day when the gov approved a national "purge". All of the stray dogs would be captured by the animal control and sent to special zones where they will be either adopted or
eventually
*euthanized*.
You will still find a dog here and there but it's not a problem anymore
Now there are a lot of cats where the dogs used to live
tbh I would take the cats
In the countryside : a fox(I think) ate 5 of our little bunnies, We often find pheasants trying to eat our garbage
ferrets,squirrels, snakes,so many moles
managed to catch one last week
In the city ..cats,cats everywhere
Outside of some meats/sausages the problem for me is seasoning
I am more into aggresive flavors, spiciness and Northern European dishes, on average, are just bland
They're made to be hearty and use all available crops to cope with the colder and rougher climate so was more practical, I guess, whereas  Mediterannean cuisine for example has a more varried selection of spices and herbs
I don't know about others, but I simply don't like fish and most of their dishes are made with fish
Who considers northern European food bland
I am Romanian and when I went to England once, I loved their food
I like meatballs
Because the English colonised half of the world and *still* can’t cook a decent meal
Smells like it too
dang it
Cooked
We only use it in salads, thinly shredded, with a bit of vinegar and salt, tastes like a coleslaw variation without the sauce but with a different flavor than regular cabbage (which for salad receives a dose of salt, oil and pepper)
Both need some manhandling after shredding and adding salt (it softens it)
"Sfântul Imperiu Romano-German" (the Holy Romano-German Empire)
In Romanian we call it *Sfântul Imperiu Roman* (Holly Roman Empire), but another version that is not very used is *Sfantul Imperiu Roman de națiune germană* ( Holly Roman Empire of German nationality)
Sfântul Imperiu Roman, it's the same as in English but Empire and Roman are inversed
"Sfântul Imperiu Roman" (Holy Roman Empire)
"Sfântul Imperiu Romano-German" (Holy Romano-German Empire)
"Imperiul Romano-German" (Romano-German Empire)
I saw your username and bursted out laughing
Thanks for that :)
Or simply "Sfântul Imperiu Roman".
Well that's how I heard his name when he was on the news back in 2001
It means "A [sarma] Bin Laden" or "A Bin Laden sarma".
And here I thought it is "o sârmă" (wire), not "o sarma". :))
Me too, because I use/hear the term "gălușcă" more often than "sarma".
No, I would say that we actually use more and more loanwords from English
No, quite the opposite, there are many english words that became part of our vocabulary in the last 20 years
Well, it's not an organization per se, but you'll get a bunch of elitist "intellectuals" that will Wang their finger at you for using certain loan words
There is also a wave of romanticizing the countryside or the folklore that can go from wearing "traditional" clothes sometimes to flat out hating on anything modern
And tbf there are a bunch of uneducated idiots that don't even bother to speak the language properly so yeah
So much so that many people use them involuntarily
Tbf, there are bunch of technological advances that we are completely left out of and you learn of those things only from sources written in other languages
I'm talking about how in our universities they generally teach the "principle" of the method which generally means the super old method that all the new methods are built on
So when you go to the work place you have little to no vocabulary about certain stuff
(I'm mostly talking from experience with pharmacy school in Bucharest and biomolecular lab work in Germany)
While it’s true, you didn’t have a good example because you are talking about two different countries, of course the terminology is different
My point is that we aren't taught certain things and so we're forced to learn new techniques from other countries written in other languages
If our universities bothered to update their curriculum maybe we'd have a vocabulary for those methods
And my example was my personal experience transitioning from pharmacy in Ro to medical research (a field I was trained for in theory) in another (let's face it more advanced) country
And the terminology should be easy to translate
It's the same, just în 2 different languages
I am very good at English if I do say so myself, but I just can't remember the difference between lay/lie, especially in the past tenses
I just avoid them as much as possible
I constantly say "open/close the lights". Because to open and to turn on are the same in Ro
Also, I mix up leg and foot, because we have only one word for both
Store and magazine
(Magazin = store in Romanian)
Stationary shop and library (librarie = stationery shop)
Honestly, the ones I used to get mixed up, since I don't think I do anymore were learning and teaching since the same word is used for both in Romanian
That was back when I would translate Romanian to English in my head, now it's much simpler when I can actually think my sentences in English
The word “Pollution” , at first,I tought it meant “Poluție” , but that actually “Poluție” is when you have a...uhmm,sort of a wet dream
Romanian
Consistently and consistent (about food, like it's a highly dense meal)
In romanian we have a hole group of words that are similar to english we call false friends
They are almost the exact same words but have different meanings
I have a C1 level certificate in english so I don't get them mixed up but a beginner might
Here are some examples
The word magazine in english (a journal/publication ex
The forbes magazine) and the romanian word magazin( pulral magazine, which means store/market ex
Amazone or Tesco)
The word library in english( which is a place where you can read/rent books) and the romanian word librarie (which is a place where you buy books, notebooks, pens, etc .  Properly translated to book store, the romanian word for library is biblioteca)
I never mix up any words in English, oddly enough I mix up words in my native Language
Turtle vs tortoise is more of a biological difference, I'd say
A turtle is a more generic word that means all animals with a shell, etc
Tortoise is specially a land dwelling turtle
and terrapin is a turtle that lives both on land and in water
Source: Romanian doesn't have separate words either (we just call them 'lad turtle', 'freshwater turtle', etc), but I had to learn the English words when I got a terrapin and there were no Romanian websites about their care
Tbf, I didn't know "affect" was a word until recently
I just used "effect" for both
Actually, paid is the correct form
That's one brutal sentence
Wait
They're not supposed to sound the same
Stefan the Great - Ștefan cel Mare
Romanian criteria are:
A.) Be the ruling monarch of Romania or one of its provinces
B.) Fight the Turks, Hungarians, or Russians
Mostly the former two
It’s not particularly a narrow list
Other than that, we have Burebista and Decebal, two Dacian kings who unified the Dacian kingdoms at different points in History, the latter of whom fought the Romans to varying degrees of success
One of the most important is King Mihai the Brave, who unified Romania 3oo years before it was cool
Then he was almost immediately assassinated
Vlad Dracula is of international fame, but we Romanians certainly love him our fair share since he fought the turks and almost, *almost* managed to win strikingly
Ferdinand von Hohenzollern, although he came from a German noble house and was related to the King of Portugal I think, also unified Romania after the First World War, during which he became king
Unfortunately, his successors didn’t manage to keep it together, and now we’re split again
Do we have a guy with the the same name
I'm confused now
Arsenie Boca and Mihai Eminescu, as well
Yes, both our ministers have the same name
People are usually joking about this, as the prime-minister said himself
That's a real glitch in the Matrix
That, my friend, would be a real nightmare
My grandpa has a list of things he thinks the commies invented:
-aliens
-climate change
-atheism
And many more
Like a month ago there was a flat-earther meeting in Cluj-Napoca
Seven people were present and it was the biggest one ever on the territory of Romania
Does this answer ur question
That is actually true, it was present in almost every news source
I mean there's 2 groups
The older uneducated communist and corrupt generation that already is driving us insane
Then there's the young don't give a shit about anyone and anything generation
Though I should make myself clear, there are good apples and bad apples in all generations, but that's the observation i made
Anti Vaxx is a bit common here sadly
Well not really
There may be a few old people that are too christian to believe in this but they will go away in 30 years
No and that is a miracle, my country is full of dumb people
Totally, especially anti-vaxxers
Flat Earthers and climate change deniers are quite rare though, but all this anti-medicine movement is pretty popular unfortunately
Starts to gain momentum, especially in the western side of the country
You hear from time to time about antivaxxers and there are some antivaxx militants in the public space that get interviewed from time to time
I was not aware that there was a flat earth movement in Romania until I heard that this year took place the first flat earthers conference in Cluj-Napoca (Center-West)
But homeopathy more common from my personal experience (my mom used to medicate me with homeopathics when I was a kid and now when I have a medical problem, she pushes me to use it)
Our parents' generation (born 1960-1980) is generally Internet and technologically illiterate and believe everything they see on TV or on the web
Many follow weird conspiracy-themed facebook pages that say a lot of stupid things such as: the existence of a portal to another world in the Bucegi Mountains, the mysticism sorrounding Dacian society (ancient people living in the space of today's Romania), freemasons, antivaxx, etc
Another thing that is prevalent, mostly in the ranks of women, are those pseudo-new-age beliefs that combine every possible religion on our Earth and make a nonsensical soup that they take for granted, without any critical thinking
Also, essential oils
Romanian here, and can confirm, when I searched about Flat Earth belivers, I found a lot of articles about it, but when I searched about anti-vaxx all I found were articles disproving that they cause autism, not talking about them, haven't searched climat change deniers tho
WW1 really spiced up Romanian-Hungarian relations
We went from paprika to at least horseradish levels
Nowadays it's chill, except for extremists on both sides, but they are fairly low in number
WW2 lost us what is now the Republic of Moldova (again) and also made us a communist state for 40-something years
Overall, this made Romanians dislike Russia a lot, maybe even hate it
Oh yes
WW1 had good effects on Romania, and WW2 undid most of it
The relationship with Hungary is awkward at best, we don't know how to feel about Ukraine and Russia, there's Moldova with whom many romanians want to unite and others don't, which sucks alot
42 years of communist regime and the corrupt aftermath of a young re-established democracy by hardcore communists
How about Slovakia and Croatia
Hungarians still consider them "lost teritories"? Or just Transylvania is consider like that
Yes there are plenty of political parties, most of them are ruled by extremists and dont have any sort of power and everyone condiders them a joke but everytime an accident or a conflict between romanians and magyars starts Budapest starts to accuse romanian goverment and Bucharest starts to accuse hungarian goverment is still a difficult relationship
Huh
What genocide
Well
any English speaking medium will inevitably attract Americans since they're the largest English speaking country
This being by default an English speaking forum it automatically eliminates most of the people who don't speak it, as you can see in this subreddit we all communicate in English
I too feel isolated at times, but there isn't much you can do
I would love to discuss things and learn about South Americans, Asians, Arabs, Africans etc but here is why they are not and will never be pervasive on such a medium as reddit:
South Americans, Spanish and Portuguese speakers, there are enough of them to form their own Spanish/Portuguese internet bubble and probably have forums in their respective languages, too few have an interest to post on an English speaking forum when they simply can communicate in their languages
Asians, probably language barrier, and also there are enough of them to form their own internet bubble, plus China censors stuff
This aside from the fact that they are also very different from each other and language barriers abound
A thai and a south korean have next to nothing in common culturally
They are probably as curious about each other as we are of them
Arabs, except for those who live in western countries and a few very wealthy but tiny states, as a whole are not very proficient in English, hence they don't have a real presence as a culture on here
Africans, aside from the lack of internet access and education, they are also divided between English and French as a second language
There are African centric forums on the web but they don't seem to be very active
Also Africans are a very diverse bunch, and don't have that much in common with each other, and language barriers abound between them
Only ones who seem to have a big footprint are Indians because they speak English as a second language, are tech savvy and are huge in numbers so you'd inevitably bump into one every now and then
Americans and English speakers in general are by far the most common users of the internet and reddit simply because it is English speaking (most of it anyways, and this discourages other language speaker from joining or contributing)
I only think that Americans force us in believing that, mistaking the diversity of countries on purpose
I personally find my subteddits 60% European 40% american
Try r/autos seems a bit less American centric
They have concepts like 'race relations'. When I first heard of this I thought it was something related to motorsport
I always put garlic when I fry them, and eat with ketchup/mayoneese
So do we, but we get Americana instead
Joking
You're welcome to join us over here
>  Europe desperately needs its own social media
Amen
We are behind all other major powers
China and Russia have their own, while we rely on the US
This is terrible for our culture, security, privacy, economy etc
Clearly you've never been to the Balkans
Turkish cultural influence is still pervasive
As a Romanian I honestly feel our culture has more in common with Turkey than Scandinavia
That is a characteristic of their culture
They've been so American centric for their entire history and only recently woke up to the rest of the world and extrapolate their narratives and perceived issues as if they were a problem everywhere
IGNORANCE at its finest
Ridiculous
It gets to a whole new level of ridiculous when they start preaching to others
Give r/autos a try
Where are you from
I fully agree about flat-earthers, it's obviously just a meme and it's not like we have to constantly show how smart we are by pointing out that a meme is factually wrong
But anti-vaxxers are real as fuck
At least in Romania, there's **plenty** of them
Everytime a news website posts some news about vaccines (but also other "alternative medicine" stuff) on Facebook, the comments section is full of these people, and with real accounts
Also, I think everyone here more or less knows at least a person who opposes vaccines
And I say this from my more "science-based" bubble of friends/family
True
Media isn't doing much to challenge these morons either
Olivia Steer should be put in jail or declared 'persona non grata' and sent into exile somewhere far far away
Also 'plenty' doesn't mean they are a significant percentage, around 90% of children born do get vaccinated, which is kind of low compared to other Euro countries
There are fines now for refusing vaccinations, so the percentage should steadily rise
Maybe I didn't make myself clear, not in the sense that we are like the Turks far from it actually, however,  we have clear straightforward Turkish influences in our culture, certain customs, way of doing things and handling ourselves, foods, words, people's mentality etc are similar even if we don't like to admit it
Our freakin' national dish is turkish in origin and name
I feel more at home in Istanbul than in the west simply because the people are so similar, they are like us in many ways, even if they have a different language and religion
In school we are taught the Turks were the archenemy, in reality extensive geographic, cultural, historic, religious and trade ties bind us and have done so for centuries
Outside the times we did fight with them we cooperated, traded and had extensive diplomatic ties
If you look at paintings of Romanian boyars made before the middle of the 19th century, you will notice they dressed and groomed themselves after the fashion in the Ottoman empire
They had long beards some even wore turbans (even if they were Christian), wore salwars etc
They are indistinguishable from the Turkish aristocracy of the time
We don't talk about it but in any museum you go, you will notice it
Also we have quite a few family names that indicate Turkish origins, like for example Turcu or derivatives (literally means 'The Turk') its very common
We have a lot of Turkish words in Romanian as well but not half, perhaps 5% or so of common words (words used in regular day to day speech)
There used to be a lot more but during the 19th century the language changed a lot, and many words were replaced with italian, german, french neologisms
That woman sounds mentally deranged to me
Leave the Americans to themselves, many of them are brainwashed with their own culture and world view, and they think everyone should be like them
Also their 'white privilege' and all their gone mad, childish and ridiculous political correctness, they don't realize this stuff does not apply to all white people
Eastern Europe has no colonial past, quite the contrary
Yes, I become a bit friendlier
Actually yes, I think I become more extrovert when I speak English
But this may be because I have more courage talking online than in real life
no wtf
>An alternative explanation is that differences arise between native and foreign tongues because our childhood languages vibrate with greater emotional intensity than do those learned in more academic settings
As a result, moral judgments made in a foreign language are less laden with the emotional reactions that surface when we use a language learned in childhood
Hell, this happens to me when speaking Romanian outside of Bucharest
I think it's common to change style in different regions of a country though
I read your post in Schwarzenegger's voice
Probably because you learned your mother tongue naturally while English in a more formal setting, both at school and from media

Where do you see the EU in the next 20-30 years
Will more countries join the union
Or will there be more wishing to leave
The large expansion and the global crisis in the 2000's bassicaly guaranties that adding a new member is a no-go
Eastern Europe still hasn't caught up and not all of them are even trying
Eastern Europe sees EU membership as a ticket out of poverty and not something you also need to invest in
It's seen as a 3rd party thing from Brussel
And Romania and Bulgaria have shown why letting someone join with such a mentality is not the best thing
Thus their slow integration
Furthermore, EU works if everyone is treated as equal and Poland and Hungary have also shown the great weakness of such a policy and how it can be used in a negative way
Malta and Cyprus still sell citizenships affecting basically the power of EU sanctions
And finally Brexit has shown how populism can be used to shoot yourself in the foot
The only good news from Brexit is shuting down anti-EU nationalistic rethoric
Albeit, that's just one economic crisis from being reignited
Personally I hope North Macedonia and Georgia get to join
They are the only 2 countries which actively try to align and join EU and they are the 2 countries that should get the most help
I'd love to see Serbia and Moldova in the EU but realistically it's probably not going to happen
The rest of the balkans seem to be stuck in time
But they all now have great free-trade plans and all chances to change their countries if they truly want to
This is more then other similar countries in less fortunate parts of the world have
I also don't think much will change within the EU towards federalisation, nor the other way
I think the long-term-plan right now is to ensure EURO will be a global alternative to USD and further steps will be done towards this goal and more economic unity
This also means we'll see more FTA's in the next years
The EU is a slow build project that, due to external factors, found itself moving too fast for some
I think most will want to just let things settle and people getting used to how things are first
Honestly with the current state of it, the future seems a bit grim, unless something good happens
Though I think that it will either fall or have more members: North Macedonia and Albania preferably
> Why pay local workers more when you can get cheap labour from elsewhere
Don't forget the part where they wage wars for resources leading to the forced dislocation of millions of people from one country to another, which they again profit from through cheap wage labour and otherification of migrant groups in order to sew divide among the people and keep the focus on these folks that are running from bombs and environmental disasters or for a better chance in life
> wildly different cultures, politics and not even a unifying language or religion
Usually when people speak about unification of Europe they don't mean it in the sense of a single culture/language/religion
That will never happen and should never happen, our cultural and linguistic diversity is what brings us together
And in fact I'd want unification, through whatever form it may take, to empower these cultural differences
Sure, we could have and we already do kinda have a language (English or rather Euro-English to the dismay of native English speakers) that we use to communicate to Europeans from a different culture
But I think that's pretty much the extent it'll go
We'll always have our native language(s)
On this topic, can you lot start speaking Gaelic more often
It's such a beautiful language
Oh, my apologies
I in no way meant that, I was commenting on the previous person's post about neoliberals, which have both started and profited off wars
> Lack of shared language is among other things what will impede people from feeling united, and won't help create a shared European citizenship when certain languages will naturally beat out others at the top most levels
That's why I was thinking of English as lingua franca, it's already quite common and from where I'm standing more and more people are getting to speak it fluently, especially because of the internet
Is it really that unfeasible to have such a secondary language that'll help Europeans transcend the linguistic barrier
First names
hard to guess
You could only guess ethnicity maybe judging from it (Hungarian, Roma etc) but it’s never a rule
Last names
almost all matriarchal names formed with “a + mother’s declined first name/nickname in the village” are from eastern Romania (Aelenei, Aioanei, Amariei, Ageorginei etc)
Traditionally, names ending in -escu are from the south of Romania (Wallachia), but due to internal migrations, you can find them everywhere now
Names ending with 'ici' (Belodedici, Popovici) are usually from the West, as they were originally Serbian
I would say that in Transylvania it's more common to find first names of Latin origin (probably dating from when it was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and even before that), although that's not a rule anymore
As for last names, most people who live is Constanța county are able to recognise Aromanian ones
Agree with you and I would add this: usually when their last name starts with "Cara" they are aromanians (Caragiu, Caramitru, Caragiale, etc
Most surnames in my family and from people I know don't follow any of the rules lol but surnames like Gatin, Kovacs, Erdelyi, Gal, etc
And mine is even weirder
Some from west some from south
Dijkstra as well
Names ending in -schi are not too uncommon in eastern Romania and Moldova either, I wonder if there is any connection
(Seredinschi, Dembinschi, Dlujanschi)
Not necessarily, I’m from that area and there are many names like Lupulovici that are clearly Romanian, just adopted the Serbian name ending
Yes, but it has been adopted in that area
You would not hear someone in Moldova adopting the -ici termination
Either way, considering the internal migration in the past 100 years you are very likely to find a Popovici in Iași. So we're discussing more about the origins of the name
Took me a Google search to realise you were talking about The Witcher
I was thinking about the Dutch computer scientist who discovered the algorithm with the same name
Indeed, just like you can find names ending in -schi in eastern Romania and Moldova
Sounds pretty Polish to me
Hmm, historically Moldova is the principality with the most contact with Poland
In the middle ages the border along the Nistru had Poland on the other side (where Ukraine is now)
Then later it was the Russian empire they had a long border and lots of contact with
So it would make sense that Polish, Russian, Ukrainian influence to be greatest in Moldova
I've been in Germany for 4 years now
I work in scientific research so we use English at work all the time
And I can't practice my German too much
I kinda want to try living in a French speaking country next (I'm honestly thinking of Quebec)
Because I learned French in school
I'm also still young and I could probably manage the move to another environment
So I kinda want to try that
But I'll probably never go back home because everything I get to do here in a lab is Sci fi compared to what people do back home
Also, I kind of despise the attitude people from back home give me now
The whole "you left the country and you forgot the language
", "just cuz you got your diploma in Germany, you think you're better than me
" and all this shit
I don't think I want roots just yet
Romanian living in the UK for 8 years now
I couldn't stand the London area, so I tried Cambridge and then Newcastle, and so far Newcastle is my favourite
I don't see myself going back to Romania though
Not in my hometown at least, place is a shithole
However, as someone else said earlier in the comments, the British public service incompetence, the housing market that got out of control in the last 5 years, the xenophobia and whatnot makes it really difficult to be living here
And I ain't even obviously Romanian ( tall as a dutch, long blonde hair, no accent), so I'm kinda skippin past daily strangers' xenophobia)
Now with Brexit, there's no more EU protection/regulation for pensions, health insurance from your job, hours worked, worker's rights etc
They're gonna start chopping them one by one
So even if I'm working in highly skilled data driven job, I still feel a threat looming for my job security and quality of life
I'm planning on moving out to Hannover within 3 years max
Oh my God, I know, right
Worked 4 years for a company developing new tech in biosensors/blood gas analysing
Most fun I've ever had at work, working with robots worth 5 times more than the house I grew up in phahahaha
Tbh, i think the language part is also due to the people who left the country barely speaking proper romanian that went back home and used words in the second language just to look superior
I've been living in Spain for 2 years now, i only use english at work, but i am still able to speak romanian without inserting spanish or english words in everything i say
I absolutely hate the "romanization" of spanish words i see in romanians here, like saying "e castigat" insead of "pedepsit" (castigar is to punish in spanish) wtf is that
I once heard a romanian living in Canada saying "am rentat" an apartment
But anyways, kudos for your job in Germany, i wish you all the best in your endeavors
Or even worse:
"you should take advantage of every opportunity
*takes advantage of every opportunity and studies/works abroad *
"you think you're better than me now, huh
My partner is just starting her PhD at the institute there, it's a very nice culture centered city as far as I can tell ( which is paramount for me - despite being science and tech driven, I can't live without music, live shows, theatre, various forms of fresh art etc), plenty of greenery ( which is also what I like about Newcastle - forests, parks, fields, all accessible from the city, coming from a post-communist industrial town, you can figure I'd hate living in a concrete sprawl again)
Also, it would be good for my career too
I barely know any German at this point as I didn't study it in school, but in Hannover and its general area there are plenty of large companies either national/international where it's most likely that I won't need fluent german
Also, the wages - I've noticed around there that the avg
salary for a business intelligence developer/analyst is around 55K euro/yr, so for my age(27) in a generation of people screwed out of luck on career growth possibilities and salary to skill ratios, I'm liking those numbers quite a lot
Also, I'm hoping to find people to start a hobby stoner rock/industrial band with ( guitar + bass here, and learning synths)
Oh yeah, and the famous german clubbing/rave scene
Oh man, that gets me spidey sense tingling

For me personally, the old Astra Iva underground trains in Bucharest, I miss when i was 7 years old and  the lights were cutting off in some places between stations
Good old days when we helped Vlad Țepeş impale the turks
That was so fun, really brought everyone tougher
Seeing those burgundy tapestries hung up on walls
I miss home :/
As a romanian living in UK for the last 20 years I’m always nostalgic around Christmas

What does it really mean
That comment is so French you don't even need a flair anymore
Yes i like it because we already call it Cehia not Republica Cehă.
It highly deoends when i reffer to ot in english i say Czech republic but when i reffer to it in romanian i say Czechia
Well we call it "Cehia" in Romanian, almost the same pronunciation, so i guess its good
I prefer to say Czech Republic over Czechia, because i don t like how Czechia sound
We already called it czechia here
Well, since everyone here calls it "Cehia", which is the short, unofficial name, it wouldn't be weird at all if they kept "Czechia" as the official, short name of the country
I do like it
In Romanian it had always been "Cehia", which has the same pronouncion
The shortening just makes more sense for me when speaking English
Same in Romania: rarelly heard 'Republica Cehă' and usually just 'Cehia'. On the other hand, we usually call Moldova, the Republic of Moldova (the oficial name) when we want to specify the country and not the region that is part of Romania
For our Czech friends, we pronounce Cehia in a way that could be written as Čehija . So the English "Czechia" sounds very familiar for us

The present, because it’s purely national, without anything else stuck onto it
The 1989 revolutionary flag is also nice, but it was really just a substitute
There  are more recent ones posted, but I really like  [this one]
The flag with the hole:
Maybe not the most beautiful, but I feel like it's more for the people
The flag we had when we were called The kingdom of Romania
this looks kinda sad
Indonesia : why don't just copy
In Romanian we have "gelozie" and "invidie". They can be used interchangeably, but the former means when you want to keep something you already have (oftenly love related), while the latter when you desire something you don't have
Jealousy = gelozie
envy = invidie
Yea, they are pretty much the same thing in Romania, but different cases do fit different words better
Gelozie = jealousy
Invidie = envy
Being jealous can mean anything from the feeling in a romantic relationship to wishing you had as nice a car as someone else - but without super negative layers
Envy is used with a much more negative connotation
And never to refer to relationship jealousy
Envy harbours malicious feelings towards the person who has a nicer car than you
You're not just jealous, you wish they would end up totaling it so they don't have the nice thing anymore
We also have "ciudă" which a sort of envy mixed with spite
I disagree, to me it doesn't seem like they can be used interchangeably
"gelozie" - jealous is about love and romanticism while  "invidie" - envy is more about material things
Look, you cannot feel envy - "invidie" if your wife flirts with another guy, you'll be jealous (at least if you love her)
You can feel envy - "invidie" if a guy has a nicer car (or a more beautiful wife for example) but you can't be jealous about his wife (unless you have a relationship with her)
Side note for envy - my favorite is "pizmă" with the verb "a pizmui" and substantive "pizmaș".
We're taught in school that Romanian has 3 main dialects corresponding to the 3 historical kingdoms that now are part of the country - Moldova, Transylvania and Wallachia
The standard Romanian language is based on the Wallachian dialect and accent
So if you travel away from Bucharest you will start hearing different pronounciation, and different words
The different vocabulary is mostly for things that common people like farmers were talking about 150+ years ago before unification and public schools, so stuff like plants, foods or religious concepts
There are also many idioms and expressions which are different
It was recently pointed out to me by a foreign friend who is learning Romanian that we use very many idioms and 'indirect' expressions in everyday speech
The accents can get pretty strong though, to the point that some Wallachians may not understand a strong Moldovan accent
In the Republic of Moldova the accent is even stronger, and they have lots of Russian loanwords from Imperial and Soviet times
There also other "Romanian" languages spoken south of the Danube, in Serbia and Albania mostly, like Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian
These languages have diverged pretty significantly from standard Romanian and are not easily intelligible
We have 4 in Romanian
But they are either unspoken or spoken outside of the Country
Dacoromanian ( unspoken)2
Aromanian - spoken in Greece, Macedonia, south Albania and a bit in south of your country
Meglenoromanian - spoken in northern Greece& south Bg on the side of the Vardar River
Istroromanian, spoken in Istria peninsula of Croatia
A Romanian speaker will be able to discuss to a certain level with the last 3 but not complex phrases
Also, there are Subdialects ( Graiuri in Ro) but theese are forms of the language spoken in different parts of the country, Moldova, Wallachia, Transylvania
Evrybody cand understand them, but, there are areas where one has to pay a lot of attention to fully comprehend everything spoken
In general I think it's more of an age thing if we exclude touristic locations
Millenials are moving to cities such as Oradea or Cluj-Napoca and so modern industry goes there, such as Tech and start-ups
Cluj-Napoca has it's origins as Napoca, a city founded by the Romans after the Conquest of Dacia
Pretty sure it was destroyed in time and a new town just took it's name but it is something interesting

That's about it
I also know that the Irish have a very weird sounding "thank you". Something like "go ray math gat" (definatelly not that, but something weird like that)
When I first heard that,  was sure it was a joke, like we Romanians tell foreigners that "Pulan cur" means "Thank you" but it actually means "Di*k in ass" when we want to mess with them
Apparently tho it's not, that's really how they say it
English, American, Canadian, Australian etc
yeah I'm smart B)
Tbf, for Romanian and French is the same if you're informal
You could add romanian since we use 'mersi' as thank you, almost same pronunciation as 'merci'.
Edit: since the linguist nazis are after me
Multumesc is the official thank you in ro, it is to be used in any formal instance : banks,doctors,officials
Merci is more informal can be used between family, friends,coleagues
It's quite misleading to add that
The word is regarded as a "franțuzism", a word copy-pasted from French and then tweaked a little
While it's true that Romanians will highly likely understand "mersi", it's quite improper to suggest it since most Romanians will understand "bonjour" too but you don't count that as saying hello in Romanian
The proper way to say thanks and have it count as Romanian, not French that Romanians happen to understand, is "mulțumesc".
It is , mersi is  used more in an informal instance
> it's true that Romanians will highly likely understand "mersi",
Lol
"Highly likely to understand". Everyone says it
Everyone knows what it means and everyone spells it with an s.
The guy is right
Mersi is informal, mulțumesc is formal

Before the Romans conquered Dacia, the Dacians had a monotheistic religion with tenets such as moderation and an eternal paradise after life
It revolved around a god (Zalmoxis) who came to the Earth in human form, took the first kings of Dacia as his disciples, died, and then was resurrected
This was all before the birth of Christ
It is considered by some that the Dacians’ religious prohibition of wine was what eventually became the modern tradition of dietary restrictions around lent

Romania once had a portion of the city of Sarandë as a colony at the Adriatic, because it was gifted by King Zog to an important Romanian historian as a response to his studies about the Albanian history

Complaining
We Romanians complain a lot
We would probably complain about having to go to the olympics
Drinking beer, but I’m not sure if we would win so a round of complaining would be perfect instead
Wait, LIDL is fast in your country
Unless there are 20 people waiting in the row here they don’t open another cashier
Nothing like a Romanian making a swear out of every word imaginable
Complaining Olympics would be just perfect for us
They are fast in my city too, they scan your stuff so fast they basically throw it at you
Then you have to move fast to take it, usually you don't have time to put in a bag because other people will be waiting so you do that outside
Yeah, I think that’s actually the problem
They don’t scan slow but out of 8-10 cash registers they only open 2-3, 4 if they are feeling very generous

We barely have trains
[Romanians be like]
Romania actually [ranks number 32 worldwide] by rail usage and while they're delayed all the time the trains have a high number of riders and good coverage
I know it was a joke but some people might actually believe you
And we rank 23 in rail length with 10
774km of which only 3
292km are electrified or 30
5%, so we have an extensive yet antiquated rail coverage
And the high number of passengers is mostly due to the lack of anything better (no highways and few air routes)
I have noticed that whatever foreigners find exciting and awesome, it is usually a nightmare for people who use trains for commuting or who travel by train a lot
Sorry we use comma (,) for decimals

Anyway at least in the public system there is no sexual eduaction course, idk if private education has it though

The perfect dialogue
I'm half Hungarian and half Romanian but I grew up in Romania so I identify more with Romanian
I also now live in Canada but still identify as Romanian even though we moved here when i was 10 and am 29 now
I'm half Romanian, half German and I speak both languages fluently
It's a bit funny cause my romanian friends call me "the german" even though I technically grew up and studied in the same schools as them, while my family from Germany tells me that I'm nothing like my father (he's very close to the german stereotype) So I guess by that logic I'm either none or both lol
Now to answer your question, I identify as a romanian because Romania is the place I spent the majority of my life in and that's where I made friends and have memories
I like Germany, but I just don't see myself living there
The people there seem colder and more serious if that makes sense
Despite that, I do sometimes tell people I'm german if it's in my advantage (especially when it comes to jobs, people who can speak german have a higher chance of being hired, and will get paid more than their coworkers just for that alone) It's also useful when you want to get out of awkward conversations with strangers, just act like a foreigner and they'll leave you alone

I was taught that a good way to ask a question in French is by using inversions
We were even taught stuff like “puis-je” when making inversions, only to learn that it is regarded as highly formal and pretty much outdated by most French speakers
Yeah, ideally you'd also have another way of getting exposure to the language, outside school
Unfortunately many teachers are also quick to correct anything that doesn't follow textbook rules
One of my classmates did an exchange with a French student and obviously picked up some casual language habits, our teacher would then complain how ungrammatical it was hahah
>Well, basically all of my French
8 years in school, no chance I can follow a conversation or participate
All the crazy grammar we learned and in the end the French don't even use it
Same
"Qu'est-ce que vous avez préparé pour aujourd'hui
" is forever etched into my brain though
Hahah it sounds so serious and dramatic
Especially when the action itself is super trivial
"I shall tie my shoelaces
It is
But as students it was one of the most dreaded questions
I can say it in my head and hear my teacher's voice haha
Lmao I especially love those random ass village/town names, a lot of really funny, dirty or plain nonsensical ones (for example some of the most famous, literal name meanings related to dick, balls or sperm: Spermezeu, Băicoi, Sculeni, Slobozia)
As for English versions, only Bucharest (București) is translated afaik
However some city names get translated in other languages, like Bulgarian or Serbian I think
And many cities in Transylvania with significant German and/or Hungarian ethnic populations also have German and Hungarian names :D
I am sure that in Romania there is only 1 city translated to English and that is Bucharest  București
Do I like it
Well it depends
For example its translation in French is Bucarest and it sounds cool when people say it like that, but when some English people say Bucharest like the starting of the word  "beautiful" I just wish there was never a translation of it
It makes Bucharest seem cute when they pronounce it like that
I think bucharest is a great translation for București ( the romanian name )
I love most city names
but not Vaslui
nobody talks about vaslui
>d Rouen, Reims, Nantes and Caen, only because it's funny to hear foreigners pronounce them badly)
However, a lot of cities and town have "sur" and "lès" in them, like all these towns: maizières-lès-me
I feel the same for Germany, I feel like germans had put all their efforts in having cool names for big cities, like Wolfsburg, Hannover, Frankfurt and then you have the little cities like Schloß Holte-Stukenbrock
Pretty much same for Romania, the only cities I know of that are translated into English are Bucharest (Bucureşti) and Jassy (Iaşi)
That being said, a lot of cities in Transylvania have German and Hungarian translations because of Transylvania's history
Let's not forget about Târgul de floci :D
Also neat thing imo, lots of stuff share the name of their place of origin
Like Făgăraș the candy bar and the city, and Măgura the cake and town, monastery, hotel and mountain
Well Köln is where Eau de Cologne comes from, it's one specific perfume but the word "cologne" kinda evolved to describe any perfume marketed towards men
So I also tend to use Köln to avoid any confusion lol
I've never seen that translation
I'm actually from there and I completely forgot about that translation :P
It sounds pretty in French but weird af in English haha
For me is how it sounds not if it is long, Frankfurt am Main sounds cool
Cucuiata
There's two of them
Cucuiata din Deal (on the hill) and Cucuiata din Vale (from the valley)
Though to be honest I'm not sure if they're real places
Well then you're talking with someone from the middle of nowhere
:-)
There is a village in my county that only has 5 old families left ..it's in valley surrounded by hills ..if it rains you need and suv to get at some of them . There are jokes that during the WW  the germans couldn't find the village cuz they ploughed the dirt road
I doubt we do unfortunately
It's a tropical plant
But we grow bell peppers though
;-)
Here people tend to move from smaller towns to other countries
Just skip the middle man
Nice one
Though in the interest of informing OP, vast numbers of young people move to big cities like Bucharest, Cluj, Iași, especially those working in stuff like IT, graphic design, marketing etc
Small towns are quite sleepy, for the most part it's middle aged people or older, and their kids who haven't finished school yet
I think that British Universities are one of the most popular choices here, along Dutch ones
I have no idea how Brexit's going to influence this tho
Hopefully not much
Also, it's just that overall, more young people choose to study abroad or at least go with Erasmus or other programs for a semester or a year
There's this idea engrained in Romania that makes Romanians want to study and move abroad
The warning signs on worn-down buildings that say ["Warning: Falling Plaster/Tiles"]
It's terrifying because apparently, it *isn't* illegal for street-front buildings to have potentially life-threatening shit falling off them, as long as they put up this stupid sign
I cannot imagine why the police doesn't sanction the fuck out of the owners and associations that let buildings get to that stage
It's a serious hazard for people on the sidewalk
If you decide to visit please pay attention to the bear signs

We have rugby teams, but it's not popular
It is mildly popular in Romania, after football, tennis and probably handball
People watch the national team matches but are not very familiar with the clubs
I'm susprised at the amount of ppl that don't know about UHT milk
That's all we ever buy in Spain
Not just my family
I don't know anyone that uses any other type of milk lol
When I go to Romania they try to give me natural milk but I find it disgusting bc I got used to the UHT, and the natural ones taste way too strong for me
Also, my family never put the eggs in the fridge
Like
Never
And when it's Easter we boil the eggs and paint them and they last for like 4 days at least lol
Black magic
I'm glad we don't need to put all the milk and eggs in the fridge that would be a waste of space
I honestly don't even see non UHT milk in the supermarkets lol
Maybe there is one or two
But the most bought ones are the ones that come in a carton container and are UHT
Also, yes UHT is much cheaper and much more convinient bc it doesn't spoil easily and doesn't take more space in the fridge which in my family's case is already always too full lol
Also, apparently in Spain UHT milk is just called Normal Milk, the other one is Fresh Milk
Standard US layout most of the time
Add Romanian diacritics (ă, â, î, ș and ț) when writing a school paper or project
Most people I saw  have plain QWERTY, sometimes with the extras ă, â, î, ș, ț
I personally have the UK keyboard layout  ( £ instead of $ and other minor differences) on my laptop with the diacritics mapped to it
It was cheaper :))
I never thought about the 0 before, but your right
Sometimes it is in the wrong place
I use Romanian (Programmers)
Me too
Couldn't you write it without the diacritical mark
Like, if you write it without would Italians not understand
Would you write an important formal document in Romanian without the diacritical marks
I mean, dismiss as bullshit/spam any email I get in Romanian that doesn't have the diacritics
Oh my, that's quite bad
I mean I use diacritics in formal speech, but not in informal speech and I just thought the italian guy meant informal speech, sorry
I guess I came off too strong, oops :P.
Doar făceam o observație, n-am vrut să par nervoasă! Scuze
Este ok
We don't have many buildings left from Roman times, but we are very proud to be descendants of Rome
We even called our nation after it
I can say with 111% that among the last countries on the list is Romania
A lot of the ruins are getting ruined,either because of funding or because the guys in power just don't care enough for them
Also taking into consideration this verse of our national anthem: “Now or never let us give proof to the world
That in these veins a Roman blood still flows,
That in our chests we hold a name with pride,
Victorious in battles, the name of Trajan
TBH some Romanians are taking more pride in the muddy heritage of Dacia/Thrace
*edited to change a word
When we play online games me and my friends add "us" after every noun to make people think we speak latin (a lot of people are super racist towards romanians on some games)
In this case the Roman testimonies are the only ones available, apparently our Dacian ancestors did not use writing and there is nothing left of their language
Well yea
You're right
70% of the lexicon comes from latin but some slavic influence is also presented
I'd like to say 70% latin, 20% slavic influence and 10% turkish, german, hungarian influence
There's more Slavic influence than many Romanians care to admit (we don't like Russians), both in the culture and in the language
The language is based on Latin, but it gravitated towards Slavic before the 19th century
Then, many students went to Western universities, particularly French, and came back as educated scholars, introducing words that sometimes replaced Slavic words
Essentially, the language was re-Latinised through French
Those same scholars also brought back elements of the French culture
It isn't, but I think the average person thinks of Russians when they hear about something "Slavic".
Germans blow their nose SUPER LOUDLY
And they do it *everywhere*. Back home it's very impolite to blow your nose in the middle of a conversation for instance
If you really need to do it, you'll excuse yourself or find some discrete way of dealing with it, not whip out a tissue and blow your lungs out while making eye contact
After 3 years it doesn't disturb me anymore, but I still wish they would stop it with the eye contact
Romania is the most disorganized place in europe but how is noone else organizing their parties properly
Every party I have attended since high school had a fee (usually 15€) which would be less than having to buy booze yourself and that would cover renting the place, buying drinks and if we have enough alcohol to make everyone piss drunk (1st in the EU at alcohol consumption) sometimes we even buy food
The people who volunteer to do all that get a small part to I imagine, I never volunteered but knowing Romanians, they wouldn't have done it for free
The only downside is overcrowding (think 60-80 people in a place meant for 20)
But that's nice because you get to know a lot of people and don't really need the space at a party
My office colleagues eat pizza with mayonnaise
I hate when my friends do that
They eat pizza with anything
Ketchup, mayo, garlic sauce, tzatziki, anything
And I hate it
*Is this like a personal attack or something*
I never realised its uncommon
When I get to highschool I shake hands with all my classmates everyday
Would broadcasting the request to all participants turn the party into a Balkan one
Everybody sharing drinks with everybody
Savages
Italy sounds just about right
Happens to us all the time that's why as we got older we just got used to bring an "extra" bottle just to be sure the party gets right and we don't have to leave the party to buy more :)
>Taking someone's alcohol is like taking anything else from them
You take alcohol very seriously it seems
I have a colleague who enjoys fruits on pizza and I cannot eat looking at that sacrilege
Ketchup is fine, it's a poor man's habit, why pay 1€ for sauce when you can buy a bottle of roughly the same sauce for 1€ and use it the whole month
In fact, at my company there are bottles of ketchup and mayo in every kitchen and on every floor
I would be surprised if it were up to only you :P
No, it's an IT company
People order pizza for lunch and need the ketchup
I have used it yesterday on top of the pizza and it was delicious
Last year we had a full on lockdown for Covid until the 15th of May
In preparation of getting out of the lockdown and entering a so called 'alert state' the Parliament made a much debated law (the problems with it and constitutionality is another discussion, part of it got annulled and fixed afterwards)
Similar to how many other countries did, right
Well, wrong
every party in the Parliament apparently forgot how their laws get enacted
It takes a minimum of 3 days after they get published in something called the Official Monitor to take effect (if not specified otherwise but can't be less then 3 days)
And can take a day for it after being voted on to be published
Long story short when we exited the lockdown we had 3 days without any restriction whatsoever except the self isolation and quarantine for 14 days when entering the country since that was an executive emergency order based on an old law already in effect
A living person was declared dead in Romania
You just can't beat that
That's good
Now imagine this under Romanian law where by the Constitution any such changes go retroactively if in favor of the accused
As in anyone that up until then bought, sold or used drugs would have been doing it legally by a technicality
Te iubesc, scumpa mea iubită!
I love you, my dear lover
Az anyád picsája szájadra van csinálva
You are beautiful
Legalize corruption
Free criminals from prison (including rapists and murderers)
We had Nicolae Ceausescu, who ordered the military to fire upon civilian protesters in 1989
The general in charge refused the order, and he ‘committed suicide’ a few days later
And I mean this in the same way that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide
A little bit of polish land in my life
A little bit of polish money by my side
A little bit of territory is all I need
A little bit of profit is what I see
A little bit of polish workers out in the sun
A little bit of polish girls all night long
A little bit of Lebensraum, here I am
A little bit of Poland makes me German
I *am* the art institute
Not quite true
Skin gets tanned to protect itself from the sun, true
But it's not a reaction to DNA damage
Usually when the DNA damage has occurred, the cell goes naturally into apoptosis (programmed cell death) = flaky burnt skin
If the cell doesn't go into apoptosis it can turn into cancer
Most of the time it just becomes a dark spot
Tanned skin is literally the way your body protects itself from radiation, not being damaged by it
You didn't answer the question tho, so I'm gonna assume that you're not really German, because they wouldn't accept such inefficiency
Just a short FYI: the amount of melanin a person has is more or less fixed
And you get tanned because that melanin get "redistributed" throughout the cell's surface which blocks more sun and creates the aspect of tan skin
And that's why if you stay inside all winter you're gonna "reset" to whatever shade you were before
But of course, there will be some cells that will get damaged a little (not enough to be discarded by the body as flaky skin) or that won't change back
And that's why as you get older the skin just stays darker
If you get burn every time you step out into the sun
Well, you don't have enough melanin to protect yourself, so
Sorry
The sun's not good for you :(
>rammed people
Loooooool
They are quite normal I'd say, pretty much everyone has one, but they are stronger in rural areas
You can identify one's region from their accent
In TV news or documentaries, a sort of "unaccented"  Romanian is used, while in movies/shows the accents are typically from around the Bucharest area
We can mostly understand one another even if we have different accents, but sometimes it becomes difficult
For example, I have trouble with accents from Moldova (the country, not the region) and also with some accents from the southwest (Oltenia)
I am from Oltenia and I can confirm that people can be confused by our accent sometimes
I didn't have the pleasure to meet anyone from Oltenia, so I find it weird that their accent is somehow confusing
We speak in general with a very fast pace and because of that some don't understand us
We also have specific words like Brabete (male sparrow), bișag (Belșug,I don't remember the english word), boalcă or boare (heat), bobolani (gosling) etc that no one apart from us use and if used with someone else other than a Oltenian they will be confused
There is also this excessive use of the perfect simple we have and the -o ending for female names in vocative (Alino,Leano etc)
Saw many people eating alone in my country
Nobody seems to care
No one cares
Why would we care
Why would we bother someone who maybe just wants to eat
i don't think it's weird to go to a restaurant alone on a work break for example, if you don't have a lot of time and want a hot meal which isn't fast food
No, it’s illegal
But I have to recognize that it sounds quite interesting
In a fictional way not real one
Tochitura moldoveneasca
Pork and sausages cooked like a stew,but without any broth,served with polenta,cheese and one or two sunny side-up eggs
Serve with pickles as an optional garnish
It's the best thing to eat in winter
It actually sounds similar to a dish we have called "varză călită". It's cabbage cooked with meat
We eat it with pork, chicken or, personal favorite, duck
We have 8, 2 of which are natural
- Churches of Moldavia
- Dacian fortresses of the Orăștie Mountains
- Historic centre of Sighișoara
- Danube Delta
- Primeval beech forests of the Carpathians
- Monastery of Horezu
- Villages with fortified churches of Transylvania
- Wooden churches of Maramureș
More details and pictures:
Last time I checked, Romania had 7 (i see there is an 8th added now, shared with multiple countries)
The one I recommend the most is the Danube Delta
It's the largest one in Europe and its very well preserved
Not too touristic either, yet
Summer is coming which means the debate about what to call watermelons will start again
Is it better to call them "lebeniţă" or "harbuz". Do not try and came with its fancy name "pepene roşu" because both the users of "lebeniţă" and "harbuz" will fusion together and will burn you at the stake
*cough*
*cough*
Harbuz
onion but only red or spring kind
I love raisins and eat them by the handful, but in fucking cheesecake
Nasty
It's actually *Pepene verde
* Or just *Pepene
Intresting, never heard of this debate myself
This is a conversation we're having too
An extension of the conversation is talking about old ladies in the market
Should you buy your eggs/milk/etc from old ladies that sell it in the market from their garden or not
Is it even safe
Oddly enough, people that buy from random old ladies fall into the antivaxx category too
Totally agree
> we say "petit pain"
That's just wrong
> if u want it to be sweet just put sugar
That's just disgusting
'Romania' seems fine but i d change it so that it doesn't rhyme with roma or romani
Wallachia would sound cooler
I would give it a long ass name so it confuses people, like The United Principalities of Moldavia, Transylvania and Wallachia
Stealland
Why
Because politicians steal a lot from the people
I'd rename it just to Mania so that I can be called a Maniac officially
Dacia or Wallachia
Before trying to emphasize our connection to Rome, The region that is now my country was sometimes referred to as Dacia (yes, like the car)
In Romania we call your country "Țara Galilor" - The Country of the Gauls
To the point it would be too close with "Neanderthalic", there's no winning haha
Really
Portchugul ?
We need to teach foreigners how to say “România”
Same in Romanian
As far as I know, it's because Rumania ment only "Wallachia and Moldavia", in 1913 King Carol I of Hohenzollern renames it to Romania after gaining control over Northern Dobruja from Bulgaria
that one hurt just a little
We already call the Wales "Tara galilor" so the country of the Gauls
The "a" suffix is usually added to almost every country name in romanian so: Italy is Italia, France is Franța, Germany is Germania and so on
“Â” sounds like “e” in “ewwww”.
As far as I know there’s only one english word that has the sound
The “e” in ross**e**s is the closest to our “â”. Or similar to how the welsh call themselves in welsh, the “y” in C**y**mru
Huh, interesting
Agrippa
Carlos
If i name him so, he would get bullied all his life, or at least until he emigrates to a spanish speaking country
I really like Ethan or Nathaniel, but they're also hard to pronunce here
I’ve always liked Yukio
Hannibal and Tarquin; peak juxtaposition, I know
>Hapchetsut
Bless you
Why not, it's basically just an "old lady" name
Edit: referring to the Romanian version, Agripina
My name is Alex and I wish my parents had called me Sasha when I was a kid cause I really like that name
Unfortunately, as an adult it's pretty weird to ask people to suddenly call you by a different nickname
Spanish names for Romanian babies is a bit overdone now :(, it's impossible not to get bullied
I had a classmate in high school whose name was Carlos and he wasn’t actually bullied though
My sister has a classmate named Alejandro
Please god help our "wanna be unique" souls
Ee-tan Na-ta-niel
Could be the pronounciation, also I've seen people with English names here
Carol
Cornel
Carol
Cornel comes from the latin Cornelius
>kin
Fyi, it's "keen" (with a long "í")
"Kin" means relative
Of course we do
A lot of Romanians seems to love the ones with known brands but they are fake
I usually avoid them, not my style
My style is more fit for a movie if I think about it, simple colors or patterns
I know a lot of sneaker/streetwear hype people and they love plastering logos everywhere
And generally a looot of people wear clothes with logos because it makes them "look rich"
It is a generalization, but at least in Romania in most cases it is considered to have bad tastes and being arrogant to wear clothes with huge logo's on them
And   objectively is quite true, is hard to combine a t-shirt with a huge logo on it with some pants and a jacket
Here in Romania there are 2 types of people
The ones that buy clothing JUST because it has a logo on them (we call them "Bombardieri" and they typically wear fake Gucci and Vagabond) and the ones that just don't care that there's a logo on the clothing, what matters is that it looks good and fits
to give you a pov of someone that wears logos
Fuck yeah
Its not tacky if its not a tshirt with a HUGE Nike logo
Every teen here knows how to dress and throwing a logo piece in your outfit is something more people should do imo
Except pants
No one wears logo pants except people that wear fakes or actual fashion disasters
A nike cap with a small logo on the middle is subtle yet it looks good
Nothing wrong with wearing logos and you are not a walking billboard for doing that
I imagine that people that say that are the ones wearing a pair of blue jeans with a white/black tshirt, nothing else
There are very few things you could categorize as "typically European". I even find it hard to think about 1 thing tbh
That's right
Still, when the label of "European" is used, they are usually referring to 3-4 countries
I live in one, but Americans would probably consider even our portion size small
> war
That's not fair
I doubt that nations outside of Europe don't have a huge history of wars behind them
Definitely the UK
When I was a kid, I thought they were such polite and civilized people
Growing up, I found out about the hooliganism, excessive drinking, knife crimes and so on
Germany :(.
I was fascinated by it
Then I moved there and realized that people are people everywhere
I was really disappointed to find out that the "German efficiency" stereotype is just a myth
Monaco
Had this enchanting image of princes, wealth, the good life etc
In reality it's just a terribly overbuilt and overpriced strip of land, which in winter is more like a sleepy village with skyscrapers and during the summer is overrun by obnoxious tourists taking selfies
>Also the German efficiency stereotype is a myth
This completely disappointed me too
I work in a university and the lack organization is at the same level (or even lower) than in Romanian universities
How so
Do you think there were too few restrictions, too many, too broad or too specific
I think Germany did some of the best work in the region on the matter
From news and talking to people over there it seemed much more chill than say, France
I never said I was "believing". It was just a part that my childhood naivity wasn't aware of
We have the the suffix "-escu" which would mean "son of"(ex
Popescu,Ionescu etc
) or the surnames being just articulated nouns(eg
Galbenu meaning "the yellow one")
> (eg
Galbenu meaning "the yellow one")
You missed a golden opportunity there, my boy
These surnames are rarer and I wanted to use the more common ones(also I have never seen these names until now)
Negru, which has no racist connotation at all
I see them SO often, especially in university lists
There are even names starting with Aa (Aanei, Aanicai)
Oh no, the English language has taught me how grotesque (some of the many times) the Romanian language is
I never never thinked like that
it fits so well its easy to learn
I learned it at 7yo old
Ukraine: no, I think they're busy dealing with their other neighbours
Moldova: if I'm cherry picking I can find some things I don't like, but no
Bulgaria: no
Serbia: no
Hungary: barking, but not biting
still scared enough to cross to the other side of the street
Some of the best Romanian music is created by Moldovans so I’d say Moldova is Romania’s most dangerous neighbour
Bulgaria: we've had our fights in the past, but things are really ok now
Romanians probably are the majority of tourists so I don't think they want to jeopardize that
Not sure if stealing cars is still a thing or is now an urban myth
Romanians were afraid their cars will get stolen if they go to Bulgaria
Serbia: No
No conflicts in the past, probably Serbia and the Black Sea are our best neighbours
Hungary: They make a lot of noise and we squabble at a diplomatic level, but I don't think they would consider an actual attack
The difference in army size is substantial, plus we are both in NATO and EU
So we will continue to squabble, unless they change that wannabe Putin called Orban
Ukraine: Again, some rethoric from them, like a few months back
There is a romanian minority living in the Ukraine and the Ukrainian govt was afraid that Romania might fuel some kind of secesion, while Ukraine is busy with the Russians
No such thing and I don't see them as a threat
Moldova: These are basically Romanians, living in a separate state and kept like that by Russia
So I don't think there is any chance of Moldova being aggresive towards Romania
Russia: not a direct neighbour, but too close for comfort
With them you never now, since the 1800s we have had a hate-hate relarionship with Russia
They buzz our airspace, make threats about the NATO bases in Romania, especially the missile defense one
Yes, Hungary has scary goulash
Jokes aside, no, I don't think anybody around us has time or resources for that
Maybe Russia would want to exploit us, but then again, who doesn't Russia want to exploit
Bulgaria  - We are in a very good relationship at the moment but there is still controversy around Dobruja
Serbia  - no way
Hungary  - well
Transylvania
Ukraine  - probably over Northern Bukovina and the remaining parts of Bessarabia
Moldova  - a referendum would probably solve the conflict :)
Black Sea  - our best neighbor
Hungary
I'm worried they will try one of their shenanigans again
Ukraine: They got their fair share of problems
Moldova: Eyyyyy, buddy
Bulgaria: Apart from the constant competition for the poorest country in the EU, no problems
Serbia: They're pretty cool
Hungary: You will not steal Transylvania, now gtfo
To be fair, most Hungarians individually just got over the Transylvania thing and couldn't care less
Most
> Romania - tbf probably our best neighbour
We aren't culturally as similar as other EX-YU countries (obviously), but we didn't have any conflicts historically and I don't think we will in the near future
I visited Belgrad last summer and I almost felt like I was back home in Bucharest
I find them quite alike eachother
Maybe I’m wrong, I only spent one day there unfortunately
If he is not a doctor he is safe
Apparently only Russian doctors have a sudden urge to fly
Not sure why but I am sure it is just a coincidence this happens only in Russia
Hockey is a wonderfully brutal game
Eh, its almost a lake
Some nationalistic politicians 20 years ago were saying that "it is and will be romanian". Pretty cringe if you ask me
It used to be called little Paris up until the Second World War, then it got a severe and ugly makeover in the communist era, so the pretty parts are in the minority now
It’s very common for people born here in western Romania
Most of the people I know who were born here speak either Hungarian, German, Serbian or Bulgarian as a minority language
Edit: come to think of it, 100% of my friends who only speak Romanian have moved here from other parts of Romania
In Romania,gypsyes have a language of their own
It is simillar to the indian language,but,appart from that,I don't have much knowledge of it
Is there a big difference between Spanish and Galician
There are no French communities in this area, there is no reason for kids to grow up speaking French as a minority language
French and German are taught in school as a second foreign language, after English
Thx for the info
This one is for my fellow and beloved people from the grand city of Bucharest:
You want to know what is the main source of traffic and parking problems in Bucharest
Look in the mirror
Yes, the administration it’s incompetent and the big projects are moving as slow as they can be, but the biggest problem it’s you, you that are alone in a car meant for 5, you that owns more cars than you even need and don’t even considered ranting one instead of buying one, you that instead of walking or using public transportation choose to drive the car for a few km
It’s you, everything it’s because of you
Szekelyland still exists
NATO
I think Austria is not allowed to join NATO
Even when you were a superpower you were called “the sick man of Europe” because after 1800’s you were basically a superpower just in name
This is a nice sentiment
Just out of curiosity i've searched on google map
From estern side of Czech Republic to Syria (closest non Maghribian non european country) there are 2
800km
From the southern border of Czech republic to nord Tunisia there are 2
400 km so they are the closest non european neighbour
The independece war, when we got rid of the otoman influence
1877 war of Independence
Or better the Voievod era
17-16th century Romania around the time that Mihai Viteazu managed to unite for the first time all the provinces that form modern day Romania
Yeah, it has
In fact, I'm pretty sure they air all 3 on television every year
Yes, in Romania they air Home Alone, the Lord of the Rings and Die Hard every year, all the movies
Yes, you cant have Christmas in Romania without Home Alone
hell yeah
Each year PRO TV puts home alone 1,2 and 3 each saturday of december leading up to christmas
romania btw
I've seen it so many times I friking learned its plot
Of course
It's aired every year
Don't forget Lotr ...for some reason
Yup, this year were aired too
Cocalars (douchebags but gypsies and dresses only with adidas, just google)
Moldoveni
Gypsis, too many of them

So, eh, what does wallah mean, what's the origin of the term
Rock actually started to gain traction in the 60s, however being something very Western it was pretty controversial at that time
Some of the bands from this era are: Cometele, Uranus and Phoenix (which still exists today)
A lot changed in 1971 after the July Theses, the July Theses' objective was basically to put the Romanian culture above all others, along with it stuff like singing in English or wearing Western inspired clothing like jeans was banned
Naturally this change greatly influenced rock as more and more people were encouraged to sing traditional Romanian music
Despite this, it wasn't the end of rock in Romania, a new subgenre arose, etno rock which combined rock music with traditional Romanian themes and music
This one
I enjoy quite a bit Premiata Forneria Marconi
I would add Rodion G.A. as a great name of those years, there are lots of people who don't know his music
I'll link [The Lost Tapes] here, I like it a lot
Yeah the July thesis definitely influenced that song along with pretty much any other song from the 70s and 80s
Link it mate, for fame and karma
As a Romanian, I can understand like 20-30%of italian and spanish, and like 40% french
However, I don't think its the other way round as well
As a Romanian, can confirm that Spanish and Italian are the easiest for me to understand, at least in proportion of 70-75% or so, sometimes less, but that depends
As for French and Portuguese I kinda struggle there, at best, I'd probably understand around 10-15%, sometimes around 20%
I myself can understand most Italian words
but still
we are very different
We are the bestly preserved language from the ancient times I mean
. Our language is closer to latin than Italians are
I think some Scots are unintelligible to English-speakers
Type something in Aromanian, I'm curious to see how much I can understand it
unintelligible*
For me Spanish is easier, but I have a hunch it's because of all the telenovelas I was 'forced' to watch with my mom (we only had one TV back then)
I know some Irishmen are
The spear in the ass
We impaled ottomans here
Make em shish kebab
People used to get Impaled here
Pretty fun, just some people hanging out on some good ol' spikes
We had Vlad the impaler
Do i need to say anything else
Gravity after impaling their asses lmao
Impaling people on wooden sticks, Vlad Tepes Style
We have impaling from ma boi Vlad Tepes AKA Dracula
Ofc no one still uses it :))
It was not used since the 15th century, but impaling
Can you imagine, being put on a stake, and slowly being stabbed and you dying instantly
And then your fucking king will drink your blood because you were a bloody traitor
Giant wooden spear that goes up the ass of the victim
impaling (also how do i get the flag
Impalement
Our impaling used to be of high quality
Turkey was the biggest importer, so they can confirm it
People were Impaled here (Edit:Didn't meant to post as a comment)
Yes, sir
I would love a Turkish kebab with a little bit of blood
Ah I forgot about that
Can we bring back Vlad
#MakeRomaniaImpaleAgain
I am curious
How
But effective
Yes
#MakeRomaniaImpaleAgain
thank you
We'll impale your ass and rip your still beating heart out, but at least we'll look good while doing it
Effective
They keep screaming for half an hour sometimes dude
Not only does it take a while for them to die, but they keep making noise afterwards
I need sleep y'know
You're welcome
Romania has a region widely inhabited by Szekely people
They keep making noise about independence but nobody really takes them seriously
They do speak some sort of Hungarian though so people are associating them with Hungarians and now we have a lot of jokes about autonomy misdirected at Hungarians
But we also joke about the obsession of actual Hungarians with Transylvania and how they can't stop being so salty about a century old treaty
No, just one group that wants autonomy however they sometimes behave like separatists (and quite frankly the large scale autonomy they want would basically be a different country paid by us)
I think i might know who wants autonomy
Are there 2 words in English you use the same word for ?
For example in English you have Rifle and Shotgun
But in Romanian they're both "Pușcă".
Or Convent and Monestery which are both "Mănăstire" in Romanian
To do and to make are both "a face" in Romanian
But we have  "Mitralieră"  too for rifle
Same here
Even the word is similar, "Nepot".
Same here
We call both moon and month "Lună".
We do have "revolver" in our language but no one really uses it . We usually just say "fuck it
" and just call both of'em "pistol".
Same here, bancă
_"Poison and married are both gift"_
That's food for thought
Same
They're both "Pistol Mitralieră".
"Mitralieră" is machine gun not rifle
Nepot, nepoată, strănepot, strănepoată
Not the same
Thats because the ancient Romans didnt use the "months". They referred to a period of time of 30 or 31 days with "moon". Like, "see you next moon
" Instead of "see you next month
" This kept on being a part of some countries such as Czechia and Romania, in Italy you say "mese" for month and "luna" for moon tho
Idk about other latin or non-latin european countries
Hmm , I guess you're right
"Stranepot" and "stranepoata" is used for grand grandchildren so it s only "nepot" for male and" nepoata" for female in this case
Not really in Romanian
Pink is "Roz" and  Rose is "Trandafir" (which is also a type of sausage)
Altough we also have "Roză" for Rose but "Trandafir" is more common
it's funny because it's true
Oh well Russia had nothing to do with the Roman Empire tho
Its normal that there are differences
Yea, but i dont know if the Byzantium used the same method as the Roman empire to count months
I identify like myself like this
Wallachia/Hessen/Europe
Nation
I have many international friends, and it has become a trait
And I don't have friends from braşov or sinaia, only bucharest or other countries
For me it was always logical to view the identity as concentric circles, with my village in the center
If you're part of the diaspora (like me) than you probably have a somewhat separate identity
Also don't forget about the Székelys
Playing outside "in front of the block" as we call it
Going outside a lot, in the park, with friends
My legs and arms are full of scars from falling over while running
Fun times, man
I was organizing arenas where different household items were fighting each other
Watching tv on 2 channels that both dont exist anymore . Jetix and Animax . Those were the good ol' days
Back when the world made sense
The ones that have several L's and R's in close proximity
- *Literally* sounds like [Patrick from Spongebob]
- Particu*larly*, same issue
- *Rural*
"Wrath" is super difficult for me
And "world"... And "word"....
Basically anything that starts with a w is hard
I've lived in Canada for 20 years (from romania, left at 10 years old) and speak fluent English with very very little accent and I still have an impossible time saying rural
Also horror
I find it odd for Rural as it is part of our vocabulary, we say rural environment, mediu rural
For me things like Worcestershire sauce or names like Massachusetts are hard to say, they feel like such a rollercoaster for the tongue
I can't even pronounce rural properly in Romanian
It's a badly designed word
So like [this] scene from Psych haha
I mean, rural is just as part of our vocab as it is in English, as in - almost never used by anyone who's not a news anchor or giving a presentation
Regular people in conversation use "la sat" (in the countryside)
> Worldwide is my nightmare lmao
Pitbull would be [very disappointed in you]
> and we make it sound like f or d.
**D**ey and **F**ink respectively
I think he's saying that is is easier for the tongue to transition from one letter to another when he says "g**o**rl", rather than the short **i** in "girl".
Visually, România and the baltic states have a very similar vibe
Bucharest and riga (exclude
medieval parts)
From a.langiage perspective, portuguese can sound very similar to Romanian
In terms of story and old history România has a deep rooted balkan vibe
Now each part of România has similarities with their former occupier
The South more of a turkish influence
Transylvania more of a germanic, hungarian type vibe
Romanian moldavian area more of a.slavic vibe
South American countries, without a doubt
Probably Brazil or Argentina come closest
Weirdly enough lots of of things Koreans do and say remind me of Romania lol
Even my mom agreed
At least when I compare both to Spain, I feel like South Korea is more similar to Romania
People tend to have higher respect for elders, people are obsessed with what others think of them and do anything to appear better for others (aka, both Koreans and Romanians can be rlly fake lol)
Rarely see this in Spain
Here, we called even the teachers by their first name
Which was so hard for me to do when I moved here lmao
And they don't usually try to put up walls and masks to appear wealthier and nicer
Which I see constantly in Romania and Korea (haven't been there but I watch tons of videos on YouTube by Koreans hahah, plus the kdramas are somewhat true)
Also, even some foods remind me of Romanian foods
I keep thinking that mixing romanian and korean food together would be heaven lol
I think there's also a similar feeling due to being separated from our sibling
(North Korea and Moldova)
Obviously Korea's situation was and is much worse but still, lmao
I forgot to mention
That both Romania and Korea are pretty hardcore about their religion and beliefs
In Spain most people aren't very religious, if at all
And those who are, are pretty open minded and relaxed either way
In Romania and Korea people are still very close minded and traditionalist
Man we in Romania sure are suckers for all things French
Our architecture, our political and legal systems, our education and cultural institutions and even our language have so much French influence
One fun fact I noticed is that the street signs in Bucharest are exact copies of the Paris ones (the green border and blue background, like [this] I know not everything is the same, there are of course very strong Balkan influences
But when I made a French friend in university we would talk about things back home and every 5 minutes one of us would be like "hang on, we have that too
I'd add countries from South America
I've met people from Brazil and Argentine and their way of being and expressing themselves hit close to home, like I was conversing with just another Romanian, same levels of cynicism, very similar humour and a general openness towards life
We could even share similar stories of corruption from our politicians lol
It was weird how familiar these people seemed
Well, if you feel like driving for 2h, [The Mud Volcanoes] If not, there's the [Văcărești Nature Park] IN Bucharest
[Bear's Cave]  in Northern Romania
It's named like that because 140 bear skeletons were found there
The cave bear, also known as Ursus spelaeus, is a species of bear which became extinct during the Last Glacial Maximum, about 27,500 years ago
Very close to the place I was born: [Delta Văcărești] basically a Delta next to the city where Ceaușescu wanted to create a canal that would connect the city to the Danube
The project remained unfinished and nature slowly reclaimed the land
Not as beautiful or majestic as the Danube Delta, but quite unique in many ways
Close to the place I currently live: I guess also Wadden See or the sand dunes, but from the Dutch side
My school got us some nice G suite accounts so we're using Google Meet for online classes and Classroom for everything else
Our uni recently came up with institutional e-mail addresses for everyone, they are Gmail-based and we mostly use Google Classroom and Meet
Romanian lessons are done on Google Meet, Math on Skype and the rest on Cisco WebEx Meetings
Yeah school we use a bunch of apps
which are:zoom,skype and g classroom
Yes, we use Teams but there is one teacher that uses Discord and one that uses webex
Honestly, this online college is the worst
The implementation is not bad but the teachers have so much tests and homework now, I'm at the end now, I don't have any strength left
My university uses zoom but we don't have a balanced schedule
For example, on monday we have courses from 9am to 8pm but on tuesday we only have one course which is 2 hours long
It's really tiring
We have Math every few days, Romanian twice a week and English once a week
All on Zoom
Yes, we use Microsoft teams
All classes are also recorded which is super nice
They should have done this since long ago
We mainly use zoom and WhatsApp
WhatsApp for those teachers that don't really wanna do zoom meetings or don't have a good internet connection, they mainly just send us homework
I'm in 10th grade and yes
We use google classroom and google meet
All is going pretty well
My brother who is in 5th grade uses microsoft teams and let me tell you,some of his teachers have no idea what they are doing
One put an assigment like this "page 96 ex 1 2 3 4".It didn't state the subject,ms teams didn't show the name or anything
They asked what the subject was and nobody answered
Some children said it was history some said it was geography
In the end she still got mad at the kids who didn't know what to do
Not personally, but my boyfriend's mom is a teacher
She teaches through Google classroom I think it's called
Either way it's from Google and its for e learning
From skype to discord to google meet to messenger, zoom and an app called adservio that never works but my school continues to pay for
Teachers use whatever platform they want and it's so infuriating and stressful
Either Google Classroom and Google Meet or Zoom and custom e-learning platforms around here mostly
Same as my school
Oh boy there was a looong list somewhere online
One that comes to mind is Spermezeu - basically translates as sperm god

Băicoi=you testicle (vulgar)
It's quite a big town
You forgot to mention that the German word for ‘ale’ is ‘hell’ (to my knowledge)
There is a brand of beer known as ‘Fucking Hell’.
We have a city named slobozia wich sloboz means sperm or other liquid like that
There's the classic example of Croatian city named Pula, which means The Dick in Romanian
In the country, we have:
* Băicoi - would translate to Hey nut (testicle)
* Fututa - Fucked (Not sure if this is real or just a well photoshoped meme from many years ago)
* Amărăști - Poor people (common name used by several villages)
* Slobozia - Sperm city
* Cetatea de Floci - (Genital) Bush Fortress - Doesn't exist anymore, but it was important in the middle-ages
Țigăneşti (Gypsy city)
And probably many many others that I can't remember right now
WE ZIJN NUMMER EEN *trumpets start playing*
Băicoi = you testicle
Slobozia- the land of cum
Fundu’ Moldovei - moldavia (a region of romania)’s ass
Măciuca - slang for penis
There is also a bus going from Lungește (lengthen) to Măciuca
Haha, but that town is in your country, not in Romania
The question is about your own country
Here I am
Already posted a comment about your Pula before scrolling to yours

The Colectiv fire (30 oct 2015) when 64 people died and 186 were wounded
The Colectiv club fire
That club has been ignoring fire safety regulations
On 30 Oct
2015 there was a fire caused by some fireworks and a pillar had some sort of inflammable material on it
27 people died burning in that building because of non-working fire exit doors and some have been left physically mutilated
Colectiv club fire
A truck filled with amonium nitrate had a crash, the firemen and the EMTs got blown to bits because they didnt know about the truck load
The Caracal case of August 2019
Basically a girl who was abducted managed to call the police
The operator handled the situation very and i mean very poorly, it's like they couldn't realise she was in danger, and they hang up on her telling they have other calls
There was only one operator for a huge area of the country apparently
The next day police arrived but didn't enter the house until they got a warrant
They arrested the old man and investigated and found bones in the backyard
This man also abducted at least another girl in the spring
From the analysis of the bones they realised those were of the girl who called
It really is a shame the police is so unnefective here in critical cases
In recent history, in my opinion, there's the Colectiv Nightclub Fire in which 146 people were injured and 64 more died
It all started with when a show of a band went completely out of control when their firework system made the scene to catch on fire
The regulations in Romania had very permisive points for the approval of a fire safety permit, and proper exits didn't exist to allow everyone to get out in time
As all tragedies in Romania this would go further up to reveal that neither the hospitals, the authorities, nor the society were ready to handle a crisis of such scale
Our governmemt
I say that because we have chosen them and they were just some corrupt clowns
It was so shit we had prime ministers who could not properly speak our language
Thankfully our government fell down a week ago
We have chosen some really bad guys
Colectiv
A concert using fireworks in a highly flammable environment (a club which didn't even have the right emergency exit procedures put in place) ended up killing dozens of people and badly injuring over 150
(Club Colectiv, October 2015)
Colectiv
They didn't respect the fire safety rules and many people died
There was that whole nightclub fire a few years ago
... and nobody was held accountable for said deaths
64 people died because the club owner decided to mount cheap, flammable soundproofing sponge on the club walls  knowing that there are also indoor fireworks in the same room
Dumb
64 died, sorry
Unfortunately
the club owners were arrested  for negligent homicide, negligent bodily harm, and negligent destruction, but that's it
4 years since we lost 64 incredible people and nothing changed
Yeah, and shit fire regulations like not enough fire extinguishers and malfunctioning fire escape, for which they got authorisation anyway from the sector mayor
It was horrific
The hospitals weren't ready for this disaster
Lot's of burnt victims and not enough  medication or sanitary conditions, which are very important, staff was overwhelmed and overworked
Some lucky ones were able to be transported in other countries for treatment
The authorities also lied about the conditions in hospitals, telling everyone that everything was under control, which was absolutely not
It was horrible
We are still mourning the victims and we are still angry about the situation
yes
We have a shitton of traditions surrounding funerals (there's stuff you need to do even 7 years after someone dies)
And it honestly feels weird to ignore doing those stuff when the person that died was religious
While these traditions were designed with a very specific material meaning (like we have to give away some of the personal belongings of the dead person = distributing stuff within the community), nowadays it has a weird effect on people
It forces you to think about God and the afterlife so many times, most people that I know that are atheists turn agnostic when someone died
Just because it otherwise feels like a waste of time and effort to do all the traditions
I think people turn to religion as they grow in life, because they need a sense of purpose, wether they realise it or not
The church gives that
The elderly probably turn to it because
you know
death
the fear of death
"Romania
There is where Dracula is from, no
"Thief's and gypsy all around

Did it snow where you live this winter
I live in Bucharest and my city hasn't gotten any snow yet
We're approaching February so I'm kinda losing hope, given that the temperature today is around 10ºC. Anyways, I hope next year we'll have a white Christmas
Actually it did snow for about one hour in December, but very very weak and the snow just melted when it touched the ground
Today really feels like a spring day
I know this is bad for the environment, but I love Spring
haha :D
Techincally we did get some snow flakes around the end of December but it was very lite and too warm to actually get a layer of it
It is unusual however, we got used to having snow only in late January begining of feburary, sometimes even going until early april, that's how it's been in the last years
Normally though even without snow temperatures used to get even as low as -7 -10  in this period of the year, it hasn't been the case though, you can even get Snowdrops at this point in time despite them being supposed to bloom in early march as a symbol (in our culture) of spring
Adriatic sea side of Italy, and not even a snowflake spotted, just a bit of rain
And cold
Really cold
We had about a day of snow
Not a lot compared to other winters
I'm from Craiova btw
Like 3 days in Timisoara
Yes but not that much like in december started after december ended and again now we dont have snow
It snowed in Cluj
We still have a patches of actual snow here and there and there were some days of a snow layer right after New Year, but not enough to make it a decent winter
In Vâlcea it snowed a little mid-end November
We had one day of snow and that was it in Brasov
All the ski slopes had to rely on snow cannons
Honestly i think that for most including me this was just a harder autumn
Twice, the snow was gone in two days in both cases
Northen Romania here
We had a few weeks of snow
It was nice
I could even go ice skating one day
There was snow in Cluj-Napoca for a few days at the beginning of the month
Just enough to make your shoes a mess and maybe slip on the sidewalk
Nothing more
Maybe there still is some on roofs
I can't stop thinking that if all Europe is without snow that means we will have a serious issue with grains this year
I mean
yeah
snow is nice to play and everything but more than that it means the soil gets the right amount of water for the grains to grow
No snow - no water - no grains = higher food prices and more poor people
Higher prices + more poor people = riots most of the time
Still very much popular
Though it's not as much scam healthcare products like it was 10 years ago, it's mostly up-priced cooking/cleaning gimmicky gadgets that you can buy for 10% of the price on aliexpress
Sadly, very popular with old people, enough for them to buy 3+ minute ads in "prime-time" tv
Dormeoooo Noapteee bunaaaa
Tigaia Dry cooker
Dar asta nu e tot
Daca suni acum nu vei primi doar unul, ci doua \[insert product name\] la uimitorul pret de numai 99 lei

English translation:
But this isn't all
If you call now, you won't recieve just one \[insert product name\], but two at the amazing price of just 99 lei
I don't know if anyone remembers many years ago but there was that Italian dude that was selling rings or something like that and kept yelling "CADO
" and kept adding rings to the offer
That was ridiculous
Yes, I remember my grandma watching this as if it was an Oscar nominated movie
Never quite understood why elders were so fascinated by teleshopping
From the past [This one] - a boy with the flag from the 89’ Romanian Revolution
From the relative present [This one] From the 2017 anti corruption protests
What's that photo of the guy running from east to west
There's a mural in Berlin of it, I think
Edit: nervermind, someone else posted it :P
That's when he realised
He fucked up
Yeah, I watched the video and at one point he starts promising pay increases and other benefits, with no effect on the protestors
A hungry wolf doesn't care about what you promise to buy him if he spares your life
I really like the flow and sound of Russian, and in fact thet's the reason I started studying it
Im seriously surprised
With some turkish influences in the south, hungarian and german in transylvania and yes slavic ones in east and a lot of words are from french but modified so it's sounds a bit more romanian than french
A lot of people think that French is the only language Romanians usually learn at school other than English, but it's not uncommon at all for someone to never have had a French class in their lives and onlt German
Still president , on his 2nd term
Yeah, I am in Harghita and I learn French, but even as close as Mures there are people learning German in school
My cousin who lives in Targu Mures only has German classes
Shortly after the unification of Wallachia and Moldova in the 1850s, a branch of the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family was placed on the throne of the new Romania
I think it was a compromise between some great European powers, some of which (the Ottomans and English) didn't want a united Romania, and others were for it
I think overall they did us good, as we gained full independence from the Ottomans in 1878, unified with Transylvania and Bessarabia in 1918 and industry, transportation, infrastructure, education greatly improved
Yes, [Carol I] the first Romanian King, was born in the German Empire
I think Romania is pretty much the most qualified country for this one
There was an entire century between around 1711 and 1821 when Wallachia and Moldavia had, with very few exceptions only foreign born rulers
It was called the Phanariote Era due to the fact that most rulers were Greeks who came from the Phanar district of Istanbul
After that part in 1866 King Charles I came to Romania from Germany as well as the next ruler, Ferdinand I, who was also born in Germany
Well, there was [this] guy, the first monarch of Romania, who was born in Germany
What's worse, his son, Ferdinand I, was also born in Germany and he was probably quite torn when Romania entered WWI fighting against his native country
Heh, thanks
I actually didn't knew this
To add, while being a tributary state the Ottomans gave the rulership of the Danube principalities to Greek families
Most of the 17th, 18th and 19th voievods were either Greek or with Greek ancestry
Read his name as Boner Law
Yes, you're right
For anyone interested, they were called the Phanariots, after the Phanar quarter of Instanbul where they were originally from
Interesting point
I was alluding to the 1856 Treaty of Paris
The Ottomans were opposed to the union because the two principalities were their vassals, and divide and conquer and all that
The British were allied with the Ottomans, so they were opposed too
France, Prussia and Russia were in favour, because it gave a stronger buffer between the Ottomans and everyone else, as had the role of the Principalities been for centuries
Thanks for adding that, did not know how to spell it in English
"Romania single-handedly helped the Entente win WWI because we joined the war"
Yeah I fucking bet
we were talking about neighboring countries for some reason and my history teacher told us that we are neighbors with russia
we all were like wtf no we’re neighbors with ukraine and moldova, and she then told the whole class that ukraine, moldova and russia are one and the same
this happened in 5th grade and after that we never saw her again lol
we also had a substitute teacher that firmly believed that romania was part of the ussr, and when we tried to correct him, he would say that we are dumb to believe “media propaganda”.
When we had the WW1 lesson in high school our teacher told us that the Franz Ferdinand was assassinated in Serbia and that we had a general called Constantin Dragalina (when in reality whe had 2 generals named Constantin Prezan and Ion Dragalina)
Another one from the same teacher is that our independence day is on 9 may when in reality is 10 may
The whole "9 may" thing was taught during communism because 9 may is when the parliament signed the declaration of independence and on 10 may it was when the prince (later king) signed it thus declaring the country officially independent
That cellular data in cellular phones is dangerous because they use a nuclear cell
"Australia has 6 states
Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and NORTHERN Australia"
7th grade, had a quick geography lesson on Australia
I bet she just looked at a map of Australia and came to that conclusion
Tasmania is RIGHT THERE and on the map it said "Northern TERRITORY". Who let this women into the school
My class is divided in German learners and French learners, and I am studying German
One day, my german teacher was not at the school because she was sick, so I had to stay with the guys from my class who learn French
When I got there, I went on my desk and started to play on my phone, because I didnt have nothing else to do
That French teacher has seen me and said "You german learners should go down on your knees in front of french learners because the actions on WW2
I think she was just dumb and didn't know what happened to French
My classmates always say that their french teacher is dumb
My teacher tried to tell me that vaccines **don't** cause autism,such a fool
Yeah I mean when you get stomped you distract the enemy so the big guys can do stuff
The same with WWII when we switched sides
My history teacher: who knows how long WWII would have gone if we did not switch sides
PS: cute username ;)
..the fuck
When did the first thing happen and how old was the teacher
This reminds me of my philosophy teacher who said something along the lines of: "Humans are superior to animals because we dream" and when I told her that my dog dreams very often and asked for clarification she said she'd get back to me
She never brought it up again
Nope, just a few years ago actually
At the time I had an old man as a history teacher and he tried so hard to make us patriotic
He was nationalistic af
He told us that Hungarians are the scum of earth and that they shouldn't even dare request Transylvania and other shit like this
We got a new teacher who, on the other hand, simply told us the truth and he even made fun of our country
He restored my faith in history teachers and I'm glad that there are not many people like that old dude
Double that with Romanian school system,really,half of our teachers actually demand high respect and still believe that students should only listen to them,not even other teachers,so yeah,Austria is still good
almost four years ago, i think the teacher was in her fifties
What I said wasn t a joke, unfortunately
I mean,,, it was a joke
In Romania it's called "Boboteaza", Christ's Baptism in the Jordan River
Priests make holy water then visit people's homes and "baptize" them with it
They also leave a bit of holy water in a glass, that you'd traditionally drink in the morning to protect yourself from evil
There's a tradition for unmarried girls to put a sprig of basil under their pillows to see their future husband in their dreams
For those who live close to a river/lake/sea, the priest would throw a wooden cross into the water and young men would race each other swimming for it, the one who retrieves the cross will have good fortune the whole year
Also today we celebrate St John the Baptist and those who have his name or derivatives of his name
The first that comes to mind is “Descent to me, mild Lucifer" ( Ro:  "Cobori în jos Luceafăr blând")  from Mihai Eminescu's poem "Luceafărul" (Eng: Lucifer / Morningstar)
It's the most famous poem in our literature
The whole stanza goes like:
“Descent to me, mild Lucifer,
Thou canst glide on a beam,
Enter my dwelling and my mind
And over my life gleam
Sidenote: we never read this poem thinking it's about the devil, we interpret it as being a God of some sort who is a personification of the literal Morningstar
[Here's] the link if you fancy reading the whole thing
Evening Star ("Luceafărul") by Mihai Eminescu
I believe it's the longest piece of romantic poetry ever written in history
In Romanian, I would say there is the beginning of [Luceafărul] the masterpiece of our most famous poet, Mihai Eminescu
*A fost o dată ca-n povești,*
*A fost ca niciodată,*
*Din rude mari împărătești,*
*O prea frumoasă fată.*
&#x200B;
*Și era una la părinți,*
*Și mândră-n toate cele*
*Cum e fecioara între sfinți*
*Și luna între stele
&#x200B;
Which has been translated as:
*There was, as in the fairy tales,*
*As ne'er in the time's raid,*
*There was, of famous royal blood*
*A most beautiful maid
*She was her parents' only child,*
*Bright like the sun at noon,*
*Like the Virgin midst the saints*
*And among stars the moon
I would say probably every Romanian has heard those two stanzas and most of the people know them by heart
It's such an iconic poem
>“Descent to me, mild Lucifer"
This implies the existence of spicy Lucifer
No foreign films that I can think of, but one of the most internationally acclaimed Romanian films of the last 20 years portrayed us perfectly - [The Death of Mr Lazarescu]
It's a "slice of life" film about an old man who is trying to get correctly diagnosed (and treated) in our healthcare system
Won some fancy award at Cannes, was all over the news back in the day
None in my experience or that I'm aware off
Quite sad but I think that's the case for most countries
You rarely see a movie trying to portray another culture and done it right, though there are exceptions
In Romania we don't really discuss the trianon
A cool movie could come out on this topic especially if you focus on how entrenched beliefs lead to conflict
Cheers for the recommendation
Don't go to Vaslui(jk)
Seriously, try not to go outside at night
If you go to big cities it might not be as dangerous, but there are a loooot of stray dogs and creepy people so watch your step
I heard tons of tourists complaining about how many stray dogs there are around here and honestly, we're tired of them too, but no one has any idea what to do
Come to my country
Don't make fin of the gypsies/poverty
Keep it to yourself,and if they make you feel unconfortable,don't just say "ach damn deez dumb gyspies",avoid conflicts and ignore,they will get bored and let you be
idk if it was said before, but definitely don’t mention dracula/ vampires to us
it’s annoying and vampires aren’t even part of the romanian folklore
we have strigoi though
also don’t go hitchhiking,  it’s very dangerous and a girl was actually [murdered] quite recently
Think we’re Slavs, or Gypsies
I thought that would be Australia
Depends on the city, in Timișoara is really safe on night and there are no stray dogs
So you generalise
This is so true, my father and I literally walked around for an hour to find that thing and it was a huge dissapointment
Especially compared to the rest of amazing stuff we saw there
Wait, aren't you people a bit restrictive
Not if it's a sad clown
We had a German teacher once and the fact that she was speaking in a similar tone as the hitler speech in the movie didn't help at all
8th graders are ruthless
I don't know how they act in other places but here, if there is an opportunity to make fun of someone it is taken
No second thoughts
Unrelated to heil hitlering, one guy managed to make the math teacher leave the class crying from frustration after he argued for 20 minutes that she forgot to give us homework
Ruthless
I never said stray dogs are in every single city this wonderful country has to offer did I
We did, but it's kind of unethical
We wanted to euthanize for quite a while now( I mean, a couple of years ago a kid died eaten by stray dogs I think)
I don't know what happened with them but they disappeared all of a sudden from my city . Meanwhile in my parents town has like 4k people and they have a dog problem because of some stupid dude that keeps them around ..like 15 dogs ,they are cool during the day but the bark and try to chase you during the night ,someone had enough and gave them rat poison ..most of them died . Problem solved
I get a boner when the climate is hot, or in a sauna, I don't know why, and if I can't hide it, how do I not disrespect anyone in Finland in a sauna
Part of the Western corporations group involved in illegal deforestation scandals in Romania
They are very rare
Thats all
Ive never been to one
Several companies,civilians and other men in posisitions of power are engaging in illegal logging on state or private land and cut tree after tree after tree,so much so that we no longer have virgin,untouched forests
All the while,the ministry of the environment,of the waters and forests,and ROMSILVA,the romanian forest protection angency just sit there saying something along the lines of:'Idk man,we know how much they cut,but who knows,maybe they're just getting firewood for the winter,nd we can't prosecute that,can we
Doesn't matter that the wood is in such large quantities that it's clearly not firewood,and the tree trunk bases left behind can be seen from a plane as a hole in the forest,but we don't need to talk about that'
As for what companies do that,I have no idea,can't help
Here is a little clip about it, part of a larger documentary Netflix made
Usually anything about Transilvania, started either by a Romanian or a Hungarian
The thing is that almost every ex-communist country (Slovenia being the model out of all) are, in comparison with the "west" richer
So it does not surprise me when people associate being poor with being eastern European
We love to trash each other but we're also pretty united in a strange way
Since we're the closest NATO country to Crimea, it feels good having a military base to protect us from Russia
There's an air base near my city, and you can sometimes here distant *woosh*es from that direction
It's funny when they line up with jokes
As long as they keep Russia out I'm fine
The one at Deveselu is doing an amazing job
American soldiers are fucking teenage girls forced into prostitution
Police does nothing
Some of them are killed
Everything is great
You guys make very good matured cheese, yes, but fresh cheese is exquisite in Eastern Europe
(although it's mostly not brand cheese that I'm talking about, but still)
Exactly, just because they are not super marketed, cheese you find in eastern Europe is very underestimated
True, but when you think about it (at least IMHO), both elements - the fish and the fries (I'm not calling them chips lol) - are better in other dishes
Like, the fish is better prepared in Mediterranean dishes - beer batter is kinda boring - and the fries, idk, I just don't like the thick cut + semi-soggy consistency
Much prefer the belgian style: thin, crispy and served with mayo
Tbh I'm really really looking forward to being able to travel again, so my wife and I can visit the UK
Maybe I'll change my mind then
Basing this off the classic British passive-aggresiveness - why, what are they gonna do
Ring me up with a bit of an attitude
I mean, I'll take'em if nothing else
IMO thick cuts are only for patatas bravas - [these ones in Valencia] were amazing
Otherwise, my favorite kind is [these] super crispy thin cuts, with parmesan and chives optional
No, and would probably be unsuccessful
There were in the USA and I tried some kielbasa
Any Romanian sausage is better IMHO
When it comes to food, for me it's hard to choose from Turkish and Hungarian
Romanian would be 3rd and I also wouldn't mind having Italian or French food
No offense, your food is for me just like Czech or German or Austrian
I really like the norse mythlohy and greek mythology
So I like Sweden, Norway, Greece
Germany
It s just that they contributed so much to modern society as people
Japanese for sure
I started with the strongest god, and then with his children, his nephews etc
You'll learn
If I wanted a vacation, interwar period would be nice
If I wanted to learn more about the past (and didn't care about safety), I'd go either sometime in the Early Middle Ages, during Roman conquest or in prehistory
I would go back 20 years only if I can be a child again
Otherwise I would stay put
I prefer being alive and unharmed
1918, Banat Republic
It feels weird to have Banat independent (and with a socialist leader to top it all)
I would like to see that with my eyes
I jsut know like 5 wprds from the russian anthem cuz im a weird
I couldn't hum any of them (maybe besides the French one) to save my life, but the Slovakian and the Italian ones are my favorites
lmao people just FLEX, and when i say flex i mean FLEX, Big Houses, Super Cars, Everything outta gold
They are two different perspectives: the normal people, who don't have the same possibilities, but who are not interested because they realise the importance of the medium class and the rest of society who have the ideal of the wealth, so the society is divided
The majority is, however, sceptic and, even more(indifferent, malicious) with the rich people who are flexing on us
I can't say the same thing in the political context, they are some politicians, in Romania, who steal and who become rich just because of us
The society became so frustrated when the politicians had adapted an urgent ordinance who modified the laws of the justice
The people had protested and, the government fell 3 months ago, after two years of continual protests online and in the streets
So,  in Romania, the grandiosity of the rich people is not supported and encouraged, especially because we are a poor country reported to the European Union
And, in general, the mentality doesn't permit to praise himself because it's immoral in a society abounded by poor guys
Hope you understand the situation
Every kid nowadays tries to look like a rapper from the States
Just like Nobility during the Baroque, everything must be made of gold and have as many details as possible
nah they are mostly "gypsies" who are rich just because of their parents and their parents spoil them so hard, i was in a village last summer and i saw 4 identical houses for each family member
Normally gypsis flex the most, building themselfs castle like homes, that is for the 2% of them that are actually wealthy
And yes they are flat out A-holes
Super cars aren't that much of a thing here though, well at least not in the captial where I live, the richer people in here just have a mansion here and there, less opulant and better looking
Trăsniții (the crazies)
Originally a military themed sitcom called Trăsniți în NATO (crazies in NATO) staring a group of soldiers and their shenanigins and later it became a regular sitcom known simply as Trăsniții
It ended last year at season 34 ep 1847 after running for 20 years
I'm not sure, but I believe it's Trasnitii (also known as Trasniti in NATO/din NATO)
From the wiki page: number of episodes: 2157 and number of seasons: 54
Also, "La Bloc" - with 525 episodes and 13 seasons
When my gf visited my family in Moldova she said she couldn't understand my grandparents for a couple of days before she got used to how they spoke
That accent just sounds like a different language
We use older/different words and there's Russian influence in the pronunciation (even if we try not to use actual Russian words, which sometimes we do)
I'm told that I automatically switch to it when I'm talking to family, even on the phone, and my friends find it hilarious
Not really the case in Romania, but some regions have specific words (regionalisms)
In 2005 in Brasov(city in Carpathian mountains in Romania) it snowed pretty hard and pretty much .I remember coming from school on the "tracks" left by cars in the snow and pretending im some sort of a train (i was like 6 year old) and there was always plently of snow for snowmans , castles , anything .Right now it barely snows once a year and next day is already melting .Climate change is as real as it can get
When I was a kid, a lot
I remember neighborhood was white all winter and there where many days with heavy snow
Since like when I started high school, snow becams quite scarce
In one winter (11th grade), there was almost no snow in winter, but there were like 3 days of snow at the end of March
This is how it was in my hometown though
Different regions might be completely different in terms of weather, since Romania has a great variety of relief, and the mountains king of cut NS through the middle, so different global currents can influence some regions more than others
In London it’s rare if we see snow once a year, it used to snow WAY more though
In western Romania it can snow from November to April and the snow sticks for days when it happens
However in total I’d say we have around 20 days of snow / year
Currently living in Dublin where last winter we had just a few snowflakes once that didn’t stick anyway
Yes, some times even during spring/ early summer (this year it snowed in april)
When I was a kid I remember the first snow would fall somewhere in November and we'd have snow on the ground for weeks, maybe months
Now it's basically cycles: it snows now, we have snow for a week, then it gets hotter and it melts, then it snows again etc
It's insane when you think about it
When I was a kid it used to snow quite often every winter but in the last years I've barely seen any snow
Last year's winter was basically a colder autumn in my town
It's sad to hear kids these days getting excited for winter to play with snow and stuff but not getting the chance to experience it
No one has that  over here maybe some tattoos here and there but other than the occasional teen with 3 piercings in his lip you don't really see anyone wearing any
And in the workplace it depends but usually you don't even ask for permission to wear them you just don't wear them from the start
Depends on the workplace
I believe it's more strict the closer you get to direct public interaction and also on the prestige/class level of the job
In everyday life though I'd say they're fairly accepted especially in the educated youth bubble, but there are still plenty of conservative (usually elderly) people that might stare or comment on them
>women here tend to be on the more decorated side
This is how I'll describe myself from now on in English
I imagine this is true in our kind of countries
In Germany for instance, I was examined by doctors with neck tattoos
And almost everyone in my lab has a piercing somewhere other than the "normal" place
And I've been to science conferences in Belgium/Netherlands/Canada and a lot of people even older have a lot of piercings and/or tattoos
I guess that in some fields, in some places, it doesn't matter so much how someone decides to decorate themselves
Same in Romanian
This, here is the correct way
Not great
But there are more and more atheists/agnostics among younger generations
I was in a huge scandal back in my late teens because my cousin found out I'm an atheist that supports the pro-choice movement and then she told almost everyone in the family
That sucked
The younger generations are generally ok with it, but if an older person hears that you're an atheist, they'll either say that you are dumb and should reconsider your choices, or they outright say that you'll burn in hell
If I'm not mistaken, Romania has the smallest percentage of atheists in all of the countries from the European Union
My country is still super religious so claiming to be an atheist in looked down upon
However, there are quite a few people that are atheist/agnostic, but mentioning it will come with a lecture from any old lady that hears you
well i'm an agnostic
what i can say is that the younger people won't care about it and the older people will find it extremely weird
when i told my parents that i'm one they didn't say anything, since my dad is an atheist and my mom isn't religious at all, but i'd imagine that that wouldn't be the case in most families
Here in Romania Grandmothers act like Atheists are the bane of existance
spawn of the devil
mothers just don't accept it as a real thing
In the cities no one gives one
In the smaller towns or especially the countryside you are considered a little bit of a jerk, as there are very little atheists around here
People are ok with preferring Pepsi over Coca Cola in Norway
Oh same here, I bet those statistics are overly inflated because most Romanians are non-practising ot closeted atheists
In big cities people don’t really care (at least Bucharest)
I assume that most people of my age are not religious until it’s proven wrong
Most would probably identify as Orthodox but most probably don’t care
Or do we
I still believe those stats are overly inflated because it includes non practising, if they asked if they practised it would be a whole different fish food
I know that in bigger cities most people don't care because they are populated by more and more younger people
But in smaller cities like my hometown or villagers things are pretty bad
I live in Iasi most of the time so I don't have to deal with fanatics all the time like I used to
Two years ago, people forced the goverment to start a referendum in order to change the marriage definition in the Constitution because it was kinda "vague". The definition was something like:"marriage is the union between two people" so they wanted to be change to:"marriage is the union between man and a woman". LBGT marriages are not even legal here but people are crazy
Would that make LGBT marriages technically legal
Hmm
No, maybe, Idk
If you remember that referendum was a big circus
He ..... talks
like
this
We're not even sure he knows he won the november elections, probably preparing for his speech right now
He speaks way too slow
Like waaaaaaaaay too slow
We usually make fun on how slow he speaks and thats it
But jokes about our past and current prime ministers
Oh boy
Our last prime minister was a lady that she didn't know how to speak proper romanian, she said that Pristina was the capital of Montenegro, she though that the Pope was orthodox etc
Our current one is a guy who likes to dance veeeery weird (youtube
com/watch
v=fHScwoOHKrQ)
Sorry for my english
The fact that he speaks very very slowly, and his dumb looking grin
Talks
Like
This
Also a few years ago there was this popular meme with him eciting a plane with cool sunglasses on a national holiday and he looked badass
Now a days when dragnea was a leader everyone was saing m*ie dragnea
In Romania, our president, Klaus Iohannis, is named the "ficus" because he talks very very slow and he is quite inactive
But he have been having a lot of hilarious phrases like:"Ha Ha Ha"(told very slow and ironically for express a bad joke) or "Ghinion"(bad luck), as a response of a question about his houses(6 houses
In general, he is well-known for his slowness:)))
She said Pristina is the capital of Montenegro not Kosovo though
Hahah i made the same mistake
Damn
Fats*
Well, depends on the language around the word
In Romanian, the name is Budapesta, with an s sound
In English, I just pronounce it Budapest, also with an s sound
It's in the same way that București is Bucharest in English, which sounds very different, but I still use Bucharest when speaking in English
The rule I usually follow is to use the rules of the language I'm speaking when the name is translated, not the rules of the original language
For example, when speaking French, I would say Allemagne, not Deutschland or Germany
In Romanian we say Budapesta, Boo-da-pes-ta
The a are as in Mario
I mean, if this is instant magic we're talking about, then Russian, Japanese and some Scandinavian language or Chinese or hindi or Arabic
Cuz there's no way I'm learning all that without instant magic
I'd like Dutch because it's cool
Bulgarian because whenever I go through Bulgaria I have to argue with border guards that most of the time don't speak English
And Swedish to be able to understand some of the shit my mate sends to me
Vietnamese, an old man from the USA lives across the street
The second would be German bc I want to dress like Adolf, go to the center of Bucharest and yell Guess who is back traitors (Romania changed sides during ww2) and the final one would be ancient Chinese so I  can speak and the Eastern European security systems (Old ladies who spy on you ) could not conceive that the can not understand what I am saying
I'm surprised that not many people chose chinese(whichever one's spoken more, mandarin
) First of all it's incredibly hard to learn so you'd skip alot of effort, a huge fraction of the globe speaks it, and at the same time they don't speak english unlike india
Plus there's lots of business to be done there
Other than that probably Russian, due to the constant contact with russian people while playing video games, and their culture in general
They're also english averse
And i'm torn between either german or spanish or japanese
This comes with the caveat that i already know english french and romanian
We didnt have many monuments but those that were
Were destroyed and replaced with monumets of the heros of December 1989
Well, most of them were removed
Unfortunately, I was born 15 years after the Revolution, so I could only see them in photos
However, most of them were removed in '89, and other monumenrs were built in a hurry in their place
Now we have a statue of an impaled potato in the middle of Bucharest
Happy cake day
On the sub page, there should be 3 dots on the right upper side
Those open a menu, you would want to go to "Change user flair" and there choose what you want
That's it if you're using the app
You're welcome
they all sounds very good imo
How are you supposed to know which table is that
Going from uk pints to the small lab-like glasses people drink in Koln was really weird, it took me some time to get used to
I don't abandon my beers
All the police officers in Romania wear hand guns, when on duty
Machine guns and stuff only for special police forces
There's armed cops at airports and as response units in Romania, but that's about it
Even this much feels too much to me tbh
"Road is road" Cyclists are looked down on by drivers because they "didn't go to driving school, no license, they don't know the struggle of traffic". Drivers often yell at you to cycle on the sidewalk, most of them don't use the signal when turning and there are often collisions
Also hitting one of the many potholes at 30km/h on a city bike would send you walking to the nearest bike shop
In Romania we have paths on sidewalks built just in electoral campaign they promised a better bike infrastructure but i think we will never see a romanian go to work with his bike rather than his car
I start to see a little bit of movement in this area but i am not optimistic
I live in Netherlands and the infrastructure here is pretty good
Sure, there's always room for improvement, but the bike almost always has priority over cars and even pedestrians
On the other hand, in my native country the whole infrastructure is a joke
There are a few paths in the cities, but they look like they have been designed by people that never cycled before
Cycling in any Romanian major city is a very dangerous activity
In the smaller cities, there is no traffic so it's safe, the only problem is that the roads are full of potholes
My city keeps trying to promote cycling but it's not built with cycling in mind and on top of that there are a lot of people who leave their brain in the passenger seat when driving
Have heard the following way too much: "iF I sEe a bIKe On mY rOaD I kilL". This comes from otherwise mentally healthy people
Usually me and my brother lock ourselves in one room so we don’t have contact with them until the launch/dinner is ready
If my parents are not home when the rest of the family visits then I have to talk to them and make sure they don’t stare too much at everything in my house or garden
Those gatherings are quite fun in my opinion
We gather around every weekend or
every day because we live very close of each other  and are very close
We don't have family gatherings
My mom's side and dad's side don't even know each other
We've never gathered more then one family visiting another
We all live in the same city so idk, we've just never been close I guess
There is also the uncle who has to get carried home because he can't walk anymore from all the alcohol
At some nouns, the plural desinence, and the definite article are all "-i"s so, for the word "copil"(child) for example we have "copii" as the indefinite plural form and "copiii" as the definite plurar form
In the latter, the first "i" is the one from the singular root of the word, the second is the plural  desinence and the third is the definite article
To these three we can add a fourth one, but it will be considered a seperate word, but in pronounciation it will be pronounced as one, so we can have the sentence:
"Copiii-i făceau micul dejun
" which means
"His kids were making him breakfast
In this example, the last "i" is a pronominal adjective and means "his".
The swear words in Romanian
Let me give you a few examples
Futu-ți morții mă-tii
= Fuck your mother's dead relatives
Băgami-aș pula în rasa ta
= Introducing my dick into your race
Du-te dracu
= literally "go satan",but it is used as go to hell
And,my faveourite
Făceamea-și schiuri din crucea mă-tii
= Making ski's for myself out of your mothers grave cross
•Double negatives: “Nu vreau nimic
” (I don’t want nothing)
•I don’t know the name for this, but we double the indirect object “complement indirect”: “I-am dat lui Andrei o ciocolată.” (I gave Andrew a chocolate to him
) instead of “Am dat lui Andrei o ciocolată.” (I gave Andrew a chocolate
•We don’t have a word for “nap”. Instead we use “un pui de somn” (a baby sleep) or simply say “somn de după-amiază” (afternoon sleep)
Not a sentance and not my first language, but in Hungarian 8
15 is “quarter nine” and 8
45 is “three quarters nine” and that makes no sense whatsoever in any other language as far as I know
Azi la prânz o să mă sinucid
Să-l ia dracu de viitor perfid
M-am săturat de lumea asta fără rimă;
O să fentez poeții, o să comit o crimă
Pe care n-o s-o ancheteze nimeni niciodată -
Cea mai proastă crimă comisă vreodată.
Today at lunch i'm going to kill myself
Fuck the perfidious future
I'm fed up with this rhymeless world;
I'm going to trick the poets, I'm going to commit a crime
That no one will never investigate -
The dumbest crime comitted ever
The dumb parts are: we put the adverb at the end of the sentence , we have the special characters (ă ,â, î , ş , ţ)
You should also add that the plural word "copii" with the accent placed differently (first syllable instead of last) is a different word, meaning 'copies' (i.e. photocopies)
Aren't we all copies of our parents
Yes, but by the logic of “half nine”, 8
45 should be “quarter nine” not the other way around
I get “half nine”, but the fact that the quarters are reversed is baffling to me
Fuck that's deep
I understand “half nine” as being half an hour before nine
As 8
45 is “quarter to nine” in most languages , as in “a quarter before nine”, by my logic 8
45 should be “quarter nine” not “three quarters nine”
Since no Romanian commented, I'll do it
Those are super basic, and almost everyone knows them

fun fact: dante alighieri is also a high school in Bucharest
>Søren Kierkegaard
>H.C. Andersen
That's why I love danish culture !
it isnt like british council
it is just like a normal high school anyone with good enough grades can enter
you can go on the Italian section but it also has normal classes like every other high school
my pleasure
Donno but one of the funniest memories I have and keep involves a drunk Brit, a yellow chicken costume and rain
In Bucharest city centre
It was just
priceless
I could write a short novel describing the whole scene
The apogee was when he decided he should give up the costume and just walk naked
Do you think it is easy to remove a yellow chicken costume when you are drunk
IT IS NOT
It takes a lot of skills
Skills that are altered by alchool
All in all I don't know about the balconies but we do keep an eye on Brits just to be sure they don't die or hurt themselves
I read a couple of years ago that this is a very common cause of death for young american coeds during spring break
Yet it's not because they jump and fail to land in the pool, it's due to hanging over the window and waiving at all the other coeds hanging over the window right after checking in the hotel
Some go to far and fall to their deaths
Normal conversations: English > Romanian
Swearing: English <<< Romanian
English is OK, I'm happy I can speak it
The only thing that kind of bothers me is the "lack of expressions".
I think Romanian has a lot more expressions
And we have bigger and smaller ones too
I'm watching right now and American show and a Romanian one in parallel and it's just so striking how many small and big expressions the Romanian guys use and how little the Americans use
It's a little bit like in Romanian people make reference to things constantly, while in English you do you just sometimes
But I may be completely wrong
After all, I'm not native so maybe there's this big chunk of the language that I missed completely
That's exactly how I feel
English is fine most of the time, but I can express things in a much more interesting way in Romanian
I am 15 and I am not worried about myself, but about my family

"In Romania we don't have corruption, bribes are just a cultural way of thanking someone"

Another great one is when she was asked if she can speak english, she answeared:
"in a month after the elections I will hold a speach in english", the elections were back in fall
I can't decide which one is the funniest
We have something similar:
>Romania is a beautiful country, too bad it's inhabited
Ah yes parchetul este din parchet
(The floor is made of floor)
I'd rather translate pitica dracu as fucking midget, it sounds better

Întreabă-i pe r/Romania de ce românii sunt obsedați de opiniile altora despre noi
It's viewed pretty badly from here
Ahh Romania
I love it and hate it
However the discrimination in Western Europe is so bad that you have to go to the point of saying your from Moldova and not Romania
I wish people would learn we are nice european brothers
From my country it's seen as corrupted
Oh yeah and our prime minister is literally illiterate
Man FUCK GYPSIES making us look bad >:(
>Ice Hockey team
We do
I like your roads, Romania will never be on that level ngl
Verry funny, u/xXx69TwatSlayer69xXx
I thought you Germans are really tall
r/tehnicallythetruth
Hey, at least we have gypsies not we are gypsies
It reminds me of a saying, we all use at some point
Beautiful country, shame it's inhabited
That is actually good to hear
We love you guys
Long live Serbia
Screw Albania
I'd love to hear both
both
Believe me we Romanians hate gypsies even more than other countryes
They stole my fucking bike when I was 9
>"Be careful that romanians don't steal your stuff, keep it locked"
"Be careful that romanians don't steal your stuff, keep it locked"
Sorry, but this is so lame and ignorant
Wait people do that
I'm shooketh
Holy shit besides the long hair this is exactly my friend’s story
His mom left to work there to help pay the house they bought with a loan in swiss francs(wich grew in value over the years so they were really screwed )
So after a couple months his mom left his romanian dad for a rich guy in the netherlands and then got my friend and his brother to live with her and their new stepbrother
He got so fat i didn t even recognised him when he came to visit
That s his life now smokes weed everyday :))
hahah
Us Romanians don't really got roads so I guess we'll have to give em to u
Well be glad you have someone to harvest your strawberries :))))
>they are only country that we border that we've never been to war with
Well
there was ww2
I really dont wanna ruin the fun but as much as we love you guys we kinda had some conflicts in the early 14th century when serbia as a vasal of ottoman empire fight alongside ottomans against wallachia,hungary and moldavia BUT THE LOVE IS STILL THERE
What about Agent 47 ?
about what
The parts about the language is true our language is mostly latin and slavic
The youth (this includes myself) is a mixed bag
On one hand you've got the people leaving the country (me ayyy) who are usually smart and worked to the bone in education
And on the other hand we've got the ones who smoke a lot, drink a lot, have parties and turn into cocalari later
Our youth right now is european and in the country non existant
It's shit here and if you ask a romanian immigrant in a higher sector they most certainly are going to tell you that we are not patreotic and it's a shit country lmao
God dag fra Romania btw :)
>we enevy you because we see how you are handling your government
I heard it is bad there in Serbia, but is it so bad that you are envious on US
I hate most of these things except for transylvania
A piece of advice, try the county of Sibiu and Brasov
Both of them have autro-hungarian/german influence :)
>and you have 24/7 stores everywhere
Are Non-stops not as huge of a thing outside of Romania
>reliable
If it was not reliable, than your factories would not be full of them
So that's why Pewdiepie was making all those Romanian jokes back then
Makes sense now
I have green eyes and no round cheeks :(
Your Labour doesn't feel great lately either :)
what's wrong with it
In Bucharest we have almost no stray dogs left
A child got killed by a pack of stray dogs so the goverment got them all
Not sure about rural areas tho
> gypsies come from there
I'm pretty sure they come from India, Hans
Soooo
who wants your land
Where does this come from
Because we are tired to help them
Keep giving them money
They come back here and build "nice looking" [houses]
We have a team
Never ever did i think about Romania having an ice hockey team
> 10% in Bulgaria vs 3% in Romania
If only
Gypsies are vastly undercounted on Romanian censuses; most independent observers estimate that they comprise 10% of the population in Romania as well, and roughly 20% of the youngest generation
omg
Fine with me, I can't say no to shots
Neat
Same
Oh and how do I add Romania to my name
They stole my phone when I was 8 lmao
No we don't. I don't hate them
Neither my friends or my family
I don't care if people call us gypsies
So be it
Whoever does that type of superficial racist comment is the one who should feel ashamed
Not me
You wrote really good
Shhhhhh, don't ruin this
I would prefer being called a vampire over a communist any day
You also hate world class gymnasts, football and tennis players
You forgot about central Europe as well(slovenia slovakia croatia)
People from the East are good as long they do the jobs the western don’t want to do
Yup
I was thinking the same
Yeah and this sounds racist, I dont understand why the westerns can be so racists and xenophobic towards romanians and romani people but at the same time they are fighting against racism
In West Europe there are a lot of hypocrite people
Aparent
Not really
I don't know a word in hungarian amd most of the people I know don't either
And you think that Bulgarian numbers are more precise
For what we know there could be as many as 18%.
Haha then the eternal city is full of gypsies haha so funny
Go to the subreddit main page, press on the 3dots in the top Right corner and press add flair
Still i dont blame him or serbia till his final moments at least he was a loyal vassal  ,it is not our role to judge if what he did was right or no, he believed in his actions and motives and fought for them and his country till the very end and that should make him a hero in my opinion
Damn
Nice
Buna idee, ii respect
When I said "US" I just capitalised the pronoun "us" but whatever
Ah shit I stopped reading after the first sentence
Whole Germany is full of Romanians workers because they work for shit salaries and because they are hardworking
Stop being xenophobic
I don't remember them but I think one of them was him breaking his 1mil play button and then saying "Here, take this Romanian
" or something like that
I get what you are saying
But most people don't care
We have a hockey team
Neah
they understand and speak Hungarian
It is just a matter of choice
My grandparents were fluent in Hungarian but they only used it ocasionally with Hungarian citizens who really can't speak our language :)
Thanks
It's not perfect, but it's pretty good
>westerns can be so racists and xenophobic towards romanians and romani people but at the same time they are fighting against racism
In West Europe there are a lot of hypocrite people
Dude, is like saying " Our country do not has a very good opinnion about USA, there are so many niggars there". This is pretty ignorant, xenophobic, racist and disgusting, I do not care that the people from West do not know much about Romania, being an ignorant is not an excuse
Yes, but at this point Pălincă has also become a romanian word
We have to be the best at something
Probabil nu o sa aiba la cum este guvernul
I live in Bucharest but my grandparents were from Bihor
Your Romanian is going great
Much better than my failed trying in learning Dutch :))
>majority of encounters people have with gypsies is negative can you really blame them for mistrusting and disliking that
Is not an excuse that they had negative encounters with the romani people
Saying that you have a bad perception of Romania because it is full of "gypsies" is racist, disgusting and ignorant, especially coming from a westerner
and counting
Felicitări pentru progrese
You are correct
People see Transilvania as a homogenous part when in reality it is very diverse both culturally and ethnically
I have seen people sitting at the same table speaking to eachother one in Romanian and the other replying in Hungarian very natural and fluent
As you can imagine it was crazy for an outsider like me
But it made me realize how beautiful a moment like that can be and how much it hurts when a small group of both Romanians and Hungarians are ruining this with hate speech
I suppose it is hard to be objective and we all have had different good or bad experiences with other nationalities or minorities
The easiest way is to put a label "good" or "bad" and ignore everything else
I am sad
I've read the comment thread and I was thinking *"should I label everyone as being racists towards gipsies and ignorants regarding us"*? It would be easier
But I know that one person's opinion does not reflect the majority
And even if the majority has a wrong opinion, that still doesn't matter because among them there are people worth more than the majority :)
>words in my mouth and embar
Why do you take this so personal

Just made a point on how the western people are hypocrite because they can be racist towards gypsies but at the same time they are fighting against racism towards other ethnical groups
Romania was given as an example, because this subject is about Romania
I haven’t seen a Romanian comment yet
but no I don’t think so for us
We are very different compared to Italian/Spaniards/Portuguese
I feel we’re closer to Slavs & Balkan people
I’m not fluent but all I know is that Italian, Spanish and Portuguese are the close ones and that the other two are a little bit more different
Really
Maybe depends on which area you're from
I've always seen cultural similarities mostly with Spaniards and Italians
Living abroad and having co-workers from other latin-based countries felt like an inner circle
Disagree completely with the Slavs part
Oh that’s cool
So do you know any Italian or Portuguese without actually studying it since the languages are similar
I’m not fluent in Italian, but I’m studying it :D
They are
Italian is the easiest Romance language for me to understand without actually knowing it
Slovenian is also beautiful
For me it was completely different
I didn't get along with Spaniards or the French
I'm in Germany now and most of my friends are Slavs
We don't like admitting it, but we are a profoundly Balkan culture
Yes we get along well with Spaniards and Italians because we do share some broad cultural traits, but that is true for all of southern Europe
Our culture is closer to Balkans and Turkey than it is to Western Europe
I grew up Romania (Brasov) but now live in the US
I hangout with a lot of Serbs and Russians and our cultures are very similar
I’ve met Italians and think our cultures are more similar but cant say the same about Spaniards and French
Me too, I also feel we are a lot like Italians, but we definitely have some common cultural ground with Serbs and Bulgarians
It is in in Eastern Europe though
As someone with an Italian dad and Romanian mum, you are right
I’ve lived in EU & US now and while in other European countries you see more of a mix of nations
In the US you’re more prone to meet Russians than Spaniards and if you lump those together of course Ro will be more similar to Ru than to US
The overall environment has a huge impact
When I lived in NL, it was very hard to see similarities with my Ru colleagues and that’s because in Europe you already have a big common foundation (which, if you have that with everyone, makes you go into cultural specifics, which is why I felt closer to Italians, for example)
You don’t have that in the US so it’s natural to see Slavs & Russians culturally closer here
Totally disagree
Im a romanian in the US as well and romanians here usually stay away from slavs as well as other romanians haha and mingle more with americans and hispanics
I think we'd like to stay in the east too
I mean, we got buddies over here
Câmpulung was one of the first capitals of Romania
My city of Buzău, Romania has more natural landmarks than historical, but:
Our city hall is a palace in the city downtown, called the Comunal Palace
Our coat of arms had a phoenix / dragon on it because the city was destroyed by fires multiple times but it was rebuild every time (like a phoenix, birth from its ashes)
Idk if Iași,,my city, has any ither landmarks that are older
Im pretty new in the city
But I think I can say we have the Culture Palace ,a building like a castle with some museums in it
It looks so cool on the outside
Here s a photo of it:
Here in Braşov we have the Black church wich is black because of a fire that ravaged the city a long time ago and the huge walls surrounding the city and the Tâmpa mountain with the big bold ***BRAŞOV***  sign
Hollywood style
And the big citadel on the hill overlooking the city .... Oh and the museum right next to the church etc ... etc
Bucharest - Parliament’s house (ex People’s house) 2nd largest building in the world
The entire greek port of Tomis in Constanța.
The [Orthodox cathedral] mostly, but some might consider the [Catholic Dome] too
In romanian its "ciocan". Pretty hard sounting tbh
We have ciocan for a usual hammer, cio like the cho from chocolate and can like toucan
For sledgehammer we have baros
I doubt mine will pass: ciocan (pronounced ch-o-k-an)
Similar in Romanian - 'ciocan', would probably sound like 'chukan'.
Its molot not molotok
To me the kalapacs sounds way more badass
The other one sounds like food for people without teeth
About 15 euros
I make like 400 euros a month
It's not much, but I manage
I could go for 50 euros, but I'd have to give up some food
I pay a bunch for gluten free food because I have celiac
I bought myself a car 2 years ago with what I saved in 3 years
I can give my example
I earn about 650 € per month
That is the salary after tax
I live in Bucharest which is the country's capital
I fully support myself for a few years now without any money from my parents, friends or other family members
I save up on average 100 € per month
This is an average as sometimes I save more and sometimes due to unexpected expenses or expenses higher than usual, in some months I cannot save money
The northeners will eat leek, drink țuică, bake [mucenici] for 9 March, kill each other with Katanas and speak in perfect simple but otherwise standard Romanian
While the Southerners will eat [poale-n-brâu] drink horincă, bake [Sfințișori] for 9 march, kill each other with axes and speak in a  Ukrainian accent
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson, old man
happens often, did it quite a bit after clubbing when i was younger lol (romania + uk)
I like it a bit softer
If it takes 9 minutes for it to be al dente I let it boil for 10
I prefer them soft, al dente seems a bit raw for me
Soft
It just tastes better to me
That we are not a third world communist country
The fact that there are other places besides Transylvania
Well, I have been a tour guide and most of the people that visit Romania are surprised that we are not a shithole like Somalia or something
With those prices i'd become an expert homemade brewer
Do you also have intercourse but in a not gay mode
So, we both eat pizza normally, its settled
Is home-brewing illegal in Finland
You don't reach just by running the speeds you reach cycling
+ The probability of hitting another cyclist are way bigger than hitting another runner
Lol
In Romania homemade distilling is very popular, it's a tradition (unfortunately)
If it would become illigal probably we start a revolution
Maybe professionals, not average joggers
Romanian language it's as spanish on this matter
Each letter will always have same pronounciation (exception is C/G followed by I or E when we pronounce like ChanGe , otherwise like in CoGnitive) so such contest , as you figured out for spanish, wouldn't make much of a sense
I've only head of spelling bees from American TV shows
Never seen such a thing IRL
Answering the edit: When I was young, we would learn to write and read in the first year of school (age 7) and then have spelling tests ("dictări") until fourth year (age 10)
They've added another year of school at age 6 so I don't know how things have changed
I saw spelling bee american shows but i never knew what they were called
I found them really entertaining
In Romania we don't spelling bees because the language is phonetic
It can vary by accent though, depending on region, like the word "pe" (P eh) being spoken as "pi" (p ee) or "pă" ( the "ă" is spelled like the "u" in but) or the word "ceva" (tch eh-v  ah, v always spelled like in the word "vowel") spelled as "șieva" (sh ee eh - v ah) but once you recognize the accent it is easy to realize the proper spelling so it's rarely a problem unless you encounter a really heavy and regional accent with lots of regional words
But the language itself, when spoken properly, with no accent, is very exact with it's spelling, and even with an accent (because most accents aren't that heavy) it is quite easy to understand how someone speaks and change the consonants and vowels properly, because accents are quite regular in what sounds are pronounced different from the norm
We don't have such a thing
Even more, our language is so phonetic that we don't even have a word for 'spelling'. In the rare cases where we don't know how to spell something (a foreign name for example), we use the phrase "cum se scrie/how do you write it" or "spune pe litere/say it letter by letter"
>you always know how to write a word by listening to it
For all romance leanguages is the same rule
Look at the Word "lup" for exemple (wolf) even if you are an italian you knwo how to spell it
Same for Romania
Our language is phonetic, so there's really no point in spelling bees
Very few words are spelled weirdly and most of them aren't of Romanian origin
Mostly new foreign
Yeah probably Italian would be a better analogy for Romanian
Maybe with a tiny bit of room for confusion, for example some diphtongs might get confused with others ("ia" with "ea", "ie" with "e", "ua" with "oa" etc), but not spelling-bee-worthy in any way lol
I find all those variations you pointed out pretty interesting, funny how Spanish is always well known for the easy and consistent pronunciation, but then in the opposite direction it doesn't quite work the same
>is it the same for french though
I think so
I said that bcs when I was still in school a lot of french words were spelled similar like in romanian
It may by also because we barrowed an enormous amount of words from them, maybe a FRENCH PERSON  will be sweet and explain to us how really is
Popular vote, if in the first round of elections no candidate gets more than 50% of the votes, than a second round is held with only the 2 most voted candidates from the first round and the one who gets more than 50% of the votes win
Case 1: in the first round of voting:
•candidate A gets 53% of votes
•candidate B gets 24%
•candidate C gets 13%
• other candidates get the remaining 10%
In this case candidate A wins
No second round of elections is needed
Case 2: in the first round of voting:
•candidate A gets 42% of votes
• candidate B gets 28%
•candidate C gets 26%
• other candidates get the remaining 4%
In this case candidate A and B go into the second round of elections and whoever gets more than half the votes in that round is the winner
Same here but I don’t know if the more than 50% rule applies
To win from the first round, a candidate has to get 50% __of all registered voters__.
It does
You are correct, thanks for pointing it out, Til :)
Yes and no
Depends a lot on the family
In my case, my parents don't badger either me or my brother to settle down
I do have some relatives that "encourage" me to date/get married cuz I'm a girl
And in our larger family people sometimes say that my bro is a big hulky man so he'll be fine by himself and I, the cute tiny woman, will not
But my parents understand that I'll be fine, while he will not (big hulky crybaby that's what he is)
They only insisted for my brother to buy an apartment when it was cheaper, because it sounded like a good investment to them
I have a lot of friends my age (30) that recently married
I don't really feel any kind of pressure about this
Except from a small (unhappy) group of people
Romanians are in general opportunists
We have this mentality of "pushing through the crowd to get ahead". So I feel that most people understand that one person wants a family and another wants a career
As a woman I have been incuraged by family, friends and my friends' families to settle down, especially since I have been in a serious relationship for a few years now
I got comments such as "even if it doesn't work out, you have to try" to "What else would you do with your life" to "you will die sad and alone, none will want to take you when you are pass 30 and you will only have to choose from men with kids and an alcohol addiction". My grandma cried when she found out, because she "fears she doesn't know what will come of me".
So yeah, no pressure
I think my parents are still hopeful, but I am legit forbidden from telling some of my relatives about my plans, because they are very conservative and would go crazy
* Transylvania: Slow shepherds with an ubercomplex
* Banat: Rich and arrogant people who blame immigrants for all the problems
* Oltenia: Stupid peasants who talk fast
* Bucharest: Arrogant city people who consider everyone outside Bucharest a peasant
* Moldavia: Alcoholics with funny accents
* Vaslui: Axe totting,wife beating,alcoholic rednecks and rapists
* Szekelyland: Hungarian separatists
* Dobrogea: Fish eating beach muslims
*Stereotypes about Romanians from different regions:*
Transylvanians, Oltenians and Moldovans are probably the ones who get the most stereotypes and jokes:
**Moldovans** \- they drink too much, especially the ones in the Republic of Moldova, which is known for its wine
Also, they always pronounce E (‘’eh’’) as I (‘’ee’’), again, especially the ones in the Republic
There is also a joke about that
**Transylvanians** \- they talk too slowly and sometimes are also slow in general
Otherwise, they don’t really have stereotypes, they are seen rather well
**Oltenians** \- I’ve heard many say they’re stupid (that’s just a stereotype, ok
Also, some people say they think they are too *şmecheri* (I don’t think that word has got a proper English translation, but it means something like thinking you’re very cool or badass)
Other regions also have stereotypes, but are not being talked about so much:
**Muntenians** \- some say they are also *şmecheri*, maybe not quite as much as Oltenians
**Bucharesters** \- too arrogant
**Banatians** \- see themselves as the head of the country and don’t like being called Transylvanians
**Bucovinians** \- they don’t like being called Moldovans
Bucharest citizen
Can confirm
Get out you peasants
Vaslui is like ultimate Moldavia
I agree from Transylvania
I hate being in a hurry
Can't confirm
Me and my bănățeni friends are poor
Person from bucharest: Oh you are from Clooojj, get away you filthy peasant
Of course we blame immigrants for all the problems when 5/10 people in Banat are from Oltenia (and , as you described them , are just stupid) .
Molisen't
*describes rest of the country as some backwards hellhole*
Vienna: considers rest of the country a backwards hellhole
*Surprised pikachu face*
As a *Bucovinean* I can confirm
It's Romania's Florida Man county
True, Maramureş and Satu-Mare should be classified separately
Yes
But they are catholics and write in latin alphabet
Shit
I need to step my game up
In all seriousness though, your country is really not a backwards hellhole, it’s one of the most civilized countries in europe
Maramureş: the northern part of Transylvania, called Moroşeni (Morosheni), have a different aproach towards things
The Oseni are the best scythe workers in the country, one individual being able to manually cut a hilltop full of grass in a day
Hard working people, love *horincă and slănină.*
Well civilized can be looked at from two perspectives
Civilized compared to the others, or civilized compared to your own moral compass
Since I said “in europe” I compared it to the others
We should all aspire for something better, but it’s good consolation sometimes to remember that *it could be worse* .
Oaş people are rich AF, just look at Certeze and Negreşti - Oaş.
Yeah sorry, i should be ashamed
După pui de moroşan să nu dai cu bolovan
In the summer time we take regular trips to Bugaria to eat mussels for lunch and then return to Romania for the desert
Travelling to Belgrade or Budapest from my city in Romania (Timisoara) is faster than going to Bucharest
I chose to go to Belgrade instead of Bucharest for the same concert
We were back home on the same day, if we'd have chosen Bucharest we would've had to stay the night and deal with an exhausting car trip
Outdoor toilet
Not by myself, but by a quarter of my countrymen
So I live in the UK now and I know the reasons for having separate taps are mostly historical and don't apply any more
But damn i hate them so much
I can only wash my hands with freezing cold or boiling hot water
And even worse is that i have sensistive teeth on top of that, they don't like either of the two temperatures
I bought a thingy to connect the two taps and mix the water - best 15 quid ever spent
You can find those toilets in Romania as well, usually in older buildings
The only popular Romanian server i know of is called mc
gamster
org
Less cars parked on sidewalks
If think in Romania there is this super dumb mentality that if you can afford a car, you should buy one
And if your kids are grown up, they need cars too
And your wife needs a car
And you need a special car for work
You don't use all of them all the time
Some cars may be used only once or twice a year, but you need to own them
I just wished people used bicycles more and that we would have more bike lanes and less parked cars
A functional education system
Or at least slightly below average by Western EU standards
Many many Autobahns
Many roads with 0 potholes
I wish our Carpathian mountains would have the same good infrastructure as the Alps
Well kept beaches like in Spain, France or Portugal
The country has everything - 4 seasons, mountains, beaches but corruption is prevalent
I wish the vibrancy of London in big cities but I know that will never happen
Mortgage interest rates like in the west not 6%!!
Nice to have more atheism like in the nordics
I see english is pretty common in the UK
Would be nice to have it here as a second official language
If it’s your only option to recycle it becomes a PITA very quickly
I don't remember a time or a place where I didn't pay contactless in the city
IDK, in Bucharest some areas of high-density appartment blocks are quite nice because they have lots of greenery and the buildings are reasonably spaced out
Some of the newer built stuff is much more on the "concrete jungle" side
I pay 10% out of my gross income to healthcare and I have never been to a public hospital or take a day of medical leave in the last 12 years since I've been employed
If it were opional I would opt out in a heartbeat, especially since my employer ofers a premium private health insurance that is far superior to the public one
Edit for clarity: I am not against free access to healthcare for everyone
The healtcare system in my country is ineficient, corrupt and provides poor quality services so in dire need of restructuring
I have to pay for both the mandatory 10% to the public healt insurance and an additional 300 € to private health insurance because I cannot rely on the public one
I understand that my 10% does not go towards my healthcare, but it does go in a badly managed system that does not really ofer decent care even to the ones who need it most
There is no easy fix to this situation and I do not have a solution but it is frustrating to be paying twice for the same service knowing fully that part of your money go into a badly managed corrupt system where people who are in dire need of it have to slip an envelope into someone's pocked or wait months just to get an appointment
Damn, I pay more for the mandatory one in Romania than he does
It's 10% of gross salary
Healthcare is very much not free
Doctors and pills don't fall out of the sky and they don't work for free
It's not that I do not or will not have health issues, I cannot rely on the public health insurance because the services are so bad and the waiting lists are outrageously long
My mother needed a CT scan with contrast asap due to problems with her kidneys
The public hospital put her on a 6+ months waiting list and told here there's nothing to be done
If she would have waited that long without propper treatment she would have been in dialysis now
I put her on my private health insurence and everything got solved in less than a week
If the entire healtcare system would be restructured and I could confortably go into a hospital without expecting filth and having to handout bribes Ibwould be all for it but as it stands it's of minimal health to everyone
I'm not saying to scrap the public healthcare system entirely, but there should be caps based on income and risk
Besides the heltcare system in romania is dirty, corrupt and ineficient, most people who can afford to , avoid it like the plage and go to private clinics paying out of pocket or through private healt insurance
All things considered I don't think it's fair for me  to be paiying a masive amout of money every month
twice
Renovation can be hard and the roads small, but then the cities tend to be small so you don't need a car
But the build quality is very good on the buildings
Tourism can be a problem too if the city has some interesting historical monuments
Wait, do you guys have different arguments for it
I'm joking though but that is the case in Romania most of the time  when we are talking about an election between two candidates
EU didn't necessarily help you get out of poverty
It was the mere access that allowed more foreign investments into the country (I hope that's what you were hinting at)
Say it after me: the private sector
You have your multinationals in the big cities and factories in the industrial parks
If the governments of the last 30 years would have done their part, Romania would have easily been the economic powerhouse in this side of Europe
As it should be
According to the EU, we lose 15% of our gdp yearly on corruption
That's 38 billion euros annually
And to think we have actually been moving forward, developing further, every year
In spite of this shit
Imagine if that loss of 15% would be 3% like in Denmark, 4% like in Germany, or 6% like in Belgium
The first decent government we will get will show how much better we can get
Though I don't think this election will bring it, I can't but notice how little things show that we're actually heading there
It seems inevitable, almost unavoidable
One of those little things is the decent and/or very good mayors that were elected this year: in Resita, Tulcea, Alba Iulia, Targu Mures, Bacau, Oradea, Timisoara, Brasov, Bucharest, to name the big cities
About 50% are PNL and 50% from USRPLUS
They're good work will do on the long term what Bolojan did for years in Oradea
Except now there will be several Oradea-like examples
That's why my guess is that a greater change is bound for 2024
Meanwhile, yeah, like you say: I can only hope
I think that those mayors will in the future be seen as the sign of the times, as generations are changing anyway and now the ones born after 89 (people born in the year 1990 are gone through college and now are mariied or have kids; they're entering they're 30s, which is crazy), are starting to be more numerous and have a bigger say
Somebody born in 2002 who grew up in the social media age has the right to vote in 2020
That's crazy to me
Bribing police officers, no one seems to do it anymore :(
[Dragobete] it is similar to Valentine's Day but celebrated on 24th february
Sadly I don't know all the traditional stuff they do during this holiday but i'm planning to celebrate it again more or less since I never cared about Valentine's Day
This still happens here and it is called the same, but in Romanian
Girls know that they are going to be soaked and put their phones and watches on a table or somewhere else
Same thing here,only in leanguage that tradition remained, in order to salute a woman we say "saru'mâna" which means "i kiss the hand""
Dragobete was never a national tradition, but a very regional one
It actually took off when some wanted to find a local alternative to Valentine's day
"Reviving" Dragobete is more of an inovation than a tradition
Umm, where exactly
I've literally never heard of that in AR or TM
In Alba, more specifically Ciugud
But I do think it is a matter of the village community
We also have villages where this tradition is not more respected but we try not to forget too many
I think it's [Treceți batalioane române Carpații] a military song written in WW1
It's about the liberating of Transylvania and it's the song that the Army marches on and it's played on our National Day military parade
Also, it's that patriotic song we're all taught at school as 'every Romanian should know it'.
Hora Unirii - It's about Romanians coming to dance and celebrate the Union between the Romanian states
It also sounds amazing
&#x200B;
Here is a link - [
I am sure not everyone agrees but I think this [Made in Romania-Ionut Cercel] is the song that should represent Romania
We'd have loved to say a certain song by Ozone but it belongs to Moldova
> and actually meant to calls for the different German states/regions to unify and work together
That's the first time I've heard this interpretation although it makes sense if you're really into that mindset
I have to admit whenever I hear "Deutschland über alles" my mind immediately jumps to a whole different scenario
The Southern region of Romania is called Muntenia, which would translate to something like "Mountain Country" I guess but it's a big ass plain with some hills in the north as you approach the mountains
Satu Mare, which translates to "Big Village" the point is, it is no longer a village, and it's one of the 50 biggest cities in Romania
We have Baia Mare, which means “the big bath tube” which is one of the furthest cities from Black Sea
City of pubes (Orașul de Floci)
No one lives there anymore and the word initially refered to a type of wool, time changed its meaning to a specific type of human hair
Braşov
it should be named Stalin again
No Icelanders are allowed, but that still opens it up for Greenland
Maybe it was new at that time
So Porto is just port
Creative name
They are not hills, they are called highlands
Sure, call them as you will, but they're not mountains
I agree
Unpopular opinion here: in the grand scheme of things, culture doesn't matter so much
I mean compared to the well-being of the people
And cultures and languages always change, get lost, get modified
I mean, my country's culture got changed so many times, it's bullshit to claim that what we have now is similar to what we had some years ago
And this has to do with the changing political landscape *and* with the people
Expecting people to "preserve" their culture by using it is a fallacy
Just think of some of the batshit crazy things that existed in some cultures 2-300 years ago
It was culture that didn't allow women to be anything more than baby making machines
It was culture that suppressed the gays
Just to be clear, this doesn't exclude the fun parts of certain cultures, however if you want to keep all traditions alive then you have to keep the bad things too, and if you want to keep traditions alive, but exclude the bad things, then you're proving my point that the times and the people enforce change
Culture, music, art in general have everything to do with the times we're living and the people we are
Expecting this to never change is bullshit
My thinking is that whatever people choose in terms of politics should regard the well being of their people, not of their traditions
>What are the specific processes that would allow this to happen under a EU state but not without it
This will happen regardless if we're part of the EU or not
Because people move around, see what others in other countries do/have and bring that knowledge back
And this was the process back in the day as well, but now it's on steroids because of planes and the internet
And unless you cut off the internet and close down the border, you can't stop this from happening
*The future is now old man
It was never "just a trade union". It's direction was political from day 1

I actually started sleeping and eating so much better during the pandemic
Waking up at 7 to get ready for work ( started at 9, commute alone took 1h:20m) meant I only got around 5-6 hours of sleep, since I just can't fall asleep earlier than 1AM
It also meant that even though we had 1h lunch break, lunch was from a food court (so a lot of fast food) and breakfast was whatever I could get from a pastry shop
Dinner was something quick because by the time I got back home it was 19:30 and I just didn't have any energy anymore
But with work from home, I took my life back
My sleep, my healthy eating habits
If I fall asleep at 2, I wake up at 8:30-9:00 feeling so, so rested and jump to work immediately, juggling reading mails and updates with making breakfast - which is a fun multitask
I also have time to try so many fun, new recipes - I still get that 1h of lunch break, but you can do so much in 1h! Dinner is the same
I wrap things up at 18:00, I have two whole free hours before dinner
And, all this is done together with a hubby
Cooking together, eating together, sleeping well on a mattress and pillows we invested in
I have all the time in the world during this period but that starts to make me depressed
I work from home now so I'm lucky to have the comfort of my house at hand
I can wake up even 30 mins before work, I have food in the kitchen, I can take a break from the screen and go lie in bed for 5 mins lol
If I had to physically go to office, I'd probably sleep less because I'd need more time in the morning, maybe rush or even skip breakfast, have a shittier lunch or spend more money on it
Back when I was in uni I probably had the shittiest lifestyle though hahah
Either working or thinking about working, eating fast so I wouldn't waste too much time, lots of all-nighters
A consistent 8 hour workday had been a godsend comparatively
One downside of all this is that I slowed down in a negative way too
Kinda like I lost my sense of time and structure
I'm less punctual and productive, I finish 3 tasks and I'm already tired lol
I have more free time that I can spend
As a freelancer, sometimes I have time, sometimes I don't. Depends on how much work I have to do that day
Some days I work 12 hours straight running on a sandwich and a coffee at most
Others I get to clean around the house and cook something
When I worked full time, I didn't have proper time for anything, because I was always exhausted
I worked in a crappy workplace culture where overtime was considered "the right thing to do" and we had many weekends ruined because we had to come work
It sucked
I find it's quite a mix in terms of my friends, some are overworked and exhausted, some are doing alright
In moldova 2 villages develop this tradition around the 60' when once every year they meet in one place and beat the shit out of each other, ofc in the past years the police intervene and the tradition became the villagers getting beat by police
There are two innovations I can think of, although they are new elements of existing celebrations:
**1
Eating “[fasole cu ciolan] (beans and smoked pork hocks) on National Day**
When Communism fell, the authorities decided to change the national day, from 23 August, the “*Liberation from Fascist Occupation Day*”, a celebration heavily associated with Ceaușescu and the communist regime, to 1 December, „[*Great Union Day*]
The celebrations of this new day included military parades, and with it, free giveaway of food to the public
Since the military was deployed, they served bowl of “fasole cu ciolan”, the stereotypical high-caloric military food
Through repetition, this meal was so associated with the national day, that people started cooking it at home for 1 December
Thus a culinary tradition was born where 3 decades ago there was none
**2
Eating “[Panettone] around Christmas**
“Panettone” is a typical December sweatbread from Lombardy, northern Italy
Italy host the largest Romanian diaspora in the world, with over 1 million Romanians having moved there in the 2000’s, most of them to the richer North
Winter holidays are a time when many of these emigrants return home to spend Christmas with the family, and “panettone” is sort of an ideal gift (delicious, not too expensive and can withstand the journey)
So in no-time it became a staple winter sweet, expanding the choice of sweets during winter time (Romania has its own older sweat-bread, shared with Moldova and Bulgaria, called "[cozonac]
Did you stab yourself
Iohannis
Now that the police is involved is a three-way,free for all i think years ago the guy who was in charge regarding the police force got suspended for ordering his mans a full out charge at the villagers
Not really a city, but [Odorheiu Secuiesc] - with a population of 35k and [96% ethnic Hungarian population] it definitely fits the bill
I mean, if you'd show me some of the architecture there, I wouldn't recognize it as our own
[Sibiu] does not look Romanian at all, I would say it looks more Austrian/German than anything else
Typical Romanian city would be something like [Craiova] I guess, where you have a mix of Communist architecture and Interwar period monuments/buildings
Interesting choice
I would say of the big cities, Cluj feels the most 'foreign', in that it feels kind of Central European
Most towns are typical though, anywhere in Wallachia and Moldova especially
Put your finger on a map and you have it
Thanks, communist systematization
Quite most of the cities from Transylvania/Banat/Crișana are like Cluj, so for someone from there, it does not feel that foreign
That means half of the country, lol
I think it is hard in Romania to name the typical Romanian town because every region has a different typical town in terms of architecture and stuff like that
ClUg fOrEiGn, dar dacă te duci prin Mănăștur sau piața Mărăști, cumperi aceleași petarde și țigări pe care le cumperi în orice alt oraș.
Dar na, cineva trebuia să confirme mema
Yeah fair, valid point
I'm not from Transylvania as you can tell
I suppose cities in the south and east also have more communist architecture and apartment blocks as a percentange of the whole place, which makes them feel more samey
Like not just the residential neighborhoods, but also city halls, theatres, train stations and other notable public builds are like that
Whereas cities in Transylvania feel more different from each other, like they have more individuality
Pai normal, doar n-am zis ca chiar este in alta tara
Vorbeam de cum arata asa, la suprafata
> in the south and east also have more communist architecture and apartment blocks as a percentange of the whole place, which makes them feel more samey
Like not just
It is true, but at the same time, Iași is just a different thing compared with Constanța, Ploieișt for Bucharest for example
And for me, for someone from Timișoara, when I have been for the first time in Tulcea for example, I felt like in another country
But probably for someone from Constanța is not the same, he may feel like in another country when he comes in Turda
When I went to Turda it just feels like home, not another country
Romania is very diverse, we often do not realize that, just because over 90% of people living in Romania are Romanians lol
Romanian : easiest language on earth to spell , all letters have always same sound and we always say all letters in the world as clear as possible ( no rules like French or English or even Dutch ) .Only exception is C or G followed by I or E when instead of saying c like in *c*ar / g like in *g*orilla we say C like in *ch*ur*ch* / g like *g*ym
Vocabulary is easy for romance+ English speaker , somewhat common for Slavic and rather new for a pure Germanic ( pure Germanic aka Germanic but not English) and for the rest is probably as hard as for any other language
And then all hell breaks loose with grammar . We have all declinations of the verb ( like the French ) but we also have for noun . We don't add a generic prefixes/suffixes for the cases ( ***the*** house , Andy'***s***, car***s***, ***to*** Maria) we change the entire word and there are a lot of exceptions from the general rule(which is already very complicated considering genders, cases , number, etc
) . And in writing there is the short form (idk how to call it ) somewhat like the English it's vs its but we have way more words like this and probably more than half of the native speakers don't know how to use them properly .There is also a lot of freedom in the order of the words : the flower beautiful and the beautiful flower both make sense but the first is used to expess just the fact and the second form is used to emphasize the beauty of the flower .
&#x200B;
Basically Romanian is like French but the speaking vs writing is easier but grammar is harder .It's a easy language to average but very hard to master
The number of speakers is actually the main issue but i guess so it is for most of the languages
Our language is both latin and slav,so it will be easy to learn and speak,and the fact that everything is pronounced as it is written is just a bonus thing
We speak it and we
don't have the best reputation,so to speak
But it's *pickpockets your wallet* getting *pickpockets your phone* better
*doing a 100 pickpocket skyrim bs and stealing literally everything from you except your underwear*
Reason why Romanian should not be the next pan-European language:
-It's not taught in schools in foreign countries
-Its grammar is pretty hard compared to other languages
Reasons why it should be:
-Could be a bridge between the latin countries of Europe and the slavic ones
(but that's a long stretch)
You'd still have Hungarian people in Transylvania(/Erdély/Ardeal) who tenaciously preserve their language, therefore it won't become a dead langauge that fast
Part of me wants to learn Hungarian so I can know a couple of words that my Hungarian friends say
The other part of me only managed to learn "szia" from Duolingo before giving up because it was too hard
So we have grammatical genders and cases for nouns, and a ton of verbal tenses on top
And while the tenses themselves are similar to French/Spanish, the actual forms of the verbs are often irregular and kinda weird
Also, plurals of nouns are mostly irregular afaik
So hardest parts of Romance languages and German put together
But the best feature is of course that we have triple letters, such as in "copiii" = "the children". Can your language do that
Besides, in a sentence can have a word of Latin origin, one of Slavic origin, one of Turkish origin and one from some other language family right next to each other
For example:
>Veșnic mănânci ciorba încet
= You always eat soup slowly
Veșnic = always (slavic), mănânci = you eat (latin), ciorba = soup (Turkish), încet = slowly (???)
A friend of mine recently learned Romanian (he already knew French quite well and Spanish conversationally, so it was not very hard)
When he heard native people talk he said he couldn't understand because we use so many colloquial words, idioms, expressions and just filler stuff that it's nothing like "textbook" version of the language
> rational ... you end up with english and french
Oaia aia e a ei
Eu i-o iau
that is correct but i was thinking most of the languages have hardcore phonetic writing .German and Hungarian are good examples . Hard to read even if there are no rules to be followed but this might be an subjective opinion of mine
German has way more exceptions in pronounciation
Don't know about Hungarian
Well, there are pockets especially within Székely Land and near Oradea/Nagyvárad where they speak entirely Hungarian
Because Romania has a pretty nice attitude when it comes to minorities, in regions with a big minority population, that minority's language because another de facto official language
[Road signs] or [other official signs] contain both languages, the town hall and other official institutions are required to speak both Romanian and that other language
Even the state school system has a dedicated curriculum in Hungarian with special exams
Therefore, in regions with only Hungarians or very few Romanians, Romanian is almost not spoken at all
While there won't be as many speakers, the language will still be used enough to count it as still alive
While not equally comparable, you can view the situation the same as with Catalan in Spain
Lodz it's pronounced Wuch . No way  . Also you're language is impossible to read Grzegorz Brzeczyszczykiewicz . It should have been it's all polish to me , at least greek have some root words in every language
I've been born in hungarian minority region of Romania and so i was exposed to hungarian often enough and for many times i focused on trying to understand what people were saying but its totally helpless . Not even 1 word out of 100 .Maybe just loan words like goulash but no other
Gave our national treasure to the Russians when we entered ww1 so they'd protect it
All we got back was like 20kg of gold
Trusting Russia . Then trusting Germany . Then trusting Russia again
Then Trusting Germany again
Third time's the charm I guess
Voting for the heir of the communist party
Allowing the social democratic party, who is composed of former communist party members, exist
This predates the modern notion of "country", but I consider our biggest mistake to be our naïve friendliness; even when confronted with aggression and obvious malevolence we rarely took arms to defend ourselves
On the other hand perhaps this is also what allowed us to survive the millennia while other populations got assimilated
I can't believe we made such a stupid mistake
Almost all of the Eastern European countries have joined the chat

- **When exactly the language stopped being Latin and became Romanian
** The oldest text we have in Romanian is from the 1500s and is still easy to understand by a modern speaker
But before that
Almost no records and no information
- **Why Romania escaped the "slavification" of Eastern Europe
** There's a couple of theories, some of the main ones are:
\- We took refuge in the mountains and therefore escaped slavic assimilation (explains how geography might have played a role in this)
\- After/during the fall of the Byzantine empire, the latin people migrated north (explains why there's a strange absence of latin-speaking nations in the Balkans besides small isolated communities like Vlachs)
\- Instead of being assimilated, we were the ones who assimilated the Slavs coming here (explains why a few grammatical constructs like the vocative case in Romanian appear to be similar or inherited from Slavic languages)
For some reason, the Dacians (with a religion which was really lazily written, they just copied and pasted the Abrahamic faiths,) are hailed as the noble resistance to Roman invasion until the fall of the Dacian Empire to Emperor Traian under Decebalus
while, at the same time, we’re supposed to have national pride for being descended from the Romans, but still revere the Dacians
It’s a weird contradiction the writers really aught to make up their mind about
The ethnogenesis of the language and of the identity of Romanian as we now know is really vague
The Dark Ages left a big question mark on our history, and we know details about it only from about 1000 AD
To add to that, there's an immense gap of time, from the time when the romans left dacia to when the medieval romanian states formed, where we have very little knowledge of what happened
My theory is that the Carpathic Basin always worked as a roundabout for migratory populations, so they never stopped here but passed through, usually for the wealthier parts of the Byzantine Empire, which were way more attractive than a bunch of forests and some mountains
So basically no one can park in a roundabout, but everyone can pass
The Daco-Roman people, which were already settled, so "parked", managed to stood their ground pretty much because most of the guys that went through here didn't care so much about settling
Excepting of course, the Slavs, which influenced our history and culture quite a lot
Basically it's because this part of Europe was always seen as transitory, being the way that most of the people chose to reach other parts of the continent (aspect that can be observed even better in the rest of the history, when Romania was always between the Hungarians or the later A-H Empire, Ottomans and Russians
> The oldest text we have in Romanian is from the 1500s and is still easy to understand by a modern speaker
But before that
Almost no records and no information
Not a plot hole per se
Remember we were always surrounded enemies and it's plausible for them to have actively destroyed artifacts pertaining to our history (see the churches: Romanians in Transylvania weren't allowed to build stone churches precisely because they didn't degrade easily)
He called dibs
I meant in terms of language, not culture
Culturally we're obviously pretty similar to the neighboring countries
> During my studies this theory was the example used to illustrate made-up historical narratives in Eastern Europe, lol
I mean, it's a theory
Could certainly be wrong, but there's not a lot of information to really understand what happened
> During my studies this theory was the example used to illustrate made-up historical narratives
Interesting way to diss a theory
Almost everyone was illiterate back then, save the nobility and clergy, all across Europe
>At the end of the Middle Ages, the ability to write was restricted to less than 10% of men and hardly any women possessed it
The issue is that compared to Western Europe, the region was always in a state of war, with constant invasion and pillaging from all directions, particularly with the Golden Horde raiding from the North and the Ottoman Empire raiding from the South
Moldova and Wallachia had few geographical barriers to protect them, being basically open plains
This is why you'll see way more castles that survived the Middle Ages in WE compared to ours where [this sort of thing] is generally all that's left
With cities/towns being constantly burned to the ground, it's unlikely that many artifacts, scrolls or tablets survived from that period
But I'm optimistic and as archeology starts to pick up here with time, hopefully we find more clues
Oh yes, we know at least 50% of our history before the Dark Ages, more precisely before the 3rd century AD, but after the Romans evacuated Dacia, the place was overran by migratory populations which pretty much pillaged and ransacked the country so we literally have very few evidence of what happened here in the meantime, and even this few material evidence comes from more powerful or at least centralised neigbours
And that's why we also don't have a lot of old buildings, they were pretty much constantly destroyed during the history
So the answer is, yes, we know what happened before that and even, very generally speaking, during that 700-800 years timeframe, that was after the Roman Retreat, but we know very few specific details and we just have more questions
Dacian gold artifacts are [displayed] at the National Museum of History in Bucharest and I went to see them a few years ago
It's simply mind-boggling how much gold there is and that being only a tiny portion of what was found
You pretty much step into a huge room that's filled with thousands of golden artifacts from one end to the other, it's crazy
Go on, ask
lol, thought it was about what I said
I was doing a teaching internship and during an English class with a Spanish speaker we started talking about foreign languages and I said that the only thing I know in Spanish is "hombre de nieve"  and they were soo stoked about it
So I guess watching Handy Manny as a grown-up paid off
On a similar note i know the italian for "go get yourself fucked in the ass" but i wouldn't dare attempt to write it since i know it only phonetically
I like the one of [Rangers]
The Mandalorian theme fits for Bucharest,a wild place but civilised
Resilience and oportunism
We’ll give our politicians
and then leave the union
Muhahahah
I was waiting for that one Romanian to comment something about alcohol
I must say Slovenia is one of the most beautiful countries I ever came across
I travel from Italy to Romania by car and even though we never had the time to visit any cities, we're always mesmerized by how green and natural your country is
Good job at keeping the country green and full of trees
Kürtős kalács = ️
Bring some Apfel Strudel too
I'd prefer to not have stray animals tho
While the optimist and the pessimist argue if the glass is half full or half empty, the opportunist drinks the water
It's behind on its own
"And then it got worse
for others"*
It's just
uncomfortable and strange
I never got used to it
If the stray animals are tiny and cute, sure
If you're talking about huge dogs with big teeth too, then I'm moving to Canada

Actually, you, as a Portuguese speaker might find lots of similarities in Romanian
I am acquainted with someone from Portugal and she's understanding basic Romanian pretty easily
But unfortunately it doesn't work the other way around as smooth
I guess you can try our music
What, Romanian
We have some vocabulary in common, and both being latin descendant languages, we have somewhat similar verb structures, as in present past and future things, i don't know what they are called in English
But if you're talking about pronunciation, they are *completely* different
I've only visited the famous Palace of Parliament in Bucharest by means of the Modern Art Museum which is in one of the wings, and that only last summer
Still haven't taken the tour of the actual Parliament bit
I also lived in Cambridge (England) and I'm sure there are some museums or historic sites I haven't seen just because there are so many
I would say a Medical Degree
You will definitely have a job at the end of it, though it might not be paid well in some hospitals and you may be tempted to work in other European countries
Computer degrees are pretty much useless since you can learn pretty much anything online, and get a job at any level
None, only then you'll be prime minister or president because who needs education
The politicians here surely not
We eat soup or a sour soup with meat and vegetables almost everyday at lunch
Romania here - we have a food named “șorici” which is just pig skin, with salt
It may sound gross but it’s fucking delicious and it’s always made for Christmas in the rural zones
Yeah, turns other countries don’t really do that
Some people in Cyprus too
Wait, other Europeans don't do that
Same here
There is this very old joke which means 'take with bread' ('ia cu pâine') used in all kinds of things
I'm pretty sure we are one of the only nations that have this awesomeness called ciorbă. Russians have borsh but its different
Ciorbă is unique
Ciorbă is the best
Man, I'd love to go foraging in Berlin/Brandenburg, but couldn't find an active group to join and I've no idea where to start learning about edible mushrooms etc without getting a Darwin Award for the effort
:/ Do you happen to have any tips
Oh, the friends from other countries who I have said they never heard of anything even similar
Also it is not fried here, it’s raw
This was very helpful, thank you
I have to look that up as I don’t know what the term means, but I’ll edit once I do
EDIT: I guess it is kind of similar but not exactly, [here is a photo of some sorici, which I found out is called “salted pork rind” in english]
Ciorba is typically a sour soup and there are lots of variations: chicken, pork, beef, bean, potato, meatballs, tripe
We use [bran] or lemon juice to make it sour
It is indeed his actual name
His name is Alexandru Ciorbă, Sandu being an abbreviation
Actually if I think about it I've never heard a name being a kind of food before either
It's not common at all
Just a coincidence
Romania
That's it
Someone will always be bad in someone's perspective
I wholeheartedly agree
We had this very "delicate" form of extermination when the communists allowed only gypsy women to get abortions
Also encouraging doctors to give them abortions for "medical purposes".
Most people have no idea that we tried to "cleanse" ourselves
> arguably
We used to have "[Hungarian Autonomous Region] back in the 50s.
Yeah I heard some of them delude themselves with some nonsense about Romans or some such, but they spell it weird
> She would get angry if we kids borrowed them to cut anything else
Edit: also relevant
It wouldn’t

nothing would change in territory  but politically it would be chaos

We have these in Romania too
They are usually filled with plums and we call them Gomboți.
Didnt know that was the name in english
i mean yes it is a thing tho here we use plums and plum gem
Not many people buy em,  but I like them
Yup, we have the plum ones as well
Bread crumbs on top
That's interesting
My grandmother used to smash biscuits into really small crumbs and would put that on top
I'm reading the comments saying "11:45
Pffffffffff, that's when I *start* drinking
" and I feel so old
I go to bed around 11 pm
If I had 4 beers by midnight, I'm in bed snoring in the next second
I don't have the time, energy or liver capacity to party anymore
I know, right
They're probably just students or they're exaggerating to seem cool
Well
Either the Parliament building or the useless church taller than it across the road
I don't know which one of these is the most popular but for Romania, the House of Parliament and Bran Castle are some of the most popular buildings that a foreigner would think of
For me is the palce of the parliament (palatul parlamentului) wich is the second biggest used construction in the world
It's taller than the parliament and built for the old guys with golden hats :-)
Nah bro, big church for golden hat people
Thank you for pointing out we have monuments which are actually intetesting and historically significant
Which is
That's oddly
on point
Well done
I currently own a Carrera Hellcat, had a Carrera Virtuoso before but I had to sell it because of the super thin wheels which were not suitable for the surrounding roads
I also had a Carrera Crossfire 2 that was stolen  (I live in UK)

never did it
Im internally screaming at myself to not say that would make you Chinese

Do unifications count
Because before the small unification there was no single Romanian entity
About Romania: before 1860, there was Wallachia and Moldova, then, after the unification, we kept existing
Now you can say "free" and mean a sovereing state, so basically from 1860-today and i hope even more
Instead if you mean democratic by saying "free" only from 1989 to today
Maybe we could count the monarchy years too, from 1860-1946, when the iron guard established in Romania, and then well, the commies came in
But in an overall we've been around from 1860 to modern days
So yea, we are relatively young nation
I don't like this topic
Romania (fully united ex
Moldova):
98 BC-105
1599-1600
1877-Present
Moldavia and the Republic of Moldova are not the same though, you are just a piece of Moldavia that was stolen from us by the Soviets
Rome because of the "YOU LOOK LIKE AFRICA" scamers
I dont know why they can't get rid of them
Braşov
Everyone was praising it when I told them I will go there, but when I went I didn't find anything special
It's just like the other Transylvanian cities, just, bigger
Prague
I had pretty high expectations for it for some reason, but it just ended up as a rather dirty tourist trap
Also Brașov is very praised, but for me it’s just another city in Transylvania
Napoli, it would be a beautiful city if it was cleaner
I didn't have any expectations when I first came to Munich (had some business there, otherwise wouldn't have went), left with a dislike of the place
To be fair, I've never considered Dublin for vacation :/
I did consider the countryside in Ireland, but not Dublin
It was cold, it's usually bigger when it's warm outside
Surprised Bucharest let you down
Sorry neighbour
Cluj Napoca and Brasov are also worth visiting since they are really beautiful
It has that tiny mountain top in the middle of it, that's what catches people's eye
Well clearly you didnt visit it in the Winter
It's too bad because, otherwise, it's very very beautiful
Some footage of what happens
In reality it's much more annoying as they really don't give you a break and come after you
As a side note, I'm caucasian and lots of them kept yelling "hey man, you look like Africa" which is quite funny
Another "pick-up line" they used was "Hey man, nice shoes". I fell for that a few times, my shoes were really nice
Being John Malkovik, Rome edition
We were there late March this year
I am not a big fan of pasta, so I didn't try it
But I did eat bad lasagna
Yes, and after all that I really had a horrible moment near the train station
I was having a beer outside a small bar when all of a sudden lots of these "bracelet guys" gathered
After a few more moments their leader came and picked up lots of money, I think he counted thousands of euros
They got in a fight with the owner and started picking on tourists (hit an English guy's chair because he didn't give them a cigarette)
But still, very nice place to visit, but just go to the popular places, and don't even look at the bracelet guys
Kürtos kalacs is life
Romanians have status anxiety
It’s not about what they are worth as much as it’s about what they are _perceived_ to worth
As a result you won’t hear anyone asking for “the cheapest beer”, but they will ask it by name
Actually they will more likely ask for the second cheapest beer [by name]
If the beer offer is varied and the cheapest is too cheap compared to the others, they’ll toss in a joke like “the best beer”, “the good kind”, “a true beer”, “a true Romanian beverage”, “the others are crap”(*) etc
In practice though it’s fairly easy: most places (hotels and large restaurants aside) have balanced menus, so you won’t find cheap beer in expensive bars or expensive beers in cheap bars
LE: I realized I hadn’t answered the actual question: no one will say a thing, nor raise their eyebrows
But servers, bartenders favor rich patrons, so there you go
(*) By crap they usually mean additives
What they don’t know is most beer has additives
Huh
seems to be only a London problem
I never experienced something like that anywhere and I asked for it both in my country and as a tourist in Germany and the Netherlands
Everyone here is looking for the cheapest anything
So you'd fit right in
Are people really choosing beer based on alcohol content
I mean I get it when it comes to cocktails and liquor, but why beer too
Rome, Dacia, Ancient Greece and Egypt along with Ancient Mesopotamia are the ones I learned about in school
Not that many
Unless you're in a special profile in high school
I was told about some cultures around the south east of Europe and even those I don't really know
I don't know how it is today but from what I can remember history was very greek and roman centered in 5th grade
Then in 6th grade we were already in the middle ages
7th grade everything after the Renaissance all the way to the Victorian Era I think and after that, in 8th grade, only Romanian history
High school history, I can't actually remember much of it because we barely did it
I actually started learning history myself on the internet at that point
All this is just what happened in my schools, can't talk about the whole country
Now that I think about it there might have been something about ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, but if it happened, then we went quick through them
Yeah
What did the Romans ever do for us
The language and the name
yes yes
But other than the aqueduct, the language and the name, what else have the Romans done for us
Yes yes
The aqueduct, but what else
Like in **H**onduras, **H**ungary, **h**orse
It's different from A, which always sounds like the sound you make at the dentist (i.e. c**a**r in English)
"hî" it's one of the sounds cartoon characters make when throwing punches
ah yes, the beaten minecraft villager sound
The best equivalent that I can find is the "h" in "hashish"
Ai dreptate frate
I can't think of any
I would like to visit all
It might take a lot of time to visit some like Scandinavian countries because of how expensive it is to explore the places
But I definitely want to go there
Belarus and Turkey, this is due because of their dictatorships and authoritarianism which scare me and i wouldnt feel safe but i would go to every other country
I would like to visit them all, if i only had the money
My mother says Slovakia
She was there before, and she hated it
Out of the official countries, there isn't any I wouldn't visit
I love all my European brothers and sisters, and I consider myself extremely lucky to have been born in a time and place as flourishing and progressive as 21st century Europe
I have some bad opinions about Russia, because of the instability they created and the agressive foreign policy that they are pursuing
In addition, they are challenging the boundries of democracy, and I don't like that either
So not sure if I'd visit Russia
Apart from that, I wouldn't visit Transnistria, unless I do so with a rifle in my hands and a helmet on my head
I wouldn't go to the Donbass Republics either, because why would I?
Edit: Oh Turkey too, not for any other reason apart from pretty much the same things I said about Russia
So it has to do with the current leadership and government
don't consider them Europeans though so not sure if they even count, just trowing my 2 cents in there
Nah
It would probably get difficult in the future with UK, but I would still visit if I had time & money
UK, Russia, Turkey, and Bielorusia
I have already been to Hungary and my guide was genuinely frightened for me calling its Prime Minister "Orban" instead of "Mister Orban".
I don't want to sponsor other dictators
Update 1: I forgot about Poland
The far right protests from a few years ago frightened me
Update 2: as many point out, UK is not technically a dictatorship
But with Brexit and the general hatred of immigrants, it is as appealing to me as Russia
You'd be fine in capitals and big cities of eastern european countries, it's mostly old people from small towns that are racist/homophobic
Yeah, we can't really see in the future
Well, getting a visa it's more difficult than just showing my ID at the customs, but I've never been outside EU so far so I don't know for sure how it is
I just expect it would be more difficult because paperwork is usually so bad to do here
Public display of affection
La mama dracului - At the devil's mother
Yeah, here the place we mention us Honolulu
Romanian
“In pulă cu satelitu’”  which word by word means in the dick with the satellite
In romanian we say this in many ways, but the most common is ,,La dracu-n praznic'' which roughly translates as ,,At the devil's burial table''
We say Patagonia
Or "the devil's corn field". Very similar :P
We use Honolulu, or at least used it :) i was in Honolulu when i once asked for direction to the toilet in a mall
It was pretty far and i said to my self “where did she send me
Honolulu
” Then realized i was actually in Honolulu
Then of course there is also “in pula cu satelitu’”
We say somewhere in "cuca macaii" wich is an imaginary place or "la naiba in prasnic" wich means somewhere near Satan
We use as well *Cuca Măcăii* means "a remote village or place, very difficult to reach" and I've personally heard/used Honolulu too
For time we use "La Pastele Cailor" - "The Easter of the horses"  which is a real holiday (but not so important or celebrated) 40 days apart from the Orthodox Easter
So it usually refers to "someday" or "never".
În Puleni = (approximately) in Dicksville
And also "Plaestina" or Palestine
We also say la mama naibii, which means the same thing
I've heard this one but i don't believe it's used too often
Either way, when I was a kid, I taught it was a made up name, not the capital of Hawaii
There is also Pulahara and Pulalela
Im so gonna use that one from now on
I was at the British history museum and I think this guy was Canadian
He looked at this mask from Africa and simply said "bruh"
Yes, we have a jandarmerie (we stole the word from you guys :D), it's the special police, but it operates in the same area as the normal police, but it responds to "tougher situations". I don't know how those tougher situations are determined tho
One that got my attention was the verb “a dezmierda” which means something along the lines of taking care of someone, fulfilling all of their wishes, excessively looking out for that person
Most often this applies in the context of parents and kids and the result would be a brat that always wants to get things done their way
The etymology of the word comes from Latin: des + merda (meaning shit), basically the act of cleaning poop
It’s associated with the mother cleaning her baby in old times and that’s how the current meaning came to be
Le mai spunem de șmecheri si bombardieri

Well, we do have some of the history cut out, but essential we learn about the Daco-Roman precursors until the emperor Aurelian retreated the roman army from the Dacian region 271-274, after that we have well pretty much the void millenium, until about the year 1100 when we have the next documented history of our country and the medieval history starts all the way to the time of the 3 regions of Moldova, Transilvanya and wallachia then we study a bit of rennasiance, and then the napolean era/ the industrial revolution and then contine on to the 18-19  century and then the modern history
Here, in middle school we learn 3 years world history and 1 year Romanian history
Then in highschool is the same, another 3 years world history with 1 year Romanian, this time more in depth
Our way of learning history in schools is kinda shitty, at least in my opinion
We go over the basics in 4th grade, then do universal history from 5th to 7th grade, only to do the history of Romania in 8th grade
And the fact that educational systems change very frequently isn't too helpful either
In the 7th and 8th grade we do the simplified history of the world
We then go in depth in the 9th and 10th grade
History of Europe in 11th grade and history of Romania in 12th grade
In the first year we talk about general romanian History from the 1200s to the WW1
In our second year we talk about antiquity
In our 3rd year we talk about the Medieval times for all of Europe
In our 4th year we talk about the 20th century extensively
In our 5th and final year of ‘simple’ history we talk  about Romanian history but in greater detail
Unfortunately, life isn't EU4
Iam not totally sure, but I think is between 18-21 yo
In Romania high school graduates are usually 18-20
Catalonian Independence be like: WE ARE INDEPENDENT

Târgoviște, the name comes from the word târg which means market place, it's actually of slavic origin
It's unknown where exactly Bucharest or Bucureşti came from
The most common hypothesis is the name of a shephard named Bucur that founded the city but it is unconfirmed and it's more of a legend
What's interesting is that the name has the word for "happy" which is "bucurie"
"Târgoviște" , Romania
"Târg" is an old word for "Market Town" , and so that's where it comes from
It used to be the Capital of Wallachia, but Vlad the Impaler moved it down to București so he would have his supply lines shorter when fighting the Turks
There were some merchants who wanted to build a church in a market with no name,and they wanted to name the Market MITROPOLIA,Something to remind of the church,but then the guy who ruled over the country financed the building of the church,so the merchants decided to call the market that later became a city, ALEXANDRIA ,after the name of the ruler,to pay respect
The verb is "toarce" . It means "to spin wool" . It apparently makes a somewhat similar noise
The noise is "prrrrrrrrrrr" or just "rrrrrrrrrrr" .
In Romanian we say "miau" when reffering to the sound they make
It's very similar to the English "meow".
Mârrr in Romanian
Intrebarea se referea cum suna cand toarce pisica
Lol, you looking where to go
Babeș-Bolyai
I don't really know why just everyone says is the best and majority of students go there
Da chiar, care sunt
the coolest and weirdest thing about metu is that it has a forest
i never knew a campus could be so big
The closest thing to that is a story from Păcala (a peasant who is the protagonist of numerous stories) who fools some men to drown themselves
(For Romanians, "Razbunarea lui Pacala", vine dupa "Pacala nu vrea sa fie primar in sat")
Even to Romania
Do you also buy cars from Germany that were 'driven only by an old lady'?
Our fantasy old ladies used the car to go to the market, not church, but very close
Some of the cars are also "company cars, driven by professional and very careful drivers".
Yes it's possible that some people will switch to try and speak something more like literary Romanian (based on the Wallachian dialect) if the context requires it (i.e. a very formal setting like an exam, or speaking to someone who struggles to understand their accent, when you're in a different region)
I've never heard anyone ask for it though, like other people have said
People just "feel" when they need to switch
However, it's hard to get rid of an accent, and depending on how strong it is it may still show through but they may be avoiding regional words
An interesting feature i've noticed when people try too hard to hide their accent, they kind of overshoot and their "literary" speaking sounds kind of robotic and overly soft
In Romania we don't really have dialects, just accents (i.e. the words used are pretty much the same and are pronounced similarly, but there are certain words, some of them quite common, in which the accent is different)
That being said, people understand each other easily
I don't think I've ever heard of anyone asking a person with a strong accent to cool it down
More likely the person with the accent will be stopped once or twice and asked to repeat something, and they'll then try to avoid that in the future by changing it
But a lot of people from Moldova for example (the region in Romania, not the country, but it can apply to them too) try to fade out their accent when they come to Bucharest
I knew one guy from Piatra Neamț, who had this news presenter accent when talking to me, but the sweetest moldovan accent when talking to his relatives
I doubt anyone told him to change his accent, but maybe he thought it was a disadvantage when talking to clients

I am a confused Romanian
Me too, too bad they don’t let us into Schengen already
Romania's economy and minimum salary would suffer immensely if we did the change, so maybe we won't, for now, until things get more stable with the corruption and everything
Same here brother
Romania had fulfilled the technical requirements for some time, but fulfilling the "political requirements" is very tricky when it's very convenient for western EU gov'ts to score political points by acting tough on the Schengen issue
In romania it's yellow for plastics, red or green for organic and blue for paper
Now I kinda see a flag pattern in it
One popular dumpling that I know is a [plum dumpling] They're actually made from potato dough and does not include any kind of flour dough
They are very delicious and easy to make and I highly recommend them
Money counting, there is even a game about that on App Store
In Romania when it's warm outside old men will sit in parks all day and play backgammon
Some games even attract spectators
The more "intellectual" ones will play chess
There are even tables with a chess board built-in in parks, [like so]
Edit: [here they are in the wild]
I would have thought they would allow for a 10 minute buffer in case of a queue
Alas, it would seem to not be the case
I don't see a point in the limit, unless the express purpose is to annoy people
the netherlands because of the general feeling, and for some reason hungary(although im only talking about budapest because thats thre only city i visited, but from pictures the others seem nice as well)
that is so cool oh my god what did you visit
You went to some interesting places, some of whjch i havent seen myself
I'm a bucharest local so here's some advice for being here:
Stay near the center if you can help it, or at least in sector 1 or 4
Those are the safer parts of the city
Avoid Piata Obor, that whole area is a bit of a mess
For the love of god, look for the Ferentari neighbourhood and avoid it like the plague
If you want some *scarily authentic* portuguese food there's a city in near Tei called Dancing Lobster, on the expensive side but it's the best food i have ever had, in the country or abroad
In most cities restaurants are a safe bet, I can't name 1 restaurant i have been to that was horrible, especially since better restaurants are next to tourist areas
since only the good ones tend to be near tourist attractions
Man hiking here is amazing(ly cheap too) if you're into that
There's a website and app called Munții Noștri (literally our mountains) that has all the trails in almost all of the hiking areas, makes it super easy to plan out your hike
You'll also meet crazy locals out hiking for sure
Had a guy tell me that this crucifix on a cliff we were walking to is the actual place Jesus was crucified and that Romania is actually the holy land but the Freemasons are hiding it from us
So not all good crazy
Can't wait for summer
Nothing like looking at a 1km tall cliff at sunset and saying to yourself "yeah we had lunch up there".
I would love an EU
Shows my continental pride
I know the reference
The Romanian one says for the glory of unification, and it also uses slava which is more of an archaic word
Pentru gloria uniunii is a better way to say it
Romania mare intensifies
Waiting for germans to show up
Liviu dragnea, Viorica dancila
liviu dragnea is in jail now thank god
this is the type of politicians we have, thieves mostly :(
Viorica Dăncilă and Liviu Dragnea but he's in prison
Liviu Dragnea was a corrupt politician
He is currently serving his 3 and a half years sentence in prison
Viorica Dancila, fellow Romanians know why
I think on our part we agree on Dragnea
Is he the worst politician we've ever had though
People lived worse during Ceaușescu's period
I mean, we fucking killed the guy just to overthrow communism
Add on that list Ceausescu and Iliescu
Nixon got a lot of bad rap for obvious reasons but he lived for like 20 more years after that and did a lot of things that rehabilitated his image to a certain degree
I know someone else who won't be doing that
yeah but I wasn't born in Ceaușescu s period
so I share my experience not something I've been told
Iliescu almost died a few weeks ago and people were already opening champagne and celebrating the night before the news of his stable condition surfaced
Am not really into politics so this event took me by surprise
We aren't that lucky friend
He survived . I am starting to think he is a vampire
I remember a variant with a well
Instead of 3 objects you had 6, but I can't remember which those other two were and I've played it just a couple of times as a small kid
We normaly have the usual rock, paper, scissors (piatra, hartie, foarfece), but I remember that in primary school we used a few more like : gun, well and fishing net
I have no idea how popular this version is, it might've been just a thing my school did for all I know
Yes I remember the fishing net too
And we also used to say ”cio-că-ne-le-le” while counting/swinging fists
In my experience the mono-chain-industries were so powerful in some places that it trumped a highly developed need for young students to learn other fields
For example parts of Spain were hit so hard 11 years ago when the global crisis arose because a lot of the population worked in construction-chain which once collapsed left a lot of young people without any training/knowledge to do anything else
Worse of it went from a deep need for employees to employees fighting for a spot anywhere (something that, again, young ones were not used or taught to do)
On average, urban environment, money spent on food, 215€ per household member, as reported by our national statistics institute
Somewhat on par with my experience, about 400-500€ for 2 people
(Romania)
maybe 100 euros per person
I personally spend \~200€ per month on food alone
This includes lunch at a restaurant (sometimes) or at the mall food court almost daily plus groceries
But I have an income higher than the average in Romania
I only get this low if I cook a lot myself and bring foot at work, but most of the time I am between 220€ and 270€.
One bottle of vodka and you're all set
It is, I've been surprised to find roughly the same prices abroad (Italy, Greece, etc) when going shopping
I guess the only thing that's different is the income
Bernie Sanders on Twitter in 2016: "Today, people living in Bucharest, Romania have access to much faster Internet than most of the US
That’s unacceptable and must change
" I just saved a bit of Trump's reputation on this post lol
Hello Budapest or something like that :)))) maybe "it's nice to be here in Budapest"
Russian Vice PM said we're a country of snakes after we refused to let him fly over Romania
This is such a weird one
What is Turkey's problem with Czechia

Let's just pray that these 3 morons (Putin included) won't get us into a new WW
I'm tired of fighting with the hate that they are spreading everywhere :(
If they permanently live there, work there and pay their taxes there, they should be able to vote there
This also means they aren't able to vote in their home country anymore
I say they should be allowed to vote if they are residents and more importantly if they pay taxes in said country
Some older people say it was better back then
Everyone had a job, they had money to buy food, they were never starving, education was taken much more seriously
Everyone had shitty jobs, yes
They had money to buy food, only if food was available
They had ratios of certain amount for each basic produce, which was not enough
My mother used to tell me how she spent hours in line to buy milk for us, because milk was only available that day
They were never starving, but they ate industrially produced food of such bad quality (at least in the city, farmers were eating much better)
They never mention the power cuts and the lack of information, the restriction of movement, the lack of diversity in stores and the technology being decades behind other countries
I will agree with the education part though
Even when I was in school in the 90s and 00s you could see the old teachers were not giving a damn anymore, and the younger ones were sometimes ridiculed by students
I feel like that has gotten worse and worse over the years
In my experience, people who only graduated highscool pre 1989 and never went to university, are a bit more intelligent than university graduates from the 00s on
Back then it meant something to be a university graduate
Nowadays you can find idiots who finished 2 or 3
Oranges were so much of a luxury that children could only eat them once per year: as a Christmas gift
this question was asked 3 weeks ago already wtf
I'm stunned because there are so many people that think the communist era was so much better
"Everybody had a job and everybody had a house and food and money". A simple look on the [Wikipedia page] about the communist Romania would reveal just how bad was for some people, and what were the plans of Ceausescu for the future
There are still many politicians that come from that era and they hurt this country, but there are so many idiots that still praise the communism and those stupid politicians
Most of the people that praise communism are doing pretty good
In my opinion it's easier to say it was better back then if you get anxiety from having to make your own decisions today
Back then the party would give away houses and land, but no one questioned where they came from
No one had to make a decision about where to apply for work, because the party would give them work
No one had to really think about what to cook cuz there was barely any food
People that say it was better back think it was better because they didn't have to plan their own life, it was planned for them
They aren't aware of what possibilities they missed
Democracy for them it's like the Netflix issue of too many choices
My dad liked it there
He always had food and everything he needed but that was just because his dad was a military commander
My mum however hated it because she never had enough food and had to put in hard work everyday and her dad was a military engineer
My mum and dad both met from their dad's work so all went well
If you want a good picture of 80s Romania under Ceaușescu, there's a movie called Hawaii (2017) by Jesus del Cerro
Quit lying to yourself
The communists committed so many atrocities in Serbia
There are so many memorials and concentration camps left from back then and you say it was better back then
Yuck
I completely understand
By your flair, I'm only happy that you fucked off from here
Wow, looks great
I didn't even hear about it
Thanks
Oooooor, and hear me out on this one, because they were members of the party and actually had a good time
Or somehow involved with the party
I don't even bother
Nobody from that group of people is willing to have an actual argument, based on actual facts
I was mentioning Wikipedia because it's as easy as that to see how it was back then, especially for people who were born after '85
I'm talking about romanian communism
And I'm pretty sure I don't need to cherry pick anything in order to support my opinion
If wikipedia is too mainstream and "malleable", then I'll use Richard Wurmbrand's "In God's Underground" just to highlight the same things
Also, communism sucks wherever it comes from
The only way it works is when it's combined with capitalism
Cheers
Grenade throwing sounds fun
I visit every year:)
However, according to my grandparents, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej was much different from Ceaușescu, and that life was better under Dej
What do you make of this
Romania is great when you visit it
I have a cousin in Spain that visits every year, and he doesn't see any problem with the country
I reminded him that he doesn't have any other bussiness with our country, apart from staying at home and drinking a beer
Yes, but back then you were the shit
People were afraid of you because you might get them in trouble with the security
Now they are just some old people that brag about this country and kids taking "their places" in the tram
He was a full on Stalinist who had no qualms about sending people to die from hard labor
The think about Dej is that he got the USSR army out and his economic policy made some sense(soviet sense mind you)
He was also a true believer in the socialist cause if that matters to you
(I personally don't care)
I don't do anything else apart from stay with family but that's still fun so guess you're right
Oh, now that I think about it, my grandparents position on Dej make sense
My grandfather served in the military under Dej, and became a middle-high ranking officer in the military
Nope, my grandparents are just really old
Yeah, could be true
And they were also kicked out of their house in 79 By Ceausescu and were moved into a Ploiesti flat
“imi bag picioarele” is a fairly common phrase
it literally means “i put my feet in” and is used to express frustration .
“s-a ales praful” is used when something like a plan doesn’t go the way you intended and is usually followed up by mentioning the said plan, or thing
it literally means “the dust was chosen”
Cu pula-n cur si sufletul in rai = with a dick in the ass, and the soul in heaven
Basically means that a person has contradictory feelings about a topic
Un şut in cur, un pas inainte = a kick in the ass, one step forward
This is mostly an encouragement for when things aren't going your way
You get hit, but now you're wiser kind of thing
A da la rațe = to give (don't know what) to the ducks
To puke
A da cu mucii in fasole = to drop your boogers in the beans
To make a mistake
"Unde fug câinii cu covrigi în coadă"
Where dogs run with bagels in their tail - a place that doesn't exist but it would be perfect, where there's enough food for everyone, everybody is happy etc
I just like to imagine dogs caring bagels around on their tails
**Took a spike**
*A luat țeapă*  — Got scammed / betrayed
^(This one is probably inspired by) [^(Vlad Țepeș)]
**Made a whip out of shit**
*A făcut din căcat bici* — Did a good job with few(or non-existing) resources
**Has a carrot up his/her ass**
*Are morcovul în cur* — To be afraid (in a situation)
**Like a deaf man hits a church bell**
*Ca surdu-n clopot* — Usually sexually,  thrusting / hitting very hard
**Rubbing a wooden leg**
*Frecție la picior de lemn* — Futile effort
These are the first I thought of, but there are much more in Romanian:
"I-a sărit muştarul/şi-a ieşit din sărite/e scos din pepeni"=one got mad
"trage mâța de coadă/toacă frunză la câini"=one is lazy and doesn't do anything productive
"dă la boboci"=one throws up
"se uită ca mâța în calendar/"se uită ca vițelul la poarta nouă"=one looks at something they don't understand
"când vor zbura porcii/la Paştele cailor"=it will never happen
"nu are toate țiglele pe casă/e dus cu pluta"=one is crazy
(a ajuns) "la spartul târgului"=(one arrived) very late
"a pus burta pe carte"=one started to study
"e tobă de carte"=one is very intelligent
There are also a lot of popular sayings, for example:
"scumpul mai mult păgubeşte, leneşul mai mult aleargă", lit
"the selfish spends more, the lazy runs more", it means that you make more effort trying *not to do* something than you would if you *did* it
I don't know how common this is, my family says it all the time tho
"Țâță de mâță" to say that something is great/perfect
It literally translates to "cat tiddie".
> Dzielić skórę na niedźwiedziu
> To divide the skin on a bear - to prematurely divide, think of spending profits, which you cannot know you're going to make
In Romania we have "A vinde blana ursului din pădure" (To sell the fur of the bear from the woods) whitch means the same thing
another one bites the dust
I haven t ever heard the first one
Honestly, WHAT THE FUCK
Pretty much, yeah
None of my neighbors are an option here (except Moldova but that’s another story), I think the easiest to understand would be Italian and Spanish and I know some French so I think would be fine with that too
Romanians are everywhere, so I may not even have to resort to an *intermediary language*.
Only to Moldova
Although I met some people in Prague that could speak Romanian
But I quickly realized they learned a bunch of phrases just to lure customers in their shop
I could easily get by in Italy, France, Hungary, Moldova
One of the benefits of speaking multiple languages
I was going to say about the same thing, I'd be fine with Italy Spain and maybe Portugal but French would be a challenge
Though I feel like Romanian is a bit hard to be understood by others
Well, me and some friends were trying to get to Vienna from east Germany by car and we took a wrong turn at some point and ended up in Czechia
We were in some rural part around 11 pm, we had no idea where we were exactly (Google maps for some reason was stupid), we saw some sings in Czech and then nothing
In one village the police stopped us and they started talking in German to my friend
Friend: oh, great, are we in Austria now
Police officer: no, this Germany
Apparently, we've been driving back to Germany for some time
Why didn’t you just, you know, used the GPS
The guy driving used Google maps, but the "destination" kept changing for whatever reason, without us doing anything

most of our jokes are about Hungary
they hate it
A Romanian, a Brit and an American jump in the devil's garden
The devil catches them and as punishment makes them put up their ass whatever they stole
And to do it in front of him for his enjoyment
First comes the Brit with a couple of cherries
The Brit cries in humiliation and pain
The devil is pleased
Then comes the Romanian with a couple of plums
He cries but also laughs
The devil is confused
"why are you also laughing
", asks the devil
"this must hurt you, right
The Romanian says "it hurts and it's humiliating, but I can't stop laughing when I think what the American is gonna do with the watermelon".
Hungary, even though I'm hungarian as well
We don't make jokes about other countries, we are the real joke and that is sad
Hungary :))))
We also joke about scots being cheap
And on a smaller scale Bulgarians
Which I'm certain have their own jokes about us
Not to be racist or anything
What do hungarians want
Autonomy
etc etc
Our jokes aren't for you
They are for the Hungarians in Romania
Neah
We joke
They take it seriously :))) we joke again
Next thing you know they fight and we are like: *duuude
wtf
We were just kidding
25C - it's sunny outside and my apartment is facing South so during the day it gets quite warm
I like around 23
5 since I can stay in shorts and a t-shirt
18 degrees but i prefer 22-25
This is because lots of parts of Romania still dont have gas supply(or sewage or water)
I'm not even in bumfuck middle of the mountains, i'm 40km from the center of Bucharest, the capital
And we have a "soba"(a sort of enclosed fireplace) in each room so i have to make a fire, which can go wrong a couple ways, conpletely my fault though
I either forget about it and it goes out, or the damn thing is so sensitive, 1-2 wood logs too many and you get 28-30 degrees instead of 25
4°C, I'm in the room with the biggest radiator and I know the temperature on point because my bearded dragon is also in this room
His "cool end" of the terrarium is 23
4, so room temperature that I would say it's just fine for us
His "warm side" is 40, 43 on the basking spot, so that's a bit too much for me but it makes him happy
That's awesome
Oh no, these soba are big, the size of a fridge made of brick or other ceramics and they are fixed in place because they have "chimneys". It's basically a fireplace thats not in a wall, usually in the corner of a room though with an airgap between it and a wall, and enclosed on all sides
They have a small and a big opening usually covered by metal doors
The big opening is for putting wood inside and the small one is for air, which you close after a while so that the fire doesnt burn out too fast, the wasted heat would just go out the chimney
After that they retain heat for a such a long time i usually only make a fire once every two days
[This] is a good example of what most soba look like
You'd usually have one per room, but it depends on means, you'd even find houses with only one
There's even ones with an horizontal metal plate that you can use to cook on
Damn, let me blow your mind a bit more then
These things used to be used for cooking as well, with a sort of ingenious system I would say
[Here's a large picture] of one similar to my grandma's house back in the day, but this one apparently is movable
The classic ones were built in
The different elements are:
- on the front, the 2 brown doors are for putting wood into the fire (top) and optionally, ventilation (bottom) to speed up the fire
- the hot plate has several round places to cook food on, controlling the heat/fire intensity by taking out the round elements and creating a larger hole beneath the pan (direct contact with the fire)
- the grey lateral door is basically an oven, for making [this kind of regional pastry especially]
Idk about the user above, but my grandma used to put like 2 larger pieces of wood in right before bed, and during the winter had to put more in around 4-5 AM
And this was in a really small room
Usually from our side when it's close to the election time one or two candidates will talk about this as there is a small percentage of people that really want this, our former president even offered some advantages for students from Moldova
But there is no real effort and my guess is there will never be
Moldova also has the Transitria issue and it seems that they keep electing presidents closer to Russia, not to EU
It’s more like a citizens initiative, most Romanians want to unite with Moldova but that is not a political topic, no politician discusses about that and, well, we have bigger problems now, like the fight anti-corruption and trying to collapse the corrupt political parties
Maybe after the elections in 2019 and 2020 there will be more time to talk about it
As for Moldova, there are people that opposes any union (mostly Russian) and there is the problem with Transnistria (what a pain in the ass)
I'm not really up to date with political developments or have any ties to that part of the country, but my general feeling (as a Romanian) is that it's not something that will happen
People don't really discuss it day to day, and I'm not aware of any politician taking a stance on the topic
Also, I'm  pretty sure Russia would have something to say about it
Well not really, there were efforts some years back but now it's just a SF idea in some people heads
A territorial unification is pretty pointless in my opinion given how many difficulties it presents
What would be beneficial is to streamline the citizenship acquisition process for moldavian citizens (possibly other romanians living near the border as well) . I know it is easier compared to other immigrants but it's still a bureaucratic nightmare
This would be like a symbolic invitation for the romanian people outside of the EU to join Romania
We are suffering from rapid population decline and if anything the people from moldavia (both inside and outside of Ro) I have interacted and worked with have an unbelievable grit and work ethic
We could use more of this kind of people
As a Romanian, I don't really care about this topic
BUT
Judging by the fact that the economical situation in Moldova is even worse than in Romania and the fact that their politics align more with the Russian side than with the EU, I would vote against the unification, if it will ever be the case
Moldavians, like other foreigners, are welcome to move to Romania
But unifying governments and parliament and absorb their economy
No thanks
Why did no one mentioned the stuff from last year
Last year we celebrated 100 years from the formation of Great Romania and the subject of reunification got a bit of traction in the media
There was even a declaration of union signed by the officials of many Moldavian villages/cities (including the birthplace of the actual pro-Russia, anti-union, Moldavian president) and there was a friendly response from our parliament, but there was no talk about technical matters or about actually holding a referendum for unification
The biggest effort is done by all those poor football fanatic with nationalistic views, who have painted the same message all over the country: Basarabia, pământ românesc
[Example] one that can be routinely seen on the side of the road
It has had as much success as their similar attempts to convince people to go out and vote Yes in the [2018 referendum] which can still be seen sprayed on walls all over Bucharest
Wait for the elections, you'll see at least some mention there
There have been some discussions about the unification in the past, especially around elections and such, but now Romania is far too busy with the fight against corruption to think about it
For now it is also impossible
Moldavia's president is pro Russia
Also, we need to put our economy back on it's feet and having Moldavia on our backs will be a drag, as they are doing worse than us
There will be more disadvantages than advantages for Romania if the unification takes place in the near future
Nope
Romania
The country always had this name since 1866 even if the teritory suffered modifications
We call it Moldova in romanian (both of them), but for the country we may call it Republica Moldova (The Moldovian republic) or Bassarabia (i think it comes from russian)
It's an English thing
In Romanian you have "Moldova" and "Republica Moldova". The former being, usually, the North-East of Romania, part of the former Principality
I'm from the historical region of Moldova and we still consider ourselves Moldovans (regional identity) and we refer to the citizens of the Republic of Moldova as "basarabeni" (people from the region of Bessarabia) to avoid confusion
It’s an English thing
They are both called Moldova, you can refer to Moldovians as: our brothers on the other side of the Prut (the river that separates Romania from Moldova)
There are very few differences in vocabulary and accent, almost negligible
The main thing that differentiates the two is the geography: Moldova is a region in Romania, Moldavia is a separate country
Oradea - It's the safest city in all of Romania
It's very rare you see a crime or something bad happening here
People here are very nice so, yeah
I live in a small place, like 2000 people or something
I am more scared of stray dogs than someone wanting to rob me
I live in Iasi
As long as you avoid *that* neighborhood(which every city in the world has,don't try to deny it) it's extremely safe
This goes for most cities in Romania,especially since the municipalities now have the stray dog population under control(it used to be a BIG problem in most cities)
Timișoara, Romania
I would say it's pretty safe
I don't think I ever heard of someone getting robbed at night
That said, if there aren't a lot of people around and the lighting is bad I start feeling uncomfortable
There are areas that I would comfortably walk through all night (ex: the city centre) and areas where I would turn back asap (ex: Botanic Park, where all the druggies and alcoholics spend their time and areas that look sketchy in general)
Bucharest
I would try to avoid poorly lighted alleyways (for precautionary reasons) but I definitely have no qualms about walking on the main streets and boulevards at night
I used to live in Bucharest for 20 years
I was never scared to walk around the city at night, although I never entered the really bad neighbourhoods at that time
In the city center and where I lived I was never robbed or assaulted
Târgu Mureș & Timișoara in Romania
You can walk anywhere, any time you'd like and nothing will ever happen to you
And I think this applies to all cities in Romania
Not sure about Craiova and some neighborhoods ( mostly Ferentari) from Bucharest, never had the chance
As a dude Bucharest most of the central part at night is ok, usually metro stops areas are quite safe as they are in densely populated area so they might seem unsafe but I never had a problem
Safety has increased considerably with time in Bucharest
Talking strictly as a dude up until 12 o'clock at night
Buzău is super fine at night
Except for one neighborhood
But even in that neighborhood it's not so bad
The only people I've seen on the streets at night were teenagers
And, yeah, they range from annoying to sort of aggressive, but if you literally don't pay attention to them they'll get bored and move on
Bucharest on the other hand, it has a lot more neighborhoods you would want to avoid, but even so it's pretty safe
Iași, Romania
Not dangerous per se, but you can run into annoying people (drunks, ghetto bois etc
I never had any problems in 7 years living here
Pretty much the same thing applies to Bucharest too
The only one I can really think of is the [Bucium] which is a very long horn made out of pinewood and a few other types of wood that was also used to alert soldiers during military conflicts
Nowadays it's only used by Shepherds
[Digi fonf] on a serious note, probably not or at least not that i know of
But this guy is a meme in Romania
Probably the pan flute
If you've ever watched Kill Bill, then you definitely know [this] song
The instrument heard there is the pan flute
The song is composed by the lates James Last and interpreted by Gheorghe Zamfir
I looked it up and Wikipedia says it was invented in Berlin but also mentions that it was first patented in Vienna by someone else almost a decade later
Târgoviște
That one time the Turks came and beat the hell out of us but we still fought harder than anyone expected
Also we killed our Communist dictator here in 1989
That's about it
It's a small city
The first thing that comes to mind is the Treaty of Bucharest, signed in 1913 after the conclusion of the Second Balkan War
Cluj Napoca is known for being founded by the romans, then after hundreds of years being in kingdom of Hungary and now part of România
I can't really a special event in time
Stephen III (the Great) won a great battle here against the Ottomans in 1475
I'd have said the 1918 battle of Helsinki but I guess it was a pretty small battle
About Bucharest there's a lot of more important things that happened
From the top of my head I can think of:
-The 1916 battle of Bucharest
-The 1944 coup
-Bucharest was the center of the 1989 revolution
I mean the 1913 Treaty basically only gave us Southern Dobrogea, which is mostly Bulgarian either way
Fun fact: The Winged hussars didn't do all that much
The "Charge of the winged hussars" was done at the end of the battle
It was the final routing of the Ottoman forces
And even then most of the horsemen were not the heavy Winged Hussars, but light German and Polish cavarly
It was the mostly German and Austrian Holy League infantry who won the battle, alongside the defenders of the city who held out for longer than the Turks expected
I read the style of fighting was more like what we see in WW1, with trench raids, dispersed infantry charges with no volley lines, extensive use of grenades and plenty of close quorters combat
I...Don't know if that actually happened
I know the battle of Târgoviste was in 1476
That night attack in which Dracula almost routed the ottomans but his officer who was supposed to attack alondside him in the 2 prone attack never showed up
It's unknown if he got bribed by the ottomans, got cold feet or was just so bad at leading the attack that he got halted by the ottoman patrols before he reached the base
Never heard anything about him burning the city though
I wasn't really thinking about what we got out of it, but rather that the city was chosen for the negotiations
Agreed with the 1916 battle, but the other two events were bound to happen in Bucharest, what with it being the capital
Moreover, you could argue that Timișoara was the heart of the Revolution because that's where it all started but since Ceaușescu's "HQ" was in Bucharest, the latter ended up being the epicentre
Lmao yeah I know about that anime
I just wanted to make sure you know that didn't actually happen
I mean you probably already knew it isn't supposed to be in any way a representation of history but still
And also that Târgoviște looked NOTHING like that back then
It was basically just a marketplace and some houses, a few dirt roads and a small fortress
Actually the name "Târgoviște" comes from "Târg" meaning "Market Square" .
Cum, in Romanian it means "How".
“Crap” is a type of fish here
“Fac” (pronounced “fuck”) is the verb for “I’m making”
Blanking out on non-offensive ones
Salt means jump in Romanian
Face
A face in Romanian means to do/make, but of course in english it means someone's face
"cum" means "how" but yeah I guess sometimes it's pretty funny
"curve" (hookers)
No is yes
Oh dear
Then again, we have ‘Eu’, pronounced similarly to ‘you’ to mean ‘I’.
In Romanian we have "da" which means yes, but in german it means there
There's a song named "Cum se face
" that has a lot of youtube comments from disappointed english speakers
Also fag means beech in English
FYI, constipation in English is the opposite of diarrhea
In case you end up at a doctor's office
Some non-offensive ones:
Sat = village
Pat = bed
Site = sieves
Gem = jam
Beautiful, thank you
“Salt” is the noun (the jump)
The verb is “a sări” - eu sar, tu sari, el sare etc
That song, but the comments were from 2016 or whenever it was released
Haven't checked it in a while
The corresponding verb is "a sălta".
Happy cake day
My boyfriend is Filipino, I'm Romanian
He eats sooooooooooooo many sweets and there are so many sweet dishes
Also the obsession with white/pale skin is unreal
Garlic crumpet
Do I have to say more
Same in Romania
Same i  Romanua, even is for dead, uneaven for the living
>Dinners being a big deal
I appreciate cooking once or twice per week but most of the times I just want to have a sandwich or yoghurt with fruit
Also, just tea or coffee for breakfast is sad
Truest truth
I hate sweet popcorn
***Ricardo Milos flashbacks***
I just imagine telling someone I'll meet them at half 3 and they arrive an hour earlier
I guess that would rub anyone in the wrong way
I can't talk about your wife, she probably went through some stuff completely different than me
But for me it's almost a trigger when someone tells me to be "the better man". Mostly because I was constantly told as a child that "women forgive, women are kind". And as an adult it feels like complete defeat and humiliation sometimes to give in and be kind
I wanna be like a man: have my cake *and* eat it
I understand your wife, in some situations I would rather burn everything down than forgive
Forgiving seems like weakness
I see no problem
r/suddenlyportuguese
But the story has a happy ending, right
All is fine now
Thinking that East European women are perfect, beautiful, easy to get and the best housewives on the planet
"Romanians are gypsies"
"Romania is dangerous"
Well maybe this isnt so much Europe but more Romania
\-Everyone assumes ALL Romanian people are gypsies when there are clear differences
Literally one of the worst stereotypes
\-We dont collect scrap metal (Our GDP is Higher then Portugal)
\-We dont pickpocket (Only Gypsies in Foreign Countries that dont have education or manners)
Its annoying because there are so many hardworking and law biding people from Romania that get stained by some idiots :(
Said the guy from the country famous for dungeon porn and nudism :P
I mean it's really common for girls to sunbathe topless in Europe
I don't think they do that in the US
"No Free speech" I have encountered a lot in the US
Having lived in the UK, people often ask me if you can badmouth the queen or if you get fined/arrested for it
I dislike this a lot too, mostly because I talked to a black person for the first time when I was 26, because there are literally no black people in some cities here
Like some people in Europe that want dark skinned black people around them to show how inclusive they are
Sounds romantic :D
Brilliant
Bucharest: Around 5 2-rooms (living room + bedroom) 50m² apartments in a commie block outside of the city center in a decent neighbourbood near the subway station (say Dristor)
In a small village in Romania probably a 600 sqm house
Something like this:
Probably taxi drivers in Bucharest, it's like they are born to scam you
Instead of 7 euros, they will ask you for 20 euros from the airport if you're foreign
Other than that, the Bran (Dracula) Castle is kinda overrated, it's just a normal castle somewhere near the mountains
At least that's how I remember it 5 years ago
The "Dracula" souvenirs near the Bran castle
We repeat
DRACULA
DOES
NOT
REPRESENT
ROMANIA
[This] "castle". No offense to the owners, it was a lot of hard work into this place, but it's just not representative of Romanian culture and history, plus it's kinda expensive to get in
I went to a basketball tournament in Ferragudo,near Portimão. Amazing place, close to a lot of beaches, 10/10 would go again
There are better palaces/castles even outside Transylvania, like [this]
"Pizda țigăncii" means "gypsy pussy" and I think it's the [iris flower
] but it might be a different flower
Stingray,translates to "pisică de mare",and it means sea cat
Jesus Christ I never made the connection
We also have "bășina porcului", glad someone else pointed out pizda țigăncii tho
Here in romania ladybug is gărgăriță/buburuză
God cow is a different bug here
How do you call that bug I am thinking of
We just write them in English
I don’t think there is an automatic translator in Reddit
By the way, what the fuck is english
What do you mean by English in schools
Noi scriem doar în engleză, înafară de submarinul țării noastre
O traducere probabil că va ajunge la câteva rezultate ciudate
The ground floor is called "Parter", the next is the first floor "etajul unu (1)"
In Moldova and other post-USSR countries I've visited, they start counting at 1
So the floor at street level is the 1st floor, then 2nd floor, etc
In Romania the street level floor is "parter", i.e. ground floor and the one above it is 1st floor
This will cause endless arguments and struggles if we ever unite with Moldova, maybe even a civil war
we have word parter (same pronunctiation as the french) meaning ground floor .
3D cinema,the founding pen, the bridge(the standardized way modern bridges are build was designed here),we came with the ideea to out cars wheels inside the body of the car,insulin(even tho is highly debated dont take my word as true),ejection seat,
Insulin
The cervical cancer screen test
3D Cinema
Arrow shaped airplanes
Fountai pen
The ejection seat
The Coanda effect
The first car with wheels inside its aerodynamical line, a.k.a. the modern car
And many others, just search on wikipedia
one Romanian i forget his name invented I think a type of plane, I forgot any romanian here to complete
Petrache Poenaru invented the Pen
There's a metro station named after him
The pen, the jet engine (technically), and almost the aeroplane
The most famous of Coandă's discoveries is the Coandă Effect
After more than 20 years studying this phenomenon along with his colleagues, Coandă described what Albert Metral was later to name the "Coandă Effect". This effect has been utilized in many aeronautical inventions
[Coandă effect :-)]
The Jet Aircraft by Henri Coanda
It saves lives, man
Don't forget about the first jet engine
Even though those pesky canadians tried to steal it
Fountain pen*
To say the least we helped the world a lot
>3D cinema
What
How
Henri Coanda
Isn't it strange to claim someone "invented" a food and other countries can't claim that food
I mean, how can someone prove that a Chinese person sailed to Italy to teach them to make pasta
Didn't they, both Chinese and Italians, come out with pasta independently
And in all fairness, nowadays the Italian pasta is the one everyone knows
Thanks
We have a village/spa resort situated on the shore of a salted lake somewhere in the grassy, monotonous plain through which flows the lower Danube
Its name
Lacu Sărat -- Salted Lake
What about Amadora
Which literally means Amateur
It's like the EU wants us to hate them even more
Oh yesss, garlic sauce always
Yeah, ketchup/extra tomato sauce here
Pretty commonplace
Yes
Sweet or hot ketchup or garlic sauce
Hot tomato sauce one slice, spicy tomato sauce the next one
I love doing this
I love spicy stuff
Yes , most if not all pizza places have ..sweet/hot tomato sauce,garlic or barbeque sauces ,ketchup hot/sweet
See, we aren't vampires, if we were could we eat garlic sauce
Though we do have garlic sauce, but we don't use it on pizza
Pros:warm weather,great food,great cities
Cons:racist people,lack of xbox live (even tho they sell xbox here and  games for it),gypsies (sometimes theu are too many
Not all of them  are bad,but there are some who ruin the lives of everyone) , everything feels expensive
cons: Bad drivers and not a lot of highways
pros: cheap beer
Born in Romania, left in 1997 to USA, but I come back every year
I lived there with my then-boyfriend from 2009-2014
&#x200B;
Pros: The men are incredibly attractive, not sure why
Low cost of living
Nice people once you get to know them
Beautiful scenery everywhere
Pretty safe overall
&#x200B;
Cons: Superstitions are common, it has a very folky small village mentality in many areas
Very low wages
Architecture leaves a lot to be desired
Buildings/roads/cities are not well maintained, apartments are often really shitty
Racism and sexism and general hyper conservative beliefs are widespread and accepted
I think  "La Marseillaise"  is one of the most iconic ones
You hear the first few notes and you instantly recognize and hum along
I also like "Katiusa", from the USSR times, although I grew up hearing the romanian xxx version of it
But the melody is catchy
Russian stuff is pretty dope
Those guys really know how to make banger melodies
This [song from Serbia] and [this one from Bulgaria]
Personally like "Argonnenwaldlied" but I don't know if you can consider that a patriotic song
I also like Merck Toch Hoe Sterck and it's one of my favorite folk songs
Heil dir Im Siegerkranz is pretty cool
I think he went to Kyrgyzstan not Kazakhstan
The most famous natural disaster would be the 1977 earthquake
It destroyed a good part of our capital and killed around 1500 people while injuring almost 12 000
The psychological impact is even deeper as it created a general fear among the populace towards another potential earthquake that is still felt to this day
For those interested you can read more about it [here]
Adding to that is the Colectiv fire in 2015
aww i just saw the rendition of it on the last season of the crown
awful stuff
yet half of the historic center of Bucharest still lives in buildings that have been deemed a huge risk of collapse
We call them the Red Dots(Bulina Rosie) after the big red circle shaped warnings above their entraces
People that live in those gamble with their lives, and the sad thing is some might not afford moving
For what it's worth i've known people who had afternoon tea
When I was doing my Master's the people in my office and the professor would have a tea break with some pastries in the canteen at 4pm
Mostly because the canteen would close at 4 and sell anything they had left for pennies
(I know what my flair says btw, been in the UK for a few years now)
That thing is called Kürtőskalács here and it is very appreciated
Lol those are at literally every single market and tourist place in Romania
Even in places where no Hungarian has set foot for a generation, there will be a stand selling this stuff
They're pretty good though
Some would be :
- If you can easily break an apple in half, then your mother in law likes you
- During the wedding ceremony the groom and the bride should try to step on the others foot, to see who will be the head of the house
- You must never step on the threshold of a church door, it brings bad luck
- When you die you cannot be buried in clothes you got as a gift, because when you reach the other world those who gave you the clothes will take them back
- On New Years Eve you must wear red underwear and have some money in your pockets, for good luck in the year to come
The current pulls you
Romanians belive  that you can get sick if a breeze of air enters by the door and leaves by the window for example
Dude i tought these were romanian superstitions
If you rob a thief you have 100 years of good luck
Are you lucky enough to not go to prison
Does matter what belongings you steal of they have to be specifically the stolen ones
Does that make you a thief and someone who will steal from you will be lucky too
None
We used to cover our books and notebooks in primary school and label them with Name and Subject, but that was it
I had Notebooks :(, BUT:
Chemistry - blue
Biology - green
Physics - yellow (cuz I didn't like it)
Math - red
PS: you should make a bar graph for this now
You have the data, analyze it
Aren’t all folders yellow
Or turquoise if you use Mac
I came here expecting to see what color ppl use for windows folders
Maybe get some inspiration
This was disappointing and my day has been ruined
The disparity between the capital/large cities and the poor regions
I sometimes ride my bike outside Bucharest, it takes 30-40 kilometers to go 50 years back in time
My owl depressed ass wants to move to Sweden now
Meh, most people know about that
That’s a tricky question for countries like ours because people already sees only the worst parts
As an Eastern European I would say that the shockingly bad thing about Germany are the Healthcare services
Don't get me wrong, the system is generally good
However, if you're new in the city and you need a gynecologist, we'll, good fucking luck getting on the patient list of one
If you need some medical procedure, you might end up wanting half a year to get it and God knows how the disease will evolve by then
If you need a dental surgery, first you have to live with the pain like a real man for a couple of months and then maybe you'll get the surgery
And if you are rushed to the hospital, if you're unlucky enough, you might just get a pamphlet with the emergency surgery they'll do on you
Not a human being explaining to you what the hell is happening
There is nature too but plenty of Dutch
I have a holiday house next to Lake Tisza, a very remote part of Eastern Hungary and there are hundreds of Dutch people chilling there all summer long
Probably attracted by the cheapness of it too
Transylvania for the region
As for the city, I guess there's more than one, but maybe Brasov would be the most liked one
Maybe Brasov, or Iasi
Brasov for sure
Cluj
Cluj but its not my fav
Everyone says Bucharest is worst but i like it
Do you think Sibiu would count or is it not quite big enough
Timisoara and Oradea as well
I think Sibiu takes the cake, it's not about the size or population
I'm not taking it the wrong way
Transylvania is pretty much the only region in Romania apart from the Iași region that looks good and is developed
And that is because it was under Austro-hungarian rule for so long
If we had that since the beginning it would look like the gray depressing south
Honestly if you guys had it, it could be so much more
But eh
I feel somewhat of a local pride, thanks
I mean, it has an airport, a highway, good schools and universities (although probably not as good as Iaşi and Cluj)
It only lacks an Uber system
I always name them in English, it’s just the way it is
I write everything in English and mostly even think in English as well when programming (PS Stackoverflow is in English too
Everything in english , been doing it from highschool and university teachers were asking us to do it too
Some people prefer it over anything and there are always long lines but I find it lacking compared to kaufland
Still, no one makes jokes about it
It’s usually considered as high quality and everyone likes it
In Romania it's great, everyone loves it
In England it's so much more different than in continental Europe, but I still preffered it over Tesco or Sainsburys
It's cheap low variety here in Romania
I personally don't shop at Lidl unless I have no choice
It's the type of supermarket that serves a big high density residential zone, has everything, it's cheap but good quality for the money, families prefer to go to it because it's conveniently close and has a wide variety of products but not many brands to choose from
I myself prefer either Auchan or Kaufland
There are 3 categories of people
Those who preffer to buy a little bit cheaper and go to discounts like Lidl and those who don't care about discounts and go to Tesco
Others
it's good yea
They make the same jokes about Tesco
You're from Greece
You should be joking about your country, not about a supermarket
Romanian living in France here: not a problem in either country
I have friends of both sexes, and hang out with them even when my wife is not around, never was an issue, even with married friends
Of course, I always see a lot of kids in groups of boys and girls in equal number
As a kid I actually used to be friend with more girls than boys (but I’m strange so I don’t know if I’m a good example)
i think this applies to romania too
i think
That's just insecurities from her :(
Most cases of this kind of jealousy are coming from the fear that they alone would not be good enough to keep their boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever so anyone else is a liability
They already view their relationship as fragile and they already expect it to fall apart
Or I dunno, maybe you're friend had something else going on in her life that made her upset
Or some influence from someone toxic
They're all insecure
Certain things, and mentalities get perpetuated through behavior and become a cycle, until someone breaks the cycle
I say "alo
". Unless I'm at work in which case it's "strange_socks_, department of socks".
I swear if someone was to compile a list of everyday French behaivours and someone
else could just republish it as everyday Romanian behaviour,this is how much we love France
Romania was founded in 1859 so 161 years old
It depends what date you consider
As it is right now, 1918
There will be 102 years on 1st December
However, the country existed in different forms and under diverse powers way before of that
Well, the first Dacian Kingdoms were around since time immemorial, and we were the first humans in Europe
However, in terms of national unity, a few years come to mind:
61 B.C.: King Burebista starts campaign to unify Dacian kingdoms
(Later conquered by Romans
16o1: Mihai the Brave unifies the three principalities, shortly before his assassination
(At which point the three parts were again separated
1862: Alexandru Ioan Cuza become ‘Domnitor of Romania’. (But with only a fraction of the land
1878: Carol I secures proper independence for Romania
1918: Bucovina and Transylvania unite with Romania, in what is now celebrated as ‘Greater Union Day’ on the first day of December
In summary: Yes
It's actually 1877
>Well, the first Dacian Kingdoms were around since time immemorial, and we were the first humans in Europe
Source
For the latter are you talking about the Oase fossils,since there have since been older fossils of modern humans found in Europe
Yes
But Romania as a country was founded in 1859 after Wallachia united with Moldavia
As I said, depends on the date you consider
However we celebrate the 1st December 1918 union the national day, so it's the more widespread accepted one
Perhaps I was wrong, but I recall hearing that the oldest human fossils were found around Romania, Moldavia, and Ukraine
I’m not sure exactly where
...Forgot what
It makes very little sense to consider december 1st 1918 the Birth of Romania
That day was when Transilvania was incorporated into Romania,whereas may 22th  1877 is when the country declared independence from the Ottoman Empire,thus Romania is around 142 years old
The oldest human(Genus Homo)Fossils in Europe were found in Spain,and The oldest Modern Human (Species Homo Sapiens) Fossils in Europe were found in Greece
I know but I'm not the one deciding what people choose to celebrate
My point is that we’re old
Just because it's the national day does not mean that it has to be the countries birthday
France has it's national day on 14th july,the anniversary of the storming of the bastille of 1789,but France's birthday is August 843(or 3th of June 1944 if you want to count for how long the country has continously existed)
Ik, but again, I'm not the one choosing what people celebrate
Usually the stores that sell stuff like that (furniture or construction materials etc) offer you the option to deliver that to your home, for a small fee or for free, sometimes if you live in a village or very far they charge per km outside the city/town the store is located in
But people are inventive and I've seen lots who tie stuff on top of cars or borrow a bigger car from someone they know
Rental trucks are probably available, although I never heard of somebody doing that
From experience, it usually goes like this:
1- You think if it fits in the back of your car with the back seats folded
if not
2- Then you probably know someone who owns a van, or a friend or family member knows someone who owns a van
3- But if that also fails, then you ask the store to deliver it to your place , I assume there is a fee for this ( but idk for sure, never got this far)
> Just bought a grill in December, patio furniture earlier last fall
Fair enough on the other things, but usually here if you buy bulky stuff like that, the store/seller takes care of delivery
Either for a small fee (if the sale is under a certain value) or for free
[This massive bastard] for example would be like 22$ to deliver here
Tbh I'm very surprised it isn't free
If I were to build a bew house or completely re-do an old one and I was sure about what electronics would go where, I’d install cable runners and junction boxes and whatever else would be needed
But other than that, the cables are staying in view
The informal one would probably be "bonă" .Babysitter would be the formal one
In Romania the rich employ Filipinas as babysitters and/or housekeepers
As a result, oftentimes she’s referred simply as “filipineză” (“Filipina”)
we have *dădacă* in Romanian
I'm wondering if it's somehow related
Also, some older terms: ”dădacă” or ”doică”. "The Nanny" TV show was translated as ”Dădaca” :D
In Romanian too
From what I could find, it is
Nothing like that,only the teachers have something like an oven and a microwave in their office,and maybe a sink
Our country in general didn't have a budget
We literally had to turn the gym class in a classroom because we had no money to make another one
So, no, I didn't learn how to cook in my school but I can tell you the whole essay on Ion
It depends
If it's by naturalization (as in, first generation migrant) then language should be very important for aquiring a new citizenship
If it's by descendent/birth right (one parent of a certain citizenship) then language is of no importance
We actually still have romanians of hungarian ethnicity that don't speak romanian in our country ... It's simply bad for them if they leave their area but they're still romanian citizens
idgaf
This one right here
Sooner or later the poor fucker will find himself at a counter in front of an old and experienced Byzantine bureaucrat
Game over
drunk l ol
Is it better or worse than French
Impossible
Current or former art students, what's your university's policy on projects made while being a student
This question is mostly out of curiosity and because I'm pissed off for future students here
The art university here in Bucharest, where I graduated a few years ago, just passed legal terms saying that any work done during the study years in the university studios now legally belongs to the school, and they are allowed to sell it as well
Students are supposed to get 30% of that revenue (which I bet won't happen half the time)
The thing is, this university barely provides students with anything at all
You buy your own paper, your own art supplies, paints, etc
You even have to paint the walls and patch them up yourself before the final year exhibition
I initially did a year of a painting major and dropped out because I couldn't afford the huge costs and the teacher berating me for not using enough paint
I think this decision is awful and a gateway to a lot of teachers taking their students' work
I can't imagine not being able to take my work home if I want to because "it belongs to the school"....
What's it like where you are
That's really cool
Y'all northerners have really good school systems :(
We had Adobe CS 3 and the oldest slowest macs lol
Yeah it's definitely wrong
It's one thing doing stuff for work and another working on very personal projects in school only to have them taken away
My studio professor thought she was doing me a solid and sold literally all my work from the final uni project to random people who liked it
Even though she gave me the money, it was a measly sum I would never have agreed to
This is the kind of shit that goes on here lol
It was the same here for stuff that people didn't want to take home, or they just threw them away
That's fucked up
Considering a scientific discovery isn't exactly some random still life you've done 100 times before
Well that's crappy favoritism
That's really nice, and sounds like it should be the norm
But SAE also costs more than anyone I know can afford
She said it was all the money but like
I don't have any guarantees that she was honest
She asked like 10€ a piece
I didn't wanna sell it right away either, wanted to keep the pieces for participating in other exhibitions
Nah
We are antisocial
I can empathize soo much
I know the whole street XD
doesn't the cost come from registering it in Norway ? like a high percentage import tax depending on emissions or something like that ?
15 min walk to bus station, 25 min bus ride, 5 min from bus to work
20 minutes walk+ bus to my college
Bucharest, Romania: 35-40 minutes
I take the subway and a tram
To the office I have a 5 min walk to the tram station and a 25 minute ride on the tram
But I usually work from home
5 minutes by scooter, and I also know some backroads in case of heavy traffic
Professional driver POV:
It’s an unefficient brownian movement which takes 30 to 90 minutes per leg
Would benefit a lot from people using public transport or at least not sleeping behind their SUV’s steering wheel
I'm in Bucharest, Romania
Currently unemployed, but for my former job - it depends a lot on luck, can be anywhere from 25-40 minutes
Technically I had the option of a bus or a tram
I usually took the tram
Walked a couple of minutes to the station, waited - this is the luck part- between 1 and 15 minutes, rode the tram for 15-20 minutes, got off then walked for another 6/7 minutes
The way back usually took towards 40 min because I always waited ages for the tram and it was somehow always slow
This is a lucky commute in this city, most people commute between 40 min and 1 and 1/2 h
Enschede, Netherlands
15 to 20 minutes by bike
30 to 35 minutes by bus
Outside of London, 5 minutes walk
Can't complain tbh
By car: 15-30 mins in the morning, 30-45 in the evening
By public transport: 10 mins walk from home to the subway station, then 30-45 mins on the subway (switching line once)
On one of the lines, the train comes every 15 minutes, so the total time depends a lot on that
The subway station is right across the street from my office
20 min walk to get almost anywhere that I'm interested in ..work ,park,mall or city center
Same here
Except pants, underwear, or any kind of clothes are optional
Erin
I love it
Beatrice
I would have loved to name my daughter like that
Emily and Etienne
I dunno why I like em, but I do
Konrad sounds really cool to me
For a girl, I love the Hungarian name Timea
don't have one for a boy
M: Armin and Matteo
F: Cornelia and every other female greek name
Did my ancient ruler request me
It's great to see people talk about my country's history
> and stupid sexy Putin
Kek, ⅛ of the girls I know are named Ana-Maria
This is one of the most common names found in Romania :)
That's one of the most common name in my country
Alex/Alexandru for guys too
I know people who moved out when they were like 15, just because they lived too far out of the city and their parents, because of different reasons, couldn't get them to school or whatever since u kinda have to do it on ur own here
I also know ppl who live in the same house with their parents who are like in their forties but most of the time people move out when going to uni
Usually we move out when going to uni
Even if some of us don't, we still tend to move out, staying with your parents after 20 is not that common even though it's not looked down upon or something
Most of us move from the country side to more urban areas or we even leave the country
It all depends on the family's financial situation
It depends ..a lot of people move for school or university so can be anywhere from 14-18
If you happen to live in a city with an university there is a high chance you'll live with you're parents until you finish it
Here it depends, if you're from a small city and you have to move to a different town for university, that's probably when you'll move out of your parents house
In my case since I'm from Bucharest, I didn't move out until I was about 30 and only did it once i was getting married and had enough money to buy our own place
No point moving out earlier and wasting money on rent
And this is similar to all my friends who grew up in Bucharest
Idk if is strange but our royal crown is not made put of silver and from the steal of ottoman cannons captured during the indepence war
A huge part of our history from 1200s to the 1800s is showing the Ottomans the middle finger the best way we could
Stefan cel mare used music to lure attackers to one side of the kingdom so that they can ambush the attackers
Dude, Vlad the Impaler was child's play compared to this guy
Steel>gold
You do have Stefan The Great’s sword in your museum though
That is something at least
On the ATMs in Germany they have a sticker explaining that there's a dye bomb inside and it's written in Romanian, Bulgarian and Polish
Does this count
i was watching breaking bad and in one of the episodes i heard romanian in the background lol caught me by surprise
Such harsh graffiti people in Australia
You think so
Oh, yeah, of course, English as well, but you expect German and English
Vampires
Ffs we don't impale our enemies
Not anymore, that is
gypsies
Vampires
Totally
I've only seen 3 last year, and only one this year
They're pretty rare
How common are interracial couples in your region
You should get out more
Funny thing is that we don't have vampires in our folklore :P
Fair enough
I guess I used an American term
Not quite
They don't suck blood
They aren't afraid of sunlight, garlic or silver
They are undead tho
What I was told is that a strigoi is the soul of an stillborn baby, a vengeful person or the village witch that is coming from the dead at night to torture people and holy water does send them away
But they don't suck blood or kill, they just
Annoy
Haunt
Torture
Stuff like that
I feel so ashamed
Watch it every year, it's wonderful
Always been my dream to one day see it live
Live right now
During most of the 18th century, most of the princes of Wallachia and Moldavia were Greek nobles from the Phanar(Fener) district of Constatinople
I guess it's common knowledge that we had a medieval leader who impaled enemies (most of the time turks) and placed them around his castle walls
Or maybe those were the times it was actually measured in a fair way
> surrender his weapon, which was an air gun, in exchange for more beer
I approve and understand his dedication to the cause
> which would be around £30,000 today
Impressively cheap
Should we try to build one today I guess the project alone would be in the hundreds of thousands, with money from EU
I dont wanna be a dick, yes there were plenty of times when in Transylvania all these different groups of ppl manage to co-exist togheter (Timisoara and the banat region is such an example) but there a lot of occasions when vlachs,saxons revolted against the crown for vlachs the main reason was that after the schism between catholic and orthodox the position of vlachs became difficult this lead to some revolts and let's not forget about Unio Trium Natio in 1437 when even that vlachs represented a big part of Transylvania population they were considered "tolerated" from political point of view
Dont get me wrong i dont deny the fact that vlachs and magyars lived in harmony this happend especially during the early reign of Arpad dynasty and even later when vlachs were getting somewhat persecuted there were a lot of cases when vlachs and other orthodox ethnicities manage to get high ranked position
I completely understand
Yes i agree here a little missconception in our history is 1784 revolt is thst it was a vlach revolt against hungarian overlords when in fact it was a magyar,vlach,saxon etc revolt against the german,vlach,magyar overlords
Ha ha  pulla means dick in Romanian
They are eating pulă in Finland eh
Pula in Romanian means dick
it's also commonly eaten here
You people make the best decisions about food
Best food *and* best combinations
Indeed
You're being so delicate about
Just say it
*say it*!
Penis/dick/cock
That's what you're supposed to say
That Vlad the Impaler was King of Romania or that he ruled Transylvania
First of all he was a Prince/Voivode not a King
2nd of all Romania didn't exist as a unified entity at the time
And 3th of all
He ruled Wallachia not Transylvania
He was just born in Transylvania
Well, this might not be in Europe, but it's definitely a very interesting read
Well first of all the title
It's like calling Suleyman the Magnificent the Duke of Turkey
And 2nd of all the rules of succession
Unlike western Kings who were succeded by the eldest son, everyone could become a Wallachian/Moldavian voivode as long as they are related to the previous leader
Even if they were bastards
I'm not sure you can call salvation what happened before the Soviet Union took over
Let's remember that you carved up Poland and Romania at the beginning of the war alongside Germany, and deported and killed just as many civilians as Nazi Germany
The Germans hunted down the so called ,,undesirable'' minorities, while the Soviet Union didn't stop there and hunted down every minority, and sometimes even its own people
And let's not get started on the indirect victims of communism throughout Eastern Europe and the effects of poverty that came with the red plague
Did you ever run around and desert me
Tuborg Christmas Brew
It's a variation of a very popular brand of beer which for some reason is so much better
I always hunt for it in the supermarket as soon as December rolls in
No special beer here, but your glühwein
Oh yeah
that’s the preferred drink for the cold season
Edit: there’s also a variant of the homemade schapps (usually without syrup or herbal flavor, called țuica) made from distilled fruit that’s boiled and drank hot (add some sugar and pepper in the boiling process)
The more you know
Yes, very common here in villages and towns
In Romania's rural areas (people stash up on wood logs before winters) and in some mountain areas where it would be difficult to bring gas conducts all the way over there (slightly bigger sometimes touristic villages)
in the rural area here only
Actually not that common
A lot of Romania is heated using gas
Even the municipal heating systems of bigger towns use gas
Wood is for the countryside houses
And that exactly what I’ve said
That's a pretty good joke
Tokyo,Kyoto,Hiroshima,Nagasaki and Fukushima
Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Saitama, Hiroshima, Nagasaki
Tokyo, Kyoto, yeah that's pretty much it
Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Fukushima, Okinawa, Sapporo, Yokohama
Fukuokoa
Does that one exist
Without looking at other answers I will try my best:
Tokyo, Osaka, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, Yokohama, Fukushima, Kyoto,Nagoya, Kobe, Fukuoka and I can't remember now that northern island's name where there is a city that is colder than average
So 10 overall
Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, Sapporo, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nagoya
I obviously know more, but can't think of them off the top of my head
oh yeah Nagaski and Hiroshima too
For Romania, [Florian Pittis]
Not sure how aware the younger generations are of his documentary work for Teleenciclopedia, but he used to be THE voice for that
In Romania it has to be Telenciclopedia
Younger kids may not know her,but a few of us,who grew up in the 90's and  early 00's,got most of our useless facts from her sliky voice
Hell,I know a girl who went on to have her bachelor's degree in biology because Telenciclopedia had an episode on celular activity that she liked very much
This is the kind of impact that makes me call a show iconic
His voice brings back a lot of childhood memories
Sure we do, we have one of those tiny portable grills that we do the sandwiches on
No pickles
You've just made an enemy for life
Ion Iliescu
Our 2nd president
He tried to sell us to the Russians and refused union with Moldova
Are you sure these guys are not regarded as heroes
There's a special mouth of the Satan in the middle of hell for him
Fuck
Him
He was pro-Russian
In fact many suspect that he may have been a KGB agent
Exactly
If it wan't for CDR to steer us towards the pro-Western direction
We can safely say that we would have become Belarus 2
We tried the option of not being on either side in 1940 and you guys just claimed parts of the country that didn't belong to you
Romania can't fight Russia alone if that happens again
Also what kind of advantages would an alliance with Russia offer
Your economy is barely holding, you don't have any resources that Romania needs and can't buy from the west, and the Russian state is a corrupt apparatus that grinds people into poverty
Also Ukraine was allied to Russia and look how that turned out
If you consider "being a slave to Russia" better than "being a slave to western Europe" than it is nit better, but almost every eastern european would prefer being a "slave to the west"
It's rumored that Bonaparteb said that the Russians are a nation of devoted slaves ruled by a ruthless aristocracy
And quite frankly it still holds to this day
Yesterday
Our PM (de jure) said she teached maths, then she also said the circle's surface is the radius squared
Edit: ex- PM
De jure and de facto she's not our PM anymore
Parliament voted Orban
Ludovic Orban
But she's running for president
Our meme culture has material
Just that she isn't our PM anymore (not de jure, not de facto)
Maybe she ate the pi, it was a good pi
She was but now she’s running for president, and practically all the candidates suck tbh
She was literally an art teacher before becoming a PM
She can’t even speak romanian properly
And she’s running for president
It’s just sad at this point
Yeah lol
Thank god no
He's meme-y enough as it is
Hate fkr each other
r/technicallythetruth
all of these apply to Romania too other than being tall
Is it like the difference between Romanian and Moldovan
Like, just an accent difference and a few regional words
i went to Cluj and I thought I crossed the border /s
I have small "cultural" shocks everytime I travel +100 km around where I live
The greater the distance - the greater the differences
But I love it
I love to the bottom of my heart the diversity in people, the small language nuances, their habbits, their traditions and even the geographical differences
It makes me feel grateful we are not the same
It makes me understand better the background that connects us all and gets me out of my comfort zone
Once you live for too long in the same place surrounded by the same people you start thinking the whole world is or should be like that
And it isn't and won't be
We are different based on a countless number of variables: from the altitude to the family history
Even if some patterns exist, the more you travel the more you realise how fragile and unrelated to reality those patterns are
Once I realised this, I also realised same applies to any country in the world
Except maybe Luxemburg
Or Vatican
They really small :))
I had exactly the same shock
First time I was in Germany it was work related and it was in a small town in Bavaria
People told me to leave my bag hanging at the entrance
Imagine the shock I had, coming from Bucharest
I thought about it a lot and realized that I also grew up in a small town in Romania where it was perfectly ok to sleep with your door opened or leave your phone on the table without even thinking someone might steal it
I suppose small comunities protect themselves better from criminality due to the complete lack of events they have
After that, I went to Munich for a couple of times and though whole Germany is like that
Imagine my shock when I discovered Frankfurt
I was like: WTF
Next on the list is Berlin and hopefully it will not be work related so I can have a decent visiting and a better understanding of your culture
Well no shit, why would they
You never know when albania could suddenly conquer the world
Better be prepared
Hah, ler and crumpeni are used in Transylvania, but not in the rest of Romania
I learned most of my Hungarian from my Székely grandparents
I got loads of these
(When 3 words are given they mean "deep dialect" - "proper local speech" - "alien speech from Hungary")
Törö[k]buza - kukorica
Fuszulyka - paszúly - bab
Vinétta - padlizsán
Pityóka - krumpli - burgonya
Tészta - sütemény
Laska - tészta
Your accent sounds like the ones over the border in Partium (I grew up in Nagyvárad/Oradea)
In romanian it's called ***Ministerul Apărării Naționale*** ( Ministry of National Defence) but most people call it **MApN** (M-A-P-N) or **Ministerul Apărării**.
Ministerul Apărării Naționale - MApN - _Ministry of National Defense_
I am Romanian and never cooked sarmale
I'm an atheist
Hate slanină (smoked pig's fat) or any other greasy food for that matter
Can't stand Romanian music, other than indie/rock bands
I'm not at all traditional, which means I don't want to have kids or get married in a church (say that to the women in my familly, they are gonma flip), nor "taking care" of my "husband" like handwashing his dirty underpants or stinky socks
If I'm going to live with my future boyfriend/girlfriend, we are gonna share the household chores (say that to my dad, he will flip)
I don't know how to dance horă
I cant stand traditional music and dancing
But you enjoy eating them
Well who doesn't
Robin and the backstabbers, The monojacks, Cred ca sunt extraterestru, Aproape Unplugged, Nava Mama, Coma, Eyedrops, Purple dandies, Kryptonite sparks, Mr jurjack, vie daca
Of course, the classiscs Bucovina, Vita de Vie (I love Viţa de vie-Alungă tăcerea), Pheonix, Alternosfera (those are from Moldavia) There are more, I love discovering Romanian indie music, we have a beautiful melodic language that can transmit such emotion and imagery and yet, we are stuck  with shitty pop-electronic bullshit with simple minded lyrics and basic beat on the radio
It is pretty tough
Even some of my friends are pretty traditional and conservative
I'm more of a centrist myself, yet I still spark controversy among my peers
"Ce vii ca turcii
" - "Why are you rushing like turkish
" it is used in situations like: you want to get on a busy bus, and you accidently bump hard into someone
Bă, ești turc
Are you Turkish
(angry tone)
This comes from the Ottoman times, I guess
It translates to "Do you understand me
" Or "Are you deaf
" Or "Do you not know this language I speak in
Ca la americani
Like over at the Americans
Post - Cold war, usually interprets that America is a luxury land, the technology is booming etc
să te îneci ca țiganul la mal
to drown like the gypsy at the shore (that part with the depth not even a meter)
Not a nationality but I had to include it
It means roughly to fail at something terribly simple
Ești turc
"Are Turkish
" Do you not understand
Yeah, you can say "the Tatars are coming" when you are in a rush for no reason
"Are you Turk
" meaning you're
well, no offense Turkey, stupid
The last one might not be as popular, but my mom and grandmother uses them quite a lot
"Jewish soul" meaning you're a bad person
Also using the derogatory term for Jews in Romanian and not the standard one
Don't you guys use Wallachia as a metaphor for 'in the middle of nowhere' ?
We also have something similar
> S-a înecat ca țiganul la mal  ("He drowned like the gypsy on the shore", when you started working on something but you give up at the very end)
Which comes from a very disturbing and racist history: in the time when gypsies were enslaved, there were ones that tried to run away but were caught and brought back
For the ones not """lucky""" enough to be tortured as a form of punishment, the slave owners would pretend to give them the opportunity of winning their freedom, all they had to do is swim across a lake with their legs tied up
As soon as they would reach the shore they would be pulled back in the lake, again and again, until the slave, exhausted from the sheer effort, would end up drowning
Of course, this served not only as a punishment but as a means of entertainment for the slave owners as well as a warning for the other slaves, who were forced to watch
>Siedzieć jak na tireckim kazaniu
We also have a similar saying in Romanian: "Eşti turc
" (Are you turkish
) it's used when someone doesn't understand something
We also use that "Pampas"
Dark humor (including sexism, racism and the other things) seems to be common here, not so much in other countries
It's stigmatized here to not address yourself to another person in plural if they're a stranger/teacher/authority/etc
Same in France I believe
Hating gypsies I guess
In Romania 95% of them are very bad and 4% are bad
So we naturally hate them because they do bad things like shout like crazy at nights, don't wash, steal, mug, rape, beat, piss on the streets, shit on the streets, throw trash on the steets, bully or beg
On top of all that they go in other European countries and do those bad things and WE get the -rep
We hate them so much that we even associated the Romanian word for gypsy (țigan) with words like thief and homeless
I knew you are from Czechia when I saw the notification on my phone
Also well
saving this lol it's exactly the same in romanian
Popular in Germany, too
Fuck off, Jenny, I don't want to buy your novelty condoms, so take your drunk cohort wearing personalised t-shirts, and your miniature Kümmerlings, and gtfo
>:(
Yes
[30 years of democracy] is a 3 hour long story of the politics, economics and society of Romania since the fall of communism
It has interviews with presidents and prime ministers from these years, and tells a pretty interesting story of descent into chaos and the start of a return of better times
On a lighter note, Chuck Norris vs Communism is on Netflix and Amazon and tells the story of an underground operation to dub foreign (mostly American) movies in Romanian in the 80s. It was a huge operation to dub the movies, copy the dubs to VHS tapes, distribute the tapes as well as the cassette players
It even involved some members of the Securitate IIRC
I wholeheartedly recommend [Untamed Romania] (nature) and [Flavors of Romania] (food)
They’re both on Netflix or similar platforms e.g. iTunes, Vimeo, Prime etc
These german guys(i think) from DW documentary have endless documentaries that might just be the thing you are looking for
Nobody got love for [Flavours of Romania]
I've seen them and I wholeheartedly endorse this recommendation
It's very interesting to learn of the functioning of such an important global player
Exactly
You're right, it kind of stops in 2017 iirc
But if anything, really understanding how far our politics and economics fell in the 90s has made me more forgiving of the current situation, and more optimistic
Like
We're digging the way out of a really deep hole
[sigh] This is one of the things that gets on my nerves, some people not understanding how bad it really was and how far we've actually come
They think it maybe wasn't that bad compared to today
It was the bottom of the pit
I always recommend that doc to people, so that they see exactly why the last 30 years looked like this and not better
Giving towels to the priest and to other people at funerals
(I don’t know if it is all country thou)
Romanian 'Paparude'. This is a tradition older than christianity in Romania
It was practiced by the pagans as a rain dance
Children would make costumes out of vegetation and tree bark, dance barefoot and the boys splah girls with water
It is still practiced in the more remote countryside, even tho the people there are highly religious orthodox cristians
At funerals in Romania we give away towels, many towels
At my grandmother funeral we gave away 100 towels at least
As a foreigner that's the pinnacle of British culture to me
Same here
In Transylvania, the rose water thing is common, and on 6 December, children leave their boots by the door and St
Nicholas will bring them either candy if they're good, or a stick if they're bad(so the parents can beat them)
These sticks are sold in supermarkets around 6 December
Thanks for the copypasta
Isn't that a Spanish thing
Or is it in Portugal too
Hmm
not where I'm from
That looks quite nice
All of Romania does the exact same
But why tho
Whiping bitches, burning witches
I think this is a common thing in Europe
Romanians do it too
What witch culture
Never heard of such thing
There are indeed gypsy fortune tellers and I think they are also paid to curse people, but I am not sure how widespread you believe this is haha
I think I've heard about this topic at most 3-4 times in total
Vlad Tepes
I mean impaling people just to send a message was pretty bad
I'm a Ruthenian living in Romania, it's unfortunate that we got assimilated as Ukrainians everywhere
Harry Potter said we have dragons, was that a lie
Impale me daddy like I'm one of your ottomans demanding tribute
Yea I mean doing it to ottoman invaders
okay, different times yadda yadda
But he also did it to beggars or petty thieves, I think that was a little bit extreme no matter the period we talk about
Someone was paying attention at history class
Hmm, this gives me ideas
I'll make the equivalent of German porn dungeons, but wallachia inspired
Should be fun
Let's not forget that you could've also avoided invading Serbia, but you just had to do it
the font and spacing on ours looks better to me compared to most of the others
but i may be biased
i also like the shade of blue
I like ours
County code (2 letters, or 1 if it is the capital)
2 numbers
3 letters (can be custom or random)
Can be p versatile and rather easy to parse
Example combos: AG 47 GUY or IS 66 TIV or B 08 BIS
Also the fact that you can customize them makes it pretty cool
A lot of countries don't allow this or it costs a fortune to do it
Well here in Romania it would be Cluj, and Oradea would be the second
Cluj's growth is mainly due to the IT industry (sometimes refered to as the Silicon Valley of Romania) and all sorts of international companies like Emerson who just opened a new Appleton base last week, Bosch who expanded last year, as well as others
With Oradea I am not so familiar but from what I know they did really good with convincing companies to open bases through subventions and a very well thought out infrastructure suitable for industrial/logistical parks
Oradea
This city grew so much in the last 20 years
It's an example for all of Romania
Happiest people, most green space, safest place etc
We are lucky with our administration
One of the best in the whole country
Cluj in romania is by far the most flourishing  . Honorable mentions are Timisoara and Sibiu and maybe Iasi (but Iasi is developing because of the nearby areas which are very poor so naturally people are moving there , but it's not like Iasi is a very wealthy city , even for romanian standards) .Usually the west of the country is developing much faster due to proximity from rest of Europe
&#x200B;
Bucharest is also developing but that's because it's the capital (a lot of big companies from all around the world have the romanian headqurters in Bucharest) but not because the quality of live is getting better or something like this
Meh, out of 200 countries recognized by UN more than 3/4 have severe corruption problems so we are not unique at all, if anything the functional countries are the rarity here
Same as you guys: 50/50
Although I think the z with the slash is more common for children or people that learned how to write during communism
In university most of my colleagues wrote in a very "sloppy way" or very "typewriter-like" so a lot of the calligraphy we're taught just goes away at some point (unless the commies drilled it into your head)
While I'm still in highschool, a lot of people write z and Z with a line in the middle, since it's easier to know for sure that's a Z and not some other letter
There are some cases of people who don't draw the line, but there are few and far between and practically non existent in the older generations
Elderly especially still write in cursive
Wait
What
How
That's one funky z.
Nah,not that common
But im at a new school and im in a cpass with everyone epse having 2 names
Im the only one with one name
Yes
If you are Romanian and you have parents/grandparents that are at least slightly religious people, chances are you have a second name, usually one of them is from a saint
yep, very common
*random*: Peanut butter and jelly
Monster trucks (even if I like them)
Those churches where you sing
Welcoming your new neighbours with pie (*only seen it in movies
Is it even a thing
Those shirts that some wear on holidays
With sandals
And long socks
Wtf
Using Lbs and "miles" like smh
Smiling at Strangers
That is really odd as a European I find it so weird when they do that since we dont do it here
Also they are very loud
I was in a restaurant in Frankfurt Germany once and they literally were so loud that I heard their entire conversation about guns and the USA
Hope this doesn't offend anyone I'm just really curious as to why that happens
Bumper stickers saying "God bless the police" and "The Lord protects the police" and so on
I don't think I have ever seen a country where the police is glorified, let alone to this extent
Everyone else hates the police or are at most neutral towards it
The whole allegiance to the flag thing in school, we don't have this here (though we do sing the anthem in music class) and I find it very weird, we don't even have flags inside the classroom
Our flags are usually in flag poles in a hallway or outside on the school building
Anything that has to do with food
And the weird friendlyness
And the honesty that isn't honest all the time
I always find Americans to be "off", like an uncanny valley of behavior
But it's never something in particular that seems strange
Just a general vibe
Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the ones I've met, it's just something there that I can't really figure out
Walking in your outdoor shoes around the house or even in bed
Seriously, wtf
I heard that Americans make small talk with random people
Idk how it is in the rest of my country but here if you don't know someone,don't look at them
Interestingly we tip in Romania too
Everyone from waiters to gas station attendants to hotel receptionists
> Peanut butter and jelly
Chiar am încercat unt de arahide și gem (n-am avut jeleu) pe pâine și mi s-a părut surprinzător de bun
Donno
In orthodox churches people don't really sing because nobody understands what they are saying :)) we barely understand what the story line is
I never understood
Is just like: "aaaaa aaaaaa Jesus all mighty aaaa aaaa  God all mighty aaaaa aaaaa aaaaa *someone* said something aaaaa aaaamin". I always feel like this part in Life of Brian:
Thank you for the neighbours update
Now I can watch your movies knowing it is not true :))
But not the flower themed shirts some Americans  added as a bonus :))
Yeah, but who had the most colorful and visible shirt/ t-shirt signaling "look at my socks and sandals as I walk past your beautiful architectural jewelries or landscapes
Because we don't really understand what they are saying and therefore can't sing :))))))  Yeah, it's kinda weird for foreigners when they get in contact for the first time with an Orthodox church
It's a lot to take in
My ex boyfriend was Catholic and Romanian but never went to an Orthodox Church before dating me
I thought it would be fun to see his face when going in one of our churches
Hell it was
He was like: "what the f*uck
Why is there so much gold
Why so many paintings
What are they singing
What are they wearing
What is this
" :))))
Mie nu mi-a plăcut :)) dar cred ca din cauză că nu imi place combinația dulce-sărat
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America
Liberty and justice for all
That's all I know from it
Cuz movies
I've been to many places in Europe and I have never seen other Europeans smiling at strangers
People just mind their own business you know but maybe I haven't seen it lol
I’ve seen them in Texas and Arizona
“especially the snipers” sounds like something out of a Monty Python skit
Never seen a sticker saying bless doctors or firefighters but police and the military, Hells yeah
You do you America
It's weird how people I've never met act like they're my childhood friends :/
I like the space and time Europeans give me to actually get comfortable around them
I mean I know for a fact from people who worked in the industry that if you don't tip the waiters \*will\* spit in your food and hotel receptionists \*will\* lie and say there are no rooms available
Cred că este așa un gust câștigat
Not necessairly
Small churches- just the priests and their help
Bigger churches - choir
But there are always some old ladies thinking they still have what it takes to sing along
I can imagine it's a matter of region
In my hometown we wouldn't bake or make baskets but if we had a new neighbour that we liked we used to share cookies or fruits or flower seeds for gardening
When I grew up it was a shock to move in a town where neighbours don't even greet themselves
I was the only one saying "good morning". 15 yrs later I still do it
I believe people can change using the power of example
Asa au zis si cand m-au obligat să mănânc spanac  never again
:))
I'm not the kind of person to wish even more oppression on working class people thank you very much
I do cause I'm not a class traitor

Romanians have poor taste, so I’m going to nominate the [Elbphilharmonie] in Hamburg, Germany as a great example of modern, recent, architecture
I think it’s awesome both out and in
See also [this] [this] and [this] because a cool building deserves cool publicity
None
We can't build something good-looking to save our lives
>Romanians have poor taste
This is so damn true, I can't remember the last time I saw something well-made and aestethic
It's like we are injected with kitsch and shitty tastes when we are born
I hope this generation of kids will have better ideas
Lol I enjoyed your presentation
You could assume selling marijuana is illegal in Europe and you’d be right 99% of the time
For starters I'd just start with the European Parliament
I'd switch from national lists to european parties voted by everyone, essentially creating a new type of politician focused at european levels
Then the parliament can take on more roles and be the higher body of EU
The current system is very lacking with nationals voting for parties they prefer at the national level and european groups keeping around weird as fuck parties vor seats (like S&D keeping the romanian party PSD)
Essentially right now voting for a european group you like might require giving power to corrupt members and that needs to be changed
If we do that in time it's my opinion that further integration would be reached simply from inertia
Having Esperanto adopted as the official languages, although other national languages should not be supressed
Full integration and the spark of European nationalism
We should be able to rival USA and plunge into another competition, or something like a cold war but not with commies
Yes, all the way to federalization
I think it's important to prioritize infrastructure and transport (particularly the rail system), higher education (further expanding on the Bologna system and healthcare (too much variation in between healthcare cost and quality within the union rn imo), integrate all non-Schengen members and secure the outer borders, same for the Eurozone
More integration when it comes to telecommunication and media, stuff like phone contracts and data costs
That would require also a major restructuring of the EU parliament by diverting more power from individual states to it
I don't agree with alarmists who say that would lead to the end of country-specific cultural identity
>You can't tell a Spaniard and Finn that they're the same
But Spaniards and Finns are people too
Jokes aside, I think what people want is a single currency, an integrated railway, a bit more intervention from the union and stuff like that, not an elimination of culture
I would even argue that the cultures of European countries are not *that* different anyway
We all have a similar core of beliefs in the end (and I'm not talking about religion)
It's not like Spain is burning witches at the stake and Finnland has a ministry of magic
Well, you know all of your parliament members
How about a normal day-to-day person in your country
Consider that right now there's lots of countries where you just have lists (unordered ones) and people vote only for the local party that gives out european positions as rewards
This highly differs then most national elections
I'd argue this is part of the reason why they feel they are run by Brussel
Since there's no accountability feeling
Even if you're mad at a policy normal people don't know or fell they can blame an elected person or party, you now can only blame Brussel
No one feels that they could rally up with people from a neighbouring country and penalize politicians at the next elections since that's not what we're voting right now
That said, that also means no one from Europe (even if we're still talking about a co-national) has to come and convince you that he did a good job and you should vote for him again
Or campaign that at the european level he knows of your problems and you're not alone
So I think the moment we make this change people will start feeling more in power and transfer that blame to someone palpable
Someone that they might vote against or for
Exactly, that would change as a result
>Yes I am aware of who represents me in the EU parliament and I also know that they have a special interest in specific issues which may effect Sweden more than other countries
This ~~would~~  wouldn't (this is a late edit, I meant to say wouldn't) change
This would get more powerful
That's my main point
And good for you for knowing who represents you
>When I voted in the EU election I voted for the candidate who I thought would best represent my views in the EU parliament
Because the voting system isn't unified a lot of people didn't have this option
They voted for a party who had a list (maybe ordered, maybe not)
>I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but I don't think a European list is the only solution
If we managed to increase people's engagement in EU politics the current system could work fine
Just look at the article 13 situation; people in various European countries were trying to hold their own national representatives accountable
I don't see how the situation would have been different with a European list
Yes, but I asked you if you know who represents you because I was being a realist
Most people don't. And most people don't have a clue
And most people don't engage in politics (or outside community politics that directly and tangebly affect them from one day to the other)
And look at article 13, because that's exactly my point
Maybe you just happened to not have this problem but what if those pro-article 13 were from the national party you wanted to represent you
Or what if those anti-article 13 were from the national party you simply couldn't vote for
Not to mention that EU's work doesn't stop at just that law
Actually I fell that article 13 (at least in the final law) is the least of our problems
Local representives from european parties would need to explain their position everywhere to keep or win their seats at the next elections, as opposed to being eclipsed by purely local issues
Keep in mind that pure european parties doesn't mean we'd vote only for lists of unknown names
Actually I'm not even suggesting a voting system, just pure european parties and a unified (same everywhere) system
Everything else would be up for debate, hell even FPTP would make sense in the european Parliament
>Just look at the article 13 situation; people in various European countries were trying to hold their own national representatives accountable
It's weird that you feel this way since most would say there was no accountability at all
Simply put the seats changed a bit, if at all, because of that EU-wide issue
There were some protests, yes
But I don't fell or think those got really translated in votes
The main problem is that in this current manner there's absolutely no way I would want the Parliament having more powers
On the other hand the Parliament should have more power since it's absurdly week right now
So really, I can't think of any other solution
And I do believe that if day-to-day voters (outside this reddit sphere) from different countries are given the chance to collectively discuss upcoming elections and feel they have the power to change the result rather then simply wait for Merkel and Macron to state their preferences, then euroscepticism will fall and a greater sense of integration and community will be achieved
Wait
Pizza was brought into the world by magic
Yes in Romania but just a little
Same here, I think each participant tends to focus on their own part and then put it in the general aspect of the war
With a special focus on _some_ parts in countries that were part of the soviet block (behind the Iron Curtain), because why not picture history in a particular way if you can (yes, I am ironic about it)

My favorite it’s the Romanian Atheneum, a magnificent piece of Neoclassical architecture and eclecticism, inspired by the Pantheon of Rome itself
It was built with money from donation, a building that unites every Romanian
The most impressive from a engineering, architectural and scale it’s undoubtedly the Palace of Parliament, it’s not a beautiful building for many, but you can’t deny the raw manpower needed in order to built this building
Castelul Peleş, Castelul Huniazilor
google this and you will want to move here
The palace of the parliament(Bucharest)
The column of the infinity( Targu Jiu)
Kissing gate(Targu Jiu)
These are 3 of the most interesting, but the most impressive is the palace of the parliament, it's the second biggest building in the world, after the Pentagon
:))
That's Romania, a country with tradition in sculpture and architecture
:))
•Arcul de Triumf (Arch of Triumph), it has the greatest victories from Romania's history on it
It was inspired from the Paris one - another object that made the Bucharest "The Little Paris" .
•Ateneul Român - Un leu pentru ateneu
•Casa Poporului (People's House) - Made in the Cold War and finished after, it received the titles of "The second biggest building", "The Heaviest building" , "The biggest administrative building", "The most expensive house", and "One of the most important buildings (?)"
Every material what was used in the building of it was made NATIONAl - no imports
°Fun fact° It has an underground level as big as the Height of the entire building
•Coloana Infinitului (The infinte collumn), Poarta Sărutului (The Kissing Gate), Masa Tăcerii (The silence's table) - All made by Constantin Brâncuși.
•Iasi and Alba Iulia are the cities that has a lot of cultural interest
•Castelul Bran (The Bran castle)  °want some vampires
;) °
•Catelul Peleș (The Peleș castle)
Etc
There are a few contenders:
-the palace of the Parliament in Bucharest
- Peles castle
- Constanta casino (too bad for its current state)
- the wooden monstaries of Maramures (Barsana in particular)
My favorites probably have to be the Peles Castle in Sinaia, the Palace of Culture in Iasi and the Romanian Atheneum in Bucharest, tho most of the pre-communist buildings are also very beautiful
I'd say the best are the Palace Of Parliament followed by the Romainan Ateneu
None of them compare to buildings like the Sagrada familia in Barcelone though
Viena is by far the most beautiful city I ve ever been too
Architecturally speaking and taking into account all the history
Wish it wasn't so expensive to live there
We will meet again

For Romanian standards DB is abso-fucking-lutely amazing
But then again our standards are somewhat under the sea level
We don't have infrastructure to go anywhere, but we can download *aaaaaall* the movies *at once*
Funny how the Chinese government should throw accusations about not respecting human rights
Edit: a word
Hmm
stereotypical you say
Today I was poor
Oh, wait
That was yestarday too
And the day before
S#it
I am living and walking stereotype and I don't even feel bad about i!t!
I taught someone how to pirate shit lmaoo
I sometimes wear my hoodie like a cape and pretend im Dracula
Also fengs with breadsticks
Eastern European too
My parents still make shitload of schnitzels when they go on a road trip
I'm a dual citizen
I was born in Moldova to Moldovan parents so I have that
I also have "regained" Romanian citizenship, by proving that my ancestors (actually only my grandparents) were born in Romania to parents of Romanian descent and citizenship
They didn't move - the border moved when the USSR annexed Moldova in 1940, and they became citizens of the Moldovan SSR
This is the case for a big chunk of Moldova's population
I think not only allowing, but *encouraging* people to re-gain their citizenship was a fantastic move by the Romanian state
It leads to more economic collaboration, more exchange of experiences, and ultimately convinces more people on both sides that we are the same nation
Now I live in a third country and will apply for citizenship in the fullness of time, so I can have a say in the running of this place
That does not make me less Romanian, so why should I have to renounce that citizenship
I am not allowed dual citizenship in Spain and it's very very frustrating for me
Because my family and I get discriminated quite a lot when searching for jobs and even for driving lessons
Having a Spanish citizenship would just get rid of so many issues I have with employment
But, although my brother is happy to renounce the Romanian citizenship, I am not
I don't wanna give up my true identity lol even tho I think I fit well here, I don't wanna turn my back on my own land
I wish they approve of them soon
Because we came here for better opportunities
And because I think having dual citizenship is just better
If there's ever a big conflict here I could always go back to Romania, and if there's a conflict in Romania I could always return back here
Do you see what I mean
It's just more useful
And it's infuriating that my moroccan friend can have it but I can't lol
Not even my peruvian boyfriend can have dual
I don't understand how they make the decisions of which country yes and which not
Also, I want to eventually go back to Romania but I feel very out of place there between the people as I basically grew up in Spain and they're quite different
Plus the pay in Romania is awful, all of my family back home struggle a lot
And I would miss my friends from here
I don't really know anyone in Romania or have any friends left there
It's a bit scary
that's a very ignorant question
what's wrong with living in one country and caring about both ( your birth country and your current one)
if he contributes , pays his taxes , obyes spanish laws but stil has a connection with his birth country, who are you to ask such a stupid question
Because I'm romanian
And I'm not gonna ignore my real ancestry
Lol
That's like when people say why use the native tongue at home cuz if you live in a different country you must assimilate
I can feel both spaniard and romanian but I'm still romanian
My dna is romanian
My family is romanian
My childhood was romanian
My culture is romanian lol
French
French is least
I think it sounds disguisting
But Italian is beautiful
Definitely Spanish, if like to learn it one day too
is there a big difference between Danish and Swedish
wow that’s so interesting
i don’t know why but i always assumed scandinavian languages were very similar to each other
thanks
i just opened up Bergen and Vaksdal in Hordaland to compare, and the difference is incredible despite their proximity, that’s fascinating
Poland
I feel like we are very similar in many aspects, both our communities abroad are very negatively seen unfortunately and we both got a lot of shit from the Brexit campaign in the UK
Also it's arguably that got fucked the most in recent European history, so it annoys me when the West talks shit about them
Serbia
I like them
They sure did mistakes, but this doesn't make them all a genocidal nation or whatever crap I read here about them
Hungary
We may have issues, but this doesn't mean I don't like Hungary and Hungarian people
Only we can call them names, you are not allowed to :P
Stay away from Serbia, or I'll cut you
Leave Poland alone T.T. Poland went through enough shit, they deserve some rest
Hungary
Only we can make fun of Hungary
Moldavia
Moldavia is our little brother, you mess with Moldavia, you mess with us
Moldova, they our bros, literally
Britain + every Balkan country
Thank you mate
D'awww
We respect you, but we don't really mean it when we talk shit about Hungary, unless it's football
“How do I explain to my non-balkan friends that my mom calls me “mom”?”
My parents used to call me "pui" or "puiuț", which literally means baby chick (or its diminutive)
Nuca, from Dienuca (nickname for Diana) and it literally translates to "walnut".
The male version of my name
I have a brother and he was called by the female version of his name
My parents thought they were hilarious
Other than that my mom calls me "guriță" sometimes, which means "little mouth". It's a regional thing, I guess, because my grandma called her that too
People tend to get confused when I tell them that my father calls me, a girl, "dad"
I believe it's a thing in some Spanish speaking countries as well
Edit: not sure about Spain, but I think Mexicans and other Latin Americans call their children "mami/papi" as a term of endearment
They never called me that but I am aware of the concept :)
>my mother would call me "müsli"
For a second there I thought your mother calls you cereal
Parents would literally call the kids their own “title” as a term of endearment
“Hai, mai, mama” = “C mon mom” trying to make you do something
Weird but it works
We brothers are too headstrong to call anybody our older brother, regardless of age
It’s either ‘younger brother’ or ‘brother’ in my experience
The Romanian course teaches you amazing sentances about our country such as "We live in a monarchy".
We haven't had a king since 1947
I used it for German and French
For German it's good for practicing and learning words
But it's crap at teaching you rules and exceptions to the rules
For French it's structured waaaaay better
It explains the rules several times
It has these exercises where you're supposed to repeat a rule over and over
So you can actually learn French grammar, but it's crap at teaching you how to pronounce stuff
For Romanian , it is awful  , they teach Romanian but you see there is a diference betwen the romanians they learn you on duolingo and accuall romanian , for example that romanian is so wierd that when i heard it on my new classmate who was from bucharest , we all laught at his funny romanian
Tbf, duolingo was better at teaching me German than the A2 course I got from the university (it was taught by a person that just finished studying pedagogy)
But you're right that it's not gonna get you very far
Pharmaceutical ads and gambling ads . They banned Cigarette ads so thats a start
The drugs commercials which have the following template:” have you ever felt like
you might have a .... deficit
The following drug doesn’t require a prescription “   . Also alcohol
diesel cars under euro 5
I second this
Especially for politicians
Well it is in the administration
Is it legal to litter in Luxembourg
Bribes with extra steps
I almost got fined for sitting on a bench right next to the rookzone
And they explained that there is a designated square around that pole and you cannot be outside of it (the square wasn't marked)
So some stations do enforce that rule
They should enforce it more strictly tho
I think that guy let me go just because i was still close to that pole
But if I were far away, I'm pretty sure I would've gotten a fine
And I should be getting fined for not following a simple rule like that
I mean, it's not that hard to move to a designated zone, as the smoke bothers a lot of people
And it also keeps the rest of the platform clean
I really don't understand why smokers wouldn't follow such a simple rule
Well, in there are stories here in Braşov, Braşov (Brassó/Corona/Oraşul Stalin/Kronstadt), Transilvanya that there lives A Dragon in the "Tâmpa" mountain
I don't think there are people who still refer to Braşov as Oraşul Stalin
In my area at least, idk how wide spread they are in Romania
Some female ghosts, usually bride souls, but depending on the persons you ask it can be any unmarried girl spirit known to dance around in the fields/around wells for some reason around midnight and up to like 2-3 am and if they see you passing by you are fucked (also, a funny story, there was this thing that if you step in their hora any part of you that entered will be cut off instantly which is completely contradictory to the rest of the legend and yeah
) these ghosts are usually called iele
Dunno, but it got stuck in my head since 2018 when I was part of a partnering between my school and the museum I  the town's square about it
Today I learned that nordic countries bring their own drinks to parties and consider it rude to drink without previously asking
I'm still  processing this information
I can't even imagine
This seems fair and common sense to me :)
Now I am even more confused
Have you tried them in different countries
They taste different
Same brand
Different taste
Due to water characteristics
In Romania I can easly make the difference but in Germany for example I have no idea which is which
Next time try coke too
You will spot the difference immediately
Here, for example, it is very sprinkling- to the point you cry :)) I was discussing this with a friend from Italy and he said that it is because of our natural sprinkling waters
They are very sprinkling and we are used to them
If any beverage manufacturer would make less sprinkling drinks, we wouldn't buy them
Seems right if I think about it - none of my friends (including me) like the light sprinkling waters and you barely can find them in supermarkets
Same with sugar addings
They are different
And then the water pH which changes the taste in each factory
Same here
But I got to point where I literally tell them what to buy because most parties are at my house and they are not guests anymore
They are family
And they must wash dishes also or we move the parties somewhere else :)))
Thank you
<3 It's always nice to hear people liked it
Just like any other country it has it's good and bad parts but overall we really like meeting new people and socialize with them
Hope your staying was nice and you had time to visit a little bit :)
Romania has the neutral gender which behaves like masculine when singular and like feminine for plural
We feel the vibes most of the time, by realizing what plural form makes more sense but they are some words that can have both forms depending on the meaning and that's confusing, e.g: viruși (plural for computer virus) and virusuri (plural for viruses like covid)
The singular form is virus for both
I would say 99% of the time I would be capable to guess the gender for a noun I have never heard before
The reason is that genders in Romanian are defined by the way we count the noun
For example, we use one bed, two beds to determine the gender of bed
In that regard we have 3 options
Un - doi : if you count the noun like this then it has a male gender
Una - două: female gender
Un - două: neutral
O - doi: doesn't exist
The only exception would be proper noun, especially foreign ones
Those are mostly figured out by trying to count them in your head and figure out wha sounds most Romanian
In Romanian, the definite article (in English: "the") modifies the word
For example:
bath - baie
the bath - baia
pencil - creion
the pencil - creionul
The indefinite article (in English: "a" or "an") is added before the word and it depends on the gender of the word:
a bath - o baie
a pencil - un creion
When getting accustomed to the langauge, it's easy to tell the gender of the word by the way it sounds (using the indefinite article just sounds bad to someone used to hearing the language)
For the definite article form, you essentially learn it at the same time as you learn the base word
While it is somewhat regular depending on gender, it's not regular enough to be a rule
Well i guess this is one of the hardest traits of romanian language
Because we have suffixes for changing the meaning (case, number,article) (so instead of the forest we say forestthe ,one word) .But sometimes the predefined suffix doesnt sound properly and and then we change the root sometimes dramatically and this can be tough . Also we kind of feel the gender and such things but not always and some words have been used with the wrong articles so many times now both the former wrong and the correct form are correct
Also i can't say i studied a lot of french but from my limited experience i can sense in most of the cases the gender there despite not actually studying them .
It's funny when Hungarians speak Romanian
They don't have gender in their language so they mostly guess at random
It makes for very funny constructions, that no other group manages to make
O - doi definitely exist
Have you ever been to Harghita
We don't feel the gender, there is clear rule
We count the object (one objects, two objects) if both singular and plural sound masculine, it's masculine, masculine singular with feminine plural you get neutral gender and feminine is feminine sounding for both
As someone who learned German along with my native language, das Nutella sounds horrible
Either die, or just add a noun to the name which has an undisputed article like nutella jar or nutella spread
the feel part is what you say sound masculine or feminine
It's clear if you decide the gender when counting there is nothing to debate over but that implies you decided .This step of deciding how to actually count is the step im talking about .
&#x200B;
I see here a debate over Nutella gender in Germany .For me Nutella can't be in any way nothing but feminine
But apparently in other languages i can be neuter .And so what we might consider clear gender for us in reality it's not because there is no axiomatic rule to enforce that gender , its just the way it is .Ofc there are words like "boy" or "girl" where gender is self-understood but not everything in the world has a in-built gender .So there the languages decide how it will deal with it . You can consider "mapa" plural to be "mapi "(which is wrong , its "mape") but the sound alike "lampa" have the plural "lămpi"(also to be noted how the a changes into an  "ă" ) (instead of "lampe", which would be the natural plural form considering the sounding alike mapa situation)
The romanian language would have been very fine if the correct plural form of those words would be the opposite
Lămpi should seriously be changed to lampe, it makes so much more sense
We didn't, but nutella is not neutral
It's either a name or feminine
Very similar in Romanian
O pula -> feminine
O pizda -> feminine
Un penis -> masculine
Un vagin -> masculine
Huh, the "scientific" names are masculine while the slang is feminine
Weird
Un lămpi, doi lämps
My region has the same one ..knife-wielding drunks . I know the felling
>that we’re all ugly
Funny how the country with the ugly stereotype has some of the most beautiful celebrities
>But then sometimes I come back from a holiday on the continent, look around at us and think, fuck me, we are a sorry looking bunch
Lol, I think the same thing when I go back home
I think this is mostly because you/I got used to the typical look from home and anything else seems like a breath of fresh air
'' Malakas
'' I just like how it rings how I like to say it
I never heard of this one
Nah, when I return home I think exactly the opposite
"Finally normal looking people
>Jesus christ on a stick
That's probably a porn title
And In Romania it's Transylvanians
Only short sleeves without anything else
Then probably 24 degree C.
For me T shirt is like at least 23°C. If its between 15-23 it's more of a t shirt and light jacket, or a light sweater /sweatshirt
When we go up to like 29, 30 and over its just "wish I could remove my skin" weather
17-18C if it’s not windy, which drops the perceived temperature
But like the others said, 20C is a decent  baseline
For Romania it would probably be Dragnea getting jailed and recently the Dăncilă goverment falling
Hopefully this will bring a brighter future for Romania
Stayed as shitty as it was
how the introduction of the € was like
I'm curious
we still dont have €
I wish we could get rid of romanian Ron/leu so we can get euro because
> not have to bother with exchanging currency
and other things I can't think of lol
so bigger salaries
lol

Decebal and Burebista were Dacian soldiers who fought heroically the Roman during the Dacian-Roman wars
I'd say Mihai Viteazu (Michael the Brave); he was the first to unite the Romanian principalities in 1600, but only briefly unfortunately because he was assasinated
What about Charles XII a.k.a. Carolus Rex
You forgot about Regina Maria
What about Joan Huniady (John of Hunedoara)
Actually they were Dacian kings and only Decebalus fought in the Dacian-Roman wars
Burebista fought the Celts and expanded the territory of Dacia
However,he did send troops to aid Pompey so he technically fought against Romans
My father actively took part in 1989 Romanian revolution, he knew how to handle a rifle so he was called to the warehouse he used to work at and was given a rifle (defend it from rioters and looters), he ended up not having to fire a single shot
My grandfather from my father's side fought in WW2 and was captured by the russians, was sent to a prison in siberia
A few years after the war he was released and came home
A great grandfather fought in WW1, but I don't know much about him other than that
My grandparents were kinda during WWII and my mom grew up in the communist era
Both my parents and my aunt took part in the 1989 Romanian revolution and my mom almost got killed there in fact, they shot dead a man that was protesting right next to her, could’ve been her
How can you drown while doing laundry
We still do somewhat
Even our national anthem acknowledges this lmao
Acum ori niciodată să dăm dovezi la lume
Că-n aste mâni mai curge un sânge de roman,
Şi că-n a noastre piepturi păstrăm cu fală-un nume
Triumfător în lupte, un nume de Traian
Now or never we will prove to the world
That in these hands, Roman blood still flows
And that in our chests we proudly keep a name
Triumphant in battles, a name of Trajan
Wanna a hug
Also we did called our country Romania
I mean yeah, but that just comes from the people inhabiting this land calling themselves 'rumâni' or a variation thereof, not necessarily claiming themselves to be successors of the Roman empire
Me too buddy
We didn't claim anything
It just is a fact
Our language might've originally developed from a vulgar Latin dialect, but that doesn't make us anything more than a romance speaking people, definitely not successors to the Roman Empire
We are roman successors as much as any latin nation+greece
> definitely not successors to the Roman Empire
Why not
Continue your train of though please
Looking at some traditional practices I can say for certain that whoever Trajan brought into Dacia to colonise the region was a very romanised citizen
One example is how we sacrifice and eat pigs for Christmas, similar to the roman Saturnalia
Were the romans all true latins coming from the italian peninsula
Not all of them
My theory is that we're a mix of Latins, roman citizens coming from around the empire, Dacians and whatever else happened to be around here
Cashiers having chairs to sit on while at the register
How can they force someone to stand like that for hours on end
It does not improve their ability to do their job in any way, it's just a cultural thing that ruins peoples health for no reason, especially if they are older, overweight or have preexisting health conditions
Even if you're healthy, do it long anough and your knees will eventually get busted
LIDL, this thing is on my list of the greatest invention of humanity
Wait
That's illegal

almost everyone i know (me included) speaks at least 3 languages (romanian, english and german or french) and sometimes they also speak hungarian
i always thought that americans are so lucky that they don’t need to speak other languages, but now i realize that it’s a blessing and a curse
Never disrespect Kaufland again
There aren't any
Wait
That's illegal

We used to have (I think it still is published) a comic called "Mickey Mouse," full with the Disney cast (Mickey and friends, Donald and family, and the extended cast around them)
This was right after '89 when communism fell
I was a kid then, I was 6
Well, This comic usually had a few stories in it
Mickey was always a do-gooder, he was the detective, and he had Goofy with him, and Minnie, and stuff like that
Donald was a different story
He had his nephews with him, or he had Uncle Scrooge, or Gyro, or there were the Beagle Brothers he had to deal with
There was that witch that always wanted Uncle Scrooge's first coin
And then, Donald was a pilot, he was a sailor, he was an explorer, he went on adventures, he explored jungles, pyramids, deserts, caves
Donald had flaws, he was funny, he was angry, he was happy, Donald had character
I always read Mickey's stories because they were always the first in the comic book, but Donald was what I was after
I had hundreds of those comics
Donald was very popular among my friends, and we used to laugh at his stories, he was our favorite
Thatsthejoke

We don’t have Aldi here so I can’t tell the difference
LIDL and Kaufland are really popular here, I think I have like 5 LIDLs and 2 Kauflands in an area of about 1 km radius from me
Also, for whatever reason, many times Kaufland and LIDL are being build very close to one another
We only have LIDL and Kaufland
It’s actually called Xenophobia
Could be our regions have received different stories
Mickey was always a detective, Goofy was his sidekick, and Mickey was always the hero
With Donald you had no idea what to expect
He always changed jobs, he always changed scenery, he was involved in varied adventures, had a wider array of cast members around him
And Donald was not the main character in all these stories, sometimes it was only his nephews doing boy scout things, other times his Uncle Scrooge doing things, other times that cousin of his who was always lucky no matter what, or it was a story with the witch, or a story with the Beagle Brothers, or a Gyro the inventor story, or something
Donald was far more interesting
This reminds me,  bagging your groceries by yourself is also a thing in europe, you can use your own bag and place things in them the way you like it
Too much self deprecation in my opinion
Sure, you are far from being the best anymore, but trust me, a guy from Poland has no place telling you that
Only the top Europe countries can compete with the U.S still
It’s a lot worse, but still a lot better than most of the world
There are some huge issues that desperately need solving there, — healthcare, education, college debt, public safety — but I believe you will be able to solve them in time
Same here
The instructors are very persistant in convincing you to learn to drive the manual ones so that you are not limited after getting your driving licence
They convinced me and passed the exam last year on the manual one
Damn it was hard in the Bucharest traffic
At 12 in the afternoon when everybody swears and screams
One guy pulled his car next to mine and screamed at the police guy: *"don't give her the driving licence
"*. I wanted to scream back but I had a camera recording the exam so I just smiled back at that asshole with a smile saying *"yeah
Fuck you too
"* :))
In Romania we say "smoching"(pronounced like smoking) to tuxedo
Taxi drivers
Never, but NEVER use Bucharest' taxi
They charge almost 15 euros per km (idk for sure since I don't live in Bucharest but I heard the prices are big)
Romanian taxies are super expensive if they hear you speacking english
I have a relative wich asced a taxi the price and he wanted to take triple the money
Not really a scam, but here people should be cautious with the personal belongings that can be sold to pawn shops
If an area has a lot of pawn shops, you know you have to be extra careful and keep your phone close
Some start to negociate the price before you tell them where you need to go
In Romania too
In romania they'll say,, Is (ammount) okay
,, . Usually it's overpriced and they don't get the taximeter started
* Outdated
* Too much focus on memory
* Religious indoctrination
* Propagandistic history
* Writers worshipped like a pantheon of Gods
* Too much focus on western history and little to no lesson about the eastern european countries (I mean,come one
We learn about the American independence,English civil war and French Revolution but (next to) nothing about the PLC,Kievan Rus,Kingdom of Hungary or the Bulgarian and Serbian empires whitch were at our doorstep
I've seen this over a long period of time so I have my personal arguments, not nit-picking
I have the age to know enough to argue
- The educational system since the 90s has gradually degraded because of copying other systems from other countries
This is because of the lack of responsibility of those tasked of it
Academic professors (yeah, them) have given up to design the curriculum and relied on copying from other systems
Ever since the early-middle 2000s, no matter the minister for education (honestly, I cannot blame the position in itself, since it's a managerial at best & filled with some political interests at worst with political motivations), the solution has remained to copy what he see/hear from other countries
The situation was made worse now that parents think they know best what their kids *must and mustn't learn* and relied on typical thought-terminating cliches like ”Look at that country, let's copy its education scheme & structure” and so on
Former class idiots, seeing themselves with some money in their pocket & with their own family, now they want to have their stupid vengeful attempt at reformation (due to their mustered frustration against schooling in general) by advocating *the same thing it had happened since the early 2000s* without paying a dime (as if serious schooling structure rebuild-up is free or cheap)
They think buying school requisites is too much, when they simply forget we never were a wealthy country to begin with, to have what we perceive that Western Europe has
*Tough shit, pops n' moms; it is how it is*.
Add the Bologna system, where it did wrecked the university structure for some fields, and here we are
If there's a fuck-up, all those responsible for education point their fingers at: (1) the scheme they've copied from other countries (therefore, blame those countries' system) and (2) the Bologna system
”We can't do nothing, it's how it is
School textbooks aren't concise anymore because dipshit parents worry about ”hardships” for their kid learning (learning
school is not a disco
), they've dumbed some of the school textbooks and now some are given ”complementary exercise textbooks”, where they apparently complete tasks & exercises in tandem with what they learn theory from the textbook
What's worse is that some teachers (gymnasium-high school) are offered deals to buy *certain* test problems/exercises textbooks -- for example, in mathematics, because the problem in the regular textbooks are either too weak or not enough with exercises for kids to continuously solve math problems & in-print the theorems (and how to apply them) in their brains
A lot of these textbooks with test problems are hit and miss
If you have a weak teacher, then good luck passing the national tests in gymnasium or high school
And don't get me started on tutoring
Tutoring existed under communism, where you'd go at your teacher to cram you with problems (real sciences or literature-grammar, or physics, or chemistry; it depended where your weak weak link was)
- No more dropouts
In order to keep the general PR happy (”At school X, there have been n dropouts, therefore the teachers are baaaad
”), you rarely ever hear(d) of gymnasium and high school expels + the steady dissipation of vocation schools
Remember that I mentioned about former class idiots, that see themselves with some money in their pocket & think they know better what the system needs
Well, *they*'re the drop-outs that should've been
And they're arrogant
There's no fear of wrecking your life if you don't take school serious
It isn't a secret that vocational/trade schools are meant for dumber kids that simply can't keep up & are given a second chance to re-orientate their calling in life
- Double-edged literature
The *first problem* is that kids don't read as they once did
They don't want to read literature
They're adverse in enriching their own vocabulary, yet they have no problem memorizing every stupid temporal gimmick
So, now they rely on literature criticism
They memorize literature criticism without reading their compulsory works of literature that they must
The *second problem* comes from the testing system itself, at least in high school
This isn't controversial but it's up for debate
Every literature teacher knows that, besides needing to read their compulsory list of books, pupils must also frame their commentaries, analyzation in such a way that resembles that of a literary critic
Not in gymnasium, but in high school a pupil is expected of them to know by 11th-12th grade how to argue about a short story, a poem, or a novel
Doesn't matter, you're a grown up, you must know how to argue of & about it
This creates a problem of arbitrariness because, after all, the Baccalaureate (in regards to literature; history, logic, philosophy, sociology, economics, psychology) are marked by a ”committee” of 3 (maybe 4, 5) of high school teachers ( (*not yours*, just to be clear)
So, it's a die in a cast under Damocles' sword how your test will be marked, how much the committee likes the way you've written, how you've written, and how much (in regards to details) you've written
Kids these days being distracted by phones and don't paying attention to the teacher
And also highjacking the class cuz they get bored
And then complaining that the school is not ok for them but they won't even try
Yeah
Sorry to break it to you: it's not your teacher .. it's you
Disclaimer: 27 electronics engineer
When I felt that the school failed my expectations I just started learning all by myself
No drama
Take what you can, never give back
We have schoolbooks as old as 1999, that we still use
Including a geography textbook with Yugoslavia in it and a TIC (Technologies of Information and Comunication) textbook from 2006 which is needless to say not very useful
Now, i know they are trying to write new textbooks but they aren't as good as the old ones, so it isn't helping that much
For example, we have a brand new P.E book, which i dont know if it is something normal or not
It's definetly a bit weird
The way the information is shoved into you
The lack of modernization, I mean we have projectors in most classes but they are used when the teacher is lazy and doesn't wanna write and we present our projects
I don't know if this counts but the lack of AC in the classrooms is horrible
Imagine 25-30 people sweating at 35 C while trying to learn something
We have a lot of useless subjects
For example Latin
We have Latin once a week just in eight grade
You'll never do it again
Also we have books that are ten years old but our curriculum is new
very good my comrade
i couldn’t have said it better, my tovarăș
same can be said for romania
Yes we had a whole lesson about Roman society,administration,warfare,traditions etc
We also studied other ancient civilisations like Persia,Egypt and Greece
> Why do you learn about the English civil war
In 4th grade, they start to learn history
It's about the country in a very dim-touched set of lessons, given the grade and age period
*We'll ignore this one
In 5th grade, they learn universal history, starting from antiquity
*Nothing too deep, just enough to tackle the subject, from an internationalist/cosmopolitan view
In 6th grade, they teach from late antiquity to middle-late medieval period (maybe a bit after that) in Europe
*Again, nothing deep, still internationalist/cosmopolitan view, just enough to touch that ”Here, in 1xxx, things went like this” sort of way
In 7th grade, they learn about Europe & the Americas from late-medieval period onwards
This is where the lessons about statehood, philosophy, economics, reforms, revolutions, technological advancements, conflicts, wars etc
are presented
*A-gain, still from a internationalist-cosmopolitan view, nothing in-depth, just the popular generalised events, occurrences, and so on, like your civil war
In 8th grade, they learn about the country's history
Obviously, far more in-depth than in 4th grade, but still a generalised way
Grades 9th-to-11th are the *groundhog day* grades from 5th to 7th, although with more details & in-depth approach
12th grade tackles the country with a lot details than (obviously) 4th and 8th grade
>Why do you learn about the English civil war
Different reasons
If I were to guess:
- The idea of republicanism, parliamentarism, democracy that were starting to appear *before* the Enlightenment Age
- Why Britain was far ahead from other European nations and why it became an empire, why it developed faster than the rest of Europe
- The problems of [absolute] monarchism, religious zealotry/fundamentalism, social struggle & mobility, game theory, political philosophy, state-building, nation-building, genuine progressiveness
- Understanding the contemporary English/British social fabric and the legacy that the civil war left behind
Since we were never a powerhouse of our own and always were a lump on the map, Romanian education (in regards to history & other fields, even literature) is pro-internationalist/cosmopolitan than national
It's understandable
I personally attended english-bilingual classes so those things are included as a separate class
In high-school you learn 3 years of general history and one year romanian history
At least that's the way it worked up untill i graduated (2018)
What I mean is stupid nationalistic myths such as:
> Dacians where just minding their own buissiness and the Romans attacked them just to steal their gold
When in reality the Dacians started it by attacking the province of Moesia and killing it's governor
> We were the shield of Europe and we saved it from Ottoman expansions
No we didn't! We simply defended ourselves
We were not on some kind of crusade against Ottomans
> The Romanian principalities where friends and never fought each other
Actually the fought each other plenty of times
But it is always brushed under the rug or twisted in some form
Like: "Ruler of principality X was an Ottoman/Hungarian/Polish puppet and the Ruler of principality Y invaded principality X in order to return the rightful ruler on the throne and free principality X from Ottoman/Hungarian/Polish opression". Or in a more famous case when Stephen the Great of Moldavia invaded Wallachia with Ottoman support in order to take the port of Kilia back from his cousin Vlad
Whitch is often twisted as "Stephen pretending to attack Vlad in order to confuse the enemy" or "Stephen coming to save Kilia from Ottoman hands".
> Our medieval rulers were brave patriots who fought for their people and Michael the Brave was the biggest patriot because he united the Romanian provinces into a single state thus fullfilling the national ideal of the Romanian people
There was no such thing as nationalism or patriotism back then
These rulers only fought as self defense and Michael the Brave united the provinces out of oportunism
> Constantin Brâncoveanu was killed because he refused to convert to Islam
Actually he was killed for threason
The Sultan offered to pardon him if he converted to Islam whitch he refused
> Romanian army fought for it's brothers who suffered under Austro-Hungarian opression
Actually many of the soldiers at the time were peasants and they didn't care about the Transylvanian Romanians
The only reason they enlisted in the army is because they were promised more land if the take Transylvania
> Romanian army was super badass in WW1 and beat the crap out of it's enemies
When in reality our army was shit and we were pushed back when the German troops arrived
And even if we won some battles after the French came to train us we were still pushed back and almost turned into a German puppet
> The Interwar era was a paradise
While it is often romanticized a lot
The interwar era was not that great
* Corruption was still a problem
* Elections where not really fair
* Protests where violently surpressed
* Working conditions where shit
* And women didn't enjoy the same rights they do today
> We were always the good guys who did no wrong
Actually there is a lot of shit that isn't covered in history class
Such as
* The despotic nature of our rulers
* The Gypsy slaves
* The Hungarians massacred by Avram Iancu and the Transylvanian Romanian rebels
* Our involvement in the holocaust
* And the war crimes done during WW2
But our history is always treated as if we were always in the right and everyone we fought against is always in the wrong
That's what I mean by "propagandistic history"
>we had a whole lesson about Roman society,administration,warfare,traditions etc
Only a lesson
More like 3 months in 5th grade and 3 months in 9th grade
Well it took a few days in 5th grade but we didn't learn that much about Rome in high school
I really liked flammekeuches when I was in France
Praise Alsace
When i went to France i had the opportunity to taste sweet bread
It was weird bit glad I tasted it lol
Georgian food was a cool surprise for me too
Our boss took us out for lunch, and we got a series of dips/spreads as appetizers and were told they were Georgian
I absolutely loved one of them which I then learned was made with eggplant, I was surprised because I normally hate and avoid eggplant
Unfortunately I don't know its name :(
Mom, can we get mititei
No, we have mititei at home
Mititei at home:
> ćevapi
You have just started a gang war
Be it what it may, in France I was told it's alsacian
Either way, it's delicious
Well I wasn't in Alsace I was in Lyon and no, I haven't tried any wines actually while I was there unfortunately
I had some tigersbrock beer or something like that with it and it was quite enjoyable
Hmm it looked different from Baba ganoush, If I recall correctly it was [the white one on the top right] (they were all delicious tho <3)
Probably the flag from the communist period:
Out flag with the communist coat of arms, because obvious reasons
On the opposite, the flag with a hole in the middle is used as a symbol of revolution nowadays
Definitely the communist flag
However, most of them [had a hole cut in the middle of it] durin the 1989 Revolution
Or the Iron Guard flag is hated as well idk
Hop-hop, two teams, one team seeks, one team hides and runs
The runners would scream hop-hop so the other team would know when to start searching
You have to touch the runners, but some kids would make a cross or 3 on the runner's back
We have break the line as well but called "Țară Țară Vrem Ostași" (Country Country We Want Soldiers) rounds would start saying this then a line picks the one they want the other to send crashing into them
If the line breaks he gets to take an "enemy" to his team but if the line holds the crasher gets coopted
There also was Așchie (Splinter); everyone stood in a circle, a leg outstretched, then after a count of 2 to 3, everyone says Așchie
The first who got the word in then had to step on someone else's foot
If he stepped, he continued
If he missed (you could dodge) the one who dodged attacked next
Then 1,2,3 la perete stop (1,2,3, at the wall, stop); all except one lined up and had to touch a wall
But one had to stay near the wall, facing it, then say the phrase and turn around
If you were running and got caught moving you were eliminated, if not you could continue running when the wall guy started
If you reached the wall you stood next
Nu prea imi vine o fraza in minte, dar multumesc ca esti interesat / interesata de limba mea
And he/she is like: Cool
what does it mean
"I don't have a phrase in mind, but thank you for being interested in my language"
"Oh"
"Sounds like italian, can you understand italian
I usually complain for a bit about them asking me to do that
In my language so we both can get what we want
Láttam egy szamárt a dzsungelben, de a kurva oroszlán megette
(hungarian)
In english that would mean: i saw a donkey in the jungle but that bitch of a lion ate it
That's if you translate it mot-a-mot
Ro:"Pisicuțăăă"
Hu:"A dög rágná ki a beledet te tetves"
Huh
I usually use the good ol' "Sugi pula"
On the right side of the screen, you see a panel called "community settings" and there's your username
Click on the crayon icon to add your flag
Nu prea imi vine doesn't have a translation in italian as far as I know, maybe "niente nella mia mente" if you adapt the whole phrase
Edit: Niente nella mia mente, grazie per essere interessato della mia lingua
Something like that
I tried that and once i got a "is that an invitation
Considering this is Europe the better question would have been "Is there any other nation your nation **doesn't** have grievances with
And if yes how many hundred kilometers away from your current border is it
Hungary
Ever since the middle ages the Hungarian Empire Moldavia and Wallachia (and sometimes Transylvania) have been feuding
In the first world war the Austro-Hungarian Empire was the Kingdom of Romania's enemy
Afterwards, in 1919 there was the Hungarian-Romanian war in which Hungary tried to get Transylvania back
In the second world war Hungary took northern Transylvania with the approval of Hitler
Relations have improved however in recent years
At this point its not just “grievance” its just hatred
It doesn't make sense to get a territory containing 70% Romanians and only 17% Hungarians
And my opinion is that they have plenty of rights there
They get to attend their own schools and study everything in Hungarian
Someone born there can easily make it through life without speaking Romanian at all if he doesn't leave the region
Which is frustrating for a Romanian visiting the region, as I discovered myself a few years back when I couldn't speak Romanian with anybody in the middle of my own country
We also have Piticot (rough translation is: Dwarf) in Romania
I used to play it as a kid
You can play it for free here:
There's also a game called "Moara" (The Mill), which is played by creating lines of three stones on lines
[Rummy]
it's a very competitive game
my parents were always playing it in high school
i also played it and i loved it:)))
Oradea
It's like the 9th or 8th largest city in Romania
It's well known here for having actually good administration
It's also the safest city in Romania, happiest people and many more
Ah this reminds me of when I had to explain to a middle eastern taxi driver in the UK that Bucharest and Budapest are different places
Trip to the airport turned geopolitics lesson
Turin was a big meme here a few years back
It's Bucharest for sure
[here] you can see an image from 2011
Is Bucharest, I can see my neighborhood’s circular shape
I somehow knew it would be Bucharest when I clicked this thread
This city always surprises people
Bucharest, for sure, I can see my neighborhood'
Never thought my city looks so good from the sky
Yup it's Bucharest
Zoom in on the center and you see the Constitution Square, and the big chunk of darkness next to if must be the Parliament Building
Bucuresteni are entering the chat
I live in it :) It is of course Bucharest :)
Hei, I can see my apartment

That we are somewhat racist
We are somewhat racist towards a certain minority
That we accept racism to a certain community
So true, when temps get too high ..it's like a spider web set on your brain . I hate summer with a passion
How can that be
I suppose you would get separated from most (or all) school colleagues and meet new
Do you knowingly restraint yourselves as not to make new friends
Will you remain at 'acquaintance' stage for the rest of your lives
I met the latest guy I like and I almost call friend about three years ago
Mate, if you have some cash I can help you with your problem
So true ..it's so engraved into our society that I don't think we'll ever get over it . "A furat dar macar a facut ceva" mentality
And sometimes a bit loud
Maybe
I noticed it in Hungary too, against the same people
Ditto
Spanish, right
I find this fascinating
In my area they dismantled a good part of a freaking railway
It made the trains squeeze up the remaining one and made commuting 50km from 2h to 4h-6h via train for a year
I used to live near the railway and saw them casually carrying the metal on a Sunday
It was infuriating that the police didn't do a thing when they came
They acknowledged the missing rail parts and said it was probably them
Then they went home
You can try to count, then Carol II takes the throne and everything goes screwy
Fascists and communism and all
squirrel is "veveriță"
V-E-V-E-R-I-T-S-A
Ts is actually ț but none here would understand
Veveriță in romanian
From the (old) Slavic *vĕverica*, which comes from proto-Slavic *veverъka* <inevitably from Proto-Indo-European *wer-*. I give Aromanian *viviritsã*, neo-Greek βερβερίτσα (ververítsa)
Related to Latin *viverra*.
I think it means it's full of life
Viva - life
Blindly supporting Israel in whatever shit they decide to do
We even tried to follow the US model and move our embassy to Jerusalem
I think we support Israel for religious reasons and jesssuuusssss
But it's still pretty dumb
Elaborate on 4
Religious reasons, not wanting to seem anti-Semitic, trying to wash away our previous sins with the Jews, many reasons in fact
Not only that
Many jews in Israel came from Romania, we had a pretty high jewish population pre ww2
In a smaller dose, maybe
With Romanians being kind of islamophobes due to Ottoman history, Israel is still supported by many
There is a simple saying "If you want a 5 at the Bacalaureat, go to school, if you want a 10, go to privtae tutors"
yeah in highschool almost everyone does private lessons on exam subjects, it's this way because a lot of teachers don't give a shit about actually helping students learn about the subject and only superficially cover the main points in class so that later more students will seek to pay private lessons with the same teachers ..it's a mess and you need to be pretty motivated to learn everything by yourself, but that can definitely be done too
It's common to get some tutoring for the most important subjects for university exams
It's not that common for any other period
Almost every kid in my class went to private tuitions
Its honestly insane
The teachers are partially to blame for it, but it's mostly because the education system sucks ass
Not a very big thing here
Some kids get private tutoring before their Bacalaureate exam
I did too because I was a mess in one of the subjects and I would've failed
Some kids also get tutoring before applying for university but that's not SUPER common either
Most families can't properly afford it
Eh, if you choose the easy path in high school (filologie/sociologie) it's impossible not to get a 7 imo
Its still kinda fucked up that you almost have to pay to get good results at the exam, shouldnt regular school be enough
Its sad that people think this shit(justified)
I mean, I dont think that high grades should be easy to get
In my classroom, 12 got over a 9 in the exam, and only 3 did private lessons
I never really studied anything in school, only started reading essays a week before the exam and I still got over 8
It's really not that hard
But I do agree that the system sucks
Things might be different for those who choose maths/chemistry in high school, it's easier to get bad grades there
Well I am more of a Maths and science person, so it may be harder at mate/info or SN, where I want to go
Most places that sells them are also keeping them in a refrigerated shelf here
But now that you mentioned it I do remember my grandparents, who owned chickens not keeping their fresh eggs in a fridge
I always put them in the fridge, I don’t know anyone that does otherwise
*Papanași*: [Fried] vs [Boiled] There is only one right answer
^^^boiled
Also non-Transylvanians apparently fight over *Mucenici*. There are 2 versions: [soup] (in the south) vs
[cake/brioche] (in Moldavia)
It definitely has to be [Dragostea din tei] (or as everyone outside Romania knows it, **the Numa Numa song**)
edit: apparently a lot of foreigners know it by the original title haha that's actually great given that it's in Romanian
I'd also add [Dacă ploaia s-ar opri] and [Trăiască berea]
Seeing you're from Portugal I have to say that [this song] went viral in Romania because it's very fucked up
And I think we are the also reason why the comments were disabled :))
Haha yes that's the official title
Numa numa doesn't even make sense, it's just how a lot of foreigners understood the lyrics "Vrei să pleci, dar **nu mă, nu mă iei**"
A rough translation would be "You wanna leave but **you won't take me, take me** with you"
Not really, it's more complex than that:
"nu" means "no", or anything negative (let's say when using the negative form of a verb - not, will not etc
while "mă" is a reflexive pronoun, 1st person singular (more or less like "me", as in "take me")
That being said, "nu mă" would literally be "**not/don't/won't** (take) **me** - the verb (conjugated form) is "iei" in this lyric: nu mă, nu mă iei (from the infinitive form "a lua" - "to take")
So, you can only intelligibly translate the whole lyric "nu mă, nu mă iei" as "you won't take me, take me" (or something of this sort), but not only the "nu mă, nu mă"/"Numa numa" part
Maybe you didn't want so many details but it was fun to write haha
Hope this Romanian 101 was clear enough
More like, "you won't, you won't"
Its hard to give an exact translation in English but "**nu mă"**  roughly means "you won't"
Basically anywhere in romania is by train
Also Budapest and maybe Sofia can go by train, anything further is plan
I usually search for both options, and pick whichever has the best price/duration balance
I do prefer trains because I like looking out of the window hahah
But if the trip takes like half a day by train (or, in any case, way more than driving to/from the airport, waiting for check-in, security blah blah and the flight duration itself) I'll definitely switch to flying
However if the starting point is Romania, I'll definitely pick flying
For example Bucharest to Budapest is like 16 hours by train and it's not much cheaper than a plane ticket either
When I lived in Romania, I took the train inside the country, bus/car to the nearby countries and plane to everywhere else
Now I live in Germany, so I take the train inside Germany + to France, bus to the Netherlands and Czech Republic, car to Poland and plane everywhere else
I only take trains for internal travel
Considering how slow and crappy trains are here tho, I would take a plane ride over it any time
But for cross-border, I always choose flying
It's just faster, usually more affordable, and convenient
A trip from the French Atlantic coast to the Black Sea uses about 3 full tanks of diesel, maybe 5 for gasoline
Somewhere in that range
Add to that paying for road taxes, food and hotels and it gets expensive
I don’t think it’s even comparable to the greenhouse gases output of a plane, those should be much lower
Sweden is a capitalist country, with a free-market economy, high taxes and a generous welfare system
Democratic Socialism is what you have in Venezuela
Here is what the Prime Minister of Denmark [had to say] on the subject
Yeah, why should we implement fiscal reforms, free healthcare/education, public housing
Fuck those
Let's burn everything down, kill thousands of people during the process and make an entire country stagnate for years just to satisfy some weird fetish
In my country, I heard people saying Americans are dumb because they get their education from the Simpsons and South Park
they kinda have a point tbh
Isn't christian democracy in theory centre-left economically and center-right socially
We re not a country full of vampires and gymnasts
No, we are not populated by vampires
We actually love garlic
While not quite US-tier we still aren't that dirt-poor save for certain areas
And no, we are not all Gypsies
We are not vampires and and Vlad Tepes was not Dracula
Do they even portray us
Half the time it's vampires speaking with an obnoxious and wrong accent, the other time they portray us like slavs, which is still wrong
I do not think there are many movies with Romanian characters or about Romania
Everytime something about Romania comes up, it’s some grey setting full of commie blocks and pretty poor people
No doubt Romania is poor compared to Western Europe, but let’s get real, people are not that poor for it to be a main feature of them in movies
Also not all of Romania is commie blocks
no guys , we do not have vampires in our country
Vampires, Dracula, Transylvania and mountains
Please send help, Dracula is not even a slightly cool thing
Yeah he was a great ruler that made that night attack on ottoman camps, but others were so better, for ex
Stefan cel Mare, Mircea cel Batran, Mihai Viteazu, Carol I etc
too many vampires maybe
How am I supposed to phone somebody If there isn't a red phone box every 10 meters
Well, we’re not blessed with a Mediterranean climate to grow a thousand herbs and spices, and we tend to like our traditional cuisine, which as you probably understand wasn’t very imaginative at the time
Besides, vampires come out at night, and smell is especially important in the dark

I was 9 years old when my parents decided to buy me a bike and my father somewhat helped me learn to ride my bike, but most of the time we would go to a hill and I would sit on my bike and my dad would give me a push as I would then go down the hill with my bike
Once I ran into a tree and almost broke my arm, but at least after a couple of weeks or some I had learned to ride my bike
I learned at 13, my older brother at 10, because our parents were assholes back then and didn't understand why would a girl want to "harm herself" by riding a bike
I never learned riding a bike, i have a hell grandpa and when i was 6 yrs old i just kept falling on the bike and papa  would scream at me and i just gave up
15th century balkans, personalitties like Vlad Dracula,Stephen the great,Mathias Corvinus,Skanderberg,Mehmed the second
> we often refer to the French as cugini d'oltralpe (cousins beyond the Alps)
Similar to how we call the Moldovans "Frații de peste Prut" (Brothers over the Prut river)
Well I heard many nicknames for hungarians
hungarians = bozgor
Really
Are there any other nicknames besides "Bozgori"?
Lmao, şogor in Romanian means a guy that fucked them same girl as you
No, cuz we like you
Also
* Bulgarians: "Castraveți", "Zarzavagii" and "Cepari"
* Ukrainians: "Hoholi/Haholi"
Well you can't just bring it up without saying it, can you
We have something similar; when someone isn't listening or doesn't understand what you're saying we say "Are you turkish
" or "Am I speaking Turkish
I was just joking because I've heard lots of people talking shit about hungarians here, hence lots of "nicknames".
never heard these ones
Also for Bulgarians "Cefe late" and for Ukranians and sometimes moldovans "racketz"
You use cucumbers and onions
"Castraveți" means Cucumbers, "Zarzavagii" is derived from "Zarzavat" which means "Vegetables" and "Cepari" is derived from "Ceapă" which means "Onion".
They are a references to the fact that Bulgarians in Romania used to work as gardners and also to the salads which Bulgaria is famous for in modern Romania
I think it's taught objectively
At least that's how i learnt about it, the reasons of WW2 start, the holocaust, the allied forces, the benefits of Romania, the downfalls of romania
In Romania we are first taught why ww2 started and we talk about our alliance with Germany
How they took Czechoslovakia and how nobody did anything
The invasion of Poland and the other states west of Germany, so the blitzkrieg
Then we talk about operation Barbarossa, the territories we took, how we got wrecked, all that good stuff
We talk about internal politics for a brief period and then we go over some battles in Africa and Asia, we don't go in-depth
After that it's D-day, and the fall of Nazi Germany in general
So yeah, it's not really much
We often look at our own achievements and failures in the war, and a quite long lecture of important events and fights, which country fought for what side, political parties, fascism, communism, Germany being Germany, my country being sneaky and pulling a turn around, changing sides to the allies, the king is dethroned and a whole bunch of government stuff happens
We often put technological advancements in it too
And nothing (almost nothing
) on Japan, the Pacific war, Midway, Afrika Korps, Rommel, El Alamein etc
We did talk about Japan, Italy, the pacific War and all that
But I'm not sure if it was in the book or not
Could be, I was in school a long time ago, learned pre-1989 history
Dacians,the inter-war period,the wars against ottomans as we were THE SHIELD OF EUROPE AGAINST MUSLIMS HORDES i mean the SHIELD OF EUROPE was not just 3 fuckery medieval states ya' know
1918-1940 and the pre-Roman Dacian period
The last crazy theory I heard was that dacians (the tribes that existed before Romanians) *fucking taught* Latin to the Roman invaders
This is the crazy nationalist twist of the theory that dacians spoke something similar to Latin (and this because the language dacians spoke completely disappeared, Romanian is a mostly Latin language)
Communism lmao
The free territory was at least interesting
You forgot our Golden Era, when Hagi was scoring against Argentina and Colombia
In other words the Ottomans' punching bags
Wait, you had two Empires and you're looking up to Todor Jivkov
There's something wrong there
Sorry mate, you were the second SHIELD
Somehow we managed to keep the Europe Christian, nobody wastes time to explain how the Ottomans got Vienna under siege while we were PROTECTING EUROPE
Dont get me wrong brfore us bulgarians,serbs,byzantines,bosnians,albanians etc were THE SHIELD OF EUROPE,yes they failed and got conquered and then it came our time to shine and wallachia,transylvania,hungary and moldavia got defeated(in this exact order),yes even after this they continue to revolt and cause troubles for the ottomans and slowed their advance into europe but claiming that my country and only was the SHIELD OF EUROPE is wrong it was more like a team effort
Bcuz that was THE GOLDEN ERA
Pretty wrong but ok
It was
But keep in mind that most over the top nationalists will praise [this
Well, it depends on how you measure it
While it was an improvement over the past, we had the second last GDP in Europe
If you think that's great, then you should hear the theory about Deutschland being the "The Land of the Dacians".
Yeah saying shield is pretty overexagerating but as much as i dont wanna sound like a nationalistic we cant deny their achievments
To be honest, most of them
Jokes aside, probably the former mining cities in the Carpathians
Basically looking like stereotypical ghost towns
I wouldn't call it necessary ugly but it is the most depressing I've saw for sure
Yes, I have a thick moldavian accent and my friends and coworkers keep making fun of it
I have a slight Moldavian accent, especailly when i get mad, but i also use regional words
For info, i live in the capital of Romania, Bucharest
I dont really get mocked for it, but some people told me to stop using "îs", instead to use "sunt" (translation, I *am* ), especially my romanian language and literature teachers
I cant (and dont want to) stop
My parents are both moldavian
I spent all my childhood summers in Moldavia (region of Vrancea, to be more exact)
Thats how i learned to talk :)
And because of that, i also have a slight russian/slavic accent when speaking English
My English TC teacher always tells me "Go take Putin by the hand and learn proper accents together" (jokingly, of course)
> the way people in Bucharest talk, the way they switch up their "ă" and "e"

Breton is nota a Gaelic language
Let me explain:
Celtic languages are divided into 2 groups: the Gaelic ones, properly called Goidelic (Irish, Scottish-Gaelic and Manx) and Brythonic ones (Welsh, Cornish and Breton)
So Breton is Celtic, but not "Gaelic".
I'm sure it's excelent (especially against English vampires), but in this case it was a typo
You're right, I updated the comment

"decât" and "doar", both would be translated as "just"
&#x200B;
"decât" is used in negative forms, like "Nu am decât 100 de dolari
" = "I have only 100 dollars"
"doar" - "Am doar 100 de dolari" = "I only have 100 dollars
&#x200B;
But there it's an exception to "decât" - " Decât să merg la munte, mai bine merg la mare
" = "Rather than going to the mountain, I would better go to the sea
In Romanian we use "-" for many verbs and pronouns
Many people mess it up (place the minus where it shouldn't be and dont place it where it should be) like s-au/sau
They mean different thing, "s-au" needs to be used with a verb e.g. "s-au sarutat", means "they kissed", the verb is "au sarutat" and the "s-" defines who did the action, and "sau" means "or".  Another example is la/l-a. "La" means "to" (as a place, can be used for hours) and "l-a" is used like the "s-au" example
vroiam/voiam
Voiam means "I wanted" and vroiam isn't a word, its just the wrong way of saying voiam
The examples with suomea and sri lanka are rules in Romanian, but aren't common mistakes

Dear lord
I'm a Romanian citizen (part of the eu btw) and live in Germany
I have a job now and pay the same amount of taxes that Germans with the same social status (marital status, kids, qualifications, etc) pay
If I were to lose my job
I would have to go through the same unemployment process that German citizens go through and the German state would pay for my unemployment
So I pay taxes
I paid for that safety net
As an eu citizen I think you're eligible for unemployment benefits from the country you currently live in, if you already had a job and paid taxes for 1 year
If you didn't pay taxes for a year then I don't think you get unemployment money
In Romania, this is actually a rule for everyone
You can't get unemployment unless you paid taxes for a year (but I might be wrong cuz I've been out of there for a while now)
In conclusion, the way I see it is that you are treated as a citizen of that country
You pay the same taxes, you do the same work, you get the same benefits
From personal experience
You are free to move, study, work, with just border controls between non-Schengen countries, but no other requirements like visas
But if you want to settle in another country and work, you need to declare that you are changing your residency, make a new ID in the new country and all that jazz
You're by not means _abandoning_ your home country in any way, but all the work that you do in the new country under the new ID is taxed there
Also, once you work in a certain country, **based on the laws around there**, you might get entitled to social benefits other than what you get guaranteed as an EU citizen
For example, my step-dad works in Belgium while I'm in Romania
Since I'm still in university, I get a sum of money each month under their welfare for taking care of children
This, however, implied first going to the Romanian authorities and telling them to stop giving me child welfare
Conditions for welfare often are that you can only obtain it from one country at once
In simple terms:
EU citizens have to be treated like national citizens
There are however laws in place (the 3 month limit in which you are to find a job, for example) that ensures a person that moves without doing nothing doesn't fall on the social security net of the destination country
In theory you can even get a nasty letter that you're not welcomed in the country :)) (you don't have to leave and you can further look for a job, but you could receive such a letter)
However, once he works, studies or is a pensioner (the pension still get paid by the countries in which he worked according to their law without discrimination) or has immediate family that does so the EU citizen has to be treated exactly the same
Actually
the EU law goes even further and requires all residents to be treated equally when it comes to social assistance
The only difference is that a non-EU person might be conditioned by his visa to what he can or can't do and so some assistance is simply void (a 3 year worker on a visa and temporary residence card might not enjoy any long term benefits the hosting country might have after loosing his job since he has to leave the country if he can't find another job in a specified amount of time)
This is not so weird
EU discrimination is about treating foreign EU citizens the same as locals
Amazingly you can discriminate on your own citizens
~~Wales~~ Scotland (if I remember correctly -- hopefully I don't confuse them with others) has (well, had) free higher education for scotish citizens but not for people residing in England
They however have to provide the same free higher education for all EU citizens
Related to ID, it again is very specific to the country
In Romania, all residents must have an ID card an a Romanian "Personal Numerical Code".
For Romanian people, that code starts with 1 or 5 for men and 2 or 6 for women
For foreign people, it starts with 7 or 8
My step-dad who is working in Belgium also had to get a Belgian ID card
This actually makes sense
The EU law has to take account on everything it's happening in the EU
And there are safeguards against people trying to benefit from social welfare while residing in another country (e.g. romanians getting money from Spain after just a few years of working -- keep in mind a lot of EE migrators might benefit form such a scheme from multiple countries)
It is actually the prefered way for Sweden to change it's laws if they see fit (or simply keep paying it without an actual obligation) rather then further engaging in obliging countries to pay similar pensions to people that no longer reside in their countries
It was really cool
Even after seeing a lot of it in movies and tv shows, which was nice being able to recognize things, it was very impressive and I got to discover a lot of interesting things
Oh and the statue of Liberty is much smaller than I imagined
besides from it being cool in general
I thought the financial district / downtown area seemed really really crowded i.e. narrow streets and skyscrapers, lots of shadow from the buildings and no sunlight, this is if you take a walk in the Wall St
area I would say
Not impressed
I prefer Hong Kong, Singapore, Madrid, Barcelona
Reasons: dirty, smelly, rats, alot of weird people, don't feel safe, expensive
Bad traffic, noise, non stop noise
But the op asked for the architecture and buildings
"Despicable Me" was translated as "Sunt Un Mic Ticălos" which means "I'm A Little Bastard".
Also "Die Hard" was translated as "Greu de Ucis" which means "Hard to Kill".
> Groundhog day: Idétlen időkig (Until clumsy, (?) times)
Here it was translated as "Ziua Cârtiței" (the Day of the Mole)
> Breaking Bad: Totál szívás (Totally sucks)
That's worse than our translation, "Pe căi greșite" (On wrong paths/ways)
That one was translated as "Pradă Dificilă" (Hard to get Prey)
Got beaten by 7 dudes and got my money stolen as well in the front of a church

Spilled some dude's drink while very drunk at a night club
I had only spilled half his drink but he wanted me to pay for it full price
When I said no he slapped me and I slapped him back, then a bodyguard saw me and took me outside where the dude knocked me out in one punch
I guess it was good that I was drunk and fell in one punch cause I could have ended up way worse if I had fought back

I have heard of "Patria mamă" in Romanian, or "Motherland" but I don't think there is any "Fatherland"
Romanian here
Can confirm this is true
We won't kill you, but your parents sure will
I'm struggling to read and understand this comment
Because country is feminine
I've heard patrie used as fatherland before
If a place here doesn't have those, it's either a really important national treasure with the original wooden frame windows, or it's a place with no windows
I've never seen windows like that outside of movies either
bucharestbiketraffic is a bicycle vlogger from Bucharest (electric bikes) and also makes reviews of bikes and stuff, he's pretty enjoyable to watch

How about BackPackYourLife or Grigore Varlam, Varlam influence so many people to be a food courier at Glovo and Catalin from BackPackUrLife influenced people to travel
So yea, I just unsubscribe BackPackyourLife because sometimes he do so many clickbaits and he began to show a hunger for money, at first he was independent and living with some resources and a rent
Well honestly drivers in Bucharest are shit, and there is little to no bicycle infrastructure, but yes, that's part of his charm, yelling and stupid drivers
I think most people watch him especially for the screaming parts:))
How common is the handshake as a greeting between men in your country
Do men shake hands when they meet
I mean men who already know each other, as a form of greeting, not when they are first introduced
Is it still going strong or is it regarded as an old-fashioned form of greeting
Depends
Young man shake hands but there's nothing more funny that an old man grabbing them from the handshake into a kiss on both cheeks and, maybe, a huge hug
I laugh inside everytime
If I get to see this with a foreigner is even more funny
They look so confused for a couple of seconds and I'm like "*haha
You weren't expecting this one, weren't you
You got punked with an old fashion kiss
I've been shaking hands with people since I was 14 and always, but always when I meet a man I know I shake hands
It's instinct at this point
No, we do it everyday between friends when we meet and when we say goodbye
Yep, handshakes can be anything between formal and informal here
In the Netherlands they just dont do it, it is so hard as a Romanian  to not be the strange guy that shakes hands with everyone
I had some french family friends come over
I went to shake hands with them
Then they kissed me(this happens in my country in special events and this wasn't one of them)
I felt a little weird and they noticed it
They said it was pretty common in France
I like both Cats and Dogs
I think most people in Romania have both a cat and a dog, especially in the rural areas
In the cities however, most people prefer cats, or really small dogs (from what I personally know)
I prefer cats from all points of view
I like dogs too but I'm not crazy about them
I grew up with stray dogs on the streets and not all of them were nice lol so I've kinda been wary of dogs since
Plus I'm scared of loud sudden noises which includes dogs barking near me
Not sure what the people in my country prefer
Probably 50/50
Many people also have both a cat and a dog
I love both but definitely prefer cats, generally I think that people like dogs better
I'm a cat person
The country is a dog person and I hate it
The continent is mixed, I think
Cats are just ️. Dogs are OK
Lizard person
Jokes aside, I love both for their different quirks
I always wanted a dog, but I don't have the space for one
I have a stray cat that decided to live in my yard and a dragon inside
I think both are quite popular
I know lots of people have dogs and those who have cats usually have more than one
And there's the guard dog / pest control cat thing
What I know for sure is that reptiles aren't popular and lots of people think that my bearded dragon is either gross (he ain't) or that he's going to kill me
He's a derp
He's the best combination of cat and dog and so are other lizards, there's no hair or barking but he loves interaction like a dog, is quite independent like a cat and snuggles with you like one
Unlike neither of them he changes colors and could live his whole life in a terrarium (given that it's the right size) but you can take him out for a walk
And his food is way cheaper
Im an everything person
My grandma was the type of woman who would spend every cent she had to help an animal in her care
However this is not the general consensus of my country, unfortunately
Personally it's hard to choose, I really like both - but I lean towards cats just cause I'm too much of a homebody to even consider having a dog
Nationally I would say dogs - just cause I know more people who prefer dogs
Continentally, probably cats would be a bit more popular, simply because they're easier to take care of
From what I've read, in the past , the glaziers in the west of the country invented a special language in order to communicate with each other, so that others couldn't understand what they were talking about: for example, the recipe of making a certain type of glass or how to make it
In Romania Transylvanian Saxon
It was mistakenly named Saxon as King Géza II brought over a bunch of German workers to defend the border and he called all Germans "Saxons" as most of the miners in Hungary from Germany came from Saxony if I'm not mistaken
The actual language is a Franconian one, which makes it closer to Dutch than to other Saxon varieties such as Low Saxon/German
Well, maybe people are aware that Hungarian is spoken in Romania as well and German
However, I think few people know there are also Turkish, Slovak, Czech, Serbian, Croatian, Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Russian, Polish, Italian, Armenian speakers in Romania
Also, no, none of these languages are "recent", the people have been living here for at least some centuries
The language that some gypsies speak
It is simillar to indian
It's aktchkually a Moselle Franconian dialect, classifying it as Central Franconian, so closer to Luxembourgish

They are not even that well known in Romania either
It's pretty well known
I'm not reliant of a car (I don't even have a DL) since I live in the capital
I use the public transport (mostly the subway) to go around
Short version: you can get around without a car but it takes alot of time in the capital, and incredibly long in the countryside
Long version: Well take a look at my rute to University
The university is in the center of the city
I have a tram going across my street that leaves me about 10 minutes of walking distance to it, but it's never in station on time due to poor infrastructure, busy roads or people blocking the line
It's crowded to the point of being squashed with all my belongings into the tram door, and God forbid you carry a backpack or something that takes space
The tram either takes 10 minutes to reach the city center(if there is absolutely nobody is on the street) or up to 30 minutes (excluding waiting time)
So If I am in the tram station at 7:30 i am not sure if I'll be at uni at 7:40, 7:50 or even 8:30
Same route by car takes 10 minutes
Always 10 minutes
I'm not going off the line of my tram at all
If i decide to park in the center area it costs 10 ron the first 2 hours and then 20 the next
For 8 hours thats about 30 euros, and for someone spending 5 to 7 days a week there almost every month its a bit expensive
So I end up leaving my car 10 minutes out from uni in a free parking place I find
Except for the costs of the car itself its cheaper and more convenient to use a car
If you add up all monthly tickets for tram/bus/metro its twice as expensive as the money I use for my fuel
You can go anywhere you want faster
You can go in the countryside with it and unlike public transport it's 24/7 available
Will I switch to using the tram
Not if things change
Why don't I use a bycicle or scooter
Because it was stolen and because drivers in Bucharest are mental
I am pro-public transport
If we could get dedicated bus lines I'd become a happy commuter
But the people here are backwards
I live in Romania, I make €500/month
I can't afford a car
Family
Kids
It's maybe cheaper
It's the same with the people living in small towns outside Bucharest
Ive heard corruption is illegal
Cars are technically not allowed to park on sidewalks, bike lanes, building entrances, intersections, roundabouts
Scrabble was illegal, until 1989
Very funny
Wait, what
What constitutes a suspicious circumstance
Istanbul
Athens
Bucharest
I think this is the most fair ranking
Athens of course
Do I really need to elaborate on that
Geographically speaking, the following countries are in the Balkan peninsula, partially or fully:
\- Albania
\- Bosnia
\- Bulgaria
\- Montenegro
\- North Macedonia
\- Kosovo
\- Croatia
\- Greece
\- Italy
\- Romania
\- Serbia
\- Slovenia
\- Turkey
Also Bulgaria, there is no way someone would say Bulgaria is not in the Balkans, when it's dead right in the middle in its full entirety
From a geographic point of view, from Romania only the Dobruja (Dobrogea) region is part of Balkans
Historically speaking, that region had a lot more Bulgarians and Turks than the rest of the country
European part of Turkey is
And also Trieste
Istanbul is usually not considered part of the Balkans
I said fully or partially
A region like the Balkans doesn't have to extend to full countries only
Also it's not even the same logic
I think Balkan gets confused with the Southern Slavic countries in the Western mindset
The oldest still inhabited city in Romania, Constanța (historically, Tomis) was founded around 600 BC - there is still evidence of Roman settlement (which happened a good couple of centuries later)
Many other major cities have been around for almost 2 millennia
So yeah, as other people have already said, it's not really a matter of digging in your backyard and coming across artefacts from 2,000 years ago (though it HAS happened), but our history is visible pretty much everywhere
We don't really learn it about it in schools, but we do hear hear about it it a lot
First are all the projects funded by EU money, a lot of which got stolen but still we built things with them .
Then the second leading party (which actually has more support than the leading party outside of villages where priests and mayors tell everyone who to vote for) is known to be very pro EU
People don't know much about the EU from what I've seen, but they know that it's beneficial for us to stay in it
I personally support the EU past the economic benefits but that's another story
It's only the nationalist minority who wants to get rid of the EU and of NATO and basically become like Serbia and also the old communist minority who hates everything
SMS or contactless card
I think you're making a lot of people jealous right now
In my city you can buy it from the bus/tram using a contactless card or scanning a qr code with a special app which is linked to your bank account, or outside from the ticket kiosk or vending machine
I felt the same, my friend
Sometimes the West has to learn from us
There's a 4 digits number where you send a SMS with the bus number you're traveling with and they charge you (€0
45) for that
You will pay on the telecom invoice at the end of the month
It's not complicated at all, it's simple and fast
You just send for example the text "35" (without quotes) to the number you already have
Yeah, it's cheap, but the minimum monthly salary here is like €300
It's "păsărică" here lol
It means birdie but also cooch
“Brânza” which means cheese or “Zâmbiți” which means smile but does anyone say those anymore
I haven’t heard someone since the era of portable cameras ended
My favorite one is "s-a besit mireasa" (the bride farted), gets a genuine smile/laugh out of everyone
Honestly I don't mind the vampire/Dracula jokes, but some are pretty annoyed by them
I don't mind those jokes as well
It's the others about a certain ethnicity people confuse use with that get me triggered and make me think again before saying my nationality or not/lying
Do you have a moment to talk about our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ
>How was World War 2
How was the 18 centura for Poland ?
Never heard that
And no one in their right mind would say that they would
Sorry for entering politics a little, but yes he did a lot of stuff, but at the expense of political prisoners lives, and even normal citizens' life, or basic needs like water, electricity, food
The balance is really not in his favour
Same
Also I guess you talk in salary after taxes, not before
I find it weird how others talk in salary before taxes, that's not what I see in my bank account
We caught a priest that was doing infant (i hope it's a good translation,  like with children) pornography

Congrats
All my family and friends love him
They're all in Serbia
Yes, she did :) Imagine how fun it would be for us to play tennis over the Danube
Hahahaha :)) I wonder if the Custom would ask us to do formalities for the tennis balls :))) Probably not
They would also play
What are the biggest "wow* facts about your country and what world records it has on it's name
Romania holds the place for the biggest administrative building in the world with Palace of Parliament (Palatul Parlamentului), but also being the most expensive house, second biggest building in the world behind the Pentagon of USA and the heaviest
Most of the things you said are not true though
It’s the second largest administrative building or the largest administrative building built with public founds
It’s the most expensive administrative building but there are other buildings more expensive
And it’s not the second biggest building (also depends if you refer to volume, footprint or area), there are some malls and factories bigger
Highest percentage of people actually owning their homes (96%+)
>We've knighted three penguins
This is the only thing that matters
Thank you, no one noticed the inaccuracies and it was bugging me
I'll have you know Christmas Home Alone is very much a Romanian tradition as well
I don't think it's aired every year *precisely* on Christmas day, but still
Yeah, you guys are definitely more in love with this movie than us
Eat pasta, I need my carbs
Improvise

Handball is very popular over here
Especially women's handball
Romania's team won some competitions a bunch of times
I don't really know what or how, I just know that my whole family watches it
I don't think it's violent, but people get pretty excited about it
Yeah, but generally it's the same fans from the football matches
> The final game of the Greek Basket League finals at **Peace and Friendship** Stadium
Suitable name
At the balkan corner we would try to kill each other with butter knifes and forks
We would try to calm down the balkan corner as
- Serbia strangles Croatia
-Bosnia and Herzegovina tries to kill Serbia
- Slovenia tries to save Croatia
- Albania quietly takes Kosovo away and bangs Serbia's Head with a plate
- montenegro sleeping
- macedonia being slowly kidnapped by Bulgaria
We'll just slap some Manele and get on the party, prolly get drunk and get kicked out for killing someo- i mean what
We’d just hang from the ceiling
and wait for the right moment to strike
We would switch sides during arguments and we would steal Hungarys food
we would get drunk af
We would be sitting in a dark corner cutting ourselves because the Netherlands won't agree we should stay in their group of friends
Wait, aren't you gonna be the leader who gets mad because everyone is misbehaving and France still tries to start a war with england
With us
Why did you group us with 2 other countries that like you
Romanians and Russians get along for sure, but when it comes to politics and history, you are the country that fucked us over the most in recent history
Did we ever had a problem with other Balkan country
I feel like Romania would just be there saying nothing while all the other Balkan countries argue with each other
Hey, why not us too
We promise we won't put blood in it this time
Well you can include most Eastern European countries on that list probably, if we don’t take politics and history into account, we would all get along
Yeah but we are good friends with Bulgaria now
Well barely anyone remembers our war with Bulgaria and Turkey
it’s definitely in the past for us
Hungary is in Central Europe
Their conflict with us is very Balkan, except we never had any kind of genocides against each other
We mostly like them now, while the other Balkan countries keep on hating on them for historical reasons, we found another enemy country to hate in recent history
(I guess you know which one)
The dacians' religion is something we don't really tackle at school unfortunately
Zalmoxis is often mentioned in Herodotus's writings as a demi god in which the geto dacians believed in
Most of us don't even know the dacians had a polytheistic religion before Christianity and that's really a shame, since there is so much info on it and it's just super interesting
We inslaved gypsies for quite a while
The interwar period is filled with drama, tragedy, heroeism, dreams, fools and it is very interesting
I wish we got taught more on this instead of the useless *Dacia great* circlejerck
On the other hand, we do have few datapoints and recorded history today, in oder to know more
Dacians and the greater Thracian tribes didn't really bother with written history
We do have settlements, ceramics, jewels and stuff like thst, bit since they were tribes, and not some advanced civ, most of it it was just forgotten
Their religion is what i know from the greeks,but we are not really certain it was as stated, as far as i know
Was looking for this
Also, shipped them off to labour/death camps in Transnistria a bit later
It was a month or so ago that I even found out that "regular" slaves (chattel slavery) could be freed, if their master wanted to free them, at the age of 22, or at any age above that
Church slaves couldn't be freed at all, by law, at any age
Codul Caragea
Of Europe, not the world, you can't deny it as Sweden is leading the charts in number of reported rapes,and also yes, there are some cities and towns in Sweden which could be dangerous and where you should be careful
Same with us, brother
There were many
I can only remember a more recent one: the nudes of singer Alexandra Stan
yes she was actually
Really
:))) They still play it here on the sea side and everybody is dancing and being happy about it
Oups
99 Luftballons is not about baloons
^(\*feeling shocked\*)
wow
That's deep
Made me cry
From what I am aware of, barely
It lost a lot of popularity over time, and I barely hear of anyone going to one nowadays
My colleague @work sent her kid both to winter ski camp (somewhere in Vâlcea I think) and soon to the summer camp
And I just returned from the sea side where the beach was full of kids with their teachers
I think school camps are returning
Nice atmosphere, many (interesting) things to learn
I would call this sub a quality one, can I? :)
There is also a South Korean
"Well, this calls for a celebration"
For me is once a year for cleaning and checkup
In Romania, or at least in my case the hygiene part is not done by an assistant
Also, i had braces for 2
5 years and I went to different specialists every few months for some stuff that needed to be fixed and monthly to the orthodontist
Sadly the country average is, i think up to 10 times during lifetime . People usually don t go to the dentist if nothing hurts
In the big cities i think people go like every 2-3 years
Everytime it hurts
I don't have some major problems, bit I have a tooth that's bothering me
I never went in my life because it's too expensive
I'm 17
Once per year or even less since my teeth are very healthy, according to two dentists I went to
That Transylvania always was Romanian land
I think we are in on that secret
Shhhhhh
The same is in Germany, but you also have the option to do a "tax return" which from what I understand is more of a "please recalculate my taxes" type of thing
Because you're not forced to do it and it's basically asking the financial institution to make sure you paid enough taxes/they didn't take too much
In Ro it's exactly as you described
And I'm not sure you can ask for a recalculation
No, Transylvania was inhabited by a Romanian majority since the Dacians were invaded by Romans at the time the Hungarians arrived
As a person who doesn't have kids nor owns a car, you earn alot
I earn 500 euros after tax in romania and I pay 150 in rent and 200 on food and other expenses
The 1866 Constitution only allowed the death penalty during times of war (Art
18) . Same with the 1923 Constitution (Art
16)
Both were during the (kind of) constitutional monarchy
The 1938 Constitution (during the absolute monarchy) reintroduced the death penalty for "acts against the Monarch and its family, Heads of other Countries, against people holding a office of public dignity, burgalry with murder, and political assassination". It was used extensibly after the assassination of Prime Minister Calinescu in september 1939 by the far-right and during the Marshall Ion Antonescu regime (that happened during a sort of constitutional void)
In the communist period the death penalty was used
During the Dej period (1948-1965) it could be given for more or less anything including "fighting against the new communist order", while during the first Ceausescu period (1965-1971) only for actual crimes
During the second Ceausescu period (1971-1989), it was returned to Dej levels, with very frequent executions for "economic crimes" or "treason".
After the Romanian Revolution things were complicated
On 7th January 1990 a decree abolished the death penalty
People protested because they wanted former communist criminals to be executed
The decree was abolished and instead a referendum was planned
But the authorities decided to abandon the referendum and abolish the decree that was abolshing the decree abolishing the death penalty :)))
In the end in the Constitution of 1991 the death penalty is clearly forbidden in Art
22 (3) - "The death penalty is forbidden".
The last people executed were the Ceausescu couple on the 25th December 1989
Hmmmm, it's hard to answer since I'm not in that position
I would say that the people are not against foreigners in general, but the foreigners need to speak the language good enough to manage on their own, because the Romanian people, as friendly as they are, are not the kind of people to tolerate "dead weight". People are in general very helpful, but the moment they feel like they're being taken advantage of, they'll stop helping completely, even if you're genuine about your intentions
I think the people's attitude towards a foreigner depends a lot on the efforts that foreigner puts into integrating
Meaning if they try to speak the language or if they are friendly to others and don't isolate into their little bubble (this is something some people from Asia do, they don't even get their haircuts from Romanian shops and in small communities people notice and label them as "antisocial")
As for the EU/non-EU distinction
Well
It can be tricky
If you come from a rich EU or non-EU country and you don't try to Integrate, you're a snob
If you come from a poorer country and don't try to integrate, you're a moron
But if you come from a rich country, people will be more tolerant towards certain things because they won't expect you to stay
And they will be shocked that you're not a tourist
As for the paperwork/other kind of stuff one needs to live in our country
I don't know
I can't even make an educated guess
We get today off only because it's the 2nd day of Easter for us
Otherwise if a public holiday falls during the weekend, bad luck, we don't get another day off
However I've heard that some employers can give you that option
It was this year due to easter
Atleast in my school
It transfers on a Saturday so still in the weekend
Surprised how I know that and I am not even Dutch
If by bath you mean the one where you fill up your bathtub and sit in it, then I haven't taken one of those since I was a kid
It's fun to check out your wrinkly fingers afterwards but everything else sucks lol
I do shower everyday though
During summer I shower every time I come back from outside
It depends
Usually, I take a shower every day
During summer, I take 2 showers per day
Oh, I meant that I do like getting wrinkly fingers
hahah I just hate everything else about baths, like I don't even find them relaxing, I just get bored in there and feel like I'm wasting so much water lol
I have a pizza cutter but it never cuts all the way down so I simply use my hands to separate the slices or a knife
I don't, but I've seeen it done in pizza places where they sell by the slice and all their pizzas are rectangular
For those in Bucharest, Latin Pizza is one of those places
I use a knife to cut it
But I do put ketchup on it afterwards
I don't like Hawaii pizza, maybe that will help me save face in front of the Italians
Either Augustus or Aurelian
Augustus for founding the empire and Aurelian for saving it when it was about to collapse
There's stereotypes about every region pretty much
Moldova is poor, rural and uncivilised
Vaslui man is kind of like our Florida man
For example: Vaslui man who quit drinking for the New Year becomes richest man in county
In Brăila there are stereotypically lots of stabbings
Brăila people choose the knife which they'll use to stab the ribbon at the opening of their new bridge
Transylvanians are slow and naïve
Oltenia is also poor, but the people have too much pride
I come from the area of Moldova in Romania and it is considered a place of drunkards, wife beaters and overall temperamental people, in other words a bit of a butt crack
Well I come from a specific historical region called Bucovina and whenever people say I am from Moldova I corect them and tell them I am from Bucovina
I have a bit of an accent so when I lived in Sibiu people looked at me like I was stupid
Now I live in the capital and other than my accent sticking out like a sore thumb there is not a big difference
Well, we have Vaslui, wich is like Romanian Florida
&#x200B;
Braila and Galati, wich are in a "constant war".
&#x200B;
And we have Craiova wich is full of "cool dudes".
Dunno but we have a few cities that have Hollywood like signs of their names
The most famous one is the one in Braşov
I think most of out tv industry in based around Bucharest
[Buftea] is where most Romanian TV shows and movies are filmed
In Romania there is Bucharest and then a big peloton of cities arround 300k (orderd them randomly:Iasi , Galati, Constanta,Craiova,Brasov , Timisoara , Cluj)
* Bucharest is obviously the biggest . Probably best wages in Ro but quality of life is lacking . Pollution is huge , traffic according to many sources is worst in the world even if i guess this is an overstatement but not by much .There are these jokes due to communist heating system failures over and over again due to lack of maintenance .
* Cluj . The emerging city in Ro
A lot of IT and other industries are there , city looks much better than Bucharest but it come at a price as rents there are way bigger .Often it's joked about things Bucharest has and Cluj doesn't .Like Ikea .But especially the Metro/Subway system
* Iasi . Probably 2nd most populated city in Ro , but it's somewhat a poor city in a poorer region .A lot of people from Moldova go here as it's the main city in region and the only one with a decent university .
Having lived in Bucharest for many years, let me offer a slightly different perspective
I empathised with the Irish person in this thread who said Dublin is a little more rought around the edges, and you have to dig a little deeper to find its charms, but it's so great when you do
It just never ceases to surprise with hidden architecture, views, little hip bars and cafés hidden behind a house that looks derelict, in some random side street in the Armenian quarter
I remember finding this place where you can see the brutalist concrete collosus of the Ministry of Defense through an archway of a posh early 20th century villa  Also the parks are top notch, even if the place could use a few more
You're right that it's crowded as fuck and pollution is high though
And yeah lots of places are just irredeemably ugly
Definitely not for everyone
>but it's somewhat a poor city in a poorer region
Altul care se uită la știrile ProTV
i like the city , that's why i'm living here but 99% of people consider me an alien or some lunatic when i'm saying Bucharest is not that bad
n am televizor de 10 ani cred
In fine am , am si cablu dar cred ca daca zic ca de 10 nu m am uitat la astfel de lucruri , nu gresesc .Sau vrei sa mi zici ca Iasi e mai ok decat Timisoara , Oradea , Cluj , Sibiu sau Brasov .As putea chiar extinde cu Constanta
It depends on what you prefer I suppose
If you like history or architecture then I'd suggest Iasi, Alba Iulia, Sibiu or Brasov
Bucharest also fits this category
what are you looking forward to see
if you've been so far in Europe what cities did you enjoy the most
Yeah, our people really love to hate on themselves
Everyone just agrees that Romania is the worst country on earth, and whatever city you live in is the worst city in the country
It really is not that bad after all, and it's slowly getting better imo
„Mai ok” în ce sens boss
Că aici putem face o listă lungă și istovitoare
calitatea vietii .
Ok, dă mai multe detalii
Că și ăsta e un termen ambiguu
We have mandatory vaccinations against tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, measles, mumps and rubella
Yes, a patient has the right to spread possible deadly diseases to people who don't have a strong immune system
Yes
A few examples are: Charles - Carol, Louis - Ludovic, Peter - Petru
Romania isn't poor
Also Brasov best city In Romania no doubt
True, for specific values of 'horrible'.
Well, if you have very low expectations, then it's not that hard to pass them :P
There're the sächsische Schweiz here in the East
And Martin Luther
The little towns like Weimar, Erfurt, Halle are really pretty too
Not worth more than a day of walking around, but pretty nonetheless
Right
>Vienna has been named the best city in the world to live in this year
I hate my Country dont get me wrong
Seems about right :P
Which city did you visited
sounds like Romania
.... N-no
That can't be true
Nooooooooo
Unless you pass by someone old (especially in villages)
No more from like the Dachia people who idk If they got robbed by the Roman's or something
So partially but not really
It varies a lot with age
I noticed that in my 20s, everyone bought pastries and cakes for celebrations, like birthdays, people leaving the company or so on
In my 30s now and pizza is the norm
People who happen to work during big public holidays like Easter or Christmas, or in the days right after, will bring some traditional food made by their grandmothers or mothers since that's the good stuff
Depending on the workplace, you may or may not also bring homemade wine or something stronger
In the autumn, if you happen to have a vineyard or have relatives with vineyards, people will bring to work some of the newly made grape juice that hasn't fermented yet
There aren't many workplace related traditions in Romania
Mostly the same thing that you describe
People always bring food or sweets for birthdays or happy occasions
In Germany however
There is some weird shit going on
In my workplace (east Germany), people put pictures of their children on the kitchen wall
Like for everybody to see
And when someone is about to have the baby
People make them a "diaper cake". They literally take out diapers from a diaper bag and arrange them into a cake-shaped pile
I still haven't figured out if this is a super specific thing or not
> My birthday = my treat
Your birthday = your treat
Asking me to do work (like bring the treats or the cake) on your birthday is bizarre
Just a heads up, the first sentence is a bit confusing - "my treat" means you're paying for something :)  As in "Hey, it's my birthday, so let's go out to eat tonight - my treat
Your second sentence clarifies that you're on the side of "you bring ME cake for my birthday", but just wanted to chime in
EDIT
Misread the "*your* birthday" part
[Cargo - Ziua Vrăjitoarelor] fits most of your requirements and I'd say is one of the most well known headbangers that we have
I linked the live version because I prefer that one
They had an amazing performance in White Horse, Costinești back in my teenage days that still rings in my head every now and then
If you want a more *fun* one, here's the ode to drinking - [Anarhia]
Or if you want one that truly fits *all* your requirements, it's [Altar - La Noi] Maybe a bit too "hard" and unpolished for mainstream Rock radios to play it, but it's one of the best critiques of Romanian culture and identity in all of modern art, and a true banger
[Lyrics]
[Alternosfera-Ploile nu vin ]
They're from Moldova but it's a shame to not include them
There is a youtube channel called [Heavy Metal Of The Eastern Bloc] which should cover all of our balkan friends baltic, ukranian and polish friends and russians
You can try the band E-an-na which is a folk metal band with quite a big variety of instruments used in their songs, I fucking love them !
[Subcarpați - dă-i foale
It has a national instrument (sort of), but it's not metal
It's lofi
[Coma - bine]
This one is rock
Here you go mate, some of the best Romania has to offer
I tried to keep it as diverse as possible while still respecting your requirements
They're listed heaviest to lightest
Enjoy, and do post a link with the finished product
Cheerio ^_^

It was written as a response to the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, right when Romania signed a new deal with NATO sending more troops there
[Bere Gratis - Ce n-a văzut Parisul]
should be warned, though, altar went very lame after the first album, which was in english
Well, 3 count
Vlad The Impaler
He actually was a very good leader, very patriotic and loved his people
He just impaled criminals so the people would get scared and no one would do crimes
It is said that if you left your wallet in the city 3 days later it would still be there
The second one was Ion Antonescu, leader of Legionary Romania in WW2
Anti-semitic, he sympathized Adolf and he made the jews rebuild Bucharest after the bombing
The third one was a communist dictator that we executed fairly recent (End of December 1989), Nicolae Ceausescu, he heavily rationized the food, water, oil, heat, medicine etc
and the country just HATED him
And Carol II not
Antonescu was anti semite and orchestrated the Odessa massacre but you can't really say he was insane,since he at least removed the legionaries from power quickly and didn't try to resist being removed from power
Maybe, but most would say Ceausescu
Vlad was crazy, but for that time wasn’t something unheard of to kill criminals in let’s say “creative” ways
Over ten thousands, actually, but the numbers might be exaggerated
But he wasn't insanely cruel for his time and place, medieval Romanian history makes Game of Thrones feel like a documentary
Some context: his father got killed, skinned and stuffed like an animal (not sure about the order); one of the first things he had to deal with after taking the throne was his supporters and family being mutilated and burned or buried alive by opposing nobles
Yeah, you can count him
I don't know much history of that period but I knew he wasn't a "ușă de biserică"
One doesn't get the nickname "the terrible" for nothing though
Vlad loved the people and hated crime
Crazy maybe, but still a good ruler
Vlad wasn't crazy, impaling was a common execution practice back then, and also most of the stories about him are exaggerated
Ceausescu was a megalomaniac and an idiot but I don't think he was crazy
I think Codreanu would fit better, the guy had prophetic dreams that led him to form The Legion, the only problem is that he was never the leader of the country, but still a very influential politician
Many "voievod"s (our term for king) stood up against the ottomans, for a while, this doesn't make him special
Anyway here's a [youtube] video about him/battles
According to the Sultan, yes
But the dude had a huge crush on Vlad, so he might have been a bit biased
He did win a few battles against the turks, but overall had three reigns that totaled 6 years, spent mostly in civil wars against his brother, and managed to get imprisoned by the man he hoped would ally him
If we had a genius ruler that would have been Stefan cel Mare
Yep, meanwhile Ceausescu was just an insane idiot that did nothing but torture and destroy the very soul of citizens
Most of the stories about him are propaganda made by the ottomans and by the Transylvanian saxons
He wasn't at all special in terms of his cruelty by medieval standards, impaling was a common way of execution, and he made quite a few reforms that helped the citizens of Wallachia
Sure you could say he was cruel, but I don't think he was insane
The trial and execution of Nicolae and Elena Ceaușescu
The show trial lasted one hour during which time the couple was charged and condemned to death by an improvised court with no prior investigation and no evidence
Heck, even their [forcibly-assigned] lawyers sided with the prosecution and accused them of capital crimes
After the trial they were taken out of the building and immediately executed by a firing squad
What can I say - a monstrous ending to a monstrous era
I don't know if it counts as a court case but one time, a person from Romania was declared dead evem though he was alive
Well, the court cases about the [Romanian Revolution of 1989] and the [Mineriad of June 1990] are still in the works
The first one is investigated because most of the bloodshed and deaths in the Revolution of 1989 happened after Ceausescu fled Bucharest, and complete chaos ensued for several days, with some army units on the side of the revolutionaries, others fighting for the old regime alongside the Securitate, armed civilians shooting other civilians because they were fed lies about "terrorists" and "foreign agents".
During the Revolution the power was seized by basically second-row Communist Party officials who rebranded themselves as the National Slavation Front
They also retained control of other state institutions such as the intelligence services
In June 1990, this new power suppressed pro-reform and pro-[Lustration] protest by academics, arists, students, etc in Bucharest by bringing in coal miners and industrial workers and telling them that they were fighting "radical elements", "hooligans" and "anarchists". If you want to know what people were protesting for, look into the [Proclamation of Timisoara
But since the same old elites retained power in parliament, the magistrature and in the intelligence services until recently, they've blocked and stalled these cases from seeing the light of day
And personally, I don't expect them to be resolved anytime soon
The man that is alive but got declared dead but now he is in court against the government (or something) because he wanted to not be dead anymore
They'll probably call him to vote after he really dies or something
Here's the Romanian equivalent if someone wants to know (pretty similar rules):
Děkuji ti - (I) thank you (sg
) - Îți mulțumesc
Děkuji vám - (I) thank you (pl
or formal) - Vă mulțumesc
Děkujeme ti - (We) thank you (sg
) - Îți mulțumim
Děkujeme vám - (We) thank you (pl
or formal) - Vă mulțumim
Offtopic but those Dutch phrases sound (to me) like a Russian speaking German
Ortăruie (Transylvania Romanian) Ort Der Ruhe
Ștrudel :3
>Rükverc
TIL this word begins with an "R". Always thought it was "Lükverc" (that's how my grandparents always pronounced it)
I have a good one
My grandma used to say "Vesterzi
" for "Do you understand
" (Akin to "Capish
" or "Comprende
" in English)
I don't know if this is widely used in Hungarian
It was very late in life that I realized it comes from German "Verstehen sie
And the English and Standart Romanian equivalents of this
Same
And șnițet :)
Cemetery / Cimitir
Frankly, I've only ever heard my grandma use it, nobody else, so I was always curious where she had gotten it from
Very interesting
Thank you
In my corner of the country the dialectal word would be "temetieu" (from Hungarian)
But it remind me of two other local germanisms:
"ștrase" - corso / strada principală (main street)
"țuhaus" - închisoare (prison)
In my city we even have a Sasisch cemetery with the text and all
It's not very common and society has mixed feelings about them, especially about their personal hygiene
That's how rockers spot each other in public :P Long hair isn't that uncommon here, especially if there is a rock/metal community
About how society views them, I'd assume most of them don't really care lol
Also apart from elderly people, those who aren't rock fans, and strict bosses and teachers, I don't think anyone has any particular negative sentiment towards them
For teenagers we usually call them "Roacers" , which is just a funny way of pronouncing Rocker
You don't even gotta listen to rock, if you got long hair you're a rocker
There's also the skaters who have long hair but the line between them and the rockers is often blurry
How common is it
I don't know, probably 1 in 10 guys or so
There are some
The stigma depends on the age of the people around
Older people don't like that sort of thing and they *will* let you know
Younger people don't really care, but they *will* assume that you listen to rock or metal
In my city, it's not that uncommon
Most of them are metalheads tho
At the start of highschool I was threatened with disciplinary action if I didn't cut my hair by the principal
I know other guys with long hair or beards who got the same treatment
All straight-A students who were bringing awards to the school, mind you
It was one of those schools with a stick up its arse about how great it is, enforcing uniforms and all that jazz
I just kept saying "yes yes i'll do it" until we moved to a different city
That was almost 10 years ago though, pretty sure it's illegal now
Last year i finished school
In the 11 class i had long hair, nobody had any problem except from few frinedly jokes from my classmates
Yeah exactly
I also used to have that one teacher who picked on students with long hair, full beards, dyed hair etc (and it looked pretty good on them, not blunder years material haha)
She was also a school uniform advocate
I'll never understand it
Yeah some schools are much more chill than others
The principal and other school admin were power hungry cunts who would punish anything slightly out of line
A few years ago they wanted to expel a student for a post in a private FB group that was critical of a teacher (but not vulgar or overly impolite), you may have seen that on national TV :)
When I moved nobody had a problem with it at the new place
In Romanian, it literally translates to "nun" (călugăriță)
,,călugărița” which literally translates to Nun
Călugăriță in Romanian, meaning nun
Well, given my country tag you can probably guess already
The most famous song from our country is definitely "Dragostea din tei" by ozon
Ancom gang
What is the most insulting thing that someone can say about your country
In Romania *if you confuse Bucharest with Budapest* or *if you leave food on your plate is considered very insulting*, what about your country
I'd say assumptions like 'All Romanians are gypsies' and 'You all beg/steal/are poor/take our jobs' are way worse then confusing Bucharest with Budapest or leaving food on a plate but ok
I don’t know where in Romania you’re from, but I’ve never heard anybody consider it insulting to leave food on your plate
I think
" that we're thieves"
Outside of the Gypsies issue, for pretty much every Romanian, saying that Greater Romania was bad/, idiotic or saying Romania doesn't own Transylvania or Bessarabia
Sillistria is a bit different cause Romanians weren't a majority albeit a decently sized minority
The same cannot be said about Transylvania and Bessarabia where outside of Bugeac and some parts of Transylvania, Romanians represent a significant majority and have done so for ages
Saying we do not oe should not own these lands is pretty much an insult to our history, heritage and sacrifices we made, especially in 1st World War
So you're from Holland then ?
The schrodinger eastern european  ,takes jobs but never works
We Romanians don't have problems with this, as Switzerland translates to "Elveţia" and Sweden to "Suedia" so no big deal about that
Trianon was fair
In most cases at least
I support Hungary having S. Slovakia and Carphatian Ruthenia, maybe even Voijvodina
The only reason I don't speak my support about these is because of Transylvania
Is probably a grandmother account
I think you know how people here care about the food they make and they expect a nice review
Let's drink Rakija
I'd do it for the memes
This people are definitely annoying, imagine going to the Netherlands to study and everyone assuming you are here to party
I would do that in my country too
To the dumpster  with the Christian god
Praise Zamolxis
Hungarians being salty over a piece of land is a meme in Transylvania
The hungarians from here laugh about it as well
What is it about
I don't understand anything but it sounds really cool
Yep , same in romanian "Olanda" and a lot of other languages
We have "Țările de Jos" but no one uses the term since it's strange
You don't say
That's how we call the Netherlands in Romania "Olanda"- Holland because saying the translated version of Netherlands- "Tarile de Jos" is too long and not everyone knows what country that is but everyone knows where Holland is
It's like instead of saying Netherlands  you'd say "The countries beneath" It's kind of a fucked up translation but it's all we got
Sorry
In my case it was a tease  ..also we use "Olanda" in romanian but I don't think anyone would use "Holland" when speaking English ..they'd use "Netherland"
I think you might have missed the sarcasm ..it was just a tease
The soviets killed or imprisoned any opposition to their occupation and generally the soviet cooperationist are seen worse than the military government or even the Legionaries so no one was punished fairly
Many opportunistic legionnaires ended up in the Communist Party
Thee was the famous poem by Păstorel:
"Căpitane, nu fi trist,
Garda merge înainte,
Prin Partidul Comunist"
*("[Captain] don't be sad,*
*The [Iron] Guard lives on,*
*Through the Communist Party")*
Mă refer la legionari ca mișcare nu membri
Totuși poemul evidențiază tipul de oameni căutați de sovietici în timpul ocupației mai ales sub domnia lui Stalin
Translated(I am referring to the movement not its members
Tho the poem does underlines the type of people that the soviets wanted during the occupation especially under Stalins reign
Lots, including citadels
My favorite is the Alba Carolina Citatel
None
But i’d wish to
It's okay Romania, maybe we'll have something to say on the next post
I'm a student and not employed, but I'll be talking for mom
She works as the one deciding the exchange rates at this exchange and pawn chain (don't know the world for it in English) and managing places of the chain
She also serves the clients and is also the company's  accountant
Because she's employed the state gives her health insurance and that's basically it
Her workplace doesn't count extra hours but demands them, no such thing as brakes, you have every other weekend free if you're lucky and they don't respect legal holidays
She works 8am-6pm in winter and 8am-7pm in summer
It used to be 8-8 but they didn't get enough clients in that time frame to justify electrical bills
They write all their employees as minimum wage on papers to pay the least amount of taxes, so in all records they work minimum wage, affecting everything from credit score to retirement age and pension
Also, no restroom access and heating in the winter it's your problem
One example for why most people go to work abroad
Damn all these countries with so many great benefits :'(
Currently unemployed, but at my previous job:
- mandatory state health insurance
- 2 checkups / year at a private clinic
- work phone
- mandatory 21 days / year paid vacation days
Most jobs here only "offer" the mandatory stuff
I get the benefit of having a job
everything else is either corporate BS either necessairy items for my job, packed as a "benefit". So I went to my employer and told him I don't care about SPA Treatments and fitness classes
I want money to do whatever the heck I wanna do with them after a hard week
And he agreed
I get money to do whatever I want
I work in IT
The main benefits are: 3 extra vacation days a year over the legal requirement; can buy company stock at a large discount; free phone  with an unlimited plan; can work from home 5-10 days a month; better health insurance than what the state provides;
Had no idea Metro existed in other countries as well
UiPath by any chance
I know they offer unlimited time off
Of course
Because the State regulates this very well: paid sick leave, maternity leave, minimum days off, minimum salary, healthcare, social insurance, etc
It is not a "benefit" from a private company
It is not their way of saying "I care about you". They are forced to do it - and I am happy they are
Otherwise we would be in the same situation as US i.r. to healthcare
Bottom line is that we are not friends (company vs employees) nor enemies
It is a partnership where one is providing a service and the other one is paying for those services
Most companies try to cover the lack of humanity by providing some packages that they name "benefits", which are the equivalent of a "back pat" when you are in a coma
It's not ok
The real Benefits are: better management, better communication, better working hours, better work distribution, personnel trainings, time breaks, extra holiday leaves after a project is succesfully completed, real meetings where employees are heard (related to good management), etc
It's hard for them to offer the above but so much easier to replace them with fitness classes
I see
I think it's the work culture in the US that pushes long workweeks rather than the companies themselves
Exactly
The problem is that most US Companies don't understand that most Europeans are socialists and they care about the social well being of their individuals and strictly regulate these situations
So when they hire Europeans they present their social obligations as "benefits". I refuse to consider them so
They should be basic obligations for any company in the world, just like the human rights
Because not respecting the life quality of your employee and not caring is like stealing a person's dignity :(
In romanian, one of the shortest panvocalic words is oleiau which is the third person, plural, past continous form of the verb a oleia and it means to grease or to imbibe with oil
Romanian also has three extra vowels: ă(which represents the schwa sound), î and â which represent the same sound but î is written as the first or last letter, with some exceptions, and â is written inside the word
The shortest word which contains all the vowels present in the romanian language is autoînsămânţările which can be broken into auto + însămânțările,
auto means "by own means"
însămânțările is the plural articulated form of însămânțare which is the action of sowing coming from the verb a însămânța which means to sow coming from în + sămânța which translate to in + seed
So autoînsămânţările means the natural sowings of plants
I don’t recall is ever happening in Romania, but to be fair, i rarely leave my house at night when the drunk people are out and about
Did we colonized any country
TIL Cameroonese is a word that exist
I'd nominate the Unification of 1918
Some may say the Revolution of 1989 which sowed the seeds of discord and corruption that our modern state is founded on, or the small union of 1859
*But* unification has been (and continues to be) *the* defining theme of the arc of our history since at least the early 1800, if not since 1600
Sure, at the moment it may seem to be on the back burner because of more current affairs, like troubles with infrastructure, healthcare, the economy, justice and corruption, etc, as well as the sheer legal impracticality of a union
But those come and go, whereas "are those people over there the same as us
" is a much more fundamental question
"Basarabia e România" is by far the most common graffiti all over both countries (meaning Bessarabia, the historical name of today's Republic of Moldova, is Romania)
And well, 1918 is the culmination of that effort
Literally every town has a main street and square called Unirii or 1 Decembrie 1918
I would say the unification of Wallachia and Moldova into Romania in 1859
Ironically or not, the end of WW1 is probably Romania's defining moment as well, finally being united with millions of brethren Romanians
That meant a lot
However, Moldova and Wallachia uniting in 1859 and becoming Kingdom of Romania, and then King Carol I coming to throne, led later to the full independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878-1879 and the modernization of the country
So hard to choose
Yes definitely
Also the Battle of Mohács is quite significant too
I never really enjoyed most of the traditional food because it's really fatty and it made me sick very often
I absolutely hate *piftie* ([aspic in english ]
And pork skin/fat for Christmas
I hate that
Fish borsch
I like fish and borsch in general but not fish borsch
It smells so fishy, tastes so fishy, full of tomato juice and sometimes you get fish bones, fish skin or other nasty things
Would not recommend
(I'm recommending "papanași" tho)
I'm curious why the reaction
Personally it's my favorite dish from your country
I like gin with cucumbers in it
It's definitely not a common tates tho
Are you me
Because same
Yes
The cabbage rolls that have either too much rice or too much grease from the meat are so gross (but vegan ones are good)
Racitura has such a terrible smell that it turns my stomach upside down *de la o posta*. The gelatin, ew
Boeuf salad is basically mayo cake
Coliva is just extra sweet porridge but we treat it like some great dessert because we only get it every once in a while
The only thing I personally *really* like are Pleșcoi sausages
Other than that
miss me with that Romanian shit
I don't like pork either, so I like vegetarian sarmale a lot more (with soy, mushroons and other vegetables), also drob made with chicken and vegetables is 100 times better than the original one, at least for my taste
I've never understood the fuss about zacusca, I don't like it but everyone else seems to love it
Not risotto I hope
I'd rather eat instant noodles and cheap granulated soy made into meatballs
You probably didn't eat good risotto that's why
I don't know the paella recipe
But I do know the risotto one, and risotto cooked in water it isn't tasty, even if you put a lot of parmesan in it, you feel that something is missing
It shouldn't be mushy
Is should be creamy, silky and tasty
You can get separate grains from long grain rice such as Basmati or Jasmine
For risotto you'd have to use short grain rice, more starchy, such as Arborio or Carnaroli
Short grain rice is also used in rice pudding (i like the sweet one), which is delicious
(google says in Pakistan is called kheer)
Believing in astrology
I'm not even sure how it is so popular and works with Christianity, since we are such a religious country
We really like storing ALL of our shopping bags in a drawer and then forget about them
[THIS]
It's a saying, not an action or gesture, but here we go:
"My dick
I worked for the summer at Lidl and something weird I noticed about old grannies
they buy yogurt (like little ones and lots of them) and they put EVERY SINGLE YOGURT in a SEPARATE PLASTIC BAG
Why
It makes scanning that shit so difficult
Then ZF Tom is Finnish
Reference to: [THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH BUCKETS]
If you're not watching Die Hard, you're doing Christmas wrong
Same here in Romania
It's a tradition already
Here too, we even have memes for it
Please don't forget the bag with bags
Yep, bread with every course here also
So it's not just a Romanian thing
Fuck me
I had no idea Sto Lat from Discworld is a real thing
Hahahaha
I call this move "the trap". My dad used to do it with all my friends
Always seemed like a regular handshake
Always ended up with him kissing them
:))
TIL that there are people from other countries that are pulled by the current
Open Air ASTRA Museum:
It's a huge 96 ha complex and though it's called The ASTRA Museum of Transylvanian Civilization, it encompasses images of rural life from across all historic regions of the country
There are some 400, 500 traditional houses and in the summer you can see people wearing traditional garments in some of the courtyards, doing pottery, wood sculptures or cooking traditional dishes (that you can buy)
A day isn't enough to visit the entire complex
Some local people come visiting on bikes or roller skates
I think the video, which is very complimenting, shows enough to get an idea of how cool that place is
I personally visit it every summer
Astra village museum in Sibiu Romania
It is an amazing outdoor museum that explores the the architecture of the Romanian villages across Romania
It is an amazing walk through a massive park and you can go inside houses and explore
It is spread across and it offers a beautiful experience of walking and feeling in a way the vibe of old România
There are actors here and there that tell you about the houses
It is the best museum experience I had in Romania
For Valencia, I will always recommend [The Museum of Ceramics and Decorative Arts]
It was only 3 Euro per person and absolutely worth it
Stunning work from many different time periods
When a new mall opened all the shops in the food court were empty while people were lining up at kfc :(.
If you want to eat Junk food you either eat at McDonald's or KFC
However Mickey D is more common due to it's kid friendly foods
According to Google there are a bunch of KFC s in Ro
And there are also some 3 "Kentucky fried chicken" s. And I know the one in Bucharest
It is not KFC
It's a lawsuit waiting to happen, but it never will actually happen cuz it's a tiny ass shop in between some apartment buildings in a country that no one cares about
I would say that we still have the outdated version here: women are the ones that cook in the house
It is rare to find a man that actually knows how to make more that French fries and an omlette
Though in recent years, I have started to see (at least in my circles/bubble) that men (and not single) have started to learn how to cook more and bringing food to work
I got lucky and snagged myself a man that actually knows how to cook
This sums up my experience too
We still have that mentality of "if you can cook (especially the traditional dishes) you're wife material / no man will marry you if you can't". No one taught me how to cook either, as a teenager I was expected to focus on school and was more of a nuisance in the kitchen anyway
I just figured it out when I first moved out haha
Sounds accurate, men under 30 do tend to cook a lot more, at least compared to our fathers and grandfathers
It's probably because we spend more time living on our own before marriage and you can only eat so much takeout and sandwiches
Yeah exactly
It's like when you're told "you're still a kid, you have no business here" and "you're almost a grownup, you should know this" at the same time
Yeah, i can second that
In their 20s especially
I talk and ask most my guy friends for their recipes and we chat about cooking a lot
Definitely a shift in mentality but it's probably slower in rural areas
There's also an interesting trend of more capable and less negletful fathers that i'm starting to see
Almost all my Romanian friends and family had some kind of abuse, neglect, or simply lacked a relationship with their father
Russia, you can expect the common borders to come back anytime
I think it's Poland and Austria
We don't border them but in my social bubble, we consider them neighbors
Every Country that was a Satellite State of the USSR is now our neighbour
poland i think
Ireland  I just love those guys
They would make the best neighbours ever
I can even imagine swearing eachother over the borders and then getting drunk and being bffs :))
I never felt that Poland like this, I think Greece is way more of a neighbor
Scares me I undrestood you both without studying neither Italian nor Spanish
So I live in what I would call a decent size city
Not too big, but not too small either
When you compare to Bucharest, you can see some similarities here and there
Like traffic, but it's still worse in Bucharest
Naturally being the capital Bucharest has more jobs and a more vibrant lifestyle I suppose due to all the restaurants and malls
I'd also say the other big cities we have, like Cluj, Iasi, Timisoara are nicer, like more manicured
Bucharest is random and gritty and surprising
I love it
Also, Romania is very centralised
Bucharest has over 2M people, but the next big cities have around 350k each
the second city is brum
Breslau (sorry, idk the Polish spelling)

The Szekely land, in the southeast corner of Transylvania
As a national minority they have guaranteed seats in parliament, and they regularly bring up a law about the autonomy of the Szekely land (currently it's 2 and a half counties, doesn't have any overall administrative status)
It gets voted down, but even if they'd make some kind of deal with the majority to pass it, it's still unconstitutional
Our constitution says in like the first 3 lines that our country is unitary and indivisible, meaning you cannot have something like a devolved administration without a consitutional amendment
It seems like Szekely autonomy is just a political threat used by their politicians
They get education and services in their own language and guaranteed representation
I've never heard any actual demands from them, though if someone wants to correct me please do
That corner of Transylvania, right by the middle
Secuimea
They keep whining, we keep denying, people keep acting like they’re legitimate
10-15 years ago stray dogs were a big issue, there were frequent reports of them attacking people
I remember as a kid there were quite a few packs on my way to school
We even had a few inside our school grounds, all fine and dandy until a student got bitten
But then the government took some measures and drastically reduced their numbers
If I think about it I can't remember the last time I saw a stray dog, or heard someone mention/complain about them like before
The only animals I see on the street are cats, but I can't always tell if they're strays or not
For example I have a few neighbors who let their cats roam free so I just assume it's theirs lol
I'm curious where you've been in Romania, I'm not familiar with the situation in other cities
Seeing all the westerners saying they never saw a feral dog makes me realise how much we still have to work to reach civilization xD
Stray dogs are EVERYWHERE where I live, there are in big towns too but not so many
I live in a small town and I kid you not I passed by a pack of 10 huge angry dogs on my way to school
At 7 am
Not a single person on the street
It's so annoying because there are no shelters where I live and no one has the initiative to build one and people keep throwing away their unwanted dogs on the street  it makes me so mad
There are 4 stray and 2 semi-stray (they technically have an owner but spend most of their time on the street) just on my street
Where I lived before there were like 3 cats that every other day jumped the fence, came to our back door and asked for food
(there were waay more on my street overall) Sometimes they even kept me company during my nights of astronomical observations :)
So yes, I would say Romania has quite a big problem with stray animals
Yes, stray dogs have actually been a very big issue in Romania, since there were packs of aggresive ones and many deaths resulted from them
Nowadays it's pretty rare to see them (atleast in my city)
Destroyer cats
Sounds so dangerous, they must be huge and evil
I live in Cluj-Napoca and haven't seen any
If you start one, dm me for donations
Hahah, I've been to Bucharest a couple times, I hope the situation has improved since
Come again once the pandemic is over :D
I'm also kinda scared of dogs for this reason
As a kid I've always been told "stay calm, they can sense fear" and stuff when passing by packs of strays
I guess some sort of "dogs can and will be aggressive if you're nervous around them" mentality just stuck with me
Also the fact that some guard dogs roam the front yard and bark through the fence at every passer-by doesn't help either lol, I always try to keep a good distance from people's yards if possible
I'm not super familiar with the situation but I'm pretty sure they are
They used to collect the stray dogs off the streets and take them to shelters, afaik many of them were neutered and re-released, but I guess many others were euthanized sooner or later
I'm sure they have better quality of life in German shelters than in Romanian ones, and better chance of finding a home too
People generally use both but blue is more common and some things like exams must be completed only in blue
Anyhow blue is basically the only colour for fountain pens, it's a distinct type of blue,  I always reffered that type of blue as "Ink blue" . Children are encouraged and oftentimes forced to use fountain pens, and only in elementary school do they start using ballpoint pens, so fountain pens are still common here, even though most prefer the cheaper and more convenient ballpoints
For ballpoint and rollerball pens black is somewhat common too, but most are still dark blue or light blue
So basically teachers are telling their students to fuck off
>red pen (reserved for the teachers)
Haha, same here, teachers use red pen only when correcting homeworks, tests etc
to highlight mistakes
Romanian here, most of the parties in my childhood did not involve a lot of kids so my parents would just bring in food and stay in a different room
Larger parties would usually have a group of parents close by chilling and having drinks, peeping food
But it always felt very Independent
do you get birthday parties with your friends
cringe
the true ones look at their parents friends getting drunk after receiving some money for their birthday
Well bread, salami, melted cheese
But I prefer to make in the sandwich-maker
At home, I like it pretty simple: cheese, ham, mayo, fresh tomatoes and cucumbers
For bread, I prefer butter croissants, but otherwise, some plain white bread is great
You might think me a monster, but sometimes I put chips in my sandwiches
Until you try it, you cannot judge me though :))
But when I go out, I do love some pulled pork sandwich, if available
Yum
Seems like our presidential election will actually be about choosing the best candidate instead of the lesser evil
The two prefferd candidates are both relatively clean and capable
I've never been in this situation since I had the right to vote
Liviu Dragnea is now in jail :D
Oh come on :D, you guys are doing great compared to us
Right
Right
I was actually looking for this post haha
Germany-Berlin
Never been in Switzerland, I'd choose Austria from the two
Switzerland is boring, is cool just for holidays
But you can speak German in any of those
Around 1 euro for 15 km but quality and speed are abysmal . The speed is lower now than in the 70s in more than half of the network  . Timisoara<->Bucharest one of the main routes in the country has trains going 9h and 30 min at best for 500 km .
Since the revolution (1989) less than 500 km have been repaired to the point the rail would allow construction speed (most of the rails here have been constructed for 120-140 km max speed but due to lack of maintenance there are a LOT of speed restrictions)
To give some examples, the overnight from Cluj to Bucharest is around €20, leaving at 10pm and arriving around 7-8am
If you want a sleeping car that makes it like €25
Timisoara would be around the same price, but the tracks are worse so it's slower
Bucharest to Constanta is around €10-15 iirc, but it only takes 2h for 200km because the tracks are well maintained
If you take commuter trains short distances can be dirt cheap (under €5), but those stop in every village
If you take IR (inter regional) trains, the price on short distances doesn't scale so well
Unlike most places, we do not have dynamic pricing
The price for a given route on a given train class is constant regardless of season, day of the week, time of day, demand etc
You only get discounts for buying much in advance (3 weeks or more), for being a student (at a Romanian uni, so my expat ass had to pay full price), retired, etc
It is kind of slow, and conditions are variable
In my experience IR trains are mostly fine, commuter trains have a high chance of being filthy
Also if travelling on popular routes at peak times (seaside or mountainside on a summer weekend) tickets may be hard to find
The speed issue is getting better slowly, as rebuilding of mainline sections of track has picked up again in recent years
But yeah be prepared to still have sections of 20km/h because of track issues
Just about everything is in Bucharest last I checked
Bucharest holds everything lol
"Ion" by Liviu Rebreanu
Had to struggle through hunderds of pages of what is in essence a story of a young paesant with highly questionable morals which just managed to get me disgusted, even some of my teachers said they didn't enjoy it
Ion by Liviu Rebreanu
A poor woman gets beaten  almost to death by her father and husband and hangs herself
Nice book
Hmmm we have a lot but i forgot em :(
_Ion_ is my second least favorite, for the same reasons as you
but the only book I never managed to finish is _Romania pitoreasca_. A travel blog before there were blogs, aka hundreds of pages of descriptions of rivers and forests, with nothing happening
I agree
The people in that book are so shitty
When I read how Ana was beaten I started crying and couldn't read anymore
Gospodin in Romanian means "houseman" like a person that takes care of a house
And today it's mostly used to refer to clean and organized people
It's funny how weird the false friends are between the eastern countries
*sweats in bourgeois*
Went to Germany, everyone was nice, warm, willing to joke and return a smile
Food in UK is not terrible, quite the opposite actually
Nordic women are very far from being one of the most beautiful women in the world, that title is easily held by eastern european women and south american women
Germany is not so exact and precise as you would think
Especially Berlin
Also the “strict” police is nowhere to be found in Berlin in the eastern block
German stereotypes seem to apply mostly to bavarian germans only
Greeks are not lazy bastards that refuse to work
Russia is not dangerous
Like as a tourist, during late hours, you could walk through badly famed neighbourhoods and you wouldn’t feel scared or in danger at all
Paris is not romantic, it is full of bums, beggars and drug dealers and the pastries are extremely mediocre
If not straight out horrible
So is the service in most places
If you go to France go to the other cities, where all the good stereotypes about France check out
Gorgeous country, horrible capital
I highly disliked pizza in Italy
This might be personal preference, but I enjoyed seafood the most there, not pasta (which was not bad) or lasagna (which was good, but still not as good as the seafood)
Not so much a Nederlands stereotype, but amsterdam, for “one of the safest cities in the world”, has a shit ton of thieves and shady characters
Most of Spain’s stereotypes are true, except for 2
One is about the country and one about the people
The one about the country is that Spain is viewed as this beachy paradise where you would chill by the sea with a glass of sangria
While you could definitely do this, there is a **LOT** more to Spain than that, from gorgeous museums and art galleries to superb mountain tops
It also rains a ton in some parts of the country
The one about people is that a lot of spaniards are cruel blood thirsters that enjoy seeing animals being killed for entertainment
This is far from the truth, very few spaniards actually go to bull fights or enjoy watching them and there are a lot of petitions and NGO’s that want to stop them
If you know any stereotypes that I missed, ask away if they were true for me or not, since I’ve been to all of Europe(multiple times) and a bunch outside of it
I had the same experience, maybe we did something wrong, dunno
This
It shocked me as well
**offensed Finns approaching**
But the northern you go in Sweden and Norway people start to get more cold and distant
Ayyyy
Austrian stereotype checks out
The fuck
Went to London in the summer of 2016, I was terrified
God, the rain
I just debunked a stereotype that was going around for a long time
Maybe someone could use it
Am I living under a rock because I did it and the stereotype is no longer trendy
Are you always such an uptight prick or is it only with strangers
You sound like an overblown arrogant asshole, just saying
Maybe you should debunk a bad stereotype about your country by not being like that
*I have no stance on this argument btw, just calling it what I see*
I live in Romania, work in IT, no family yet, and yes I have disposable income
I actually afford 3 vacations ( Greece every year, one in Ro, and a trip to Germany(my other home) and visiting that part of EU)
Got 2 investment accounts ( nothing big) and one saving account
Also have stock at my company and I constantly buy more from 5% of my netto
I don’t say this is generraly available but for me, yes it exists
Damn
That moment when you realize how lucky you are
We might be poor, but in my case, as a software developer in Bucharest, I earn the same salary as in Western Europe
A senior software developer can purchase a 50m² apartment in Bucharest in less than 3 years just by saving money while also paying rent and other expenses, without the need of a mortgage
Yes, sometimes
I guess is because I watch a lot of english youtube, movies and tv shows without subs, anime with english subs
I read a lot in english, like the comments from reddit
And the thing is that my english is not that good
Once I forgot the word for rabbit, at Easter, in both English and Romanian
So I was trying to describe a rabbit enclosure
"so that fluffy animal with, you know, ears
" I could only remember the German word
I also experience this
The more practice I get in German the worse I get at English and vice versa
Hungarian and Romanian don't seem to be affected by this weird push and pull
I blame them both being germanic languages
I just come from a very mixed family
It's not that uncommon
I heard my friend speaking Danish, sounds pretty cool
fyi finnish is the only nordic language that is part of the finno ugric language family
Sounds good
I had to Google this
So in 2020 it was ProTv which is more or less ok
It has a lot of crappy shows (imo), but all the good movies
On second place there was Kanal D. Which has a bunch of Turkish, Indian and Korean soap operas
Edit: I understood "nr 1" as meaning "the most viewed".
religion=government propaganda
For my old TV it was TVR 1
But a really shitty transmission of it
Now I think its either ProTV or a Digi one
I don't recall, I don't really watch TV
I interpreted "nr 1" to mean "the most viewed". Otherwise, yeah, you're right
I understood "nr 1" as "the most viewed" :P.
Ah, I thought it meant like when you press the 1 button
My bad
Mine is a really small nitpick that once I've found I can't get it out of my head
I'll just write how different words split into syllables in our language, and let you figure out what annoys me
Es - to - nia
Le - to - nia
Li - tua - nia
Ma - ce - do - nia
O - cea - nia
Ger - ma - nia
Tran - sil - va - nia
Ro - mâ - ni - a
Romanian doesn't have a word for "them". We do have the word "them" but it's gendered
Ei - them (the males)
Ele- them (the females)
It kinda sucks since we don't know how to address to nonbinary people
Most of the time we use Ei but it's still kinda awkward
I hate you for putting this into my head
Now I won't stop spliting every country with -nia until I find another one
Hahah this never crossed my mind
I would have split them all like "ni-a". Could it be because for all of those the accent is on the second-to-last syllable, while for Romania it's on "ni"?
TANZANIA
Well played
Ya gotta let them balls breath, my friend
If Romania merged with its neighbors:
Hungary: Hungarian nationalists spawned in Debrecen, Budapest, and Szeged, they demand the liberation of Hungary(and the whole Transylvanian region /s)
Bulgaria: Ok at first but then they'll get pissed because it is the same as it used to be but now the official language is Romanian
Moldova: Some Slavs and some regionalists are pissed, but the general populace likes their higher wage and the unionists are happy(myself included)
Ukraine: Instant revolt
They don't mind being part of the EU but want their country back
Serbia: ?? Dunno, probably a mix between Bulgaria and Ukraine
Romania would be whole again
So it’s a happy marriage
Do you know for how long Romania tried to merge with Moldova
It was about time honestly
>back to the Habsburg Empire
Oh, God

Had a guy from Greece a couple of weeks ago tell me how the recent protests in Romania are all polically motivated and everyone there was a paid shill
None of the people I know who went there got any money, but he was absolutely convinced he knew better
Some people ...
I swear that in 2010 I saw in one of the primary school books that Yugoslavia was bordering Romania, so for 5 years I actually thought we border Yugoslavia
You can't imagine my reaction when I found out that country doesn't exist anymore
When I was a kid I thaugh that:
* Finland was germanic
* England, Soctland and Wales were independent countries
* Vietnam was part of Portugal
* Spanish and Italian are the same language
* Poland and Switzerland are nordic/scandinavian countries
* Czechs are germanic
* Hungarians are slavic
* Bosnia is fictional
* Greece is next to France
* Belarus is a French region
* Lithuania is fictional
* Russia is part of Western Europe
* And for some odd reason, that Armenia was full of creepy supernatural stuff
When I was very young, I would see the shape of Romania in the Weather, and looking at the shape of Europe, I concluded that it's the Iberian Peninsula
Wait they don't?
The thing is
I was the only one to have the error in that book, I had an older version because there were not enough books
So everyone knew about Serbia but me
and nobody even tried to correct me
Gotta love education in Romania
But I wish I was allowed to draw borders too, pretend I was at Yalta conference
There was a show where some people mentioned places where they've been and at one point they mentioned "Vietnam, Portugal" and so I taught that Vietnam was a Portuguese region since it was the first time I heard about it
Then when I saw that they are nowhere near each other, I started thinking that It might have been a colonoy or protectorate or something
Because I first heard about it from a cartoon where one of the characters is from there
Since I never heard about it before and I only heard about it from a cartoon, I decided that it has to be fictional
I explained the Vietnam thing [here]
As for Belarus, I thaught that it's a French region because the name sounded French to me
But it wasn't named Yugoslavia back then, it was named Serbia-Montenegro
The Kids from Room 402
Look at my spoon collection
I was the other way around, I heard stuff in cartoons and thought it was real
Well you also have great smaller cities like Lille, I visited with my parents 3 years ago it was great
Yeah, that one !
Yeah and it was in another room because kids are annoying
Source: I was an annoying kid
Iny community the rule is that if there are 4+ children they get a separate table
If it's very small children and there's many of them we sit them together so they can socialize
Only I was an antisocial kid so I just sat at the adult table and discussed politics and such
I was a very weird kid
Yeap, kids usually get smaller chairs next to their parents, or if they are very young (like 2 or 3) they might even just sit in their parents' lap when they need to eat, the rest of the time they are all running around anyway

That country is called Romania
We have a Constitutional Court which has 9 judges and they are appointed (by the President, Parliament, etc)
We also have a High Court which probably has over 100 judges and they get their by passing exams, interviews and gaining experience
1-unu
2-doi
3-trei
4-patru
5-cinci
6-șase
7-șapte
8-opt
9-nouă
10-zece
11-19 are the same from 1 to 9 and you and "sprezece" after every number
Exemple : 13-treisprezece , for 14 tough patru becomes paisprezece 16 - șaisprezece
20- douăzeci
30-treizeci (same as 11-19 , but you add zeci and patru stays the same , patruzeci)
22 - douăzeci și doi (twenty and two)
100 - o sută
200 - două sute
1000 - o mie
2000 - două mii
2020 - Două mii douăzeci
2120 - Două mii o sută douăzeci
>For numbers 0 - 10 we have unique words
0 zero
1 unu ("un" for counting male objects, "o" for counting female objects)
2 doi ("două" for counting feminine objects)
3 trei
4 patru
5 cinci (for some damn reason this is a single sylable and it always bothered me - makes a bit more sense when written in the kiril aphabet because it doesn't give you the impression of 2 (чинч))
6 şase
7 şapte
8 opt
9 nouă
10 zece
>Numbers 11 - 19 are the last digit with the suffix "sprezece", coloquially shortened to "şpe"
11 unsprezece - unşpe
12 doisprezece (douăsprezece) - doişpe (douăşpe)
13 treisprezece - treişpe
You get the point I don't feel like writing all the others
>For numbers 20+ we use: tens digit (feminine wherever the case) + "zeci şi" + units digit (some tens are shortened for easier pronounciation: şasezeci -> şaizeci)
22 - douăzeci şi doi / douăzeci şi două
45 - patruzeci şi cinci
69 - şaizeci şi nouă etc
Same thing applies to hundreds and thousands (sute, mii), except the number amd the multiplier stay separate
420 - patru sute douăzeci
5152 - cinci mii o suta cincizeci şi doi
888- opt sute optzeci si opt
1-unu | 2-doi | 3-trei | 4-patru | 5-cinci | 6-șase | 7-șapte | 8-opt | 9-nouă | 10-zece | 15-cincisprezece | 50-cincizeci | 100-o sută | 500- cinbci sute | 1000- o mie | 5000- cinnci mii
In romanian we say patruzeci (4x10) și nouă (and 9) (49)
But between 10 and 20 it's a little bit weird
11-unsprezece, un - one, spre - to, zece - ten
So one to ten it's eleven
Unu, doi, trei, patru, cinci, sase, sapte, opt, noua, zece
Just the base ten
Ochocientas ochenta y ocho
>you add zeci and patru stays the same , patrusprezece
Wat
My whole life was a lie, I always used "patruzeci". Are you sure
Same in Ro
6 -sase
7 - sapte
8-opt
16 - saisprezece
20 -douazeci
50 -cincizeci
100- o suta
He made a mistake, he meant "patruzeci". Funnily enough, 60 is not șasezeci, but șaizeci, like the same shorter version as in șaisprezece (16)
Yes , you are right , good observation , I edited the comment now , I was still thinking about sprezece
Yes , you are right , sorry guys ...
I edited the comment now , thanks for telling me about the mistake
Mostly nothing, they remain under the ownership of the military
But last year and this year, 2 unused forts started renting the place for airsoft events
It's a bit of a sad story
In the late 19th century a series of forts were built around Bucharest to defend it from a potential invasion
Most of my countrymen don't know about these places, heck I didn't even know about them until this year and I live in the county they're located in
The reason why most people don't know about them is that a lot of them were bought by companies to be used as storage spaces and the ones that weren't bought have been abandoned and are extremely dirty
If I had the money I'd love to purchase at least one of the forts and renovate them, then turn them into tourist attractions
They really deserve more than this, a lot of interesting history, but a shame it has all been forgotten

Vaya Con dios is way too low in this thread

Sorry, never heard of them until now
Idk where he is now, but he was our most famous singer/DJ once(300m+views on YT)
They debuted 8-9 years ago dude
n-am auzit in viata mea de el :))
They look like Romanians and talk like Romanians
Most of them have Romanian citizenship
Except for random borders, they are romanians
It's the same with part of Bucovina which is currently in the Ukraine and other Romanians living around the southern and western borders
yeah
he's pretty cool tbh
oh lol
Nu-i chiar asa mare branza, sincer a fost "One hit wonder(defapt 2 melodii)"
If you speak the language and are an ethnic Romanian it's as simple as taking a trip to Bucharest and signing some papers
Most of the ethnic Romanians from outside the EU do that because being an EU citizen has a lot of perks
Stand corrected
The ratio of Romanian citizens is still amazingly high since all of them have romanian first degree relatives
It's not like you have to live x years in Romania

Greetings from Romania
Hungarian Folk Tales was also aired here
It was nice that I also recognize some of them from the stories that my grandma told, funny thing is that she is neither Hungarian or Romanian
I guess stories could travel everywhere
I guess it's the Orthodox tradition
I think it's the case for us too
How many other lies have I been told by pop culture
This applies here as well
Wh– Next you’ll tell me that Italians don’t have moustaches
I expect them to act as a team and put some effort and resources into gathering and watching the games together on the tv
Do some bonding, get to know themselves better and maybe if they are lucky, go to the stadium and watch Austria or Ukraine play
We'll 100% win this Euro and the World Cup , if you say anything else other than this you are clearly deluded , Germany only won against us out of pure luck , what do you mean they had a lot of shots on our goal ? Our goalie was the best man on the pitch .
Came here for the TV joke :)))
I love how French and Italian sound
Italian (I already speak it) and Spanish (I want to learn it sometime in the future)
French can sound nice too, but I can't understand a word they're saying
Might be a little weeb bias but in all seriousness, I like how Japanese sounds
Compared to other East Asian languages, when I listen to something in Japanese, I can distinguish the majority of the words, I can't understand anything, but just the fact that I can distinguish when a word ends and another begins makes me feel good
Since starting college I also began to like listening to French
I did not like French one bit because of school, but now I enjoy it
Call me a weeb but Japanese sounds the best in my opinion
For me it's Russian
Ottomans
I don't think romanian will disappear, and even if it did I'd be too fucking dead to care at that point
I think what happened with Irish and Welsh, as well as what happened with some national languages in the USSR like Belorussian and Kazakh, shows that it is very difficult to kill a language
And it really only happens if an outside force, like an empire, try to "integrate" a territory by erasing national identity, such as by forced mass migrations (which afaik happened in both the cases i mentioned)
This reminds me
I grew up in Chisinau, Moldova, where the official (and majority) language is Romanian but there are lots of Russian speakers who moved there during the USSR
As a speaker of Romanian if you walked into a shop run by a Russophone or for example asked one for directions on the street, half the time you would get an annoyed/disgusted look and a reply (in Russian) like "can you speak a normal language
". Granted this was 15 years ago, but 15 years after the USSR collapsed they still had the impression they were speaking the lingua franca
Annoying as all shit
In Romania we had [Haiduci]
In romanian also, haiduc
Although they are romanticised as bandits like Robin Hood that steal from the wealthy and give to the poor
Sometimes they even help armies in fighting the Ottomans
One of the most famous tho was Baba Novac, serb haiduc that helped Mihai Viteazul in battles against the Ottoman Empire
There are many songs and balads regarding him and his sons
Except for today, i'd choose either 1850s soon to be Romania or 1910s Romania

In more official stuff, they are called Roma
i always said eastern europe (romania) but apparently there are debates on whether romania is actually a balkan country
maybe both
transylvania has central european influences too
I'd say Eastern Europe, even though geographically we're, at the same time, central, eastern, and balkan
Eastern Europe if we were to go by the whole Iron Curtain thing and maybe religion
Central Europe if we were to go by our language and political views in the past 30 years
Part of the country is in the Balkans, so Balkanic could also be a definition
I'm here to say only this: what the hell is that username
Eastern Europe, Central Europe, Southeastern Europe, the Balkans
we really don't agree much on what region of Europe we are part of
Yes, but it is rude ask of your guest to take them off
Yes always
Yes
Yes
I only tell the visitors to keep their shoes unless I plan to clean the home in the same day or tomorrow
In Romania it is considered rude to ask your guest to take them off  if they feel like doing it (because it is more comfortable) then they can do it
And we usually offer some house slippers
It is really funny because all my non-romanian friends find it weird that we go from 5 to 5 min like: "please take the slippers
Please do it
I can't stand looking at you like that
So, if you're ever visiting a Romanian and it asks you to leave them on, it's ok to do it
On the other hand, if you're visiting a Turkish person, take them off
From my knowledge they consider it rude not to take them off
I'm pretty sure you never said that to anyone
You know why
Because 99% will never let it come to that point, their first instict being to take off their shoes

Mamaliga, don't get me wrong, but mamaliga is very often eaten in poor villages (Yes we eat it in cities too, but not that often that the villagers do) and it's a very popular food for tourists to try, because it's considered our staple food
I have a suggestion for you tourists, try our soups/ciorba and sarmale, oh and the pastries too
Yes, mamaliga is good but it's very overrated by tourists
Putuleți
I guess mămăligă is something thats considered poor people food, but it's a traditional dish here
Fish and chips maybe
No we eat it as often as the villagers do

Not like every-day but usually near Easter, we do cook up a rabbit
But this is mainly in small villages
Yes, people do, it's not a big deal
Me personally, not really
They are too cure for me to see them as food
I also tried the meat and didn't really like the taste
So you learned romanian
wait,Turkish is a European language
Romania and Moldova
Romania and Moldova obviously
Romania, Moldova, simple
Romania and Bulgaria
Mostly, because they're usually from Latin and our language also has Latin roots
Examples:
Au- aur
Cu- cupru
Fe- fier
Examples of those that not match:
Na- Sodiu (also called natriu sometimes)
N- azot
Hg- mercur
But the W comes from wolfram
Rarely called tungsten here
In romanian almost all does make sense .Looking over the table only exceptions (where the symbol letter has nothing in common with the romanian word) i found are:
Nitrogen(N) is Azot from French Azote meaning the same thing
We have nitrogen as a word , idk if official but most of the people will understand you if you say it , but it's like saying "plethora" instead of "lot" in english .
Sodium(Na) is Sodiu
Potassium(K) is Potasiu
Mercury(H) is Mercur
From  around 80th element we use the english/international form ,probably due to the fact when those were discovered when globalization was already a thing .
For us Fe(romanian Fier), Au(romanian Aur) ,Ag (romanian Argint) ,W(romanian Wolfram ,but this word exist in english as well) or Pb(romanian Plumb)does make sense
Almost all of them make sense, we have a couple exceptions:
- Na - Sodiu
- K - Potasiu
- Hg - Mercur
- N - Azot
- P - Fosfor
And a couple that are close but not quite:
- Dy - Disprosiu
- Th - Toriu
- Cm - Curiu
I wonder if any other languages gets it as close as we do
Yes, most of them do, with the exception of a handful of them which we learned that the names comes from Latin and that why they are different
In reality most of them comes from Latin but they are similarly enough that you would not notice
Some make more sense than English
Gold, Au, is aur
Silver, Ag, is argint
Then again nitrogen, N, is azot
I hesitate to say 100%
But very nearly
The benefits of being a romance language, very close to latin, and 99
5% phonetic
I should probably add that "nitro" in Romanian also refers to nitrogen, especially in chemistry, for example nitroglicerină / nitroglycerin
For us Au is aur and Cu is cupru
we call it Stibiu .
We’re boring as hell for the most part:
- Hydrogen - Hidrogen
- Oxygen - Oxigen
- Carbon - Carbon
- Gold - Aur
- Silver - Argint
- Nitrogen - Azot
- Sodium - Sodiu (Natriu)
Fun fact Romanian considers both Nitrogen and Azot valid names so you really can use the english names for compounds freely
Yeah, you're correct
whenever i find french written on the internet is just basically romanian (actually i'm very aware romanian is actually french)  written in very strange form . Chomage (Fr) is somaj (Ro) , both pronounced the same . There are huge number of words like this
> quicksilver
agh sounds so much cooler
Why'd they change it
If you know how to consider the words (i.e just read them normally ) there is a huge level of mutual understanding
same in romanian (talking about sh) but my english keyboard doesnt have that key and i was too lazy to copy paste it from around the internet . We got a lot of words from french , pronounced exactly the same (more or less , i cant think of an example now but for sure we dont copy your nasalisation-or however it's called- rule) just that we take the spoken form , not the written one
For instance for chomage we use somaj not comagé(how would we read chomage using romanian rules) .
The only minority language that is actively spoken here is Hungarian
Lots of people speak it - while full-blooded Hungarians only make up around 6-7% of Romania’s population, a hell of a lot more people have some Hungarian heritage (myself included), either a parent or a grandparent or something like that (fun fact: the Romanian President is an ethnic German, the previous Prime Minister is half-Hungarian, the current Deputy Prime Minister also has Hungarian heritage)
I assume roughly 10% of the country can speak at least basic Hungarian
Edit: Completely forgot about Turkish
There are small communities of Tatars in Dobrudja that speak Turkish
"Cum nu vi tu Țepeș Doamne
" (How come thou don't come lord Impaler) from "the III-th Letter" by Mihai Eminescu
Often misquated as "Unde ești tu Țepeși Doamne ?!" (Were art thou lord Implaer ?)
It is a quate used when talking about the corruption in the country
Basically calling upon Vlad the Impaler to punish the corrupt politicians
One use for comedy: “Coboară jos Luceafăr blând” (“Get down down you gentle Morningstar”)
It’s used for comedy since “Coboara jos” it’s a pleonasm
Here it’s used to show the impressive feat the girl ask the Morningstar to do, to leave his place in the sky and come to Earth to be with her
Well, it works for Trump
The quote it’s from a book inspired my real events, the second ruling of Alexandru Lapusneanu, he was forced to abduct from the position of king
After a few years, with the help of ottomans and money he came back as a king once again (hence the quote) and killed most of those that betrayed him in the first place
It’s a very cruel story
The only countries we can currently beat are Lithuania, Malta and Faroe
Searched it up and we got beaten one time 9-0 by Hungary
What
You guys have Euro 2020
The whole “traditional life”concept
I don’t want to offend anyone but I simply feels like a stranger at every party, wedding or grills because I just can’t understand all the village life like things most of Romanians do
People being too "playful" or being too "caterincă". I just hate that Romanians cannot be fucking serious
Men with beer bellies so big they look pregnant
Very few people give a damn what they look like after a certain age
And they completely stop taking care of themselves
There are many things I can't stand
For instance holding the flowers when walking on the stree upside down (like when you want to give someone flowers later, you hold them upside down
Idk why, but you musn't hold them in their natural way
And NEVER EVER give them to a living person in an even number)
When I applied for a job in Germany they told me to fax them some documents
Fax
Fucking fax
In all of Bucharest I couldn't find a fucking fax

With the classic "manele hour" where people argue that they listen manele just at parties
"Poșta română" (Romanian post) has the service of sending faxes
Yeah, those people that thinks they don’t enjoy manele but they do
For me it’s always just good music, nothing else, no manele, no traditional, no shit pop
Unfortunately my mother love those
Thanks, stranger :D
Hungary and hungarians have big problems with suicide, the biggest suicide rates in Romania are in Harghita and Covasna
I do not know why
Same here
I enjoy very old traditional music, search Fabris on youtube
What is on Etno TV or Favorit TV is not traditional music, is some new wave pop folk music
Same in romania always “boss”doesn’t matter if he’s 10 years older then you,you call them boss no matter what
Nobody knows (eh) .... but probably because it's because it's in wallachia and it wouldn't get taken if any other part that the hungry neighbours want would get taken
We have a few, mainly:
"Mă doare-n cur" - it hurts inside my ass, rarely used literatively, so everyone understands this is most likely you not caring
"Mă doare-n pulă" - my dick hurts
"Mă doare-n cot" - my elbow hurts, again, we tend to say it like these kind of aches are bearable, but I think it's kind of the opposite
"Mi se rupe" - it gets ripped apart, implying that would be the dick
"Ma doare in pula", it means "it hurts in my dick" and both sexes can use it
"ma doare in cot" - my elbow hurts
"ma doare in paișpe/pedală" - my "14"/pedal hurts
ma doare in pula - my dick hurts
they all mean "nu imi pasa" - i dont care
I would also add "D-aia nu mai pot eu" meaning "That's why I no longer can"
And "mi se fâlfâie", which means "it is waving", "it" usually being a woman's genitalia (labias, mostly) and "waving" like how you'd wave a handkerchief

They are both old and mostly filled with old and traditional things
My French teacher taught us that it's cooler to make that little inversion when asking a question, but then I noticed not many French do it like that
It depends on the name too (how it sounds basically), but pretty often it would end with an "i" for both female and male names
Gabriela -> Gabi
Alexandra/Alina -> Ali
Flavia -> Flavi
Cecilia -> Ceci
Bogdan -> Bogdi
Andrei -> Andi
Adrian/Adriana -> Adi
Cristian -> Cristi
Daniela -> Dani
Vasile -> Vasi
But since most Romanian names are short (e.g. Maria, Ioana, Ion/Ioan, Paul), you usually get an actual nickname than a shortening of your given name
We also like to change a name and almost make it like a nickname:
Ion/Ioan/Ioana -> Ionel, Ionuţ, Nelu, Ionică (male); Ionela, Oana, Onuța (female)
Almost all female names end in a
Romanian here
For male it's -uțu/-uț (ootzoo/ootz)
Example: Ion- Ionuț, Alex- Alexuțu
For female it's -uța (ootza)
Example: Ilinca- Ilincuța.
If you want to go farther, you can add an *ițu* on the end
Isn't that a diminutive
Quite nice
Yep, there's a whole range of suffixes that you can add to the name (or to its shortened version): -ițu, -elu, -ică, -uța, -uca etc

>Facebook is not threatening to withdraw from Europe
Legal documents filed with the Irish High Court set out the simple reality that Facebook, and many other businesses, organizations, and services, rely on data transfers between the EU and the US in order to operate their services
This is an issue over the legislative void created by the recently dismantled Privacy Shield agreement between US and EU which permitted user data transfers
Now US companies operating in EU have to find new ways to transfer data while demonstrating they can provide the same level of data privacy EU demands from companies domiciled in their jurisdiction
Should happen the same to Reddit for all I care
They're all just US propaganda machines anyway
That is a good thing actually
That would limit my aunt's intake of conspiracy theories
Hope facebook will be shutdown in europe, sadly, it wont happen
If that map was meant to represent the continental part of EU, where are Bulgaria and Romania

Anyway
Boris isn’t far off from Trump, he didn’t take the virus seriously either at the start, and #brexit isn’t any more mature than what we’re seeing in the US
I see both countries as needing adult supervision right now
0:20 " and above everything else, all the leaders " ? I'm having trouble understanding this and I couldn't understand in French either even though I speak it
He wants to say that they caricature every religion ans every leader of religion or country ?
All forms of religion should be abolished, and religious extremists, killed
All borders disbanded and people let free to roam and establish wherever they want
We should think of ourselves more like we\`re the same civilisation, not "nations" or "countries". Separation only brings injustice, lack of human rights, corruption, terror and all sorts of fun shit that led us where we are now
Banning all religions and maiming their prophets should be step #0 in solving our issues
I wonder
can't they find a way for offended Muslims to sue the ones who make the caricatures ? The prospect of getting money may at least divert the hate and extremism
Yeah and getting called racists or xenophobe for stating facts
Some people understand things harder than they should
I agree and self reflection is very important too
But at the same time some people are too sensitive and throw words here and there for no reason
Well some religions evolved, like Christianity
Nobody today calls for Crusades or Inquisition
Why can't Islam evolve too and not be about violence ever again
Yes and I'm probably wrong to generalize
My bad
But, how do we change the groups of Muslim extremists who are ok with beheading others or any form of violence
Last time I checked the news channels were full these days with people from Islamic countries burning the flag of France and photos of Macron
They didn't seem too bothered with the fact that someone beheaded an innocent man
No, their sentiments were more important
And even more terrorists attacks came in the name of Islam
So I'd assume that quite an important part of the Islamic world is still backwards
Otherwise we'd see more Muslims condemning such acts in public
It's what they value that's not compatible with European values
So how do we change the values of millions if not hundreds of millions of Muslims who aren't progressive
Or at least the ones that set foot in Europe
Because if we Europeans don't do anything we may wake one day with Muslim fundamentalists ruling over us
Or with Christian/Non-Religious groups of Europeans that become anti-Muslims and extremists
Sort of how many people turned into Nazists/Communists after WWI because of the problems they were facing and because they let themselves ruled over by their instincts of survival
And how do you show them that
Also obviously killing is not an option
I wish such things would be done, but so far it looks like most European governments are inept in this
Type C super charge
I hope
I don't know how I lived without supercharge until now tbh
Is this about the charging port or the brick
like that was the bigest problem in the world in this moment
Super charge is just another name for very fast charging
I have a Huawei but I heard supercharge for Samsung as well, it's about the adaptor, not the cable and the compatibility of the phone, obviously
No, it just charges large batteries faster
Well the idea is to have only 1 type that is compatible with any phone, at least that's why I would assume
This is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, the creator of the VLC media player, he refused tens of millions of euros in order to keep VLC ads-free
Merci, Jean
About 6 years ago, I was working in a computer repair shop and had many customers complaining about malware
Much of that malware was from using proprietary ad supported video players or "add ons" to codec packs
I would remove all those crappy players and codecs and just install VLC, literally no complaints
VLC is proof that open source software can be much better than shitty proprietary paid or ad-supported software

What would the artist do about 20-30-50km long cities
Not everyone works in an office where riding the bike is an option
Some/ a lot of people have stuff to carry around
when you're walking down a street, how many cars pass you
Say 20-30 cars
In each car there is at least one person
My point is that they do take up more space, but also enable faster movement, so they stay in the public space for less time
> they don't suddenly switch to free roaming public spaces once no cars are on them
They do sometimes, when people want that: for public gatherings, festivals, markets ... etc
- I know places that close for cars almost every weekend
When there are enough of those events in a place (usually the city center) that place tends to close the roads permanently
Reykjavík is a spread city though, you wouldn't want to walk in freezing weather for hours every day
Or wait for the bus 30 minutes each way
Pedestrian only spaces are great for city, town, neighborhood centers
You can also combine the 2: large safe areas with cars never being to far away
Hopefully Bucharest will follow suit in the near future

So happy for Moldova
Felicitări
Fuck you Putin
Long overdue for Moldova to leave its past behind
I really dislike this occidental identity politics title
Should've at least put her name in the title
Her name is Maia Sandu
The most important/relevant thing is that she's pro-EU, not her freakin gender
Not a lot of people care around here what her gender is
Where I'm from we don't really care about the identity of the people in positions of power
In Romania we had a female prime minister, a female mayor of our capital city, a female former chief prosecutor of National Anticorruption Directorate, multiple female ministers, a romanian -germanic ethnic as our president
We have bigger problems to deal with
What's really funny is that Moldova can't be considered a progressive country but guess what
When you have real big problems in your country, you don't have the luxury to pick and choose based on your prejudices, you need to choose the most competent person for the job and most people recognize that
Nice
Sper să ieșiți la fel de mulți la vot și la Parlamentare când vor fi, altfel nu va avea putere prea multă Maia Sandu

I work in a care home where the majority of the staff got sick
The majority had nothing, no symptoms
One person got the virus 3 times, one time after the vaccine

Eldery who got the virus
Yes
None of them died
Some had no symptoms
I know this is only one care home out of I dont know how many
But when you see this, can you blame the people being less afraid and not taking the virus so serious
Because people are unimaginably imbecile

Romania and Bulgaria have to be at least in the worrying category
We are the wrestling for the bottom 2 positions of every EU chart (only with EU countries) and if there is a chart about continental Europe, we're at most average
Romania prolly average tbh
Ok results is still ok
We did it guys
This map says we're doing ok, so it must be true
Same about Romania honestly, we're usually at the end of the list
We are at the top of the list sometimes
E.g. for domestic violence statistics
I don't care if it's OK/average/worrying, Romania and Bulgaria should have the same color
Romania #1^*

Yeah I agree
And high speed fixed internet
I'd trade the high internet speed for less stupid people
Hearing about 10mbps or lower internet speed from wetsern countries always makes me chuckle
The minimum internet contract you get here is 50mbps, and if you live in a good area you can upgrade to 1gb/s.
Yeah, 1gb/s download and 200 to 500 upload, though that depends on the package or internet provider that you use
Of course, it's not available everywhere, but even a small city like mine with a little over 10k habitants can get 100mbps speed minimum and it's dirt cheap
Yep, we had that since around 2013
Cost ~ 8 €/month
Same can be said about repeating a referendum over and over until the desired result is obtained
I'm anti-Brexit, but that quote is retarded
The entire point of a democracy is to do what the people want it to do
The referendum was meant to happen once and only once
It's completely the people's fault for voting pro-Brexit
Can some one explain to me what is the role of the monarch of U.K

Reminder that being a victim of an authoritarian state does not necessarily also mean you're a good person or that you yourself don't also have authoritarian tendencies
Being an adversary of the current Kremlin establishment doesn't mean he isn't a far right winger with some beliefs and ideas that westerners would HATE if he was a politician in any other country
Like if this guy was Polish or Hungarian, with some of the things he said
Oh man

But no because he's an opposition figure in Russia he's a good guy now
The gushing praise I'm reading here for him just because he's an opponent of Putin is ridiculous

There is no (meaningful) liberal democratic opposition in Russia

That attitude towards democracy is going to send you either a hundred years back, or to some dystopia that everybody thinks "surely that wouldn't happen *here*, right
See UK ? This is how it's done
Welcome back France
Hope to see you more at the helm of Europe now
Awesome
The EU needs more high-speed rail
* high-speed rail can replace in many cases planes; aviation uses 10 times more energy than high-speed rail, so it's going to be a huge reduction in energy usage
* high-speed rail reduces the need for regular speed passenger rail, freeing the existing rails for freight
* rail uses domestically-produced electricity, whereas planes and trucks use imported oil
I live in Romania, here almost all the train locomotives are exclusively and entirely diesel based
I think I saw only a single power based locomotive my whole life in this country
The only power thing I see are 80s and 90s trams that sadly our overly corrupt country does not want to let go off for newer models
Oh and metro subway in Bucharest
To get to see this country having clean trains that are entirely electric, would be a blessing, my god
Clean air is a good so a cabin in the mountains should be an EU citizen right despite income
Why
Cars are good things
It's cheaper to fly because there are various kinds of subsidies to aviation
For instance, taxes on fuel/energy:
* aviation fuel is tax-free, they pay no excises, not even VAT
* for the electricity used by trains, there are all kinds of taxes (for instance, subsidies paid for green energy) and VAT
Airports are also paid by governments and they cost huge amounts of money
Look at the new Berlin Airport which cost already more 10 billion €.
With the money from building just this one airport, China would build 500 km of high speed rail
Well , if I think of it, I would love to see more people use the train so I can drive more and faster
Mine hasn’t changed at all, you can’t rate them lower than 0
I don't care, every country does what it believes it's the right thing to do
If the voters of the US chose people that didn't do much for the country then it is how it supposed to be
I have to remind you guys that most of the executive things are done by the States and not by the Federal government
Federally it's illegal to smoke weed yet it's legal in CO and CA
The state of NY did a fantastic job during this time
Locally in every state people took precaution
Florida was a mess when it opened its beaches because the locals were careful with the virus but the tourist weren't.
I can see why Poland likes US it is because Russia is right next to it, same goes for Romania, these two countries can't really hate the US because they trust America more than France or Germany (especially after Macron proposed the two speed system)
At least they have some sort of history, and a culture that’s not based on consumerism
(Edit): And they haven’t voted for their wanker leader
I am going to ignore your arrogance and say it actually is quite nice
In case you’re not aware, money isn’t everything, and if it’s that important to you, we have the highest gdp growth in europe
That’s such a civilised answer
I never expect anything like this on social media
Do not forget to remove the people behind him as well, after the romanian revolution in ‘89, we got rid of the dictator, but it was the people behind him that starved us, now guess what, the same people run the social-democrat party that runs the country and 30 years latee here we are, at the bottom of every european statistic
The dictator is just a puppet, the people that run the institutions, the industry, tve army, they are the puppeters, don’t allow them to join democracy, ever
What can I say, Macron has bad luck
Well nothing says "we want shit" like a fuckin death threat right
They got tired of their high living standards or what
Omelette
To be fair, those yellow vests are more green than yellow
That orange fellow is closer to the "yellow" denomination than the rest
You joke, but a former high-school colleague of mine moved to the States for studies and all and after she got married (in Texas, of all places) she once told me that she and her husband have 15 guns in their house
Sad part is in Russia they end up killed, not imprisoned
Find out now how to drop that nunber to just 16 with ONE move
[Find out how]
75% of them are former soviet republics, which kind of makes sense
What happens in Belarus stays in Belarus
Quick someone post a screenshot of this /r/Europe post of a crosspost on /r/Romania of a screenshot of /r/Askeurope to /r/Denmark
i'm a romanian, most of these people have BMW's and no girfriends, in their 20's and with homies
they suck ass but like i still don't know why they do it
&#x200B;
&#x200B;
or gypsies do this
I mean they are the worst drivers i've ever seen
As a Romanian I can confirm the validity of such claims
Pls let me out
I’m Romanian and grew up in America
I drive like I’m always in an F1 race
I had no idea this was in my blood
I’ve gotta say I feel pretty attacked in this thread as I’ve owned both a Passat and 3 series
I only speak for myself but no
When I'm somewhere unfamiliar I have to pay extra attention to the road signs as well as the traffic and that means slowing down to the speed limit to process it all
Also pedestrians abroad cross the street as if there are invisible walls around them
They're the real suicidal maniacs
Ah indeed
Just imagine having to go through the already disgusting MTEROREX experience and have someone blast their music in your face every morning
We gotta spend all the speed we bottled up on those medieval paths our government calls roads
i agree, u/Ass-Eater9000
Uhm no, let's get honest, this time we can't just shift the blame on gypsies
I know some Snow White level of whiteness dudes that do this too
Doing this is seen as "cool" among certain groups, so that's how it got so common
Wow - these vezess guys really hunt for those crazy Romanians, don't they
Heh
I guess that's because they used to be really bad, you'd be out of a vehicle and a few teeth if you tried to cross one at any decent speed
The few I cross frequently have been repaired years ago, though
Edit: yeah, if there's no barrier the law is that you stop, like the other guy said
Yeah no that's probably not Romanian
You would have heard manele
it also sounds like the western part of romania
>at least the Romanians' have the courtesy to signal
Now that's a compliment you don't hear that often
>I’m Romanian and grew up in America
After seven years, not anymore
Dude, romanian metro is a godsend in comparison to british metro
I've been to London and I couldn't believe how loud it was
hate the fact that they are mixed or hate both Romanians and Hungarians
How much is many
That's a rookie technique
Here they stop basically in the middle of one of the lanes of the main road, making sure you have to stop to let him enter the main road, unless you want to crash into his car
Then they will make the "sorry" hand sign and pretend like it wasn't on purpose
Fucking cunts
I wish I had a monster truck to run them over
I will do no such thing
What about 7 years
It isn't
I'd rather be crammed in the Bucharest underground than in STB
Same here
I can't even say it's related to the level of education, I know some dudes with university degrees that drive like they want to die
After seven years spending in America, you aren't a Romanian anymore
I’ll change my birth certificate
I can agree on the last part
I live in Timisoara and drivers from southern Romania (especially south-west, they tend to move here a lot) are, on average, worse drivers
3 out of 5 times you see some stupid driver, it's from that area and not from here
I had friends in Naples, Italy
They said to me: "Traffic lights are a mere street decoration with no practical use
In the city, is not rare that scooters and mopeds are plowing over the sidewalk at 30+ mph to avoid traffic, with no minimum attention for the pedestrians
I lived in Rome, same thing
At least a dozen times, I almost got killed by scooters going 50+ on curbs
Parking is lawless, and is not rare that people are losing shit and breaking car mirrors or burning down illegally parked mopeds
Birth certificate or not, you aren't Romanian anymore
Lol at your idea of the world
It isn't an ”idea”, it's a fact
You aren't Romanian
Great Scott
Getting pepper sprayed from that close must hurt
I'm really sad for her regardless the context
And it's literally just her (and that unfazed dude) surrounded by police
Couldn't they like
push her away with their shields if they didn't like her
No corruption, political position doesn't mean you will be immune to police
Rather foolish of her to read
I meant like "gentle push", kind of like shooing her away like you do with your foot to a pigeon, but you're right, there would probably be nothing gentle about it
We hade the same joke in Romania, about our Militia (communist police)
Thank you for not outright locking or deleting this thread
I think he is dead
Too little too late
They will commit suicide or be helped to do that, seeing how many of Putin's opponents die
Be strong Russians and fight for your freedom
That's literally Budapest
Ha, joke’s on you, we razed all our history down and built a sort of North Korean/Hunger Games high density urban hell and our main city attraction is a concrete monstruosity second only to the Pentagon in size
But our beer is decent and dirt cheap and we have close to zero violent crime because all our bad guys went over to *those* cities
^Sorry
Floreasca is the suits ties and windows district
What a beautiful bad boy you have there
Yeah protests are cool and all, but don't really get anything solved
Just look at everything around us
She would have an abortion there
Even of that can be expensive, it's cheaper than raising a baby
What
That makes sense
Ridiculous
Roosevelt was manipulated by Stalin
Truman was a hardcore anti-communist and stood up to Stalin and his totalitarian policies
They gave us the propaganda number
i hope hes gonna collaborate with the EU a little bit more, Trump kinda cut ties with the EU
I know that we dont need Americas help, but its still nice to see the U.S. and EU working together
Trump did say once that he will leave america if he loses
Well,its time to pack your luggage,annoying orange
Good job everyone
Prepare for Kanye 2024
Yeah right
Everyone loves complaining about him
You think that will end over night
I still remember the "elections" in the '80s where the result was "unanimous", at the scale of the whole country
That's one of the few pluses that Biden has over Trump, he acknowledges the climate issua
The US it totally apart of Europe :)

Europe needs more Merkels

It's good for the whole world that a major nation has an enlightened and rational leader in times like this
The whole world does

Why do people even hate anyone who isnt straight
I mean who are they hurting
What are they doing wrong
If 2 gay people are in a relationship they both consented to it, assuming both of them are mature
Do people really stick to archaic beliefs made 1000 years ago so much
They are woried that someone will mistake it as rainbow road and start playing mariokart irl
The polish state won't be able to stop the will of the polish people
If they'll continue to block LGBT rights it will go to the wrong way for the state
Meh, if it was a swastika everyone would be exploding
But I guess rainbows are nice
Just like swastikas were before they were adopted by a certain political movement
Are they mutually exclusive

I hope the people cheering in this thread will show the same enthusiasm for equality when the genders are reversed too
Then again, this thread hit /all, so a lot of people from the "special" subreddits are probably lurking around
What you ultimately want is a situation where everyone has an equal opportunity to achieve their goals, regardless if they're men, women, martians or what have you
The "problems" appear when you have multiple people with the same/very similar qualifications but you can't hire them all, so then as an employer you have to decide which *individual* you think is better based on things beyond just competency in their field, the sort of stuff you might learn about them in interviews or from their social media
So technically, you're always discriminating, but ideally when qualifications aren't the deciding factor one would hope the employer decides based on **actually listening to the unique individual in front of them** than deciding based on the preconceived notions they have about that individual because of what's between their legs
this sub is right-wing as fuckkkkkkkkk
> In this case, they quantified competence
Since this was in a state institution, I expect it was required by law to do this
dunno if it's most, i'm pretty hard left and i usually stay away from this sub because i doubt i can have the most reasonable discussions with people who defend banks and corporations and sing prayers to the EU and to neo-liberalism, which happens so much on this sub
I'll give you that i rarely ever saw openly fascist idiots in threads that don't hit /r/all and in this thread it's almost like there's a flood of them
Good luck and don't give up
This seems familiar
"works well" for who
And yet the US is still United while Europe just lost a major nation and could lose some more in the future
Kinda makes you think which system is more robust
Then why aren't you comparing to California then instead of the whole US
> Fascism wasn't a good idea in the 30's either
Yeah how dare Italy defend themselves against Nordic supremacy
ITT some nutters coping with the fact that it's not a terrorist attack so they don't get to circlejerk about their bigotted bullshit under a flimsy veil of anti-terrorism
huh
what rumours
r/fakehistoryporn
As of how things went on in the 20th century and now what shit happens in the 21st century, I won't be surprised for them to do it just to piss off the English
This is what I came to see in this thread
Thank you
Vaccines Work
(courtesy of Dawn Mockler)
I'm 37 and I have a small scar on my arm but I don't remember from what vaccine
I remember getting one vaccine in primary school when medical personnel came into classroom and vaccinated all the students no questions asked, no Karen was asked if she agrees or not
Like a Renaissance painting
Is that you Michael Collow
I agree
Most people I know wouldn't be so offended by random nudity
Or they wouldn't think it's obscene and/or sexual
It's the US with their puritan insanity pushing it on others through facebook and other social media
I'd like it if we had a social media where people can be more free to be naked
It's a very natural thing
The hog is also nude
Keep fighting the good fight neighbors
so many corrupt politicians in eastern countries

Vive la France
Thats why i suck at french, let me correct it
Hello
Round apartment buildings in Moscow, Russia
Built in the 1970s.
It looks interesting
What was the rationale for this shape
More vertical space, less ground footprint
This
This is what I love and still miss about these apartment buildings
Every building, even those in the city center, have their own little gardens, in which trees are planted, and mostly anything that people from said apartment building want to plant
Sadly, this trend starts to fade out, to make space for cars
A shame, it helped clean the air
Nature at it's finest
This
And as an experiment in design/architecture
Bro the new Dunkirk movie is lookin
Baguette
Definitely better than its Easter European wannabe counterpart Bucharest
Not to be confused with the Arc de Triomphe in București (also known as smol Paris) , sadly no military parade has happend there this year cuz of covid
> In the period between the two World Wars, the city's elegant architecture and the sophistication of its elite earned Bucharest the nickname of 'Paris of the East' (Romanian: Parisul Estului) or 'Little Paris' (Romanian: Micul Paris)
From Wikipedia
Of course, only the locals know this nickname
You know what this picture lacks
A homemade still for pălincă behind the house
yeah were just waiting for it to resolve itself, right ? shouldn't be too long now
And be a sweety and hand me that olivier salad
What the hell are you talking about
What's up with the white lines in Russia and Turkey
Why are Belarus and Ukraine included but not Russia
This looks like subtle American propaganda to me
Ah yes, the great wall of Russia
Man, I wish sources were always stickied at the top in threads like this
I scrolled way too much to find it
Anyway, thanks
Half of thread is full of nazi germans thinking is ok to beat people on street
It is acceptable since it's against a idiot who thinks it's funny to do a nazi salute in fucking Dresden
Neo-nazis are a bunch of degenerates and deserve what's coming to them
Stop defending them
Over-sensationalized Fake News
It's not only Poland
Check the US, UK, Hungary, Romania, Turkey, Australia, China
It's like the dumbest assholes in world got together and decided to ruin countries and fuck people over just for the lols
As a Romanian
I agree with you
Too many dumb idiots votes for corruption because they promise higher pension income but they never think that a rise of pension means higher prices
Unfortunately the poverty is so high that people accept everything here and is frustrating as fuck
It was an international example, just like the US
People celebrate being born LGBT because of the historical oppression and violence, that happen to this very day
Being proud of being born in one country or another is just dumb
I don't get people who aren't enjoying the meme like a normal person and just type "AmErIcAnS aRe DuMb; ThIs SysTEm iS BeTtEr tHaN tHe AmErIcAn OnE"
Yes, because liberalism is all about the free markets, less government, “individual liberty” in Europe
The classical liberalism we have is quite right wing
Sure, but we have a dictionary definition that encompasses all that, and that is “classical liberalism”
Absolute unit
Can someone explain why there isn’t Bulgaria, Romania, etc
**I**r**e**land
Idk
Or perhaps The Republic of Internet Explorer
Everywhere in europe : *protests*
Denmark : Mh yes duck go quack
Goose march is very important
We go to /r/all again
Up with it then
I'm guessing that if a lot of countries would go "We'll ban the fuck out of you and your businesses after you leave office" he would definitely take notice
Other ex-presidents (besides the fact they wouldn't have pulled this shit), they'd go "big deal, so I won't have book signings or talks there", but this fucker has his tentacles all over the world and an embargo over businesses linked to him would hurt him big time
Refugees are not immigrants
You're seriously retarded
Poor soul
*Where you rollin' ?*
You mean punchflips
The internet here is amazing, but sometimes the mobile data can be shit
You can have 4G+ in the middle of a forest near the capital, or some very poor H+ in the middle of Bucharest
I know that that's the provider fault, but compared to Italy, where I had signal and internet even in the most remote areas, here it's very chaotic
Can confirm
And I'm sometimes still frustrated by it
meanwhile, im stuck with a shitty router from Digi that can only do 35 Mbps for like 5 eur
For those feeling bad, I'm Romanian paying the same and my absolute max is 60Mbps
eu la 30 de lei am 80 cu 80
Ce abonament ai
I love these threads
Reminds me that there are things that are extremely good here
Good internet is such a normal thing here that everyone takes it for granted
I still can't believe that this is something extraordinary
Bruh wtf , 40 euro for 5mbps
If you somehow manage to ignore all the border controls, you would be able to get a fiber optic cable from Arad to Strasbourg for about 2500-3000 Eur + whatever it takes to lay it
Well you do have the disadvantage of living in Romania so I dont think its worth it
I have it from Digi also, but I get 360Mbps
I have the 4€ plan, because it was before they had gigabit internet
>If you go to some african countries with 100€ you can basically own the entire city
true lol
It's the same here
Nobody can afford this internet in Romania except the millionaires
I am on a 56 Kbps dial-up connection right now
Too bad we can't implement anything else as good
That's reasonable, considering you live on an island far away and a connection to other data centers is done by expensive undersea cable or even more expensive satellite
Better than nothing
Think about those children in Africa
salaries are not lower in hungary compared to romania, wtf are you on anout
Selly te iobezk
It's not that bad
Why are they refusing tho
Just drive and unroll it on the side of the road, hope that no one cuts it
Buy an Army surplus tank from Russia, just pull the cable straight to the other side
Tanks probably don't depreciate much, so when done you could just sell the tank
Nah, it's not that bad
Is not that bad
We compare too much with the West for our own sake
Well for one we have almost 5000 daily covid cases these days, which is, you know, not very ideal
But hey the food is great
Its okay, but the guys pfp is one of the problems
It's bad, but not that bad
I would rather live somewhere else, in a more developed European country
nope, having a gdp ppp per capita of  32
000 is def not bad, it's decent
I can confirm that statement, I personally heard it before
At best it may be an exaggeration, but certainly not a joke folks laugh at
They are also stealing materials from roads
What i heard is that the "rural people" are gypsies don't downvote me it's what i heard
probably gypsies
It isnt a joke its a profesion many take pride in
I have so many stories from my vilage that you wouldnt belive
Preach
U get wifi from romania u do it in romanian style
Nah the usual thieves of tracks, metal wires and God knows what else have been mostly always gypsies
Sometimes they make the news by being stupid enough to get caught, and you can clearly see
Welp

Should I be worried
Btw in my country a lot of people think's that in the time of Ceausescu was better,and the new generation are a little to socialist because their lack of understanding what is a truly democratic and good for people  country
Man he was mediocrity incarnate, i can’t believe they’re using him in this fashion and it’s working
can i say snow is hot
Good
Yeah, I used one of those auto email things but didn't really expect it to do anything since I doubt our MEPs would listen
If a parliament voted by 3 million people won't think anything is wrong when half a million are protesting a change I doubt the same kind of people would listen to a few emails
I'm curious to see how they voted
How thin is the ice when you let thousands of untested seasonal workers into Germany and how does that fit into her "caution is the order of the day " nonsense and the reproduction number
Anyone  from Germany want to weigh in on this ?Are you aware of this at all
How essential  are these workers during this crisis if they are treated as expendable
Some reports say they are not even provided basic housing and safety equipment
Well, she has a PhD in quantum chemistry
When the RN wins the elections in France they’ll exit the EU as well
Same with the Italian far-right
Add that to divisive dictators like Orban and the semi-dictatorships of Poland and Romania
The EU will cease to exist in 10 years unfortunately
Brexit is just the beginning
He's definitely more of an autocrat than a democratically-elected leader at this point
Hungary's democracy is fragile at best - I wouldn't be surprised if the latest election Orban won was rigged from the start
Yet still parties like the RN in France and Vox in Spain are on the rise
The RN is France's second biggest political party at the moment, not far behind Macron's LREM
Le Pen has publicly outlined her intentions to take France out of the EU, readopt the franc as the French currency, and join an alliance with Russia - despite that, millions will vote her in the next elections
The situation in Central Europe is precarious at best and the only reason Hungary and Poland haven't flipped over to Russia is because EU funds keep coming in, straight into PiS and Fidesz's pockets
Romania and Bulgaria are marred by corruption - while I don't know much of what's going on in Bulgaria, the Romanian ruling party, PSD, is a proto-populist party whose policies are very conservative in nature despite them proclaiming their allegiance to leftist politics
Italy will have a far-right leadership soon and countries like Austria and the Netherlands are growing increasingly eurosceptic
The EU won't survive the 2020s.

I never said that right wing parties are dictatorships
Counterexample: the Tories who are in power in the UK are right-wing, yet the UK definitely isn't a dictatorship
I'd also argue Macron is operating on a centre-right platform
Merkel is centre-right as well

So when are the antifa and other leftist terrorist groups going put on trial, or is political violence acceptable when the left does it
I see Covid is a thing of the past in Greece
I cant understand anything they're saying but I can feel their pure joy
One the group is an leftist anarchist group which is why they fly the flags, two North Korea calls itself a democratic republic, it’s almost like the actions of group matter more then the labels they give themselves
These fucking cunts where fighting with police and throwing Molotov cocktails this very day
But let me guess the police are fascist
Violence for political reasons is terrorism
It doesn’t change because you support the political ideas of the group
Also pointing out the hypocrisy of arresting one of violent group and not the other doesn’t make you a fascist it makes you a rational human
I know they operated a brothel with women from Europe who were forced to work there after being deceived into thinking that they were getting a job
The people arrested where members of Antifa; this isn’t the first time people associate with group committed acts of terror
Hell a few years ago members associate with the groups carried out bombings against political rivals
How is the group not a terrorist organization
Oh yes because the powers that be like the ideology of the group
Get houses down; respond by setting cops on fire; fine let’s say you are right as of now you can’t tell if these people are associated with the group but let’s say after their arrest these people are tied to antifa
If this happens would you be okay with labeling the group as a terrorist organization
Cops and other political groups they don’t agree with
And by fight you mean set on fire and bomb
Which idk about you sounds like causing a state of terror
Just because they are shit at being terrorist doesn’t make them any less terrorist
Also those anarchist groups you are referring are well known for acts of terrorism such as the black star, Revolutionary Nuclei, and Nihilist Faction which all claim to be anti-fascist
Look man keep defending terrorist maybe if you do it well enough next time they riot in Athens you’re house won’t get burnt down
Antifa is more then ideology it is also a group that act as decentralize cells
They mobilize and communicate here on Reddit on Facebook and other social media platforms
Just because some members don’t carry out acts of terrorism doesn’t mean the group as a whole isn’t terroristic
Not all members of golden dawn helped in the murder that doesn’t excuse the party as a whole
Fair enough
Eastern Ukraine looks the same

Why is the leader of the Union of Britain beaten with eggs and coins

That's why today we mark the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of ~~Stalinism~~ Communism and Nazism
When will we remember the victims of capitalism
Never because capitalism rules  the world now and if someone dares to attack it he’ll become one of the victims
With definitions
I think you’re so prepared to have a “communism isn’t bad it just wasn’t implemented right” fight you’re not seeing that nobody’s arguing that here

On the Y axis it is represented that 17-11 is bigger than 8-1
Edit: Also -43 apparently is almost the same size as 17

Christmas Market 2019, Dresden, Germany
2020 has ruined even Christmas
Dresden, city, capital of Saxony Land (state), eastern Germany
Dresden is the traditional capital of Saxony and the third largest city in eastern Germany after Berlin and Leipzig
It lies in the broad basin of the Elbe River between Meissen and Pirna, 30 km north of the Czech border and 160 km south of Berlin
Sheltering hills north and south of the Elbe valley contribute to the mild climate enjoyed by Dresden
Dresden is distinguished by the celebrated art museums and classic architecture of its reconstructed old town
Completed in 1743 and rebuilt after WWII, the baroque church Frauenkirche is famed for its grand dome
The Versailles-inspired Zwinger palace houses museums including Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, exhibiting masterpieces of art like Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna
Dresden originated as the Slav village of Drezdzany, meaning “Forest Dwellers on the Plain,” on the Elbe’s north bank
First mentioned in 1216, the town on the south bank was founded at a ford by Margrave Dietrich of Meissen as a German colony
The Slav settlement on the north bank, although older, was known as New Town and the later German town on the south bank as Old Town
Dresden has a long history as the capital and royal residence for the Electors and Kings of Saxony, who for centuries furnished the city with cultural and artistic splendor
The city was known as the Jewel Box, because of its baroque and rococo city centre
Before World War II, Dresden was called “the Florence on the Elbe” and was considered one of the world’s most beautiful cities owing to its architecture and art treasures
During the war, however, it was almost completely destroyed by massive bombing raids that took place on the night of February 13–14, 1945, by an Anglo-American force
The raids obliterated much of Dresden and killed thousands of civilians; various postwar estimates placed the death toll between 35,000 and 135,000 people, but in the early 21st century an official German commission concluded that up to 25,000 had perished
The city was so badly damaged that it was suggested that the best approach might be to level the site
After the war a compromise was reached by rebuilding the Zwinger, the Saxon royal palace, and the Baroque buildings around the palace and creating a new city in the area outside
Much of the city was subsequently reconstructed with modern (though rather plain) buildings, broad streets and squares, and green open spaces, with the aim of preserving as far as possible the character of the old city
You wouldn't know by looking at photos of old charming European cities like these the horrors WW2 brought upon them

As a Romanian I don't know what to say but interesting
It's just a map to make fun of stereotypes
"How do I avoid Roma
" First of all nobody calls them Roma and second of all it's common knowledge
Nobody needs to google that
The only trick I know: Have friends that are friends with some of them
the romanian one hurt a bit
Roma refers to gypsies

They're oppressing us since colonial times
I love you Mohamed" and shit like that
the hypocrisy is astounding
Well, you have one culture that went through and absorbed the values of the Enlightenment
And you have another culture which has not done that
And now they try to live together
It's a large gap

Why are we comparing our real numbers with their fake ones
I'm genuinely puzzled about the evolution in China, even if their numbers are somewhat not correct
The debate in Europe was about taking the "herd Immunity" approach or the lockdown approach, but in both cases, from what I understand the end result would be that 60%-70% of the population will be exposed to the virus in some way
The only difference being the timeframe and the risk factor
So what happened in China
How come there are no new cases
Did almost a  billion people got exposed
Are there almost a billion people already immune
Could someone with medical knowledge explain this phenomenon to me
We are number 1
Eh , well things weren't great to begin with, so we're trying our best not to spread this virus, cause if it does, we're fucked
The healthcare system over here is okish at best if you're lucky and have $$$ and live in a bigger city
Then again, living in smaller communities means less chances to get this thing
Who knows how things will develop
At least the government is trying to contain it as best they can
I honestly think it could have been a lot worse, at least until now
So I see that the "equal gender representation" mantra has gone down the drain

if they saw our roads now they would hang themselves
In Romania we don't build roads, we discover them
It is still better than nowadays romanian roads
I don't think there has ever been any Roman settlement documented in Bucharest
The oldest record of Bucharest ever existing dates to around ~1500
Same in Bucharest, it must be an ancient Roman custom
I would say the same about Romanian roads
but they haven't been built yet
Construction on the A3 started like 15 years ago
yeah it means citizen of Rome
I don't get the "bad roads" circlejerk, we have really good roads in Romania, just very few KMs of highway
I've seen much, much worse roads in the uk for example
There's a lot of stuff like this happening and slowing the road building projects
But that's not really the main culprit
funny and sad at the same time
I think that it's normal to have a permit, it's the same here in Romania
Otherwise, it would be ridiculously easy for poachers or normal people to steal or "uncover" and then sell on the Black Market some really important and valuable objects
It was a really big problem here immediately after the fall of communism, in 1989, when we still didn't have very centralised and strong authorities and laws
Maybe in Scandinavia the average citizen is responsible enough to return to the police a seemingly old enough object
Dacia wasn't completely conquered either

I wonder how will future generations feel thinking the same when they will re-evaluate current generation photos in around 2200 or so when camera technology will heavily surpass today's standard (personally I think smart watches will be capable of taking current day DSLR level photos while DSLR cameras will be able of 100-200 Mpix with much, much higer iso and so forth being capable out of the box)
The same will be said for our generation, those born in the 80s and 90s.

So much bullshit in this thread about American cops in this thread, when I was in the US, I went out exploring the woods, at some point got lost, ended up on a busy expressway (it was illegal to walk on a expressway in that state) cop found me, instead of giving me a fine (which he could have) he gave me a ride home
Meanwhile in Austria, I got stopped by police once for absolutely no reason and they started looking around my car, at absolutely everything, just to find a reason to give me a fine
Not to mention Hungary, where cops are 2x bigger assholes, because they are looking for a reason to extort a bribe from you
There are good cops and asshole cops everywhere, it’s not one country vs another
In the US, there is a lot more violent crime than in Europe, so it’s normal cops are more prepared to deal with that kind of shit
Actually there are only two countries between Hungary and the Netherlands (Austria and Germany)

The problem is that most commie blocks you see now are in a bad shape due to lack of maintanance from the owners
You could easily solve their depressing look by fixing the exterior(better insulation, etc

not really
They were mostly built to move people from land to cities and industrial centers
Most commie blocks were built around factories to give the idea that it's comfortable to sleep and then go to work really quickly
In all the ex communist countries these neighborhoods are called dormitories
That was the intention, cheap housing for the workers and with some semblence of comfort so as the people don't get crazy

German reunification (German: Deutsche Wiedervereinigung) was the process in 1990 in which the German Democratic Republic (GDR, colloquially East Germany; German: Deutsche Demokratische Republik/DDR) became part of the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG, colloquially West Germany; German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland) to form the reunited nation of Germany, as provided by Article 23 of the FRG's then constitution (Grundgesetz)
The end of the unification process is officially referred to as German unity (German: Deutsche Einheit), celebrated each year on 3 October as German Unity Day (German: Tag der deutschen Einheit)
Berlin was reunited into a single city, and again became the capital of united Germany
The post-1990 united Germany is not a successor state, but an enlarged continuation of the former West Germany
As such, the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany retained the West German seats in international organizations including the European Community (later the European Union) and NATO, while the memberships in the Warsaw Pact and other international organizations to which East Germany belonged simply ceased to exist because East Germany ceased to exist
It also maintains the United Nations membership of the old West Germany

They shouldn't have taken on new debt in my opinion
> Strengthening them and allowing them to function better is a fantastic way to improve your country altogether - and this applies to the European level as well
The only problem is there is no certainty that the poorer countries will be strengthened
It looks to me like the money will go to all manner of thieves, and corrupt politicians, and the situation will not improve
> I agree that I do not trust our Eastern European politicians with spending, but why the fuck should that mean that we do not get development or support funds
This seems contradictory
You do not trust them in general, but you think they should be trusted with this money in particular, because
why exactly
I too am east-european, and I fear that this money will only go to thieves, and will not help ordinary citizens like myself
I don't see any arguments against this
Only some blind trust that it will be ok, while you write that you do not trust politicians
Which is it
Same here in Romania
I hate our stupid leaders
Romanians have a paranoia about debts, that is since Ceausescu wanted to give back every penny to the banks while the population did not even have the basic food
> Because I'd rather risk
"I trust the thieves because I'd rather have the money stolen than not have it at all
Well, no arguing with that
We'll just have to agree to disagree
Of course, not all the money will be stolen, to the last cent
As sure as it is that at least one cent will be stolen
The exact amount is unknown, and really unknowable now, so you can just say you are ok with whatever amount will be stolen
But kind of unfair to accuse others, Netherlands for example, that they are hypocrites for not being ok with stolen money, as you are
It sounds to me like they are exactly right, and you actually support thieves, because it is convenient to you, that after the theft something remains for you
Hardly a superior moral position

Gullholmen, Sweden
Gullholmen is a town located on a small island in Sweden's Orust Municipality
The town is notable for the absence of car traffic, and is serviced by a ferry to the mainland multiple times per day
It only takes about ten minutes to reach Gullholmen by ferry from Tuvesvik, on Orust
One part of the town is on a small island that is known as Sweden's most densely populated, a veritable beehive of summer cottages and all year round houses
There is a lovely, friendly atmosphere among the small alleys that meander among old fishing cottages and boathouses
There are a few restaurants and cafés in the harbour area where you can eat good food and enjoy the lively setting of the pleasure boats
To me it looks similar to Denmark

60 years ago, on 19 August 1960, two brave dogs, Belka and Strelka, went to space on board Sputnik 5
They became the first living beings (and the cutest
) to safely return from orbit, paving way for human spaceflight
Belka (Белка, literally, "Squirrel" or alternatively "Whitey") and Strelka (Стрелка, "Little Arrow") spent a day in space aboard Korabl-Sputnik 2 (Sputnik 5) on 19 August 1960 before safely returning to Earth
They were accompanied by a grey rabbit, 42 mice, two rats, flies and several plants and fungi
All passengers survived
They were the first Earth-born creatures to go into orbit and return alive
Animals do have personalities (should be obvious to anyone who's met more than one animal) and some of them may put themselves in danger to help someone they consider part of their group, even if they didn't *have* to
Is that not bravery
Obviously the dogs "bravely going into space" is bullshit, and people love attributing human thinking to their pets, but animals do have emotions and personalities, I don't know how anyone could claim otherwise
They're not biological robots who only act in 'pre-programmed' ways, in fact that's the more outlandish claim as far as I'm concerned
Pretty accurate

Hello, romanian here, we also say "This is Chinese to me :)"
"no data" is just lazy

What you mean "no data" for Romania, Moldova and Ukraine
Was it that hard for the person who made the map to find someone who speaks one of these languages
In romanian we dont 1 language to iee in this situation, we just use a random language, but saying that it sounds chinese is the most used
Romanian here: We somethimes do the Chinese version
Romania would be either chinese or turkish
"Vorbesti chinezeste" "Your're speaking chinese-ish"

It made me a little more euro-skeptic not because of what the article will or will not do, but how it was voted on, by people who had no idea what they voted on, they ignored a pretty big voice of the people who protested either online or in Germany and probably mostly did it cause they were persuaded by lobbyists
In no way can you tell me that this article serves the average EU citizen and not the big companies
> they ignored a pretty big voice of the people who protested
with arguments that had little to do with what the law proposal actually proposes
That's my point here
There's a lot of propaganda around the issue and very little discussions on the actual text of the law
> It made me a little more euro-skeptic not because of what the article will or will not do, but how it was voted on
You're proposing to judge the law proposal and the people who voted on it, not based on what the law is meant to do, but on your perceived understanding of the motives of others
You're better off rolling a dice to decide on this
So, when you breathe out, it goes "clink, clink" on the ground, right

The war made the holocaust worse, but I don't really see one necessarily tied to the other
The holocaust would have probably happened without the war, remember that nazis were gassing the mentally handicapped people long before the jews
Also, they had concentration camps since 1933
It was just a matter of time
Speaking of time, the stars on jews and gettos only started in 1941, 1

The war did facilitate the nazis opening extermination camps out of sight of german population, though
I used to work for the biggest independent mortgage dealer in Romania just before the 2007-2008 crisis, and I'd say that every month or so we were receiving at least a call from a lady pensioner from the UK who had heard/read that the Romanian real-estate market was on the upward trend and so she wanted to know how could she get a mortgage in order to invest

Netherlands always know to sell itself
They are some of the worst offenders to CO2 reduction in Europe, but everybody knows them for their bikes and windmills
Now add wind turbines to the mix
These look pretty, but they generate only 8% of electricity inNetherlands
In the UK they do double, at 18%. Even Romania, a very poor country by comparison, does 10%. But we'll never have such beautiful pictures and good PR
> But we are still proud of our ancestors who managed to 'create' an entire province and protect us from being under sea level
as you should, this is nothing short of a miracle
Also, NL has 52k GDp per capita, compare that with 12k per capita
This is not just 4 times richer, it also means they have much more disposable income on average
The Netherlands could afford many more expensive solutions for renewable electricity, like solar PV - there is no NIMBYsim with solar
Anyway, my post was more about the good PR that netherlands has, even when they don;t deserve it, rather than the actual solutions to the energy problem
I didn't get into the entire pollution, I stuck to the electricity production
This is the first to de-carbonize in every country, and  Netherlands is way behind other rich countries, it does worse than even poor countries
You have some unique challenges, true, but other countries also have challenges, like say for instance, not having enough money for hospitals and roads, but they still de carbonized the electricity more

Dutch engineering: Veluwemeer Aqueduct in Harderwijk, the Netherlands
Open since 2002, the Veluwemeer Aqueduct is a stunning work of architecture and engineering
This waterway measures up at a short 25 meters long by 19 meters wide and is located in Harderwijk, the Netherlands
During the design of this unique passage, engineers chose to construct the waterway over the N302 road, where 28,000 vehicles pass each day
Veluwemeer is a shallow 3-meter deep water bridge that allows for small boats and other water vehicles to pass with ease
In addition to this easy boating passage, pedestrian walkways are on both sides allowing for foot traffic
Unlike drawbridges or other roadway structures, the water bridge design implemented in this aqueduct allows for constant traffic flow on the road and in the water
Why not build bride over the water

- "Philosophers" coming into a thread about dead kids and letting us know children suffer today too and who cares about these
- Holocaust denial trolls
- US Millennial "Liberals" comparing **fucking Nazis** to the buffoon in the White House and through the comparison disrespecting all the Nazi victims for their shitty political points

In Romania it was legal under the constitution but there is no legislation made to make it official
The constitution only specified "two people" (ruff translation)
They made a referendum in 2018 to try to change the constitution so that there is no possibility any future judge would make a new law to permit it
It won by 91% but since only 21% of registrant voters came to vote it was deemed invalid
It's neither legal or illegal in Romania, as the constitution doesn't mention gender when talking about marriage
All old religious people went nuts when they realised this and got mobilised by their churches to vote on making it illegal in a referendum
It failed
as an lgbt person from eastern europe this hurts :( i just want equality
I'd love to say this is not representative for the most population here, but it is
Not for the reasons one might think, but simply because the some part of the population doesn't even know what a homosexual or heterosexual mean
Another reason is that we weren't asked, and even if we would be, the young generation that cares about this wouldn't care enough to vote if it means getting out of the house, so we're basically stuck with whatever the old generation that doesn't know much about these things vote
Romania also did
I have a feeling by the time that day comes ... marriage will be long gone

Yes, because all religious people (90% of the world) is against science, believes in "the invisible man in the sky" (according to atheists, who don't know any of the hundreds of beliefs), and against human progress
Has imaginary friends, is mentally unstable, is against human progression, and believes in Santa
That's your common religious person, right
So, in your boring life, you enjoy going to an internet forum, shaming and discriminating every person that is not a member of your belief, and rudely insult people just by bringing up the topic
Either you are troll (which I doubt, because your account is 8 years old, and most trolls make new accounts), stupid, or most likely had a bad day involving a religious person
And no, I'm not a religious person trying to defend my belief (I am more of an agnostic)
The reason of this comment of mine is because I saw how angry and wrong your comment was
>I'm sorry, but adults with imaginary friends are either stupid or mentally unstable
They are working against progression and talking down on every human achievement, because they truly believe the easter bunny and santa claus to be real
Yes I agree with that, and the world is filled with those fake Christians, who consider themselves "Christian" even though they didn't ever read the Bible
A good example is how, as I remember, Jesus Christ whole message is that we should turn the other cheek, and love everyone, even the sinful, because we are all sons and daughters of God
In my opinion, a sin is an action that intentionally harms someone
Example, violence and anger targeting towards someone is a sin
Forcefully taking an object from another person (stealing) is a sin
But being gay isn't a sin
Homosexuality doesn't harm anyone (people getting offended for no reason does not count as harm, as the first person didn't intend it
A sin can be forgiven if the sinner did it by mistake, or now regrets it, or both)
Gosh darn that is fucking beautiful

The medieval town of Monteriggioni, Italy, which has remained intact over the centuries
Monteriggioni is a walled town in Tuscany, Italy, known for its medieval fortifications and watchtowers
The castle walls offer views of the surrounding Chianti region
On a small natural hillock, this completely walled medieval town in the Siena Province of Tuscany was built between 1213 and 1219 by the overlords of Siena for defensive purposes: its strategic location atop a hill overlooking the Cassia Road allowed the castle to control the cities of the Val d’Elsa and Staggia and be on the lookout for any armies approaching Siena
Except for some work done in the 16th century, when the towers were lowered, very little work has been done to Monteriggioni's walls or buildings since they were first erected
Thus, Monteriggioni's walls and the buildings that make up the town are the best preserved example of their kind in all of Italy
Distances from other major towns and cities are: Siena 15 km; Volterra - 39 km; Florence 50 km; Pisa 157 km

Green rooftop, Darmstadt, Germany
Darmstadt is a city in the state of Hesse in Germany, located in the southern part of the Rhine-Main-Area (Frankfurt Metropolitan Region)
Darmstadt had a population of around 157,437 at the end of 2016
The Darmstadt Larger Urban Zone has 430,993 inhabitants
It’s known for the Mathildenhöhe district's art nouveau buildings, like the iconic Wedding Tower
Museum Künstlerkolonie features art nouveau glass, textiles and jewelry
Hessisches Landesmuseum displays art by Joseph Beuys
Northeast, the Messel Pit has Eocene-era fossils
To the south is ruined Frankenstein Castle, which may have inspired the famed book
Darmstadt holds the official title "City of Science" (German: Wissenschaftsstadt) as it is a major centre of scientific institutions, universities, and high-technology companies
The European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the European Space Operations Centre (ESOC) are located in Darmstadt, as well as GSI Centre for Heavy Ion Research, where several chemical elements such as bohrium (1981), meitnerium (1982), hassium (1984), darmstadtium (1994), roentgenium (1994), and copernicium (1996) were discovered
Wile I do like the garden rooftop idea the exterior design ruins the image
The irregular lines clash with the neighboring buildings topped with the fact that every window is different
I imagine the green ones are the original and the white ones were replaced later on

Where's the insult to Turkey ?
Hochland
Still no Transylvania though
;) I guess there is no scenario where Hungary gets it
> But what should it be then
The Hungary label applied to (part of) Romania should be replaced with Gypsy (or something along these lines)
The confusion of Romanians with Gypsies triggers us way more
> Don't forget it also has to offend the other nations
not all names trigger all nations
For example we're no triggered that Netherlands is called (for some reason that I don't even know) Bene
They way I interpret it is that a label applied to a teritory should trigger the people there
why
I see that Transilvania is still part of Romania
The new Romania

Copenhagen, Denmark
Charming Northern city
Since the turn of the 21st century, Copenhagen has seen strong urban and cultural development, facilitated by investment in its institutions and infrastructure
The city is the cultural, economic and governmental centre of Denmark; it is one of the major financial centres of Northern Europe with the Copenhagen Stock Exchange
Copenhagen's economy has seen rapid developments in the service sector, especially through initiatives in information technology, pharmaceuticals and clean technology
Since the completion of the Øresund Bridge, Copenhagen has become increasingly integrated with the Swedish province of Scania and its largest city, Malmö, forming the Øresund Region
With a number of bridges connecting the various districts, the cityscape is characterised by parks, promenades and waterfronts
Copenhagen's landmarks such as Tivoli Gardens, The Little Mermaid statue, the Amalienborg and Christiansborg palaces, Rosenborg Castle Gardens, Frederik's Church, and many museums, restaurants and nightclubs are significant tourist attractions
They do
And people living in that exact place probably pay a huge premium
Same for Venice or that super cute city in Austria (can't remember the name, but it's been posted before)
Edit: in Bucharest, there's either the huge premium or the fact that the inside of those buildings hasn't really changed for 100 years, so you end up in weird cold apartments with broken toilets down the hall and weird crammed staircases
It's fine as a hostel experience, but not as a living one
I think Hallstatt (or at least one that looked very similar)

There are panoramic views of the old town and the river from the top of its round belltower

Yiu are walking a fine line of hypocrisy here cause the EU has repeated refferendums on the Lisboa treaty until they came out "right"
Sarcasm aside some of us in the East hoped they'll go for cheap, they went for supply chain, stability, qualified workforce and a hundred other things we're not on par with
Now, assembly aside the supply chain for car manufacturers is so spread out it's almost impossible some of the production of the parts won't trickle down to other states
It's a big win for Germany, but also a ein for Europe and why not, ... the freaking planet
Ummm .. cough .. we're salty about our gold too
Now that’s a fun fact
Damn

Shameful political oppression what happens in Belarus
Imagine being Lukashenko, crying because your are not "properly" elected and then kidnapping your own people

This is a very rational answer thank you but I cannot agree with looking at it from this point of view
Dismissing Ukraine as not our problem despite the fact it is sitting to our right should be enough of our concern
Russia is an expansionist oligarchy that does not wish sustain any value of liberty
I'd like to think that our principles of freedom would stand out over quick greed for resources
Neutrality helps the oppressor never the victim

If you honestly believe Britain is better off on its own, that's a legitimate reason
In my view, an ever-closer union sounds great, and i fail to see what's so awful about it, unless you're nostalgic about the glorious imperial past and a nationalistic arrogance, but oh well, to each his own
That
actually makes an awful lot of sense
All of it
To be perfectly candid, i still resent it on a personal level a bit, because i would have rather had the UK in it with us too
Feels a bit like a betrayal, like it's a statement on how the UK is better than the rest of us, and unlike the rest of us, it's better off alone
But as far as your arguments go, i really can't argue with any of them
In the end, you're probably right, further integration would have been next to impossible for the UK, and it's better to cut off ties now seeing how that's the direction that the rest of us are going, rather than dragging it out and making it more strained and painful for everybody
I never thought of it that way
You're also echoing my thoughts about the fiscal union, for the record
Also, Germany's our California
You could have been Texas
Just like Texas, we could have pretended that you can secede whenever you want, as an urban myth
The attitudes towards the EU really vary across it
Here in Romania, it's still very popular
You have to understand, this was truly a national goal for us
In 1995, every single one of our parliamentary parties signed a joint declaration proclaiming EU integration to be a national goal
Every party, even the far-right
To us, on some level it represents how we finally chose our path with Europe, and broke away from our Iron Curtain past
There's dissent and some eurosceptics now, of course, but overall we're still solidly pro-EU
By the time we joined, we had millions of emigrants in the West, it made it easier to connect with them, to visit them, and so on
Also, we mostly welcome EU oversight
We're distrustful of our own government ( for good reasons ), so having the extra EU overhead is a good thing, it's a check on corruption and incompetence
EU funded projects are seen far better and more competent than our own government's projects
I honestly think it's also a generational thing
Younger people feel more attached to the EU as they grew up with it present everywhere
Older people don't have as big of a connection to it, because the EU only started gaining traction in the last few decades
This was pretty obvious in the UK referendum as well
Younger people might have gotten EU scholarships, EU train tickets for the youth, EU-funded classes or trips, might have seen it on building projects, might have met people through Erasmus
Basically, younger people are more inclined to have had the EU as a part of their life
Anyway, basically, i feel betrayed by the UK as a european, not as a romanian
As a romanian, we've had backlash before, from other EU countries too
It's only natural, i think, i for one never take it personally
Of course rotten apples emigrated to the west as well, and of course they made headlines, what can you do
See, a european identity was engrained in me growing up
We weren't just a forgotten shitty poor country at the edge of Europe, the EU represented us too on the world stage
We had rights, we had a voice in it just like the other members, we had a global reputation
Let's face it, in your analogy, we're Alabama
Of course we're fiercely alabamian and proud of it, but we're also grateful for having the entire federation representing us and being in this with us
Still don't understand why it took so long for this to happen
3 years wasted for both the EU and UK

It's incredible she dared to keep something like that during Communist times
This is ripe for memeing
If the EU justifies itself as being reactive, then this is a stand in weakness, not ~~prominence~~ proactiveness
The whole ”united in diversity” crumbles (some to say that it already does)
I laughed about this with an old German guy
He said that in Germany, they don't like to expose their houses, but while they travel abroad, they love to use street view
Hypocrisy

The US thinks that the way to fix the salmonella problem is to clean the chicken at the end of the process
The EU thinks that the way to fix the salmonella problem is to have cleaner environments in which to raise the chicken

Good bye Poland :( but wait, my country is doing right now the same thing :(
and we here in Romania are like
hold our beer
It is almost the exact same thing in Romania, and old people eat that shit up
Goodbye Poland
See you soon
Stay strong Poland, these corrupt politicians have gone mad, here in Romania too the same thing is happening, laws are being changed to end the independence of the justice system, our corrupt, like yours, want to avoid jail so they want to end the rule of law
We are protesting and I know so are you, let us hope we will all save our freedom, the opposite of the rule of law is dictatorship
Reminds me of our state media here in Romania, in a way, just less subtle, I guess Edit: "more" changed to "less"
I think what we're doing is worse
They only want to control the justice system
In addition to that, we're also making corruption legal
it is the main public tv station
the polish BBC
This is getting really serious in Romania as well
They started with the same crap of modifying judicial procedures and with anti-Eu propaganda (although not to the scale that your picture suggests)
We're headed towards an Article 7 of our own pretty soon
Couple that with the fact that the core EU has been talking about 2-speed Europe for a while and I can only conclude that EU founders are seriously considering a split within the EU
There may be no advantage in keeping corrupt EE nations in the block
you should look over the fence
in Romania after they saw the Polish example, they did not stopped to the magistrate statute, basically what is changed in Poland but went directly to the main penal laws and started butchering them so that it would be impossible to properly prosecute corruption charges, economic charges and others assimilated
it is much worse than Poland
yes but its coverage is national and it is a very important tv
In Romania's case I think most of the population does know better, the problem was that at the last elections only 39% of the eligible voters went to the polls
Out of those, 40% voted for the jerks who are now in power
That means that around 20% of the eligible voters actually voted for them
Which is quite low
Out of those 20%, a big chunk are poor and old
When you're poor you don't really give a fuck anymore and you accept any kind of quick cash promises (like pension raises) they make
As for fighting, we have been fighting
There were a lot of protests this past year
We had a max of 600K people at one time
That's out of a population of 19M. We have a great opposition party in the parliament which is making life hard for the crooks by making every single discussion that goes on behind closed doors in the parliament public
Students are protesting, judicial employees are protesting
But the fuckers keep on voting those crazy laws
It feels like the only option left is to break down the doors of parliament and drag them out of there
not enough apparently
No, you are wrong
Soros is to blame for everything wrong in Romania
At least that's what our TV says
Soros pays 25$ for adults, 15$ for children and $5 for pets that come to anti-government protests
Really, that's what they claimed and many believed it
looks like an empty cave

I was wondering why this is not a thing yet, tons of plastic waste thrown when you can refill
I always buy the biggest item which is expensive at first but at long term is actually cheaper and always wondered, why not they make a refill bottle instead
you go with your empty bottle, press the button and pay for Liter
This would be cheaper and eco-friendly
Press Freedom in the EU 2020
[rankings ] for all countries
[source]
x doubt
I don't know how the amount of corruption in the press means that the press doesn't have freedom
I went to the [page] about Romania and sure i agree with most of the stuff there but then they don't cite any sources or show any examples on any of the allegations that actually pertains to freedom of the press like the GDPR abuse, and the criminalisation of insulting the leaders
Plus they allege some bullshit about nationalist discourse against minorities which has no link to freedom of the press
And for some reason you have to scroll through text instead of it being displayed in full, really bad design
For all the people asking how is this decided, check [this] it explains the situation for each country
Didn't expect rank 48
Didnt  knew romania was doing so badly
It always seems like the press has a bit too much  freedom here
Now portugal can into nordic
[here] are the rankings for all countries if anyone's interested
I can totally feel you, it's scary
USA can into eastern europe
pro: they're now eastern european bros
How are the protests going
I've clicked on their site to check what they say in detail about my country and they didn't cite any sources, it just seems like the writer's opinion about every country
Really disappointed in something claiming to be the reporter version of something as prestigious as Doctors without Borders
Journalism is dead
I remember norway is first place
I posted two comments with all the countries' rankings somewhere here
Yep
It's Norway, it's not a EU member
I have posted the [stats for the whole world] a lot in these comments, I couldn't find a map that included the 2020 data for all of europe
I have included the source in the comments, but I guess it got buried
[Here]
Yep, they're 154th
[this]
Norway
Uk is [35th]
I didn't make the map
I've been responding to a lot of comments with [this] which is the ranking of all countries
[Here]
Every countries' situation is explained [here ]
Yes, Norway is 1st
[Here's ] the ranking for all countries
[Here]
You can find it [here]
I didn't make the map
[Here] are all the rankings
Every countries' score is explained [here ]
Also, I think they base it on more current stuff than the financial crisis

I didn't say europe tho
there are 14 countries in the green, 33 in the yellow and 63 in the orange, I have no idea based on which criteria
Lots
It's Bastille Day today too
that's a great idea, we should start doing that too
I think it's because it's made by the EU parliament

>blackjack and hookers
romania can into fake nordic then
covid 19 bans worsened the scores as they're counted as well

Stop with these maps, I told you already, I'm not going anywhere
leaving home at 30 ? seems way late if you ask me
While I agree with you completely, I think it's a combination of more factors
For example, I'm 35 and still registered at my mom's place, even though I own my own place
I simply didn't feel a need to change my ID card
When it will expire in ~5 years, that's when I'll officially moving out
But also, I moved out of my parents house when I was 30
No reason to do it sooner, my then gf, current wife, was already staying with me for a few years, so why pay rent somewhere and waste that money when we could simply live there and save for our own place
And there are also the cultural reasons, people in Eastern and Southern Europe tend to be a lot closer with their extended families than our counterparts in the West
So, yes, the map is wrong, you can't take 2 numbers and compare them, but it is also right and should at least give you an idea
I left at 22
worked full time since 19
would’ve left at 18 but I had university in the same town, so no point in paying rent; but after that I left for another town
Anyway, the first 2 years I also lived with my bro and 2 friends in a 4 bedroom apartment, so I don’t see that as bad
it was fun
anyway I’m not judging due to financial situation or whatever, I’m more thinking “if you’re 25 not working, not having a plan and living with parents, that’s bad”
Oh hell yeah, I like these kind of posts
Even though the world would be a better place if we didn't have reasons to protest

Romanian here: I bet it's nice to live in a region with no devastating earthquakes
*Devastating earthquakes*
The day before I was born 40 years ago, a 1 minute 7
4 quake leveled 3/4s of old Bucharest
The frequency with with such events occur is about 30-35 years, so we're at least 5 years overdue for another big one
Problem is, before the end of the 19th, beginning of 20th century, Romania's capital was little more than muddy huts and some 1-2 storey old boyars mansions, so the effects weren't as hardcore
When the next one hits, the losses are estimated to be in the tens of billions of euros and the city will probably be all but abandoned
If you have a still standing 2000-year old Roman aqueduct, you're not in an extremely active seismic zone
All I'm saying is count your blessing
LMAO
What's the matter with this guy
I remember reading about him but what did he do exactly
Why was it necessary to fake his death
So strange seeing that our neighbors from Hungary are so far from us :(

So we got more land now
This is a very interesting map
TIL Norway has a larger area than Poland
Huh
Also, as a romanian, i gotta say, at least now we're close to the other Romance languages
not bad

Romanians approve the color scheme
As a romanian this map hurts my eyes
Bucharest blue in a sea of red
A small island
Highly skeptical of this sort of map if it's all based on GDP
Say you have a French bank based in Paris that has activities and big profits all over France, but all of it is counted only towards the GDP of Paris
I'm pretty sure that sums up pretty much the whole map
It's basically "Let's color Europe based on how many big companies are based on each region
Italy looks like the Romanian flag :D
screw this graph
Bet it was made by a westerner
We'll see in a few years
Bucharest is listed as "more developed"? This is just wrong, they had water problems and all sorts since forever, there are other cities in Romania which are more clean and handled much better

Floating houses immune to rising sea levels in the Ijburg section of Amsterdam
They put the heavier parts on the home, like the kitchens and bathrooms, on the bottom floor to help maintain stability and balance
The plumbing connections are all flexible so that the houses can move with the wind and tide
But how will humanity ever adapt if the sea level rises by half a meter in one hundred fucking years
Oh man, so many claims, so little evidence
Last time we had a “housing issue” it was caused by the fact that banks knew governments would bail them out so they could afford to act completely irresponsible
So far, all climate predictions have proven to be nothing but fear-mongering and we have no reason to believe this time is different
And if the climate changes as much as they claim, why the hell would migrants come to Europe
And yes, millions of people might lose their houses, in a span of one hundred years
you do realize that’s a very long time, right

... that are to our liking
Cyprus right now has way better economy than back then
The dude came back in 1974 and the country is doing quite well
Cypriots should just remember the past and go on as united since they have way better economy than both Turkey and Greece(Cyprus has 30000$ GDP/capita)
I don't know if Northern Cyprus is administrating themselves that area since only Turkey recognizes the country so from my point of view Northern Cyprus didn't gain independence just yet until proven otherwise
Neither of those things should matter in a pandemic
what the fuck
No one single number is the purveyor of all truth
Hospitalizations and deaths overlook a bunch of cases, too
It ignores mild cases
It ignores silent cases
Once you have enough capacity to satisfy most demand in terms of testing, then testing becomes very relevant to measuring the actual spread of the virus
> But then again, it makes sense that you test less with less suspected infections
Or, in the good ole' US of A's case, you test more so you can bill the insurance company a cool million dollars
Give some to the poor fucks being ruled by middle school level politicians
Unrelated: How did you guys manage to get the common people to vote for people who are not openly imbeciles
Oh yeah forgot that you have a functioning educational system
Talking politics is a past time everywhere I think, but it's one thing to argue about climate policies and another thing to argue to vote for the guy who throws 2l of sunflower oil and 1kg of flour or the one who gives you a nice electoral bucket and cap
Hah
We had one of these last year at our presedential elections too
Similar story as well: the sitting president called some hand-picked journalists to ask questions and the other candidate held a separate AMA session with other journalists
Both were called "debates".
Such is politics in Eastern Europe
Yeah, about that
I have to concur
Based on the attributions that presidents have in Poland it really isn't a bad idea
Since the most important attribution of the president is denying unconstitutional laws from what I've gathered from this thread then it'll mean a double filter for the parliament regarding laws

The majestic Austrian Alps showing off their layers
The Central Eastern Alps (German: Zentralalpen or Zentrale Ostalpen), also referred to as Austrian Central Alps (Österreichische Zentralalpen) or just Central Alps comprise the main chain of the Eastern Alps in Austria and the adjacent regions of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Italy and Slovenia
The term "Central Alps" is very common in the Geography of Austria as one of the seven major landscape regions of the country
The Central Alps form the eastern part of the Alpine divide, its central chain of mountains, as well as those ranges that extend or accompany it to the north and south
The highest mountain in the Austrian Alps (and the highest in Austria) is [Grossglockner] at 3,798 metres

I don't like that utilitarian take on personal liberty
Outlawing being a moron is a slippery slope, no matter how few cases it applies to at first
I know we're not talking about state censorship here, but it sounds like you're toying with the idea
In your previous message you were passing blame to all Serbs
And you explained how it's fully justified
That's just wrong man
You are right, in that we need to admit our mistakes and learn from them
But try to avoid broad generalizations like that
Remember that's exactly what the perpetrators of genocides do
No, there are people who genuinely believe that the holocaust/armenian genocide/srebrenica are not real or are exaggerated
That's not promoting genocide anymore than 'fire can't melt steel beams' is promoting terrorism
You won't change any Serb's mind by being hostile towards them with that kind of sweeping generalizations
Like Gandhi said - be the change you want to see in the world

In Romania it was actually 2001
Before that it was still illegal if it was “in public” or “causing public outrage” and the latter wouldn’t have been difficult to conjure up
Let's not forget that it has been legal in Romania too until communism took over:)

Hospital room in Romania , 2018
Timisoara is also one of the more prosperous cities of Romania
WTF are those guys doing over there
[Found another picture from the same place]
Victor Babes Hospital for infectious diseases , Timisoara , Romania
This is not a singular case
2018 in a different romanian hospital, same [story]
This is because of the 'Deep State' or 'Parallel State' in Romania
The ruling party has nothing to do with this
Fuck, this is in my city
It's ok
The hospital manager said the pictures were taken "from the worst possible angle". Case solved
You know what the most embarrassing thing about this picture is
You look at this picture and imagine what kind of primitive poverty ridden shithole could surround such a hospital
The irony is that this hospital is located in Timisoara, the second richest city in Romania after Bucharest, soon to be European Capital of Culture
It's a city that probably has a higher concentration of brand new Audis, BMWs and Mercedes than many large German cities
It's a city where people come from all over Europe for dental work (in private clinics of course), a city where arabs from rich families pay tens of thousands of euros per year to study medicine
It's a city where you can hear sums of money like 100,000 euros thrown around like they're talking about spare change
Just yesterday I saw the iPhone X for sale at the fucking supermarket
There are private clinics with state of the art MRI and CT machines running 24/7 giving scans to people from all over the country
The problem is that there is a huge discrepancy between the private and state sector in Timisoara
Not only is Timisoara a victim of Romania's highly centralized system which sucks money from the few developed region and pours it into welfare benefits for people who are 40-50 and never worked a single day in their entire lives (despite being perfectly able to work) but the local authorities aren't any better either
Almost everything that is the responsibility of the local administration is either falling apart and whatever is done is either of low quality, bad design or too expensive (and usually it's all three combined)
You can essentially find half a million euros mansions on unpaved streets
Many people would prefer prison over hospital in Romania
Yup, that place is pretty bad
I'm a medicine student in Timisoara, so I've been there once and it really was kinda scary to see the conditions those people are in
It's probably the worst hospital in Timisoara in terms of conditions, I have to agree
I have classes at several other hospitals in Timisoara and they look much better, pretty modern too
This one is a basically a ghetto
Nice repost
You can have the TV remote for 1 euro/hour
I went to visit last summer and my grandma was in the hospital two years ago for a mild blood clot in her brain
My aunt was there to take care of her and told me that the service is garbage, unless you pay a bribe and then they take care of you like they're supposed to in the first place
Also heard on ProTV a number of times that people buy their degrees and don't study for it
And not just for medicine, but driving and other things that require you to be licensed or certified
It's no wonder there's protests nearly all year long now in Romania
The corruption is laughably obvious and in your face that it feels like I'm on /r/nottheonion
And last year when I went to Romania, at the small airport in Timisoara, they had these brochures on how to stop corruption and report it
I thought that was really cute
I feel like there's gonna be another violent revolution and the corrupt assholes who die from it deserve it
The title implies all hospital rooms in Romania are like this one, which is obviously not true
This is most likely taken in a small under financed hospital in some small town
Edit: Idiots downvoting
Appalling
That said you have to love all the Americans from /r/all coming over to make fun of universal healthcare
In Romanian hospitals, poor people die because conditions in the "free" option are poor and they can't afford private clinics
In American hospitals, poor people die because
oh wait, they die out on the curb because they won't get any healthcare if their bank account isn't fat enough
I guess they should've picked themselves up by their bootstraps before they got sick
Stupid poor people
and an empty wallet .
> WTF are those guys doing over there
They are doing the same as the rest of the country: stealing from public funds
Its literally such a joke of a hospital
but Robu doesnt give a fuck :(
Gotta post that MRSA meme while you can
[Mirror cause it took a while to load for me and in case of hug of death]
It is better than this one, this one is quite shocking for Romanians too
You get nice renovated hospitals next to some that were not renovated in a loooong time (think 70s)
It is the case of Ob-Gyn maternity hospital in my city
When my wife had to go to a procedure she was hospitalized in the old building
Dark, quite messy looking (not as extreme as this post), rude personnel who was clearly affected by their environment
Two years ago when she had to deliver our baby, she was in another building next to it
Clean, modern, even the staff was nicer (I still think the environment someone works in affects them in a great way), everything sterilized
But that part of the hospital was renovated 5 years ago
But I would overall rate the care received there and the facility a 7/10 or even 8/10
But bribing is a whole other story and change in that direction is painfully slow as you have to change mentalities (unfortunately, not just of the staff but of patients as well)
Because that hospital is in the middle of a renovation
This pic was taken in one of the rooms which have been renovated already
You are right in many aspects
Ah, you sweet Yankee child
What do you know of corruption
Of the commie regime, the censorship, the intellectual void
You blame the public for the current state of affairs, but this society is also the vector of something else
Of years of fear and survival by stealing from the very state that took everything
These were the glorious commie years
They produced people in a constant state of worry, for which survival is more important than principles or ideology
They became party members, they applauded at rallies, they lived in fear of the secret service
They had to get by, had to feed their families and make it to tomorrow
So a grocery shop employee would steal some meat products and give to a doctor, or a teacher, or a city hall employee, so they'd get looked at, or tutored, or get approval for something or other
They would teach their children to do the same, and on it went, for more than 50 years
You see, it's not easy caring for others, or for things greater than yourself, when you're on the brink yourself
People that stay in hospitals like the one in the picture, they live in abject poverty
If they weren't poor, they wouldn't be there
They worry about themselves, first and foremost, not about the dog shit in the street
It is about corruption because the corruption of the system results in the corruption of the individual as well
Our parents and grandparents waited for the Americans to come save them from the commies, and in the end it was their kids that went out and got shot and got rid of some of the commies
Our parents would listen to Radio Free Europe quietly, so neighbors won't hear them and rat them out to the secret service, that would erase them from existence
Our parents endured an unjust and deeply corrupted regime for decades and were a part of it
They are corrupted as well
Now they're in their golden years, trying to make it to tomorrow on a pension that barely covers basic needs
So they vote the most corrupt party, hoping to get something out of it
Meanwhile, the young and able leave the country because they have no future here
Those that remain are too busy worrying about tomorrow to care about anything else
You say it's apathy and learned helplessness, i say it's despair and hopelessness
Even so, some people find the strength to protest, to go out there in the cold and ask for change
What else would you have them do
Set Bucharest ablaze and publicly decapitate the ruling party members
I'd love that, but I don't think our EU friends would
Let's say you want to do something about it
Let's say you grab a bucket of white paint and try to make a difference
First, the hospital director would tell you "are you implying that we're incompetent
you think you're better than us
we don't need you
get the fuck outta here
", because big corrupt assholes have big corrupt egos
Then the hospital security would tell you you're not allowed in the premises except on visiting hours, and if you try to paint the wall, they'll call the cops to arrest you for vandalism
Your own Doug Stanhope said in a show of his something like "give a man a fish, you feed him for a day
But teach a man to fish
then he has to get a fishing permit, and proper fishing tools and he ends up owing to some bank". In our scenario, you might just end up getting spat on by patients for trying to do something good
It wouldn't be the first time this happened in Romania
Every Romanian remembers the Mineriada
The Romanian society may be sick, but let's not pass the buck just yet
The ruling party, the ministers, the administrators, they're to blame, first and foremost, for not doing their fucking jobs
I'm just an average joe, i do what i can, when i can
I'm not a paragon of charity or whatever
But when it's time to do my job, i do it
Those that were elected and they're not doing their jobs, they're to blame
That the society is deeply flawed and doesn't punish them is inconsequential
Can we change the state of the country
Yes, of course
Should we
Most certainly
But are we the ones elected and hired to do so
Nope
We do what we can, though, knowing that it could be all for naught
We do it because we have no choice
It's either that, or be everything you're portraying in your post
One last thing, people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones
You say "as an American living in Romania", like you have some kind of evolved outlook on things
Please don't forget Trump got elected there, just like PSD got elected here
Please don't forget you have places that look like warzones as well, like Detroit, Cleveland, Michigan
Please don't forget lobbying is pretty much corruption in the open
We're not that different, as far as societies go
Not really
Your free and brave can be just as shit, just as corrupted, just as incompetent as our glorious leaders
Your society just as apathetic and ignorant as ours
And you have great individuals and good, warm peoples, just like us
There's shit and roses everywhere in this world
Please, don't forget
This is a great comment
I think you've hit the nail in the head
[Pic of the parking lot
That Porsche on the left allegedly belongs to the manager
>Are there any dead people in the bathroom
Yes, there are
Maybe not so extreme
But it's really really bad
When my grandma was hospitalized for a stroke there were cockroaches in the saloon and the toilet wasn't functional
Well maybe because it was a private hospital
And yes you can't judge every hospital based on just one picture but in this case it is kind of true
Indeed there are some hospitals in the big cities that are renovated and look decent but those are few
The worst part is that churches look better than the hospitals and are a lot more of those
And yes doctors are douchebags
That's really besides the point, of course the top class hospitals in Romania look just like Western hospitals
The difference is the West doesn't have hospitals that look like this
It's not Europe's problem to fix every single thing wrong in this country
At the current state of the health system , I don't think it's even possible
Because even if you helped us, the politicians would either steal the money or use them to build more churches
I can say the same about Poland can’t I?
It's in Timisoara
The third most populated city in Romania
Corruption
Hospitals and medical universities are basically feudal estates
I am all for increased and progressive taxation, for sure our country needs it
But with our current situation, with how much corruption there is in our administration, I'm not sure how much the extra funds would help
Well what did you expect
it says *for* infectious diseases not *against*.
The moment the parallel state pulls a "coup" it is going to be 1989 all over again
This is why I never leave my apartment
What hospital
Now you made me curious
Im pretty sure it's a small underfinanced hospital as I assumed
I went to  the main hospital in Baia Mare, so far smaller than Timisoara, and it looked pretty good
My father went to the main Cardio Hospital in Timisoara and it also looked good at that time
So your picture is obviously not the regular situation and you know it
They probably steal just *some* of the public funds in other parts of the world
In Romania they steal all the public funds
I believe it's mostly an isolated incident, it's shocking to Romanians too
But I don't think it's the only one
The healthcare system is the worst part of this country imo
Things improved since we joined the EU 11 years ago , aspects of every day life , infrastructure
But hospitals remained the same since 1989 , it's the biggest stain of this country , maybe alongside the situation of the orphanages
> Romania has flaws, but America as we know it may be terminal
You do realize that's a similar attitude to that of our youth, right
"Country X may have flaws, but Romania is terminal". So you cut and run, but somehow think you have what it takes to advise us what to do
Did all those things you've said worked for USA
> I wrote the post I did in defense of the country
Didn't seem so to me
Nonetheless, Romania doesn't need defending, nor attacking for that matter
Things are what they are, and that's all there is to it
I wasn't defending Romania, i was just drawing a line between points in history that got us where we are now
> When elections come, where are the hoards of volunteers giving away free food and pamphlets in the villages, trying to influence rural and elderly voters
There already are hordes of "volunteers", but they belong to the PSD
Why should we do the same
Or, better yet, why do it when there's elections, why not now
Because we need their votes
Enough to compromise our own principles, by acting like those fucking greedy and corrupt assholes do
Because, what, our cause is just so the end justifies the means
You're kidding, right
> You have more power than you know
You have less than you think
You gotta be realistic about these things
There's only so much one person can do, without going Lee Harvey Oswald on their asses
Which, as i said before, is kind of frowned upon in these parts
> Step one - the one you can start with right now - is to put a name and face on the problem
We do have a name, and a face, complete with moustachio
What's step two
Wait in a warehouse with a rifle
Don't you get it that it's pointless, that it doesn't make a true difference
> Specific and, importantly, small
And then plan, and organize, and act in a logical way that will actually, directly fix the problem
Then you'll see people start to overcome decades of helplessness
Thanks, real good advice
Maybe you should heed your own advice and apply it to USA
See how that works out
"Deep systemic barriers" ain't got shit on "deep, systemic corruption". I'm sorry, but from down here in the mud, where i'm standing, it seems to me that you, from your high horse, don't get to advise me on how to act in order to save my country
Because if you would have an idea about how to do it, you'd do it for the land of the free and home of the brave
But you didn't. You cut your losses and moved away
Not me, you see
I've been here since i was born and i'm not gonna leave just because the going gets rough
I fight, but i fight my own way
It's Victor Babes hospital for treating infectious diseases
It is, but in various degrees
In some countries, places of business, government institutions, you cannot abstain from taking bribes, your colleagues and bosses will pressure you into doing it
And yet they weren't. I wonder why
Hmm
Maybe because it benefited the older members too
I don't think any decisions at this level are made out of the goodness of their hearts
Business and political interests decided this move
Muhahahahahahah
Bulgaria at least is in the same boat
I think Croatia, possibly Lithuania or Latvia
We're not former soviet, the USSR ended at our eastern border
We were communist though
The current government is retarded
Every seemingly good thing that they do is so they have fuel for the next election
We also have tax evasion, the flat tax rate doesn't magically prevent it
It's not some big metropolis
It has it's nice areas, but still it's just a city with a population of 300k. There is some nice historical architecture
What did you visit in Romania
I assumed that you're talking about the picture and wanted to point out that is consistent with the name
I've seen it on tv meanwhile
Still an exception not a rule
Yeah the infrastructure is bad, no doubt about that
One thing Romania shines at compared to Germany I would say is nature, a lot more untouched wilderness in Romania, and also most rural areas still keep some of the traditions of old times, if you're into that you should definitely check it out
We have lots of monasteries and villages where you could get a taste of what life was like in Europe 100 years ago
The only downside is that infrastructure sucks and the people are quite poor, which is probably why we managed to preserve some of the traditions in the first place
If we would manage to preserve these traditions and way of life while bringing good infrastructure and economic development to those areas I think it would be quite a hit, lots of cool things to see and experience if you're into the whole traditional stuff
Maybe
There's also creating moral equivalency
I think they call that a Soviet moment

The Vienna Philarmonic Concert posted on youtube gets a Copyright strike
from my knowledge the rights owner is Eurovision/ORF, not SME
Yet in Romania the public literally wants us killed
Also other good guides: History books, Wikipedia, or EU4
I always remembered it in school as the one who looks like a miniature version of Africa
For my geography exam I had to name all the European countries and their capitalis, I did well with  the Balkans, but when it came to the Baltics I had problems with Lithuania and Latvia, not to mention that in Romanian Latvia is Letonia, I was so confused
"Sweden"
This happened last time we learned about Northern Europe at school
Aerial shot of Mount Vesuvius, 9 km east of Naples, Italy
Vesuvius and Etna are the most famous volcanoes in Europe
Mount Vesuvius' eruption from AD 79 led to the burying and destruction of the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum
Ah shit, here we go again
Based on the traditional costumes they are somewhere from the southern part of the country, in what was once Wallachia
PS: People on Reddit are really obsessed with interpreting the one millisecond face mimic of the bride
Sad
Now that the part of why she seems sad has been clarified, regarding the flowers:
In Romania it's not uncommon for people to keep the flowers oriented downward like this
In fact, I would say it's the standard way how people hold them
Only when giving the flowers to someone is it necessary to turn them around
Stop saying that the bride looks sad lmao did you guys ever been to an orthodox wedding ceremony
We take it pretty seriously
I call BS
I am from Romania and 99,99% of weddings are just a big pile of sh\*t with sh\*tty musics, sh\*tty peoples and sh\*tty traditions
Stop spreading bullshit
Just because a couple decides to make a ' traditional wedding' doesn't that mean is a common thing in Romania
It is a growing trend in Romania
If you google "nunta traditionala" (traditional wedding) you will see variations from full traditional clothing for the groom and bride, folk inspired elements on more conventional wedding attire, all the guests wearing traditional clothing, etc
Anyway this is happening at less than 10% of the weddings
(My wife is a wedding planner so I have seen all the variations possible)
Traditional inspired clothing
While groom's may very well be genuine , I don't know of any traditional  woman clothing (bride or not) with a such long dress
> How common it is to marry in traditional clothing
Romanian here, this is the first time I see it
At first I thought that OP confused Romania with Moldova
never saw it before and i have participated to more than 20 weddings
Very uncommon
Considering all it takes to get ready for a wedding, and the fact that an hour-long ceremony is a short one, she probably didn't get to eat anything and is focusing on not fainting
Yea what the heck is up with the comments
Have these people ever been in a church
It's meant to be a spiritual place, it would be considered weird or even rude if they smiled, like they are mocking the ceremony
They get them during the ceremony (and return them at the end)
Maybe the pic was taken before that part of ceremony
After certain point of ceremony only . The picture may be during first part
It's becoming more popular which I think is a nice change from the boring suit and white dress
where does it say it's common
You are thinking of gypsies
Romanians are not gypsies
Stop confusing Romanian with Roma or Romani, the new names for gypsies
> those living in caravans in France are french gypsies, some 500
000 people which are treated by the french law as second-class citizens - les gens du voyage
Those are french gypsies
Usually it works like this in France: Someone does good, he is 200% french pride
Someone does bad he is an immigrant, gypsy, call it it something else, but he is 200% not french
Racism at its finest
One hour is short
The catholic ones are 20-30 minutes tops
At least here
Who is Larry David and where can I find him

I'd like to imagine that at first the orléaniste wrote "Royal square" and then later came Louis and added his name so they didn't have to like carve another name for the place
They're thinking ahead you never know when it's time for another revolution so might as well not vandalise the building
Not trying to be racist, but is this man a gypsy or why is he so dark
He looks more Northern African or Middle Eastern than Albanian to me
But we face a pretty big brain drain as most of our students go work in other European countries
Keep in mind that the 1980s were terrible for us, the economy was very bad, living standards plummeted, industry suffered from lack of investment and was mostly uncompetitive, we started the 90s from a much lower point than Poland, Czechia etc
The 60s and 70s were far better in this regard
Also one more thing to keep in mind is that the 90s were characterised by a huge informal economy that exists even today but to a much smaller scale, though still higher than most countries in Europe
Everyone was avoiding taxes which I'm guessing was something completely alien to most
Lots of trafficking rings in cigarettes, alcohol, oil products, massive trafficking to embargo hit Serbia etc
Consumer goods were being imported on a massive scale and almost all informally
However we could have done much better
This whole country is underdeveloped
There are a ton of areas which would be fantastic to exploit, tourism, resources, etc but no one is doing anything
The entire Danube keys is a great example
Massive truck traffic from the Balkans and Turkey going to the west, naval shipyards, some of the largest hydroelectric power plants in Europe, absolutely stunning scenery, ancient ruins, beautiful roads, hiking trails etc, and its mostly unchanged from the 90s. Such a shame
And yet some romanians still miss socialism :(
Still not the best in Europe but you can't ask much from a former communist nation
shrek69_420
Romania also started to get people from poorer countries
In Timisoara I see everytime in city centre or at Iulius Mall, people from India, Vietnam and so on
Huge issue not recognized enough
We are basically paying to train doctors, engineers etc and the west gets them for the price of a low cost airplane ticket
Do you have some data to support that claim or is just a feeling
You are welcome anytime
Stay safe and after this pandemic go ahead and pay us a visit
We have a little of everything haha
Impossible to do, numbers are too unreliable
They were mostly made up BS
However I can tell you from my family's experience that starting from around 62-63 living standards improved dramatically
Things were alright until 79-80 then it started going downhill fast
IT's not bad
Real estate prices are some of the lowest in the EU compared to how much people earn, cost of living also
You're not despised, just pitied
Yup
We're still not growing fast enough
We need growth rates of over 5% and we didn't manage to sustain that for long stretches
Communism is the very definition of failure
Edit: Looks like nobody got the liberty prime reference
I do stand by this though, communism is cancer
Just no
Ask your parents or other people who had to raise kids in the 90s.
> is still the same
thats a lie
Maybe is lower than what these numbers might make you think (debatable) but saying it hasn't improved considerably since '90s is a blatant lie
ah yes the good old inferiority complex don't you just love how we are the worst country in the world and we haven't changed a single bit and if we did it does not matter because i do not like it when i see something positive about my country
We had this at my uni as well, I think we were 1st or 2nd nationality in CS
Yup
In all Italian, Spanish, German and British city I can almost guarantee theres at least a Romanian
Go around your city and you'll be convinced
> without the locals profiting at any point
the locals profit from the wages they get from the extranational companies that open offices in romania
IT workers in bucharest earn approx
2x the median wage of romania
i personally know people who earned 2000 euros per month in 2008, at a time when it was basically an unthinkable amount of money to earn every month
In before westerners coming to explain how we didn't have real communism and must try it again
the name
Arguing with tankies is exhausting, I told one to move to North Korea and he was like "why would I want to move there
". Communism is great apparently but only for others
The life style definitely changed
I remember McDonald being a luxury I could afford maybe twice per year
A holiday abroad was only for the well off, a holiday in Bali for the insanely wealthy
Having a car when you got married considered a huge thing
Coca Cola was fancy, TEC was the norm, and because we could buy TEC every other day we considered ourselves lucky
It was definitely way way worse
my town is not big, it has about 27k people
unlike 12 years ago, yes
we have sewage systems now
the schools are way better than they were before, even the roads have improved a lot, everyone i know has a better life and bigger salaries
the country overall has improved
you can't just get the most unheard of poor village and set it as the example because it does not represent everything
It's not
Free people need free markets
There is no other way
yea pretty rare
> Countries like Croatia and Romania benefit massiveley from expats sending money to their families back home, though
I think there are different categories of people - those educated and those who do physical work
The first category tend to move abroad with their family and make a life there, the others take jobs  and  stay for  a  few years and  return home or send money home to  family
We don't get these financial transfers from the educated part of our immigration, it's the other part
Well curva is also a word in romanian did they say something else

Jokes on you, we don't have highways
Me when I see someone use the metric system instead of the imperial system: I see you are a man of culture as well
Not so many motorways in Romania so it makes sense there is no limit for Ro
Can't have more than 100km/h limit if u don't 100km of highway 4head  smth
You can't have highway speed limit if you don't have highways
*This comment was made by the Romania gang*
Deutschland, Deutschland über alles
Other countries : dont go with a  too high speed  on the streets
Germany: lmao,just floor it  as much as your car can
Romania is not accurate
Yes the speed limit is 130 but in reality is 140 since you don't get a ticket if you are only 10km/h over, you just get a warning so you can imagine that everyone whenever they see a speed limit they instinctively add 10km/h. Also the left lane on that highway usually moves at like 150/160
[If we can reach 130 on ours why can't they reach 80 on theirs
Salut
We’re building them so sloooow
And with triple the cost they are done in west-eu
I still hope that our kids will be able to actually use them

How can it not be satisfying for us to see Scotland doing to them what they did to us, while using their exact arguments of independence
It's labeled because a lot of people don't know how Scotland's flag looks like  it's just to help give more context
Why are people making such a big fuss
Yeah, I know why they chose to leave, a deep hatred of people like me, I’m Romanian, and while I never had the intention to live in the UK I did take that personally
I don’t think immigration would have ever went so far as to exceed 50% of the population, nothing like that happened in any EU nation, I think that’s just scaremongering
But regardless it is humiliating to me, I knew people who had moved in the UK, they all had decent jobs and were being nice people
Only that demographic decline happens just as much in Romania, our population is aging too and our wages are rising
I’m already being payed here just as much as I would be in the UK
The current rate of immigration will not be sustainable over the next four decades and if you knew anything about Romanians you would know that most of them do not plan on growing old in other countries, and are in fact using a lot of the money they make in other countries to build homes and businesses in Romania
And I can attest to being hated, I visited your country twice, as a tourist, spending money I had earned here, in Romania, but countless people in the UK aggressively asked me if I had come to take their benefits, how can I feel anything other than humiliated
We never treat foreigners like that, even when they come from Vietnam or Sri Lanka to work in Romania
I'm pretty sure in Moldova they also use 'pivă', heard a lot of Moldavians saying that word and I was confused as to what they mean by it; I thought it was the equivalent for the Romanian 'halbă', the glass you usually drink beer in but now it makes more sense
Oh, Hungary

Circumcised Christian here
The reason I got circumcised is totally absurd though: my godmother was Jewish and also happened to be a doctor, so she told my mom that she needs to do it because otherwise I will get infections, so she did it when I was like 5-6 year old with anesthesia
I can’t really complain, for me it’s been ok so far, I have no issues during sex, but of course, I cant make a comparison since I never had sex before it
Unless there is a medical reason for it, yeah, ban this shit, it’s useless

Hey, watch out
My name is Remus, and let me tell you, in Romania, or at least the South-West (Oltenia, and sometimes Ardeal) it's a quite common name
And it just rolls of the tongue
Romulus tho ? I barely knew some people called that, and even they would always get nicknamed something else (like Romica), Romulus just sounds shitty as a name, and that's why it will never be a popular, or at least common name through the ages
Remus, Marius, Flavius, Darius ? Cool names that just feel right
Even Julius works pretty well
But Romulus ? That's just bad
So take that
I’d say the date on this one is somewhat controversial

The same article was posted yesterday and it was critical towards the shameless news manipulation by the Dutch
Obviously it was downvoted
Now it's reposted, comments are highly critical towards Romania and lo and behold thousands of upvotes
Absolutely disgusting
I am disgusted and the saddest shit is that I am not surprised one bit
Yesterday I just found out we spend over 15 million euros on a single km of highway
Where on earth is all that money going is beyond me
But sadly, in the pockets of politicians that usually get voted by the braindead old farts of the country
I keep hearing about cases like this and I just cannot comprehend stealing that MUCH money, like sure I can imagine stealing a couple of tens of thousands here and there, but 800 MILLION
If someone told me "Here's 800 million, feel free to steal them", I literally have no idea how to do that
Hope some harsher laws will be imposed soon
Fuck all corruption
This is valid here as well for a LOT of things, but I guess no one cares about the Danube Delta enough to even bother to do that

WELL DONE
Well done, brothers
I remember that in a small town from the Romanian region of Moldova the mayor brought a [marching band to inaugurate a stop light]
To be honest, I don’t really understand how people keep voting the same people over and over again for important offices when those people are clearly corrupt and will use that power for their own gain and not for the people’s. I think this is the situation in both Romania and Moldova where we have corrupt politicians that use populist ways to keep their power
Edit: changed a but with when
To be fair I can understand why this can be a big deal
Ten years ago I started my first job in Romania installing security cameras
The first place I went was a recently renovated school in some shit hole remote village
Before the renovation, the school had no indoors toilets, just some latrines in the yard
The teachers said that since the renovation, the pupils just kept flushing the toilets all day because most of them never flushed a toilet before and were amazed by it
That shit really stuck with me

TBH, the "houses" in Ireland and the UK are basically horizontal apartment blocks
Is it because they call them flats in the UK/Ireland
I'm surprised to see germany there
Also, Italy is strange, but maybe they consider multi-family buildings as apartments

Land reclamation around the former island of Urk, the Netherlands: the 1930s vs now
The fishing town on the island of Urk used to be completely surrounded by water until land reclamation projects in the beginning of the 20th century incorporated it into the Dutch mainland
Now part of the Noordoostpolder (North east polder) the community there is still very tight-knit
>Due to initial financial difficulties, construction of the polder did not begin until 1936
Construction of the dikes and the necessary pumping stations was disrupted during World War II during the 1940 German conquest of the Netherlands
The encircling dikes were both closed in December 1940, and the pumping stations started draining in early 1941
The Noordoostpolder was considered to be sufficiently drained in September 1942, and the developmental process was started for the 480 km² of new land
>“Land usage focused mostly on farming
Less fertile areas were designated to be planted as forest land
Land in the polders was state-owned during the entire developmental process
Several years after this was completed, the various plots were distributed among private parties, with priority given to the early pioneers who had been in the polder since the start
Later, farmers from all over the Netherlands became eligible for the remainder
Candidates were put through a selection process before receiving their own pieces of new land

Don't forget that Romania didn't want to join the invasion
Wrong, the only country of the Warsaw pact that didn't invade and publicly condemned the Soviets for it was Romania
Yup

That would be pretty fucking stupid
>They didn't actually do anything significant for acknowledging their acts towards Congolese people
*they* ?? Who the fuck's *they* ? How are belgian people in the 21st century responsible for what leopold ii did in the 19th
Should I want an apology from the romans for their invasion of dacia
How is this normal thought
Winners get statues
See Stalin
Do they associate the name to the battleship the Nazis built and don't know who Bismark is and what he did or what
No, i don't think that if my grandfather stole something, that i have any moral obligation to the victim or their family
Do italians owe me from what the romans stole from dacia
Do the mongols owe everybody for the fact that their conquests killed 5% of the world at the time
That's bullshit
And besides, it's not as if leopold spent the stolen resources on bettering the lives of his subjects
I'd say 99% of belgians' amcestors *didn't* benefit from leopold stealing and building palaces and shit
So stop acting as if world history is a bunch of homogenous groups acting like characters in a book
Nuance exists
"Belgians" are not a group devoid of period and context, who have always had the same values, morals and ethics
Same for romans, mongols, etc
But he also created/unified Germany, didn't he
Okay, guess i was undeducated on the topic
So when am I getting my reparations from the romans, ottomans, mongols and russians
Cool, but war was a normal thing in Europe during that time (for a very long time actually)
I mean, people in Romania would tell you to fuck off if you told them to stop admiring Vlad the Impaler, and he was a pretty awful human being all things considered
Oh, I agree that what he did was necessary, and other countries did it too
I'm just saying that we can still look up to certain historical figures even I they weren't good people
Bismarck started wars, but he also unified Germany, so he does deserve some praise
It was okay at the time
It's not okay by modern standards
I never said that, I argued against that multiple times
Just because what they did is not ok by modern standards it doesn't mean that their statues should be removed
People always change their mind about what's right and what isn't.
On one hand I think that the community should ultimately decide whose statue they should keep and which to bring down
On the other hand this could create some pretty awful situations
It's a hard topic to discuss
I scrolled through these comments and found 16(!) by you that's some variation of this or arguing with people about this
Obvious agenda is obvious
Next December (2018) it’s Romania’s turn
Romania bans Chinese companies from participating in highway and railway tenders
(Article in romanian)
Translation in EN
EXCLUSIVE Chinese companies, excluded from tenders for highways and railways
The Government adopted a memorandum proposed by Minister Cătălin Drulă - Official
&#x200B;
The government adopted a memorandum at the January 27 meeting, which provides for the exclusion of Chinese companies from infrastructure tenders, government sources told [G4Media
ro] The memorandum proposed by the Minister of Transport, Cătălin Drulă, will be followed by a government ordinance that will amend the public procurement law, in accordance with the directions of the European Commission
The reason
Unfair competition from Chinese state-owned companies, but also poor quality of work
&#x200B;
The memorandum adopted by the government stipulates that companies from non-EU countries can be excluded from infrastructure tenders without an agreement with the European Union that would allow them access to the European public procurement market
&#x200B;
UPDATE 13
31: Deputy Prime Minister Dan Barna confirmed the adoption of the memorandum and said in a press conference that the decision was taken after a discussion with the European Commission
Dacian Cioloș also confirmed the decision
UPDATE 10
18: Prime Minister Florin Cîțu declared this morning that "there must be an emergency ordinance, you will have the information when it will happen".
Important: according to the memorandum adopted by the government, the exclusion will apply to both future and ongoing auctions
In this case, the large Chinese state-controlled companies participating in major tenders, such as the Sibiu-Pitești Highway, the Pitești-Craiova expressway and the purchase of electric trains launched by the Railway Reform Authority, could be directly affected
&#x200B;
The memorandum does not explicitly provide for the elimination of Chinese companies from auctions, but for companies from third countries that do not have agreements for entering the European public auction market, but China is one of these countries, according to [G4Media
ro]
&#x200B;
The draft GEO that will implement the memorandum adopted by the government will be prepared by the General Secretariat of the government and the National Agency for Public Procurement (ANAP)
&#x200B;
The reasons for excluding Chinese companies from tenders in Romania are the unfair competition caused by their support by the Chinese state, the lack of approval of their products in the EU, but also the history of failed or poorly executed works in other European countries
&#x200B;
At the moment, several Chinese companies are involved in tenders for major infrastructure objectives in Romania
These are China Railway 14th Bureau Group, Sinohydro Corporation and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), all participants in the tenders for sections of the Bucharest ring highway, the Pitesti - Sibiu Highway and the Pitesti - Sibiu expressway, works totaling over 3
5 billion euros
&#x200B;
The Chinese contested many of the auction results, which led to the extension of the design and execution period and, implicitly, to the delay of the projects
&#x200B;
In addition, the CRRC Quingdao Sifang company won in front of Alstom and Siemens the tender of 1
7 billion lei for 40 electric trains, but its trains are not yet approved by the European Railway Authority (ERA)
If the Chinese manufacturer does not obtain European approval within a year and a half, the Romanian state will ask the court to refund the advance and will award the contract to the second place bidder - all with a delay of many years
A new tender for another 20 electric trains launched in 2019 has been challenged by the Chinese manufacturer and will be restored after almost a year and a half
&#x200B;
What is the Ministry of Transport based on in an attempt to exclude Chinese companies from the tender
The EU legal provisions that allow such behavior are contained in the European Commission Communication no
5494 of 2019
It states that “economic operators from third countries, which do not have an agreement providing for the opening of the EU public procurement market or whose products, services and works do not fall under such an agreement, do not have secure access to EU procurement procedures and may be excluded ”. The EU has concluded a Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) with 19 third countries, including the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Israel and Moldova, but China is not a signatory
As such, Chinese companies can be excluded from EU public tenders
&#x200B;
The Ministry of Transport claims that Chinese companies are increasingly participating in tenders for road and rail infrastructure in Romania and distort competition through dumping prices that they can afford thanks to state aid received from the Chinese government
In addition, according to the Ministry of Transport, Chinese companies do not have the certifications and approvals required by the EU, such as construction in areas protected, protection and safety of employees
&#x200B;
In addition, there have been cases of bad practice in Europe by some Chinese companies involved in major infrastructure works
The best known example comes from Poland, which terminated in 2011 the contract with Covec for the construction of a large highway
The Chinese company did not have the financial capacity to support the works, despite winning the tender
Similar situations, which have led to major political scandals, have occurred in northern Macedonia and Montenegro

Nicely done
I hope more EU countries take this stance
The reasoning behind this, I quote "Unfair competition due to subsidies/support from the Chinese gvt" and "poor quality work".
The proposition does not target Chinese companies specifically but says all non EU companies that do not have an agreement with the EU to participate in public acquisition tenders can be excluded from the process
I support this stance
As long as EU companies are not allowed to operate and participate in tenders in China why should we allow them to do so here
Also the way they behaved in regards to this pandemic is absolutely appalling, threatening and bullying countries like Sweden and France, imposing economic sanctions on Australia because they wanted to investigate the origins of the virus, conditioning countries that had received medical equipment to publicly thank the Chinese gvt for it etc
Many people don't know this but back in Dec 2019, the EU actually sent many supplies to China to help them out, though we never made a fuss about it
When the tables turned they used this as a political tool
Shame on them
In another example of something similar, a few of years ago, there was a big tender for a nuclear power plant, here in Romania, they wanted to build two more reactors, the company that was the front runner was a Chinese company, it undercut by large margin every American and European company that submitted an offer
There were fears that the work would be shoddy, and you don't f around with nuke reactors
We all know what happened the last time
The contract got cancelled altogether because of the Chinese companies, they didn't really want to ban them nor was there a legal tool to allow this and also the gvt didn't want to deal with the political fallout of such a decision back then
I'm glad the political climate changed enough for such a move
This is a new policy from this new government that Ilike, compared to PSD which would make even more deals with the chinese if they could
While from the outside, this may look like a solid decision and a very healthy one too, this is in fact really shitty
Why
You may ask
Our country has a very specific way of functioning
A company owned by a relative of a corrupt politician is getting jobs
The deadlines are absolutely possible yet they are never hit properly
The amount of work put into these projects is shitty yet every single hour gets paid and they get really lazy and progress is slow
Jobs are quite often done poorly and when the job finishes, the whole project has to restart
That means, new funds are needed and another 5-10 years are wasted on the said project
Romania should have been covered with highways from top to bottom
Yet we barely have ANY highways at all strictly because all the money for said highways are in the pockets of corrupt politicians (often of the "PSD" party) who are consistently promising left & right
Old farts constantly trust them even though they have been backstabbed multiple times by the same people, they get voted
proper work gets done for like a week or two and then back to working as little as possible for as much pay as possible
I see some other Romanians praising this as well and the blind nationalism can be seen
Either people who didn't look a single second at what exactly is happening in Romania are commenting or just people who hate the concept of getting any help from China are commenting
None of them most likely know just how much money gets wasted in this bottomless pit known as Romania
And oh boy
when we'll hit rock bottom, politicians will be drinking expensive champagne and will laugh while 90% of the country will face serious consequences
And yet
people from my country still do not wish to go and vote whenever given the chance while old farts who are on their way out are slowly ruining this country by voting when most of the time, they do not even know why they are voting, they are just being told to do so and are bribed with an euro or two worth of goods
Not from a Fidesz member
It's called bootlicking to the Americans, not backbone
Good, let them build nuclear reactors in Poland to prove to the rest of us that you guys are not sinophobic
They do, in order to get residence
Big problem this because they are needlessly driving prices up in places
Look what happened in Vancouver Canada because of them
Most rich Chinese are desperate to get an anchor somewhere outside China in case they fall out of grace
They’ve been kicked out of some African countries for the way they treated locals or done jobs
Good point on irrational fears
Fears in this case are totally founded
Why
America will have to change in the long run
It cannot sustain itself with just financial services and printing dollars
It's simply not feasible to import far more than they export in the long run like they did for the last 30 years
They will have to reduce imports to balance the trade deficit, whether they want it or not
China is already EU's top trade partner and the difference will grow as the US imports from Europe will go down
I have no issues with anyone rich or poor buying a house if they intend to live in it or rent it out, however they never even set foot there, they buy it for residence visa schemes, they don't rent them because they're supposed to be residents and they just sit there empty
This is a problem imo
Allow them to buy AFTER they've established residence not in order to
This way you weed out 95% of such practices
> we can easily afford to neutralize them
>They are very deep into our systems of governance
Sounds like you're not judging the battle on all fronts
Russia being "deep" in western systems means they specialized vertically while the west horizontally
>quite a lot can be done
Sounds eerily [like the GoT dialogue between Cersei and Littlefinger] what good is having 20x the money one actor has when your will is staggered or even crippled by the enemy
Ancient Macedonia was much smaller and poorer than the Persian Empire and they still won because they focused on amassing the weapons and trained men and utilized techniques which simply surpassed their enemies on the battlefronts that mattered
Russia was underestimated many times by military geniuses which were undefeated until succumbing to either Russian political or territorial advantages which were capitalized by simply more shrewd people
Yeah, not anymore
That bullet already sunk in: Trump, Brexit, far-right party ratings rising across europe, avalance of fake-news, nord-stream 2
Before 2015 how many people have even considered Russia to mount such a soft-power offensive and be that effective at corroding the trust of the most powerful western nations in one another
Before 2014 how many people would've thought Russia would actually invade Ukraine
Most people were too busy gawking at the middle east to think that sophisticated
RemindMe
December 1st, 2020
Amen to that
There goes my sense of pride and accomplishment
> Which is a bit of a weird explanation if you ask me
Not as weird as you might think
You don't even know if the lootboxes you purchase are rigged or not
When you buy a booster pack, you know there are cards in it
When you open EA's lootbox, you can't know if the algorithm behind it decided you don't deserve to get anything good today
People are extremely naive to think EA doesn't rig the lootboxes
At least 35
000 people protesting against the government in Bucharest
Just came back from the protest, I couldn't resist the cold anymore, also I have an exam on Monday
Hopefully, my nationals will be stronger and more active than me, today
Edit: I passed the exam
It's becoming a cultural thing here
We are going protesting as easy as going to the cinema
I am glad of it
The press here said we were about 60
000 out there
Is possible to force a new election
Also remember to vote next time not just protest
man its too cold for that shit ill just stay here enjoy my hot cocoa in my warm bed and ... of fuck I've got exams on Tuesday god fuck me
Actualy less than a month untill we make the full year of protests
Altho protests were only held in the winter, because these kind of decisions were made only in winter
They think that the cold weather and snow will keep us off the streets
And that late in the night decisions will surprise us so much, we won't have time to react
That is the reason we took a break from march to december, but I guess you could call it a full year
Directly , probably not , this government is too corrupt to actually care about the hundreds of thousands of people protesting against them
The long term goal are the elections
The parliament election and the Presidential ones
PSD has a loyal following of elderly people , people benefiting from social welfare or generally poor individuals that vote them constantly based on empty promises that never come in fruition
The votes of these people are basically set in stone , but they are not a huge number
On the last presidential elections the PSD candidate lost against Klaus Iohannis because more and more people rallied against them and decided to participate in the elections
The turnout was surprisingly high , so they lost
That's the goal , to make the people who are undecided or usually abstain from the elections to go out there and cast their vote
For this aspect , yes , the protests are definitely making a change
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
About 70k in Bucharest and 100k overall
Basically, the current government is trying to turn us into a pseudo-dictatorship and get us out of the EU and closer to Russia
We are protesting so that doesn't happen
We have better beer though
They have a loyal following , so the votes of their fan base will probably remain set in stone
If the silent majority is encouraged to go out and vote , the chances for PSD drop dramatically , because those people are more unlikely to vote for the current government , especially one which hasn't delivered even 10% of their campaign promises
And the protests are encouraging in this aspect , more and more people join them , so maybe more people are actually getting interested in politics again , so the turnout
should be higher
No, if elections were to be held tomorrow, not much will change
Maybe one or two of the smaller parties might not make it in parliament, but the big ones will most likely get the same results
We hate corruption and the corrupt thieves running our country
We want a change
We want a country run by decent and honest people
Democracy mean governing within rule of law, with checks and balances together with the judicial system
Winning the election doesn't grant you right to dictatorship for 4 years
Complete opposite
The people are protesting against the corruption that it's happening inside this government
They are protesting against the socialist party PSD , against the third change of prime minister in one year , caused by internal disputes in the PSD camp , against the proposed justice laws , which will make it much harder for prosecutors to actually investigate corruption cases
People are protesting because they are sick of this continuous shit , we want a normal country , aligned with the European values , not one that it's still struggling to escape the Communism's shadow
Is Ceausescu the only Romanian name you know
Cause I can't imagine why else you'd bring him up
Go back to your cave
Directly probably not
The goals are the next elections
Presidential and for the Parliament
If the silent majority is encouraged to go out and actually cast their vote , PSD stands no chance
It happened before , on the last Presidential elections , when the turnout was much bigger than anticipated , and Klaus Iohannis won against the PSD candidate , Victor Ponta
Don't feed the trolls
Well, having one of the best internet connections in the world fades in importance  when you take into consideration the fact that we're speeding back towards dictatorship
Well , personally I like Timisoreana
No , it's not about that
The social democratic party ( PSD ) doesn't really follow a strict ideology . They are just corrupt , and they follow their own agenda , trying to adapt the justice laws of the country in order to escape prosecution
That's why the people are protesting , because they are corrupt and don't care about the will of the people
Not because of nationalism or a clash between ideologies
Absolutely

I've seen a somewhat related joke this week on social media (I'm translating here so here's to not getting lost in translation) :
- OMG those tourists on the street were using such bad language
- Cursing, huh
- No they were speaking Finnish
If you don’t pay attention, the clouds kinda look like flying cars, which fits the theme quite nicely
Can’t confirm, the street shown is not just a huge traffic jam
Try squinting your eyes really hard and maybe tear up a bit
Could work, worst case scenario you look like an idiot
dunno man, maybe the clouds come from my cigars
30 of my smoking buddies seem to agree tho
Tbh I find your links far more depressing than the OP
Personal preference I guess
How did they fix it irl
In the game I usually have to demolish like 20 skyscrapers and a roundabout magically appears out of nowhere in an instant
I wouldn’t say wrong, more like having an unpopular opinion
It’s all subjective
In the picture you saw teo people who disagree with me
What does that have to do with anything
I’m aware my opinion is unpopular, I’m not sure how that discards it
The reason is that the vast majority of people enjoy certain styles, and the reverse: certain places were specifically designed to incorporate the traits that the vast majority of people enjoys
But let’s go around calling those with a different opinion insane, shall we
I feel very uncomfortable and lonely being surrounded by a large amount of people having fun
My idea of fun when outside (I generally prefer indoors) is discussing certain topics (history, physics, video games) with one, maybe two friends and making jokes about them
I find the noise that comes with being surrounded by people annoying, which makes me self-conscious to not do the same to them, which leads to me closing up and not really interacting with my friends anymore
That is not fun, that is boring
Boredom makes me close up even more, but then I remember that I am in public and look about as out of place as I feel, which again makes me self-conscious
In that case I don’t really know what to do, so I kind of just panic and try to get home asap
tl;dr i hate when other people have fun
I don’t find anything in particular that is really wrong
It looks ok, there are just some  (probably perfectly justified) things that bother me
One example is how if you look to the right, the street just seems to go into a wall with nothing behind it
I’m sure there’s a great reason for that (lake
), but I don’t like how empty it feels
Next, the White House feels really out of place imo
You have glass blocks to the left, then you have this 19th century thing slapped in there, kinda like a poor facade
Looking at the lake, the fence and the traffic signs ruin the scene for me
I understand why they’re necessary, but that isn’t enough for my brain to accept it
The blocks also feel a little put of place to me
This is 100% true for Romanian, I had an interesting time adapting to these anglo world sentences
A Romanian priest blessed a christian tv office with a painting roller a few years ago

Oooohh, yeah, oh yeah
We have plenty of corruption
But we're getting rid of it, sure, takes time and effort and the road isn't always smooth or straight, but fuck it, one way or the other, we'll get rid of it
Hopefully it will not be approved by the member states' governments
Making a vague document like the Paris Agreement legally binding is not a good idea
I can see a future where the bigger the man the more the vote counts
One achieving higher vote count by salary, education etc
Its surelly not perfect and has a lot of flaws
What other voting sistems could save democracy in future
Stupidity and ignorance is the next plague
Why do Redditors have to act like literally everything ever is a foregone conclusion
Just because you can find an explanation for a fact doesn't mean your explanation is true, nor does it mean that it's the whole picture and that all investigation should therefore stop
Stop shitting on people who do the actual hard work of finding proofs and data with your armchair know-it-all smugness
It's not the way forward
It never was meant to be the way forward
Full democracy (referendums) is simply the tyranny of the majority

How safe is this
Massive worldwide protests like many unaffected countries are doing now in solidarity with the racial problem in US
Yesterday an old lady came into my shop and she was angry that the shops will close soon
She thought it was stupid
And asked her: how do you think the hospitals will be able to treat pacients, if everybody gets sick
Her response: yeah, but not everybody goes to hospital
So yeah
I stoped talking to her
Good, sensible advice
Today we closed at 3 pm
The shop will stay closed until further notice
So, starting now I will try to stay inside the house as much as I can
Turkey is like: armenia kinda sus

I think they would offer better protection than nothing, at least your eyes won't get sprayed directly, but the gas would still make it's way in, and you'd then probably want to remove it

Castillo de Coca (Castle of Coca) - Central Spain
Castle of Coca located in Segovia, Spain, was built in the 15th century by a Moorish architect - common practice back in the medieval times - and is now deemed to be one of the best examples of Spanish Mudejar brickwork with elements of Gothic architecture
Interestingly, the bricks used during the construction works are hardened bricks that can better withstand enemy onslaught during sieges
The central keep is situated in the northern part of the castle and is known as the Tower of Homage
The castles used to have 2 walls that defended the complex, but the outer wall is ruined today
The castle belonged to powerful Spanish House of Alba
The 10 stations in the new metro line opened in Bucharest, Romania this week
85% of its cost was paid from the European Union's cohesion funds
EU taxes
But still in most apartment buildings in Bucharest we don't have warm water at all
Wonderful
But with colours and everything, or is Mirrors Edge, or is a Minecraft build with shaders put on 25 iterations of raytracing
I remember when this metro line was started a decade ago and on my way to first grade in school and saw panels on the construction yards for the stations, they said "in 3 years you will take the subway to work from here". I am now in my last year of highschool and the stations arent yet open
As beautiful as they may be i see them as a testament of our corruption and lies, siphoning european funds into their pockets
You forgot about maybe one of the coolest stations of them all
Drumul Taberei
Yeah, everything will be destroyed in no time
Can't wait to see cigarettes all over the place (+ the inevitable graffiti that some idiots will use to write their name, "f*ck the government", or other shit like that)
Let's forget the fact that it took 8 years to complete 7km
Lol I was think about that too
I played mirror's edge recently and loved it
Idk, i've been to bucharest like 3 times and really didn't like it, it's waay to crowded and messy, the heat was unbearable (at least in the summer), if you're planning on visiting romania is suggest aomething nore in the mountains like bran, arieseni and the likes
I haven't seen it yet and I'm kinda split here
On one hand I think there are because I've always seen signs on projects funded by the EU, on the other hand local and parliamentary elections are comeing and the goverment most probably wants people to think "WE DID THIS", so idk, maybe someone who was there yesterday will tell you
Hey, I wasn't there since the opening, but during construction I can confirm I saw one sign
There some panels, but I'd double it with huge EU flags anywhere something was built with EU funds
The EU needs better PR firms
During the last few years, in most metro trains on most lines you could see a big poster with the details of the project, cost, and who funded it
Around 700 million €.
New
We know that it was funded by EU
We may not know that it was funded so heavily
Anyway most Romanians are pro Eu and know that we get money
Some people in Romania complain that we gain too much money for nothing and that money could be used more usefully in other countries because it costs a lot of additional money because of bad management of constructions
M5 Line
bine tu
A lot of infrastructure is built by Eu because it's cheaper in real money
Eu verification is way more rigorous
If it was from the government some people would have stopped a part of money for themselves
Plenty of them: Dublin, Zagreb, Ljubljana, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Malta, Cyprus
It was not really the case until now, but the trains for this one won't arrive until 2023 (?!) so until then they'll have to "borrow" from the other lines
i think 62
well uk can afford to pay for projects like this from their own budget
It’s a semi-scam for eastern europe also
But like .. the best of a possible list of scams so i can’t complain
we're too poor
lmao absolutely not
Looks cool, yea, but it took them like 10 years to make it, and we still have moldy, rusty hospitals and schools
I think we should focus on our infrastructure before we add neat, money draining, knickknacks
But whatever, at least it kinda looks like Mirrors Edge
Iași București
6 hours for 400 km
For reference,  with highways, that would be 3
5 hours
Labor costs are lower here
They claim there's no impact on the other lines
They can run this one with the control system in degraded mode until then, and while it won't achieve 1-2 minute intervals it would keep the old trains busy
That part of the city is extremely crowded, so even if not optimal it will be a huge improvement, not just a political move
No offense taken
Yes, we pay for the lack of highways with blood
How long it is
thanks, the perspective makes it look longer
Isn't that small edge between Czack and USSR Romania
Wow, that's truly beautiful
Ok c'mon man,you make me wanna live in the Mediterranean even more
Somewhere around that,but be careful,you wouldn't want to cause an exodus of americans who think that moving to europe will magically solve all their problems
I sugest you ask that on r/romania ,bc i'm from the south and have never been there
Percent of remain actually coinciding with number of millions of euros received from the emergency fund
That is great
So why are bits and pieces cut from Romania, Ukraine, France, etc, but not from Croatia
Why isn't they're bottom bit in the south
Bruh most of latvia and prety much all of estonia is more northen then denmark but denmark is in northen europe while estonia and latvia are central
Also kaliningrad is more western then finland, estonia,latvia,lithuania and most of poland and most of romania but its estern europe not even central
Sometimes political geografy doesent make eny sense
These maps can never be 100% accurate
There'll always be people who feel like they have been included in the wrong group
As for Romania, I think it's just hard to include us in one single category, we're just a transitional country
It feels kinda off to me that some from Oradea and someone from Debrecen have completely different cultures that need to be put in different categories
Just like I feel it's wrong someone from Radauti and someone from Chernivtsi will be that different too
There's just no way someone from Moldova for example has more in common with Greece than with Ukraine
So now Transilvania is central Europe wtf
croatia central europe
what the fuck are you on about, it's southeastern europe all day and night, make it orange or cut it like you did with us and serbia, because croatia has balkan, italian and central european influence
estonia is northern europe, netherlands is central europe
greece is a tough one, i believe they have much more in common with the rest of south eastern europe than they to with italy for example
the rest is as good as it is, gj
I hate borders
This map is bullshit and you all know it
These lines follow the German Empire + Austrian Empire's borders that's why Netherlands was left out
yeah go ahead and cut Romania in half again an see what happens we have entered the world wars for that place, except for a small region in the middle of the country all the space is Romania and the people there would be really mad to go back to Hungarian domination again after they fought for hundreds of years not to be
Tell your Orban to call our Orban and discuss it
Here we go again :))
Why point out Romania only, there is Ukraine and Serbia in there as well
You may need a little reminder that you were there fighting in the Soviet Union as well :)
> Western Ukraine makes some amount of sense
How come
And that's no different from Transylvania, which was under german/austrian-hungarian influence for centuries, there were lots of germans, not so many these days, also hungarians are the biggest ethnic minority in Romania
Well that's why they included a chunk of Romania
I think it's the same for Serbia
It's basically regions/countries that were under german/austrian-hungarian influence
that's a nuclear blast, i know when i see one
Wait a second, was Britain not an unofficial 51st US state after 1980's ?

Well there are plenty of other hotels with a way better view in Cluj
and I gotta give it to you indeed I feel there are way too many cemeteries in Cluj
And also a huge one in the center of the city, which I've never seen in other Romanian cities
My home town has only one cemetery which is huge nevertheless, but it;'s at the edge of the city
Here is a promotional video of the city:  [  (just to compensate for the cemetery hahaha)
Not Cluj, but I live in Romania next to a cemetery
The best neighbors tbh, no noises, no complains, no "can I borrow that", they may came out at midnight to play some chess, no stealing, true good neighbors
Make sure not to get killed by a Strigoi
At least then it was safer 'cause people were coffin less
Well
pay up next time, you probably rented that for €20 a day
if OP also catches a live funeral then that would be the cherry on top hahahah for a 5\* experience
Cluj ain't cheap tho
People still believe in Strigoi
With the occasion of a funeral, I was once told by my countryside relatives never to let a cat in the same room with a dead person because they will turn into a Strigoi
Some iele/ sânziene if OP is male, and a zburător if they’re female :))

according to [reports] "heavily armed anti-terror squads" have surrounded a building some 200m away from where it happened

Well fuck me then ima stop countin

For romania you could also use "I was told this is gypsy country
You know, from rroma = romania
". People will go crazy, guaranteed
I'd say that it's more annoying for Romanians to be called Gypsies
American wines hahaha that's the best one
For Hungary you can also use the one for Romania, with a small change: ''Beautiful country, I love Bucharest
''. For some reason many foreigners, including famous bands/singers/etc
mix those 2 names
Bucharest for Hungary and Budapest for Romania
''Hello, Bucharest
We love it here in Hungary
'' or ''Yeah, Budapest
Romania is awesome
But we are not gypsies, we are romanians :(

The right term for mexicans, cubans, colombians, etc
is hispanics
Cause they were colonized by the Spaniards, not by the Romans
The true Latins are dead for ages
The neo-latins are in Europe only
And they don't call themselves latinos and latina
Romanian language has one of the richest heritages of Latin of all the Romance countries, therefore we named our country Romania=descendants of the Roman empire
The other guys, the Rroma people, migrated from Indian ethnic background to Europe and have a very similar name, hence the confusion
EDIT: "one of the richest" instead "the richest". The latter makes it a very debatable assertion
Romanians stronk latins
Imperium in imperio
*flips table*
don't really have a problem with that, tbh
I find it interesting that Tolkien was super into Germanic stuff and there are some theories that he was holding what we'd consider a rather outdated worldview
And while trying to devise fantasy Germanic sounding languages, the language he liked most isn't even Indo-European
> among Stockholm Swedes
Just curious, how does Copenhagen compare to Stockholm in the "Nordic psyche" (I could not find another term) in terms of "this is the most important city out here/the one with the most history"?
My money (as a South-Eastern European who has never visited that region) would be on Copenhagen being ahead of Stockholm in that race, it's geographically closer to the [blue banana] further away from the big, empty and "uncivilised" North  (compared to Stockholm, that is), and generally speaking looks to be more densely built (at least from the photos)
I might be talking crap for all I know, hence the question
The famous Via Appia (The Appian Way) nowadays, Rome, Italy
The Appian Way (Latin and Italian: Via Appia) is one of the earliest and strategically most important Roman roads of the ancient republic
It connected Rome to Brindisi, in southeast Italy
Its importance is indicated by its common name, recorded by *Statius*:
>Appia longarum
regina viarum
>"the Appian Way the queen of the long roads"
The road is named after Appius Claudius Caecus, the Roman censor who began and completed the first section as a military road to the south in 312 BC, during the Samnite Wars
At first it ran only 212 km from Rome south-southeastward to ancient Capua, in Campania, but by about 244 BCE it had been extended another 370 km southeastward to reach the port of Brundisium (Brindisi), situated in the “heel” of Italy and lying along the Adriatic Sea
As the main highway to the seaports of southeastern Italy, and thus to Greece and the eastern Mediterranean, the Appian Way was so important that during the empire it was administered by a curator of praetorian rank
The road averaged 6 metres in width and was slightly convex in surface in order to facilitate good drainage
The road’s foundation was of heavy stone blocks cemented together with lime mortar; over these were laid polygonal blocks of lava that were smoothly and expertly fitted together
The lava blocks formed a good traveling surface, and one that proved to have extraordinary durability over the centuries
The first few miles of the Appian Way outside Rome are flanked by a striking series of monuments, and there are also milestones and other inscriptions along the remains of the road
Pompei the sequel
well, so far we are ahead in clean energy, NL is really lagging
You have good PR though, with bicycles and old windmills, everyone assumes you are better
This title is misleading af: 100 years since first declaration of independence does not mean 100 years of independence
You were in the USSR for a rather long part of these 100 years
Anyone that knows history and the fact Estonia was under soviet rule for a long long time so, it was not independent for 100 years as the title wrongly claims
It's just 100 years since first declaration of independence
Edit: I wonder what sort of retards without basic knowledge of history would downvote facts
Brainless snowflakes most likely
The title for being misleading
Estonia can't have 100 years of independence since it was around half of this time under soviet rule
If the title would have been :'' 100 years since first declaration of independence of Estonia'' that would have been correct
I'm having a laughing fit just by picturing a cat going "Dddddd

Loreto Island, Italy
Loreto Island, is located on Lake Iseo north of Montisola, Italy
Loreto is the smallest island of lake Iseo, and it is a privately owned island
There used to be a monastery on the island since the 15 century, but it switched hands and in 1910 a Neo-Gothic castle was built on the island and still stands there today
They can’t do anything, the EU is a paper tiger
Is a shame to ruin a good thing dont you agree
it's so strange that they apparently didn't have snow guards in 1910
Actually yes
Now they have flowers at the balconies

The protests matter even if you don't see immediate changes, don't stop protesting, like Romania did after we got gassed and we were beaten by the gendarmerie ( riot police )

They should be afraid because the world is changing for the better the young people are more in touch with politics and we are sick  of them the old way of doing things is over we want the world now
Good job our Czech friends
Getting rid of the communist garbage is difficult, but trust me, by protesting you will manage to do it

It's not like they can battle tanks
A Czech guy holding a molotov cocktail: Let me show you how it's done
Another Eastern Bloc person here who moved to the US - I was old enough to take part in the overthrow of the communist regime back in the day
The social stuff in the US is catastrophic
Seriously, it's the dumbest thing ever
Health care, pensions, maternity/paternity leave, vacation, help with preschool - all these are a disaster
I've a well paid job in the computer industry, so it's not too bad, but blue collar folks - I just can't imagine
There are politicians here who try to fix things, do stuff that in Europe we would consider normal, and the opposition labels them "extremists" or "socialists"; it's like a comedy show
America is great if you make a lot of money in a field of work that's in high demand - and even then, you should better love your job, because you're going to spend a lot of your time with it
If you're Elon Musk, this is the best place on Earth for you
If all of the above do not apply, then Europe is far better in every way
America has better military and better technology, and more money
But on the social side of things, they are 100 years behind Europe
> There’s a greater income and wealth inequality in Europe than in the US
Not true
There are some fairly miserable folks in the US as well, and the rich tend to be obscenely richer compared to the middle class
You just don't see all that on TV
Drive through Nevada or the Bible Belt and you'll see some incredibly poor folks; heck, Central Valley in California is not all sunshine and bunnies
Social mobility is also far lower in the US
In America, if you fall through the cracks, you fall all the way down, and you stay there - there's no safety net to catch you
I had classmates in college, in Eastern Europe, who were from very poor families
They went on, got their degrees, and then had careers in science, studying and doing pretty cool stuff
In America, if you're born poor, college is not something you'll ever be able to afford
Which then have to be repaid and are often a trap
The system is unbelievably stupid, no matter how much lipstick you put on it
Isn't this from 2016
You all talking about fixing that loophole
But until they fix this, Google and other giants will benefit from it until 2020
That's A LOT of money
And maybe, after 2020 another loophole will be found
I wonder how's the inverview at Google for an finance/account specialist: *And what loophole do you think you'll find in order to reduce costs for the next years to come
Dutch people can read it though
Or better yet, isolate tax havens from the global financial system and they will end their shady practices right away
Of course, there are too many powerful people interested in keeping this practice going for it to ever happen
First of all, free markets are about as real as Santa or unicorns
Secondly, this has nothing to do with free markets, it has to do with international finance
If they stay in the Netherlands, it means that it's better than back home for them
Call me when you can build a hospital, pay for doctors' education, build highways, build airports, etc
I know
But for many of them the forced "profession" would be the same back home, I imagine
The lesser of two evils, I guess
I'm from Romania, I don't know what you're talking about with "daddy government". Our government would throw us to the dogs and then piss on our graves if we let it :)))
Getting back on track, I don't know exactly what you're doing in Ecuador, but I see that Ecuador's HDI and inequality adjusted HDI (IHDI) are 0
752 and 0
603
I'm talking about HDI not because it is not awesome, but it correlates pretty well with general standards of living in a country, probably better than the simpler GDP
So, part 2, Romania's HDI and inequality adjusted HDI (IHDI) are 0
811 and 0
717
I haven't lived in Ecuador, but based on these simple numbers, I can't imagine Ecuador being a paradise to live in, except for nature, and that wasn't built by humans - and at the end of the day, we have to live everyday with humans
We don't measure civilizations by the beauty of their mountains, but by what people have built, learned, researched, created, in general
Part 3, the Netherlands HDI/IHDI are 0
931 and 0
857
**TL;DR**: You must be crazy-crazy to say that it's better to live in Ecuador, that in the Netherlands, for the average Ecuadorean
I'm pretty sure Ecuador has better views and better weather, but I'd still live in the Netherlands :)
TL;DR: Fuck you, got mine
That's both horrible and not sustainable if you have an ounce of empathy
People are less educated in general, it's harder to find interesting people as a result
You're more likely to get robbed since people are so poor (who can blame them
It's much easier, during a crisis, to be attacked, robbed, killed, etc
Everything is usually dirtier, grimier, more worn out because people can't afford good things or decent replacements/repairs, etc
Sure, you can build your bubble and I wish you good luck with that
But I'd still live among calm, peaceful, tranquil and especially **content** people
Also rich, when possible :)

Thank GOD Romania is shedding its Christianity slow and steady too
More and more young people ditch it and don't care about religion

Even the Soviets understood this
Same with Romania honestly

Now, I still respect the right to have a religion, but i will never be a christian again
Thanks, though it should be taken 100% serious

I don't deny that
It's just that most young people believe in god, but not in church

wdym bro my granparents gave me a lecture on how saying "naiba" is extremely bad and a sin

[Sânişor] = Little Breast;
[Urlaţi] = Scream;
[Spermezeu] = JizzGod;
[Mamaia] = Grandma;
[Pianu de Sus] = The Piano Above;
[Mădulari] = Cocks;
Granted, some of these are not the most generous translations, but still, to someone who could be learning Romanian, those would be the first connection they'd make
Replace "Belgrade" with "Minas Tirith" and you get LOTR
> Spermezeu = JizzGod;
Hahahah what the fuck
Edit: To add further, there's [Miroși] which roughly translates to "You smell".
Mădulari = Limbs
We should petition the mayor of "Cocks" to twin it to "Boobs village". In the interest of world peace, of course
Good point
Still, to name your town "refugees" is a little bit too much :)

Looking to visit one day
Reminds me of [Stavropoleos street in Bucharest] - and [another angle]
Good morning Europe from Corvins' Castle
Am fost acolo e frumos :)
Salut
Servus
The good old magyars already talking shit sad
The one and only, but the "castle" or whatever citadel was before was given to its grandfather Vojk Corvin wich origins still remsin debated(either vlach or cuman) and his father John Corvin or Hunyadi(who means "of hunedoara" the region he abd his familly ruled upon) and he build the castle
And the tower to the right of the leftmost tower is a happy cyclops
Wasnt this castle inspired by the one in Budapesr
Servus
Hoes mad
Hahaha thanks this made my day,  BTW you forgot to put this "/s"  at the end of your post
>moat with water
Vlach or cuman, lol
He was Vlach and Vlach means Romanian for those who do not know
He was orthodox and was born in Hațegului country which was an autonomous region at that time because it was mainly inhabited by Romanians
Ok so let me get this straight, a castle build by a familly with most likely vlsch or cuman origins, build in a region where magyars where in a minority so the workforce they used was mainly vlach was build by you and your friends right
How am i s romanian nationalist i strongly belive the castle dosent belong to any coubtry and represent the achivement of the ppl who lived there: magyars,romanians,germans etc
Is not posted as "vajdahunyad" bcuz the familly was named corvin therefore  corvin castle but both name are eligible dont get mad that they dont post it as the name you preffer
>"We know, hasn't it yet appeared that what they post in half of the cases we built
Yes m8 bcuz out of sll the fortress/castles/buildings etc in Transylvania were are build by hungarians is not like half of the noble famillies from Transylvania have romanian/pechen/cuman/slavic origins(romanian "Cândea or Cîndea became Kendeffy, romanian Dragosesti became Dagffy, Vucasin became Wakasyn and so on) and the population was equally diversed but is allright mate everything was build by hungarians and everyone stayed and jerk off right
Well, sucks for you
I don't see anything wrong with claiming him as a national hero
It's not as if it denies the fact that he was a hungarian king or make him any less of a hungarian national hero
I guess no reason to still have ethnic Hungarians in Romania then
They are born in Romania, in Romanian cities and most of them speak Romanian
Well its annoying too when magyars like your friends up there claim every little shit was build by magyars and everyone else didnt do shit for centuries, you have citties like alba iulia,deva,timisoara and the rest of the banat and maramures were magyars were represented a small minority through most of the history would be right for us rn to decline every right magyars have to these achivments
Look at the magyara in the comments who fail to realise that Transylvania was a melting point for different cultures, we do not claim Matthias Corvinus(also i do nlt understand why you put so much accent on calling him Hunyadi when is literally the same shit bu ok) we consider Mathiass and John national heroes bcuz they played a important role in Transylvanian history who was a rightfull ruler(during his time literally vlachs were more loyal to him the szekely or the saxons, who rebelled against him supported by Stephen the Great of Moldavia, after he defeated the saxons and szekely Mathias got defeated by Stephen at battle of Baia where he got wounded, after the battle he and his army retreated after he rewarded plenty of vlachs from Maramures for saving his life),yes there is a highly possibility he was a romanian ancestry but no one really cares about it tbh only the extremists like your buddies who claim that every fence was build by them
Ok so a castle built at the order of a vlach noble,a castle wich workforce was mainly vlach bcuz of the region wich was a vlach majority one was a only hungarian build right
In the process of erecting this castle both hungarians and vlachs were involved period
Yes it was in county of Hunedoara(Vajdahunyad) in the voivodship of Transylvania wich was part of Kingdom of Hungary(feudalism 101) but to say it was build by hungarians is as wrong as saying it was build by vlachs, is the produc of the colective work of this 2 group of ppl and  more
Love the unbiased magyar links i cannot understand
Btw that tree starts in 1508 well to bad that the firsy atestation of this familly is from 1236 under the "candea" name
>And yes Dagffy apperently did have olah ancestors on one side, but I don’t really see the point
That like it or not everything in Transilvania waa build only by you, majority of the castles,fortifications etc were build in ethnic diverse areas, and a lot of people of different ethnicities took part in the process of building
>So you managed to point out two of thousands, one of which wasn’t even true
Actually i pointed 3 :/ and do you know the meaning of "and so on"
>We just pointed out that whenever there is a pic about “beautiful Romania” it’s alway a pic about a Transylvanian city center built by us in the 19th century
When for the majority of it hungary and Transylvania was under austrian rule, following yout logic tthat claims that this castle build by a vlach familly with tge participation of other vlschs,saxons and magyars as part of the workforce is hugarian dosent that make everything build in the 19th before AH austrian
Also again i'm sure that absolutely 0 romanians from that juicy majority who inhabited Transylvania cobtributed to the building of this citties it was all on you ;)
> and old town built by us or the saxons,
You mean Sibiu or Sighisoara who was literally borded with Amlas county a Vlach predominant region in the west and in the east Fagaras county who again was known to have a big vlach populstion in the north Alba Iulia and Deva with again predominant Vlach populations, or Brasov who was founded on some bulgarian and vlach villages i'm sure vlachs barely did anything to help
> or an old castle built by us in the middle ages passed off as Romanian
achievements
Just like this one is an only hungarian achievment :)
>Which is fine you do you, just don’t act so offended when we point that out
Well dont get pissed off when the history is not the straight line you think it is
You are the one claiming "ancestry" doesn't count as long as he was in Hungary
Same argument should apply to the Hungarians in Romania then
They are born Romanians, not Hungarians after all
Say this to you co-nationals who think they build evetything then
Eo does Napoleon in the polisn one
Actually the term of nationalitty didnt exist back  then
The infamous theory that Vlachs became a majority only after Maria Theresia
Don't you get bored of promoting such senseless stuff
There isn't much debate to have in any day, shedding some more Trianon tears over the internet won't change history
>Just because there were Hungarian engineers at the building of the Suez Canal I don’t claim it’s partly a Hungarian achievement
Well you should bcuz it is
>The same way just because Temesvár bordered vlach regions it doesn’t mean they had anything to do with it, the same line of thought would led to me say Vienna is a partly Hungarian achievement
Actually funny enough Timisoara and the banat region were mainly serb abd romania with a considerable number of germans after the ottoman occupation the hungarians started to fade away by the 18th century they were under 1% magyars living and yes,you can say Wien was a partially hungarian achievment, a lot of it was built with the resources and money they obtain from hungary and other provinces
>As for the Austrian part, even during those times Hungary had significant autonomy, with different laws and legislature from
the rest of the empire
The same way durin hingarian kingdom regions like Hunedoara,Fagaras,Maramures and many around the southern border including the saxon citties had their own different laws
>But if we argue about semantics anything before 18th is not a Romanian achievement, because it didn’t exist yet
And all those places were built by Hungarians nobility
Wich again like i state a considerable number of them were of non-hungarian descent and i doubt that the hungarian nobility made the plsns,gathered the raw materials,manufactered them and build this things
>As for the family, you say official sources are not true regarding the family tree because they are Hungarian but a wikipedia page without any sources is the ultimate truth
No i'm not saying that your link is false i'm saying that there are more earlier mentions
>Also you try to force on mediaval places the ethnographic map of Transylvania after Maria-Theresia and her invited Romanian settlers
Funny enough during her time there was a documented migration of romanians from Transylvania to romanian principallities they were named "ungurenii" if you wanna do some research
>Either way this whole discussion is not really worth my time, given 4th is coming soon we will have a lot of debates about it anyways
Sure
Ask the Germans of Alsace in France if they are still Germans
The answer is likely no
And why do they got defensive by a post about a castle which wasnt theirs(personally Laszlo who lives in Debrecen dosent have any right on the castle such as you and i do not have it either) and wich yes their ancestors togheter with mine and many more build it like the rest of Transylvania
That is because this is one of the few aspects where Romania didn’t follow the French example and a lot of minority rights were granted
And Alsace had a German majority as well
Besides, you are talking about 2 counties with forests and 3 towns in total, it’s not some regional economic powerhouse or anything, so chill out
Seems like Orban lied to you again
1 million Hungarians in Szekelyland
Who lied to you like that, poor soul
Hungarians in Romania and Hungarians in Szekelyland are different things, my man
Hungarians in Arad have nothing to do with the Szekelys
According to the 2011 official census, 609,033 Hungarians (56
8%) live in the counties of Covasna, Harghita and Mureș (out of a total population of 1,071,890 inhabitants)
Check the facts before spewing Orban’s propaganda
yes yes, you are all anti-Orban but he ends up winning by a huge margin, you are all pro-EU, but you do the opppsite of EU values, we know that
You made a mistake by 400k people, so it’s enough for me to understand how much you know about the topic
Typical Trianon crybaby
Lemme know when your country gets rid of Orban, 20 years from now maybe
No, I do not usually make mistakes, not when talking to ultranationalists like you
I said “maybe they were given too many rights” and yeah, I agree, they show no respect for this country, so it’s a bit hard to have empathy for them
What 50 years of oppression
They had Hungarian schools even in communist times
Ceausescu did ethnic cleansing
Now I really want to see some proof
He sure did many bad things, but ethnic cleansing wasn’t one of them
I mean our human rights were constantly violated under his rule, but that’s a different thing, he did no ethnic cleansing
He did no actions that had the extermination of Hungarians as its goal
You can call it oppression if you want I guess, I can agree with that
[Is this] what the Space Force will look like
I don’t get the point of promoting 112, here in Romania 90% of 112 calls are either pranks, non-emergencies or butt dials
If they want to make a campaign, they should campaign for people to stop dialing unless someone is in real danger
I don’t know about other countries, but in Romania if you call 911 it just forwards you to 112
Meanwhile in the Oslo airport they have some ridiculously small 250ml bottles of water at €5
Oh and if you have a relay, you have to get out of the airport and pass through security again, so you can’t hold on to your old one
In Dubai a bottle of water in the airport costs 1 Dirham, which is about 0
25$.

I'd feel the same; the weeaboo result is a bit surprising tbh, though, I don' fall for that either
The uniformizing, cosmopolitist, of ”Let's like everybody” is boring, unoriginal, forced, and isn't let alone to develop itself naturally without political or ideological ulterior motives & pressure
Btw, you gotta love this interesting characteristic of ”muddying the water” they got here: they combine the ethnic background up top, with religious background down below
If that ain't interestingly quaint, I dunno what is
So we equally hate just about everyone that's not white and christian ?
Well, at least my country is consistent at 40-50%. Except for Asians, we love them

I call bullshit on the portrayal of Hungary on this map
Hungary was erased from the map in 1526 at Mohacs by the Ottoman Empire and stopped existing as an independent state for almost 400 years
In 1867 it was part of the Austria-Hungary Empire, but only after WW1 it rebecame an independent state and reapeared on Europe's map
Also, Transylvania was an autonomous principality under ottoman and then austrian suzerainity, with periods of quasi-independence
It wasn't part of Hungary for a long time
It was given by Viena to Budapest in the A-H, for 50 years or so, till it became part of Romania
The whole hungarian propaganda with ''Transylvania was ours for 1000 years'' is major bullshit
>After the Battle of Mohács in 1526 it belonged to the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, from which the Principality of Transylvania emerged
During most of the 16th and 17th centuries, the principality was a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire; however, the principality had dual suzerainty (Ottoman and Habsburg)
[2][3] In 1690, the Habsburgs gained possession of Transylvania through the Hungarian crown
[4][5][6] After 1711[7] Habsburg control of Transylvania was consolidated, and Transylvanian princes were replaced with Habsburg imperial governors
[8][9] After the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, the separate status[10] of Transylvania ceased; it was incorporated into the Kingdom of Hungary (Transleithania) as part of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire
[11] After World War I, Transylvania became part of Romania
Edit: Hungarian irredentists downvoting
lol Always stay in denial
You never disappoint on this aspect
So many mistakes
Principality of Transylvania is missing
All the crown lands of the Austrian Empire are put under Hungary when it wasnt the case untill the Austro-Hungarian Empire
And the fact that is posted from a bought account doesent help
It was erased from the map as there was no more independent Hungary and you know it
Transylvania was a different principality than Hungary, from 1570 after some, from 1526 under others
It was under ottoman and austrian suzerainity till the half of the 19th century and had periods of quasi-independence
Transylvania was always inhabited in majority by romanians even based on your own censuses
So it was our land and we decided when we were allowed to have a say, that we should get rid of your rule
Both romanians and germans in Transylvania were against the hungarians both in 1848 and 1918
So we had an absolute majority of almost 2/3
What happened in 1918-1920, confirmed at Trianon, was JUSTICE for all those 10 nationalities trapped in A-H, although they represented close to 2/3 of the entire population of A-H. Do you see the slovaks, serbians, croatians, polish, czech, italians, etc
cry after A-H or Hungary or claim you are right in your irredentist claims
I see nobody saying you are right
Even the austrians show more dignity and do not share histerical tears after the A-H empire
Showing just how pathetic you are
The one full of lies are your beloved hungarian irredentists, you being one of them
You even seem to forget that you people (well your turkic-asian looking ancestors) came from the fucking Central Asia and only started conquering this region after the 10th century, ending it somewhere in the 13th-14th century
You talk about fucking legitimacy
You people are pathetic as fuck as always
Go claim your true ancestral lands from Central Asia
But you'll probably just invent retarded claims like ''romanians are in fact albanians that migrated in Transylvania only after we came''. lol
The only nation crying after Trianon as some great injustice is Hungary
Well, some irredentists there that are clinging from the false belief, promoted by ultranationalist parties, that Hungary was great till 1920, when in fact it was small and ruled by other nations since 1526
The delusion is very strong in you people
Even in A-H you were just the small poor relative that got to a privileged position cause Austria wanted to still appear as a force in front of Prussia and the new state called Germany
It didn't want to accept that it lost the hegemony in the german world and is no longer a first hand power
Edit: Instead of crying hysterically ''Trianon, Trianon'' as some great injustice of the world, it would be more useful to realize that if your rule would have been decent, there would have been no Trianon
That if you would have respected the nationalities trapped there and gave them rights instead of trying to forcibly assimilate them and keep them as ''tolerated'' nationalities only, perhaps not all would have wanted to escape you
Hahaha
That's it
Show your true ugly face
Just as your hungarian ancestors did
We are not pathetic like you to claim we were big when we weren't, ''bitch''.
Learn some history
Romanians and germans in Transylvania were against the hungarians and their desire to annex Transylvania in 1848 and supported the union with Romania in 1918
There was even someone called Avram Iancu, that you irredentists like to call a ''mass murderer''. I made this point because you usually love to bitch that there was no referendum and the romanians didn't have the majority to impose their decision
lol 64% at least, was not enough
You lost the 1848 revolution and only got Transylvania cause Austria wouldn't accept it was no longer an important power in Europe
Just as you don't want to accept that romanians were the majority in Transylvania and would have been stupid not to want to get rid of your abusive rule and forced magyarization
Apparently that's the great ''crime'' you are accusing romanians of
That they should have wanted to stay as slaves for you
lol
You can make up as many lies as you want
Like your bullshit theories that we are albanians
Like your lies about 1000 years of hungarian rule in Transylvania
Like your history that still doesn't admit that Iancu de Hunedoara aka Janos Hunyadi (magyarized name) was romanian or that Matei Corvin aka Matthias Corvinus also had some romanian blood
etc
If you want to know the truth, read your own chronicles who claim that when your magyars came here, the romanians were already present
Your own censuses or the austrian ones that constantly showed the romanians as the majority here (at least 54% romanians and 10% germans) even if you had the bad habbit of registering gypsies and jews as magyars
lol Etc, etc, etc
You are the one bitching about Trianon and romanians
I am simply not letting your bullshit claims pass as ''truth'', when they aren't. You can bitch as long as you want, but we are still the majority here with over 80% and nothing can change the cold hard evidence
You can keep on masturbating to the map of ''Great Hungary'' from before 1526 and stay delusional about parts of your history

Households in the EU unable to pay utility bills on time in the past 12 months
In 2018, almost 7% of households had been unable to pay utility bills (heating, electricity, gas, water, etc
) on time, due to financial difficulties
However, this share has fallen steadily in the EU as a whole, from over 10% of households in 2013
Among households, in particular those with dependent children faced difficulties in paying utility bills on time
In the EU, just below 14% of households consisting of a single adult with dependent children faced such difficulties in 2018, compared to less than 3% of households consisting of two adults (with at least one of them 65 years or older)
Among households with two or three adults and dependent children, this share was around 11%.
In 2018, more than a third of households in Greece (36%) had experienced problems paying their utility bills on time during the last 12 months, with many households facing such problems also in Bulgaria (30%)
In contrast, few households had been unable to pay their utility bills on time in the Netherlands, Czechia, Sweden and Austria (all around 2%)

Should've had a heart attack right on that spot
I think this is false or misreported
From what I read, they knew pretty much that war was inevitable and they even trained for it
Zhukov was doing war games and enhancing the frontline just months before Barbarossa
Maybe they couldn't pinpoint the exact date Hitler would attack, but I am pretty sure they knew it was inevitable, so the idea that they just stood there in chaos, is not what a victorious party would do, and smells more like cold war propaganda than factual history
The entire forced collectivization happened to prepare for war, because Hitler was already agitating for eastern expansion
The idea of peaceful coexistence was never on the table and they both knew it
So both sides were preparing for war since 1933
The actual attack might have been a surprize, but I think it's greatly exagerated
When your last decade's work is largely preparation for war then I doubt you should chicken out the moment it happens
THIS IS PHENOMENAL

Happy International Beer Day
Among the EU Member States, Germany was the top producer in 2019 with a production of 8
0 billion litres (or 23% of the EU total production)
In other words, about one in every four beers containing alcohol produced in the EU originated from Germany
Germany was followed by Poland and Spain (each 3
9 bn litres produced, or 11%), the Netherlands (2
5 bn litres, or 7%), Belgium (2
4 bn litres, or 7%; 2017 data), France (2
0 bn litres, or 6%), Czechia (1
9 bn litres, or 6%)
Compared with 2018, Lithuania recorded the largest increase in the production of beer containing alcohol (+7%), followed by Spain (+6%) and Italy (+5%)
In contrast, the production of beer in the Netherlands fell by 9%, in Latvia by 7% and in Slovakia by 6%.

I'll cherish this day accordingly, enjoying two dark beers tonight
I'm quite surprised our country isn't in this top considering the number of beer brands we're currently producing and the yearly consumption
That's quite a challenge
We ain't shit compared to our czech, german and polish bros

Hello, you have just signed up for the *South-East Europe Summer experience*. Would you like to proceed
I think here in Romania we had 40 last summer, in the south
> humidify the curtains
Keep windows, curtains and blinds CLOSED ALL DAY, (closed as in completely closed)
Hang humid cloth in front of the fans
Don't do any of that
If you do, you'll have a bad time
Sweat-cooling takes place by the phase transition of evaporation extracting heat from the skin
For that you want the air as dry as possible
If the air is humid, evaporation of sweat is diminished, your body overheats
Humid air is not automatically cooler air, that's not how reality works
To cool down you need to transfer heat from your body
One way is to be in direct contact with conductive cooler matter, like cold metal or cold water, or even cold air, but we assume here cold air is not available
Second way is phase transition : a substance, in this case water, needs an additional amount of heat to transition to gaseous state, and if the conditions are right it takes that heat from the surrounding vicinity (your skin) as the transition takes place
The right conditions are when the environment is not saturated with the final state of the substance (water vapor in this case)

The good old Romania life
She's 95 years old, my father's aunt and she lives alone in her own house
We pass by to her every day to bring her fresh water and help with some things she may need, but she's 95% independent
She's doing all the chores by herself, even hard ones (such as vegetables, from planting to harvesting)
When we are harvesting the grapes that you can see behind her, she's working with us
If you don't do as she pleases in her house, she can get mad at you and you won't like it
She's chill, she's my grandma
My grandma is 90 years old and has 2 cows, 2 pigs, like 40 chickens, a garden full of potatoes, corn, tomatoes, apple trees, grape wines, etc and if we leave her unattended she already did all the chores herself, I swear to God these women are made of steel

I spent a night in Rome with a Brasilian woman
Was pretty cool experience
But yes, spanish, italian, portuguese, romanian do share a common root
Romanian had a more rough formation, being between slavic, hunnic, fino ugric, greek and way more influencea beyond just latin
But identity is also a choice and while latin was the majority of the language it was also a concious choice in the 19th to bring the language closer to other Romance languages, most notable French
We really had a sweet spot for French, arguably we still do
The majority of Romanian people living abroad are in Spain and Italy, languages that are really easy to understand for us
Later edit: still have a really cool Brasilian friend (and another aquiantance now that I think of it) who is (are) currently studying in UK
It is interesting to see how Bolsanto (spelling
) has so much popular suport in Brasil, even like from these people who I know and are moderately well educated
Not sure why is the support
This is pretty informative on the language:

Romanian here
Kinda hard to trust ur government if they barely even know grammar
As a romanian I can confirm
This should give a moment of pause to politicians to reevaluate their situation but they probably don't give a duck
they're too busy stealing and shift
you're goddamn right i do
You bet I do
I don't trust my government AT ALL
I would gladly let the EU rule insted
They'd definitely do a much better job
In Romania we have a saying inherited from the communist era "Timpul trece leafa merge" a rough translation is "Even if you do your job or you don't, you still get paid" and that characterizes our whole government apparatus
So the trust in EU is high simply because the bar is set so low by every romanian institution
obviously
we don't have who to trust lol
Not at all shocked
I'm not surprised at all
You can't trust someone who lies to your face and takes your money saying that it's for you, using it to build their 20th villa/mansion
With how incredibly corrupt our government is
how could we trust it
I mean
For fucks sake
They are planning full blown elections in the middle of a pandemy and they are behaving like it's absolutely normal to do it and like we won't risk getting covid-19 if we go out to vote
How can you trust this shit
Don't be surprised Western Europe
Please don't bundle us together with those bigots and homophobes
The day I'm on the same page with a polish it will be my last
Yeah, this makes no sense
And btw, I think Romanians in general trust their army, it' the absolute most trustworthy institution in the country, at around 60-70% positive views
Not sure how they asked a question about defence, but it was wrong
What
Why
what happened
the poorer they are the more powerful/effective populist handouts become, in any form
Always has been
Most of it, yes
The army turned their weapons against Ceausescu and that brought the end, until then it was not clear who will win in the revolution
It could have ended like with Erdogan revolution, for example
"The army is with us" is a chant that remained in folclore
Oh, they mean they would trust the EU more
Ok, makes sense then
oh, i see
hope everything gets better

What was the reason of the war
> The fact is the withdrawal agreement has been rejected by parliament three times and will not pass in its current form so if the EU wants a deal, it needs to change its stance
EU wants UK to stay, no other scenario is anywhere near what EU wants
UK parliament and prime-minister has to make sure the interests of the 60mil brits will be looked after while EU has to make sure the interests of the 500mil europeans inside the union are looked after
Why would the EU make concessions against the interests of the people they represent
Is like UK created the problem and now is pointing fingers at the EU  claiming they refuse to solve said problem in a manner that satisfies UK's interests
Should have done this from the start
3 years wasted for nothing
Yeah but he is a politician
His personal feelings are irrelevant
If he has to reach a deal in order to stay in power he will we just need to find a way to tie those two together
If he wants a no deal theres nothing we can do
The sad part is that even a deal scenario will cause the world economy to take a hit nevermind a no deal one
Gonna be a nice morning waking up to literally the rest of the world yelling at both UK and EU for triggering a recession
I mean is not unthinkable:
No deal into recession into pound devaluation and i guess they plan to buy everything during recession but what they did not anticipated is russians and chinese and saudi arabians coming in hot and buying everything at 15pence/lira while the brexiteers are offering 10pence/lira
And then happy independence and congratulations other people own everything in your country and they got it cheap af
And if you own everthing you can bet that the next asset you buy is the english politician
Then is smooth sailing
Not for the brits tho
> A No Deal Brexit is against the interests of the people they represent
A No Deal Brexit is against the interests of the british people too
So here we are
> Exactly
So we need a new smaller deal to avoid the No Deal scenario
We need a trade agreement first and foremost and then what it's possible to agree on
And from my understanding the current negotiated agreement provides all of that and the only big issues are about the fishing rights and the irish backstop
EU cannot make a smaller deal with the chapters both sides agree one and leave the issues to be negotiated for later because then UK will just be: right we signed the agreement and concerning the fishing rights there will be none and concerning the irish backstop there will be a hard border in place
Have a nice day
So EU cannot sign a deal where those 2 major disagreements are not solved because then it will not have any negotiating weight trying to solve them in the future
And the UK does not want to  sign a deal that solves those issues claiming that they leave to be independent and having other people fish in their waters and no border between 2 independent political entities (EU and UK) kinda underminds that
So here we are in a deadlock
Sure you could argue that by going the no deal way then you can bet your arse there will be no fishing rights and a hard border in Ireland which si 100% true
The only difference being that the irish and the EU fishermen wont feel like they were betrayed and their interests and concerns were disconsidered
So this is how we got to this standstill
EU will only sign the deal that we negotiated (which means the UK negotiating team agreed to it btw) or we will sign no deal
We are together thru the good and the bad pretty much
Is kind of the whole point
So then why did the british parliament voted down the agreement 3 times in a row
What issues in the said agreement made them vote it down
One would think so but i don't know what is going on in the british politics but it feels like no progress was made whatsoever
The same issues that were discussed after article 50 was filed are unsolved to this day it seems
Seems to me like the way forward is for Boris to talk with the parliament, then come in front of the press and be like:
After consulting with the parliament we have reached the conclusion that they would vote the agreemet provided we manage to:
- solve the irish backstop
- partition the seagull population in the channel
- deport the male population of polish and romanian imigrants we will like to keep their women
- find a way to stahp the rain
I am ovbiously joking but it seems to me like it would be the sensible thing to do
Prime minister front an center, find out what needs to be changed to make the parliament vote the negoatiated deal then come in front of the press and tell the british and the eu people exactly what  and where the problems lay

Thank you .... Greeks make literally half of my family, since my 2 male cousins and 2 aunts on my mothers' side all married Greeks
The weird thing is .... they all met in Germany, since they work and live there XD I also studied in Germany, came back home for a while, probably will go back ... I'm starting to wonder if I have to actively look for Greek girls instead of wasting my time with others XD might be my fate
And I'm awfully jealous of my adorable nieces casually boasting 4 languages (Romanian, Greek, German, English) whilst I was only hearing my first English words from cartoons at their age :(
Well, we don't have a particular saying for this day so don't worry :)
A "Happy National Day" or something along those lines will do just fine
Nothing comes to my mind
I would stick with the basic "La mulți ani, romani
La mulți ani, România
The gypsies with 5-6 kids and the ultra-religious people of Eastern Romania pump the numbers up for sure
It used to be
In the early '90 we had about 23 million people
Recovery from the communist era was harsh so a lot of people left
It's similiar to many countries from the former Eastern Bloc
Hai noroc și la mulți ani
It’s true, the Romani have a higher birth rate, but also worth mentioning, a lot of the infantile death is on their camp as well
Romanians on average are lower, but we also have the Romanians in Eastern Romania who are pretty religious and have natural high birth rates
[Births among national minorities per 1000 mothers over 15yo] (2018)

Not sure if you knew this or you did it by mistake, but this ~~is~~ can be one of the worst swears a southern American can throw at you

It's alright, I suppose, but you better head back when your visa expires"

We're poor
And our country is very corrupt
And the infrastructure is shit
And young people decided that its better to go and work in a country that pays them a good wage
And more
Yep, Sofia (the older girl) was already changing words and listening to us speaking in 4 languages when she was only 6, it truly brings your ego down XD
That was like 6 years ago, when we had this Christmas event together and the mixture of Romanians and Greeks in a rowdy party is something else, no surprise the German neighbors called the police a few times :O we only did noise though
Sadly didn't have that opportunity after since I went to Zurich and then all around, and when I was studying I was in Bremen and Hamburg, whilst most of them are in Dortmund/Koln, so they meet every year like that, harder for me, although they always invite me :D
Thank you and I'd go with this: "La mulți ani și multă sănătate

it's just funny
Let me tell you something, my friend
We are getting better
more gypsies means bad so it's a bad thing
german saxon villages are like that
and probably villages in the poorest counties
Oh okay, that’s interesting lol
Oh yeah, definetly
We're lucky that we're in the EU
We have the potential, we just need less corrupt people to lead us on the right path
Now that's a challenge
Yeah if you're a doctor or software engineer/work in it
The rest of the country is still poor af
Pretty much, yeah
It implies a longer lifespan
To many years
It is, but things are slowly getting better so there's hope left
5 more days and we may be a little closer

Yeah, for the parliament
Can we just admit it already that the Brexit movement emerged in a time of high distress for Europe with an alarming number of terrorist attacks
[2015 saw a surge in terrorist-related incidents
2016 played in the same note
I believe this was the main concern, jobs or redirected money were just paravans
People were frigthened for their lives
The terror seemed to be spreading like cancer with no end in sight and the Brits wanted to run for the exits
Well, the only exit they saw possible at the time
Now the fear seems to have been dampened and they've found themselves with the goodbye note still in hand

So you don't put palm oil in butter and just about everything
What about high fructose corn syrup
I don't want to fuel the anti-US circlejerk, but I moved from Europe to the US a few months ago, here are my observations:
- cheese is much worse that in Europe
Also, you miss the specialty cheeses of Europe
- eggs and milk are cheap and good
- butter is worse
- meat is cheap
- chickens are huge, I guess because of antibiotics
Also pork bits are huge, makes you think you are eating something unnatural
- you miss the specialty meats of Europe: pastrama, prosciutto etc
- you miss good salami and sausages
- bread is worse in general, but there are a few expensive brands that are fine
- vegetables are good, but a bit pricier than in Europe
So you just confirmed my point :) For some good tasting meat of cheese you buy a lot of European stuff
Which is fine, just that it's too expensive or hard to find, especially in a little town like mine
Back in Europe I didn't have to buy artisan or hipster cheese/meat/bread to get tasty stuff, that is the difference
Depends where in Europe as well

Romania on 87th place, lower than countries like Ghana, Kenya, Sri Lanka, Jamaica, Trinidad Tobago, India, Tonga
Well i never liked the british to begin with
Wy they don't like Romania tho
The 25 % of positive opinions about Romania are the romanians XD ma incardez lol
Screw the closest and farthest countries and love everything in between
Why does the UK hate Albania so much lmao
We live in a society where Albania is more of an enemy to British people than France
good, we hate them too
I would have expected my country to be lower, but it's pretty low as it is anyway
Well it looks like more people like us than dislike us, the majority is just reaaaallly *neutral*
*Come on man
if you don't know why, you ain't romanian
Because we spent all our points on Religion and none on Diplomacy
the romanians  are coming
Extreme cultural differences, even beyond the usual superficial arguments
It goes both ways
no problem,we hate them too
good they're not in the EU anymore, hope their economy goes to shit
Can't think of a single person who even remotely dislikes the Dutch
How do they do it
Can't just be the drugs
Damn son they realy hate us
because they're racist pos
glad they left, the EU doesn't need people stuck in the 19th century
Dont worry in my heart Poland will always have a special place up there with Serbia, Bulgaria and the Black Sea
>poverty (Moldova & Romania)
i don't think so, romania is richer than all the countries you listed
doesn't exist
The Principality is to strong and wealthy for those envious brits
They are jelous of there godly military strenght that could crush there puny country in an instant/s
I expected that 100% tbh :(
All the countries from European Union are part of Europe, the continent, but not every European country belongs to the Union
i find it ironically and pathetic that your country held BLM protests while moust of those people probably tolerate the racism against a minority from europe
you know what I mean
Turkey hasn't exactly been neighbour of the year
The real question is, do they hate the romanies or the romanians
lol
Uh, i don't know what's more confusing, the fact that you might be romanian or that I should take it seriously, I have no idea what to do
Please stop putting salt on our wounds
Nah, it's because gypsies are not called Bulga, Bulgari or Bulgaries
lol
Yeah, I doubt anyone knows the exact % of albanians who have not assimilated, because those who assimilate don't stand out
Nah, mate, I know a lot of people from varied countries
USA, Canada, Romania, Portugal, Germany, Hungary, Bulgaria, Mexico
everyone loves the Dutch
Both probably and most of them  probably cant even make a diference between tho not every Roma is a bad person(also note to use Roma as romanies is even more confusing for westerners)well i never liked the brits to being, with this even more now
i am
I've heard they wanna change their name next into Romaniens
Uhh about who you are talking >they are racist pos

Let them have it we change our name to vlachs or something more Cooler
Dude, we have an extremely low population of muslims and there is one (that I know of)
I just extrapolated that to, let's say Germany
The only thing to note is that usually western countries don't have problems with people needing food and stuff so there's no need for charity, but am pretty sure there are charitable people who happen to be muslims

I heard the supposedly-true Romanian version
My friend's aunt and uncle, visiting some city in the US
Uncle says to aunt, in Romanian: Let's ask the dick over there to take a photo of us
(The dick in question being a black guy
) They ask nicely in English, he takes the photo and afterwards deadpans in Romanian: Dick can understand Romanian, he studied in Bucharest for 4 years
Ethnic groups of Bukovina region, Austria-Hungary, 1902; from top left: Hutsul, Hungarian, Roma, Lipovan (Russian), Jew, Pole, Schwab (German), Romanian, Rusyn
Beautiful photo
I am from Bucovina as well and I have 3 of the ethnicities here in my family: Romanian, Lipovan and Ukrainian (my grandfather called himself Ruthenian though, not Hutsul)
And still today, you can find towns where all those nations live in perfect peace with one another
Bucovina, at least the part within the romanian borders, Satu Mare and even in Harghita, you'll see people bonded by mutual trust and humanity
Worth visiting 11/10
Frumos️
Fancy looking folks
Amazing picture
Bucovina used to be one of the most ethnically diverse regions of Romania, together with Dobrogea and Banat
Nowadays it’s not as diverse I believe, the fight is between us in Banat and Dobrogea
That’s actually really cool
I’m from the region of Bukovina and both my family name and family tree clearly states the Hutsul descendence
True Europe
Actually, Rusyns are the same as Rutherians
>Satu Mare and even in Harghita, you'll see people bonded by mutual trust and humanity
...ermmmmmmmmmmm what
Hungarians have been pushing for autonomy from the romanian state (not constitutional), and romanians hate hungarians & vice-versa
Sure, we don't kill each other, but I wouldn't call it living in harmony, bonded by mutual trust and all that bullshit you just said
Despite living in romania, they refuse to learn the language, and 5 km from where I live, it seems like it's a different country
Billboards in hungarian, store signs in hungarian, schools in hungarian etc
Fuck those guys
100 years ago romanians had to learn hungarian to be able to interact with the state under the domination of austriahungary, while getting the treatment of second class citizens
These assholes have the same rights as everyone else, same citizenship, same everything but still refuse to learn the language of their country just because of their bullshit ancestry
Fuck
Them
Note they all have medals
My guess is that they are members of the Imperial-Royal Army
All pre-WWI Europe was a big Stachistan
From what I understand, nowadays, they are considered subgroups of Ukrainian ethnicity
It's both a religion and an ethnic group
In this particular case, the ethnic group is "Ashkenazi Jews", Jews who came (or were brought) in Europe during the Roman Empire (particularly in Italy), then moved into what is now Southern Germany were they acquired a German dialect (Yiddish), then moved to Eastern Europe
Hutsuls are Rusyns, but not all Rusyns are Hutsuls
In what sense not native
By the time of the photo, all of them have been living for many generations in Bukovina, so they were natives
All of them came in the last thousand years, assimilating whatever populations were there before
* Romanians: 1000-1300 (from Maramureș)
* Hungarians: 1000-1300 (from Hungary)
* Rusyns, Hutsuls: 1000-1300 (from the north)
* Roma: 1400s (enslaved)
* Poles: 1700-1720 (most of them came during the Great Northern War; there was some Polish population previously as well)
* Russians: 1700s (fleeing religious persecution)
* Germans: 1780s (after the Austrian annexation)
* Jews: 1800-1840 (fleeing massacres in the Russian Empire)
I guess you mean the Rrom and the Jew
It’s interesting though how the Rroma were treated so badly here (slavery and stuff) while the Jews enjoyed a pretty privileged position
The first Yiddish theater opened a bit further south than Bucovina, in the city of Iasi
Probably the most accurate description of the Eastern European lifestyle
They do, however, leave when their angry wives call them to finally sign the divorce papers
As far as I know, Ruthenians are basically Western Ukrainains while Rusyns are pretty much their own thing, but they never got to have their own state
Not all Hungarians are like that, the majority in fact are not
I grew up in Banat and I swear we do not make any kind of difference between Hungarians and us
I thought those hostilities were a joke until I got to visit some cities in Transylvania where some tensions seem to exist
dude, grow up
Around 15k
Actually, at the same time, none are native and all are native
All their languages formed in other places: Slavic languages in the North, Romanian and Hungarian in the West, Yiddish and German far in the West
However, they all likely had ancestors among the people who already lived in Bukovina
When people move to another place, they usually intermarry the people who already live there
And that's fine, as long as they didn't come from somewhere between the Ural Mountains and Mongolia, damn those steppe invaders in particular
> the Jews enjoyed a pretty privileged position
They did not have any privileges
There were plenty of restrictions placed on them
They could not own land nor join guilds ("bresle"), so they could not be either farmers or craftsmen, which is why they were mostly merchants
>its just the leading magyar party making retarded promises to win votes lol
And that's not an issue
The fact that they're literally trying to divide the country
The fact that they just tried to ram through parliament an anti-constitutional autonomy law
The fact that they are doing their best to prevent romanian from being taught properly in schools
The fact that magyars keep voting these literal traitors to the nation
Idk where you live, but belive me, there's issues
No, we're not
We were second class citizens under occupation
They're just citizens, with representatives and everything
Edit: what i said above is historically accurate
Downvote all you want
If you think wanting *romanian citizens* to at least know how to speak *romanian* is nationalism, then idk what to tell you
Because i'm really the furthest thing from a nationalist
It's not impossible btw
The turks did it in dobrogea
They get along just fine with everyone
You guys arent special
If you have romanian citizenship then, for fuck's sake, speak romanian
Whatever you say, jefe
Ashkenazi Jews have been living in Europe since the Roman Empire, so they have been living in Europe for at least 1800 years
That's longer than the Hungarians
Roma people also have been living in Europe for at least 700-800 years
Also, almost all Jews and Roma have more than half of their DNA of European origin
Compared to the Rroma I mean, we were talking about the two
I see, my bad
My grandfather called himself Ruthenian, but the language he spoke was definitely Ukrainian, he taught my mom as a kid a few songs and it’s Ukrainian

> the settlement policies in Austria was largely segretationist
It depends on the era and place
The Austrian policy in the Banat under Maria Theresia was to forcefully assimilate the Roma
It was mandatory for Roma people to settle in a village (nomadism was banned), they could marry only non-Roma, etc
shit, I forgot Ceausescu made himself president in the 70's

And the majority voted for brexit
And now nothing can stop it because of that
But people have become much more educated on the matter and changed their minds completely
Right now, if the same vote would be held again, a big majority will be against brexit
why are they not redoing the vote

I live in Romania and I installed an AC this year
Can't take the heat, 2 years in a row I couldn't do any work because it was to damn hot and even got sick because of the heat last year
Transylvanian summers were as you described 6-10 years ago
We also used to have lots of snow during the winter season
Almost noone has an AC and it's not like it costs a fortune, I think it was around 450 Euros total (including the team that installed it) and about 10-15 Euros more on the Electricity bill
It's the best purchase I made since building the custom PC
Wouldn't be able to live without it now
Unrelated but one downside is that I am sharing the office space with the girlfriend and her minimum comfortable temperature is my maximum comfortable temperature (26°C)
I like it best at 24°C though (her fav is 28°C)
But yeah, if you don't have one, buy one
It's worth it
Is it because of regulation which prevents you from altering old buildings on the outside
The guys that installed it bought a machine which made a hole with a diameter between 5-10cm which is filled with the cable from the AC
The whole installation took about 1h and we only had to vacuum some dust
But I live in a non-historical apartment building and we own the apartment
I wouldn't recommend buying the portable one, had one when I was renting and it was, as you would say it, umsonst
You have to keep the window open for it to work which is bs
You said you have to live there for a few years first
If you "inform" the government that you're Swedish after a week of living there, do they still accept it
If they don't, then you're still applying, you're just calling it something else
Maybe ask your landlord/lady about it
Properties with AC can be rented for a higher price so it's a win win
Slovakia,Czech doesn't count
Also Croatia,Serbian doesn't count
I’m calling bullshit on Romania
Lots of people around here say they speak English, French, Spanish etc
and it seems it’s because that’s what they get taught in school (just look on their LinkedIn profiles)
English and French are the most popular, but I only met two or three people speaking French, while most English I heard was awful
“I make food, ok
” and “this is Roman Market” (it’s the Roman Square ffs) are an indicator they translate things word by word and their vocabulary is limited
To their defense, however, I’d blame school for focusing too much on grammar, and less on practice and conversational skills
brexit gets a new meaning
In Romania you learn from the 3rd grade either English or French ( some schools teach german or other languages) and from the 5th grade you get a second foreign language
So if you got english in 3rd grade, you'll get French in 5th and you'll be considered "advanced" level for English later in highschool
For exemple I learned french from 3rd grade and English from 5, although I don't know much French at all because I hated my primary french teacher .
Wait, what
Isn't English the first language you learn in schools
I don't remember us having a choice, in 3rd grade it was English and then French in the 5th grade
Edit: we also studied Latin but it's the most useless thing in the world, we can't even speak or translate without a dictionary, we mostly learn grammar
I don't remember making a choice as well, but some classes had English first and some French first
The only choice I made was in highschool, where I chosed english
Damn I wish I could do that too, studying only one foreign language in highschool
Instead I have to study English and French, and Latin too but it's mostly grammar
A pain in the ass
I didn't know they still teach latin lmao

That's a pretty common trope, but I wonder if actual Bible reading was indeed the main driver to educate everyone in those cultures
Weren't there more practical considerations also pushing literacy
I guess it boils down to the balance between "that's how Protestants are in general" and "that's how those specific cultures tend to be regardless". Which might be tricky to figure out
The high literacy rate was bcuz of 2 opposing systems:
You had AH who after passing some laws that forbidded the learning of romanian or any minority languages in msjority of the schools
On the other hand you had ASTRA ,an organization who opened hundreds of romanian schools and highschools across Transylvania, its main founds camed from the kingdom of Romania
These organization appeard as a reaction to the new laws imposed by AH , wich forced denationalizqtiom and magysrization on the  minoritties living in the hungarian half

Gay plot to take over the world through climate change
The gendarmerie  intervened in force with water cannons and gas to evacuate the protesters  from the Victoria square and the nearby streets
The interior minister decreted Code Red, asking all police officers to get to work
This was obviously prepared in advance by the PSD government
When PSD organized its own rally with people brought in from all over the country, there were no water cannons on sight, no gases, no shields
The hospitals were informed by the authorities, from this morning, that there will be many people injured during this meeting
Dragnea and his PSD want to intimidate the population from protesting
Things have gotten a little more violent than what is displayed in the picture
The riot police is out of control
Full story from what is known right now (others who have been paying attention/watching please correct me or point out additional details as they appear):
The protest gathered 100,000+ in Bucharest
At one point one of the shops in the area asked for help from the police because hooligans were rampaging through the square
The police force asked the riot police to intervene
They dispatched a few rows of their own to *march through the protesters* to get to the affected shop
Unsurprisingly, 2-3 riot officers were caught by the mindless hooligans and were beaten up severely (from the images it looked like they were being beaten close to death)
**Many protesters intervened and acted as human shields, protecting the 2-3 riot police members that were singled out**.
This is when the riot police initiated a full-scale assault and started bombarding the entire 100,000 crowd (fire at will)
Almost the entire protest was pushed out, with a clash between hooligans and riot police breaking out, while the majority of the protest was pushed to one side (and of course, many protesters fleeing because things were getting dangerous)
The remaining protesters (a few thousand by the looks of it) are now singled out on the left side of the square, with the central area largely empty (or rather full of riot police vans and such)
One thing I should point out is, the riot police have been very aggressive and provoking the whole night
They didn't single out the hooligans (which are incredibly easy to identify), instead choosing to use tear gas on everyone as a response
It is not a normal response to disperse an entire crowd of peaceful protesters with endless tear gas grenades flung **right in the middle of the main crowd indiscriminately**. It's not like they chose to disperse or fight the hooligans, they shot tear gas at **everyone**.
**Edit:** [Here is a video of the incident that initiated this event] **You can clearly see that many protesters shielded the riot police officers and pushed away the hooligans
** It is important to note that the people in power (PSD) like to use these events and point fingers at the entire protest, for the violent actions of a few (in order to strengthen their position)
Fortunately, many brave souls stepped in and protected them, ~~thus eliminating the chance for PSD to claim that all of the protesters were violent
~~ but PSD and their shill television channel Antena 3 is only showing small segments and pictures where the riot police officers are attacked
A lot of injuries, including a number of gendarmes
One of them seriously
Expect an anti-protest narrative by tomorrow
It's a very old timey Soviet technique: Agitators blend into the crowd and cause trouble, then the police can 'justifiably' disperse the crowd
The protesters will be demonized, the organizers may even get into legal trouble
More protests tomorrow
Stay tuned

We've been doing this shit for ages, when will we get it that it doesn't work
We need to be more educated and less forgetful
yea too bad the "peaceful" protestants started throwing their literal shit on the guards because why not add a little violence to make our point stand better with the government ... bunch of hypocrites ... like ok i am all for the no corruption thing and what not, whatever these guys are fighting for, but by letting your anger and frustations and whatnot out on the poor guards doing their jobs, you prove quite literraly the opposite of what youre trying to achieve ... like c'mon now ppl posting vids on facebook threatening the gendarmes and shit why is this needed ... and also if im still here, why does the diaspora have anything to say about what goes on in this country ? you left, your out, you have no say in this, mind your business ... jesus fucking christ, and then the ones out there lash out on people for DARING to question their doings ... i guess this country is all out of common sense and critical thinking these days ...
Less than the PSD support manifestations
I guess democracy spoke
PSD will win with over 50% alone next elections because they dont fuck the economy like the opposition parties
2:24 AM and they're back
About 100k people there once again and in full force
We'll be back, we're the resilent sort
thank you
much luck needed
fuck sake there would be no need for this if there werent instigators paid by fuck knows who there to stirr up the crowd and intimidate the guards there only to do their jobs ... a "peacefull" protest wouldn't fkin barge in the fckin goverment buildings and whatnot to "discuss" with the politicians of course they'd get pushed back jesus christ there are still laws in this country
Thanks
We lack courage as well for the most part of our history but, from time to time, we snap (*cough* Ceaușescu)
Even our national anthem is called "awaken thee Romanian": Awaken thee, Romanian, wake up from deadly slumber
i mean if they would have critical thinking they would get rid of the people starting the altercations as those are mostly the ones causing everything by being the ones paid to cause shit to go down, and not join them and then cry on social media that gendarmes bad, they hurt people whithout reason, of course that in the mist of everything, the guys paid to serve and protect will not know who to fuckin beat up, its logic, their not superhumans to target the pieces of shit that are paid to destroy the protests from within, before they act, but people need to diverge from those, and keep it peaceful
nobody, especially the ones meant to protect you, is gonna come beat you up, if you dont first stirr them up
Over 100
000 people protesting in the capital and 50k+ around the country
\>Let the protest go on and be forgotten by the end of the next week
\>Bring ultras to disperse the protest and don't even attempt to pretend to stop them so everyone hates you while calling you willingly incompetent
Hard fucking choice indeed
eh, it never does these days, what this country needs is a revolution like the one in 89, go after all the fuckers that think their above the law, make their own decisions, and align the country on the floating line, but allas, this will never happen, everyone is corrupt, and nobody is gonna intentionally break away from the means they use to largen their pockets
Just to clarify, do you think the protest should be peaceful
The protests never stopped at 23 and no such action was justified
This was premeditated
There were no water cannons, gas and shields to the other protests or to the PSD meeting
The gendarmerie has no excuse
It decided to enter Dragnea's sick attempt to silence any opposition and intimidate people from protesting
This was a dictatorship like move
The gendarmerie acted like Dragnea's mad dog tonight
They want to attack the protesters
Problem is, lots of ppl made a big effort only to come here
to protest
that means months and months of protest
those guys will have to go back to their countries next days
of course it should be peacefull, why would you resort to violence to prove your point ? most of the poeple gathered there came with this in mind, those not hereded like ships there, without having any idea what was going on, at least, but the pupets paid by the goverment or fuck knows who to cause the violence, from the inside, and the guards irked by them, and given ultimatums by the government dosent help the situation in any way
We've had enough peaceful protests
What have we achieved
Jack shit is what
If the Jandarmeria wants to be violent, then we'll bite back
It's time someone does something to actually oust this corrupt government
Standing around and waving signs around hasn't and will never achieve anything
dont you understand, nothing will come either way, these protests are as useless as a method of wanting the bigger dogs to change their attitudes and anything else, peacefull or violent, like i keep saying, these fuckers dont know shame or humbleness, they need to taken out fo their positions by force, but as long they keep paying and forcing the police to shield them, everhing will only end in a bigger bloodbath, with uncesesasrry losses for both sides
That's true, but there's nothing we can do besides fight
Maybe violent protests will give way to a revolution
It's definitely better than just chanting things for a few hours and then going home
I wish it wasn't like this and I wish PSD would just quit, but there's far too greedy
I hate PSD as much as the next Romanian but fuck this resorting to violence bullshit
Go vote instead

''Snow'' in european languages
It snowed heavily here last night, so I thought I should post this
In Romanian we also call snow ''nea'' (from latin) and ''omăt'' (from slavic)
Ninge afara = outside is snowing
Snow = zapada  We are walking in the snow = mergem pe ninsoare
In Romanian it's also called "nea", but it's rarely used colloquially, mostly in artistic texts or songs
Another synonym is omăt, but I've never seen this one used in the wild, only in school when learning synonyms
My mostly Romanian family is always making fun of the one Polish guy because usually our words correspond to the rest of the Romance languages and the Polish words are usually something like zklczszkwskly but now the tables have really turned
In romanian there are 3 words for snow
Is zăpadă, nea and omăt. All with diferent ethimologies
You focking sniegas
Why is this thing reposted every winter
>In Romanian we also call snow ''nea'' (from latin)
Romania latin master race confirmed once again
I was worried for a second
Besides - "Zapada" from Slavic
In Romania only, but not in any Slavic country
I highly doubt the ethymological explanation of this one
It probably has more to do with the political agenda of the Romanian Academy in communist time, when it was forced to cater to the soviet interests
The dictionaries from that time are commonly known as labelling words of unknown origin (incomplete explanations that involved pre-Roman and pre-Slavic sources) as stemming from Slavic by default, in spite of the ridiculously unlikely probability, simply because there was no complete scientific explanation to contradict that
Too bad there is not ebough contemporary academic activity to wash off the communist pseudo-science
Especially considering that only about 20% of our language is Slavic in origin and we're much farther from Slavic culture than our neighbors
“Nea” e un împrumut din franceză care datează doar din perioada pașoptistă când s-a încercat o purificare a limbii de cuvinte de origine slavică, așa numitul proces de *relatinizare*. Limba română pre-1848 era foarte diferită de limba actuală.
> “Nea” e un împrumut din franceză
Dacă ar fi fost împrumut din franceză, ar fi fost folosit în București, nu în sate de munte din Apuseni
The "nea" used in [this traditional "colind"] doesn't look like a French loan-word:
> La căsuța unde-i neaua

Honesly I think we need an adult too at this point
I mean as a somewhat religious individual myself I don't like people making fun of my faith but I respect that others may not share my beliefs, I don't think violence is ever justified by any joke you can possibly make
Reddit is the worst example
It's a privately owned platform, and it's governed by its own rules, not by actual freedom of speech laws
Most people in this thread seem to be missing the point
The key word here is "charger", as in power brick, power adapter, whatever
It has nothing to do with the actual charging port on the phone itself
It just means that cables need to have USB-C (if that's what they choose to go with) on at least ONE end of the cable, specifically the end that goes into the wall adapter (the charger)
Google has already been doing this, and Apple too, as of late
It's the other manufacturers that need to switch from the USB-A port on their chargers
Apple is already using USB-C power adapters with their new phones
This law isn't even about the port in the phone, it's about the port in the power adapter
The law is about regulating the brick plug, not the cable
Most still use USB-A.
The law is trying to reduce waste and enforce a single type of power adapter
With USB-C, I assume, like the Pixel chargers or the new iPhone ones
The plug that goes into your phone is irrelevant

At least [Pyongyang has some trees] which you can't grow in the permafrost
I'm pretty sure it's because they don't have a long enough season that is not frozen
The daily average temperature in May is -5C.
That's the main problem, you divide the country in 2
The system gives you a choice; either vote the 2 main parties or throw your vote away
Idk how the system works in all of Europe, but I know for a fact the countries I've lived in have a representation of minorities in the Parliament, and sometimes they can make a difference when supporting/going against the government
In the US it's either black or white, you don't have this component of minorities being decisive
Imagine being murdered in 2020 and by Nazis, come on people, grow up and leave behind this Nazi ideology, it’s not 30’s anymore
He was murdered in 2013, but yeah, this should go without saying
Oh, I didn’t say that there are no nazi left
I know they are still a problem
I just find the whole idea of someone still following the Nazi ideology completely laughable
Those imbeciles follows an ideology of nothingness just to justify their fear of anyone that is different
No no, my comment have a very ironic tone so it’s alright if you didn’t understood it from first because it wasn’t that obvious
This is pure gold right here because it's the right attitude to have

Other nations, including the US, have done really bad shit as well but these atrocities are so modern in nature and so close to home (in a way) that it feels like they're acting on a different level of cruelty

Putting Facebook and Google in the same category as Apple hurts considering how anti tracking and pro privacy they are
Well, you are true for the most part but Apple is actually a lot bigger, it is the most valuable company in the world
Samsung however is a lot more diverse and have a big monopoly on a lot of phone components like the screens
Reddit ain’t got to admit shit
Making ships and weapons doesn’t necessarily make you rich
True, Samsung is worth 500B dollars, which is insane but Apple is worth 2
3T, quite a lot more
Also Samsung electronics and Samsung heavy industries (the one specialized in military and ships) are totally different companies, just like Sony have a lot of divisions but they are not connected at all
As a Romanian, at least we still have Transylvania

> Adolf-Hitler-Platz
We had a "Piața Adolf Hitler" in Bucharest after the war it became "Piața Generalissim I. V. Stalin" and now it's "Piața Charles de Gaulle".
We have some historical links with France and some affinity with the French culture and people
This was valid even during the communist era: for instance, the Dacia factory was built in the 1960s with French technology
Mr Dinescu once told that, in a meeting with the US ambassador immediately after the 89 revolution, he told him (quote from memory): "I hope you will get rich fast, so you'll get the respect you deserve". He was puzzled initially, but indeed, the only way to get the respect and to defend yourself is getting rich
Otherwise, you are despised
No matter how much we hate our political class, they managed to do at least some things right

Simple solution to Romania's corruption
Working with russia or with the US to escape this ultimatum also means total destruction
Romania should have 1 year to do that
That's how all of you sound
You know that Romania will probably just devolve into chaos or a russian puppet state or just a third world hell with a huge humanitarian crisis without the EU
The EU is the only thing keeping Romania from becoming like Myanmar or Colombia
My dissapointment is immesurable and my day is ruined
Well done bros, well done
They don’t. Just look at our last elections, politicians still tried (and in some cases succeeded) to steal votes
Imagine how easy they can do that in Moldova

In Romania it must be somewhere at 90%.

Thank you
Well, it's more complicated than that
Surely, the current government and coalition does not have and will never have any intention of fixing things or actually working in the interest of the citizens
Protests help
They keep the politicians on edge
Maybe not enough for significant changes, but they are put on a spotlight anyhow, including on the international stage
The issue is deeper than that
Our most important fight is to not only go out and vote, but to convince the people which don't vote to actually go out and do it because currently they are the majority
The majority don't vote
Of course, it isn't just about voting, but inspiring people to vote responsibly and not just because they're promised a raise in salaries by a party which fucks up the economy completely and still barely throws a dime at the people
People's needs for a better standard of living are understandable, but PSD and co
won't achieve that for them, not really
So I think that in the long run, protesting and civic activities such as informational campaigns will have results
It will just take a lot of time and patience
Sorry if I didn't give you the exact answer you were looking for
We haven't really stopped protesting since January last year
I mean not everyday and they're not always big, but we did it often
A full year
The protests last year actually started in January not in February, but they got bigger in February
I know because I was at the January protests too
I could hear Czechia's gasp from here
[Here
:D]
Personally I don't think they'd get the same results
They would win again, but with a smaller number of votes and because of a scattered opposition
[Yes
] Most people support the European Union as the EU is part of our fight against corruption and they try to help however they can
The EU cannot do much though
We have the CVM through which they monitor our corruption levels and they do suggest that the government strengthen our anti-corruption laws and they speak up against what our politicians do, but they cannot take any legal action yet
Recently, we're always playing on the edge of maybe having our voting right revoked because of our politicians, but not yet
Wait, do they
I tried to see it but I kinda can't lol

Spain got loads of money from this deal, what a time to do a poll
Romania in exchange, got nothing else than a piece of shit in comparisson to Spain, Italy or Greece
What I don't like about this map is that what makes Central and Western Europe is very different by different regions
For Romanians, Germany and Switzerland are the Western Europe and no one is going to call the Baltic state Central Europe
With those skyscrapers in the background it really reminds me of an American city
We have one like that in Bucharest too, but smaller:
Isn’t Timisoareana from 1798
Looks fascinating, what was the vision of the artist
Ah yes, anger the Orthodox Christians
That's smart
Hope the guy recovers
Send help pls
-20 or -2 0 in North East Italy
Not the most impressive skyscrapers individually, but look quite good together
You need some Art Deco buildings and Warsaw can become the New York of the East
That's exactly why I said that, I can't wait to see how the revival will change the cities and people's perception about Skyscrapers (tho Art Deco get it's share of hate when it first came out)

My guess is the high rate of rural population and of old people are keeping it down, basically everyone in Bucharest speak at least some English

Thank you
Romania be like: " LET MEEEEEEEEE INNNNNNNNNN"
Croatia can wait in the line
If they get in before we do, it'll be a rage
I'd be pissed
Fine
Party without us
Some members of the council should learn that you can only go so far and that we have veto power as well (remember CETA
) so yeah, maybe we'd block you, but it wouldn't be personal, like what's going on between Croatia and Slovenia
Imagine having a green light from the parliament and most countries since 2011 and still be blocked so many years later
Croatia can enter Schengen with us at the same time, but IMO not before because this is a political circus mostly based on populism
Then I hope our politicians will work in our interest and veto
You have bigger problems than us:
To a country which has waited for almost ten years, it's business as usual if we won't be in Schengen, but at the same time we should not play by the Council's rules if they don't care about us
>I did some readings about that and the conclusion I made is that Croatia is about to enter the Schengen individually; without Bulgaria and Romania, because of interests of the European powerhouses like Germany, Italy, France etc
There's absolutely no need to act bitter when I just pointed to what I meant with my comment
>You pointed out a Croatian news article, for wich you claimed that it says that we have bigger problems than you do
Not that you have more problems than us, but that there's more between you and Schengen than just Romania deciding to veto your entry
I this the misunderstanding was that I interpreted "I did some readings" wrongly where I thought you found sources stating your personal conclusion
Sorry about that
Truth is, at the moment, we don't know a lot about what's gonna happen, especially with the coronavirus crisis
We'll see what the future holds

Well, now if you spoke about it
Ignatio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits order, writes in his memoirs that at some point he meets an Muslim
So they have a friendly and polite dispute over some theological shit (virginity after giving birth
or something), they shake hands and they go apart, each on his own road
Ignatio realize later that the offence to Christianity is just too great, so he goes back and take the road the Muslim took, just to kill him with the dagger

Also, Walachia was covered in forests and now it’s white cause it’s used for farming, probably the same story in Northern Italy

It doesn't work like that tho
He'll look like a martyr
Is anyone in Turkey protesting against him
That would certainly help show him that some of his country is definitely not with him and no longer staying silent
I don't think everyone in Turkey agrees with Erdogan, but it certainly helps him that they're not willing to get real vocal about it
Good luck anyhow
Hope somehow you get rid of him

You need some more Art Nouveau and Art Deco to be perfect
You are right, but the Eiffel Tower it's not the most representative example of Art Nouveau
But Brutalism isn’t ugly, it can be hard to understand, but it’s surely an interesting style that asks the architects “what can you do when you only have raw concrete to work with
”, it tests creativity in a period of limited resources
Lots of small (between 1000 and 3000) villages
Besides mountains, I don’t think you can go 20 km in a straight line without meeting any village or town
Huh to be honest I am surprised Romania is neutral
When i visited London and people asked me where i was from they always put on a sour face after telling them i was from Romania
But of course that only literal dictatorships are worse than we
You never surprise, UK but always disappoints me
Because of ignorance mostly
EDIT: The ignorance seems to be with my countrymen as well
I don't know why I'm getting downvoted, but I certainly make more sense than one-word replies that offer no insight whatsoever
It's cool that we are expected to differentiate the important groups in Western Europe, such as Scots vs English vs Irish, but asking for understanding of a basic "we're not all criminals, and you're an ignorant for assuming that" is asking far too much of our Western partners
If they have Romanian citizenship, they have the right to call themselves Romanian, the same way ethnic Germans, Hungarians, etc
have that right

Your ethnicity doesn't negate you right to have a certain citizenship
You can say I’m the reaction
There is a lot of negativity and inferiority complexes among Romanians (especially those that live outside Romania)
I’m still young, I was a kid when Romania joined EU, that was the moment most left
Growing up hearing all that negativity made me an optimist, it’s just that when 100 people tell you that something is wrong, you feel the need to revolt, to see what the truth is
He's a Romanian citizen
That's exactly what I said
If you were born in Germany with German citizenship, you're a German of Romanian ethnicity, but no one goes around saying that specifically, they just say "I'm German" and explain later their ethnicity if they want to
It's fine
I made a bad comparison
Hungarians don't really like being Romanian citizens so of course, they wouldn't answer like that, but my point was that most people don't pull out a family tree and start explaining their background to a stranger
Nevertheless, there is nothing to be debated
If you are a citizen of Romania, you can call yourself Romanian
That was what my original point was because the other person argued against it
Ofc the romanian is a mix between all of them, excepting the jew
Well that's what I call an otherworldly vista
I’m curious why it’s so big in Bulgaria, your population it’s not that big, it is because of industry

Honesly I think we need an adult too at this point
I mean as a somewhat religious individual myself I don't like people making fun of my faith but I respect that others may not share my beliefs, I don't think violence is ever justified by any joke you can possibly make
Reddit is the worst example
It's a privately owned platform, and it's governed by its own rules, not by actual freedom of speech laws
Most people in this thread seem to be missing the point
The key word here is "charger", as in power brick, power adapter, whatever
It has nothing to do with the actual charging port on the phone itself
It just means that cables need to have USB-C (if that's what they choose to go with) on at least ONE end of the cable, specifically the end that goes into the wall adapter (the charger)
Google has already been doing this, and Apple too, as of late
It's the other manufacturers that need to switch from the USB-A port on their chargers
Apple is already using USB-C power adapters with their new phones
This law isn't even about the port in the phone, it's about the port in the power adapter
The law is about regulating the brick plug, not the cable
Most still use USB-A.
The law is trying to reduce waste and enforce a single type of power adapter
With USB-C, I assume, like the Pixel chargers or the new iPhone ones
The plug that goes into your phone is irrelevant

At least [Pyongyang has some trees] which you can't grow in the permafrost
I'm pretty sure it's because they don't have a long enough season that is not frozen
The daily average temperature in May is -5C.
That's the main problem, you divide the country in 2
The system gives you a choice; either vote the 2 main parties or throw your vote away
Idk how the system works in all of Europe, but I know for a fact the countries I've lived in have a representation of minorities in the Parliament, and sometimes they can make a difference when supporting/going against the government
In the US it's either black or white, you don't have this component of minorities being decisive
Imagine being murdered in 2020 and by Nazis, come on people, grow up and leave behind this Nazi ideology, it’s not 30’s anymore
He was murdered in 2013, but yeah, this should go without saying
Oh, I didn’t say that there are no nazi left
I know they are still a problem
I just find the whole idea of someone still following the Nazi ideology completely laughable
Those imbeciles follows an ideology of nothingness just to justify their fear of anyone that is different
No no, my comment have a very ironic tone so it’s alright if you didn’t understood it from first because it wasn’t that obvious
This is pure gold right here because it's the right attitude to have

Fuck all y'all and your mass-killing political games
Other nations, including the US, have done really bad shit as well but these atrocities are so modern in nature and so close to home (in a way) that it feels like they're acting on a different level of cruelty

Putting Facebook and Google in the same category as Apple hurts considering how anti tracking and pro privacy they are
Well, you are true for the most part but Apple is actually a lot bigger, it is the most valuable company in the world
Samsung however is a lot more diverse and have a big monopoly on a lot of phone components like the screens
Reddit ain’t got to admit shit
Making ships and weapons doesn’t necessarily make you rich
True, Samsung is worth 500B dollars, which is insane but Apple is worth 2
3T, quite a lot more
Also Samsung electronics and Samsung heavy industries (the one specialized in military and ships) are totally different companies, just like Sony have a lot of divisions but they are not connected at all
As a Romanian, at least we still have Transylvania

We had a "Piața Adolf Hitler" in Bucharest after the war it became "Piața Generalissim I. V. Stalin" and now it's "Piața Charles de Gaulle".
We have some historical links with France and some affinity with the French culture and people
This was valid even during the communist era: for instance, the Dacia factory was built in the 1960s with French technology
Mr Dinescu once told that, in a meeting with the US ambassador immediately after the 89 revolution, he told him (quote from memory): "I hope you will get rich fast, so you'll get the respect you deserve". He was puzzled initially, but indeed, the only way to get the respect and to defend yourself is getting rich
Otherwise, you are despised

That's how all of you sound
You know that Romania will probably just devolve into chaos or a russian puppet state or just a third world hell with a huge humanitarian crisis without the EU
The EU is the only thing keeping Romania from becoming like Myanmar or Colombia

Thank you
Well, it's more complicated than that
Surely, the current government and coalition does not have and will never have any intention of fixing things or actually working in the interest of the citizens
Protests help
They keep the politicians on edge
Maybe not enough for significant changes, but they are put on a spotlight anyhow, including on the international stage
The issue is deeper than that
Our most important fight is to not only go out and vote, but to convince the people which don't vote to actually go out and do it because currently they are the majority
The majority don't vote
Of course, it isn't just about voting, but inspiring people to vote responsibly and not just because they're promised a raise in salaries by a party which fucks up the economy completely and still barely throws a dime at the people
People's needs for a better standard of living are understandable, but PSD and co
won't achieve that for them, not really
So I think that in the long run, protesting and civic activities such as informational campaigns will have results
It will just take a lot of time and patience
Sorry if I didn't give you the exact answer you were looking for
We haven't really stopped protesting since January last year
I mean not everyday and they're not always big, but we did it often
A full year
The protests last year actually started in January not in February, but they got bigger in February
I know because I was at the January protests too
I could hear Czechia's gasp from here
[Here
:D]
Personally I don't think they'd get the same results
They would win again, but with a smaller number of votes and because of a scattered opposition
[Yes
] Most people support the European Union as the EU is part of our fight against corruption and they try to help however they can
The EU cannot do much though
We have the CVM through which they monitor our corruption levels and they do suggest that the government strengthen our anti-corruption laws and they speak up against what our politicians do, but they cannot take any legal action yet
Recently, we're always playing on the edge of maybe having our voting right revoked because of our politicians, but not yet
Wait, do they
I tried to see it but I kinda can't lol

Spain got loads of money from this deal, what a time to do a poll
Romania in exchange, got nothing else than a piece of shit in comparisson to Spain, Italy or Greece
What I don't like about this map is that what makes Central and Western Europe is very different by different regions
For Romanians, Germany and Switzerland are the Western Europe and no one is going to call the Baltic state Central Europe
With those skyscrapers in the background it really reminds me of an American city
We have one like that in Bucharest too, but smaller:

Not the most impressive skyscrapers individually, but look quite good together
You need some Art Deco buildings and Warsaw can become the New York of the East

Romania be like: " LET MEEEEEEEEE INNNNNNNNNN"
Croatia can wait in the line
If they get in before we do, it'll be a rage
I'd be pissed
Fine
Party without us
Some members of the council should learn that you can only go so far and that we have veto power as well (remember CETA
) so yeah, maybe we'd block you, but it wouldn't be personal, like what's going on between Croatia and Slovenia
Imagine having a green light from the parliament and most countries since 2011 and still be blocked so many years later
Croatia can enter Schengen with us at the same time, but IMO not before because this is a political circus mostly based on populism
Then I hope our politicians will work in our interest and veto
You have bigger problems than us:
To a country which has waited for almost ten years, it's business as usual if we won't be in Schengen, but at the same time we should not play by the Council's rules if they don't care about us
>I did some readings about that and the conclusion I made is that Croatia is about to enter the Schengen individually; without Bulgaria and Romania, because of interests of the European powerhouses like Germany, Italy, France etc
There's absolutely no need to act bitter when I just pointed to what I meant with my comment
>You pointed out a Croatian news article, for wich you claimed that it says that we have bigger problems than you do
Not that you have more problems than us, but that there's more between you and Schengen than just Romania deciding to veto your entry
I this the misunderstanding was that I interpreted "I did some readings" wrongly where I thought you found sources stating your personal conclusion
Sorry about that
Truth is, at the moment, we don't know a lot about what's gonna happen, especially with the coronavirus crisis
We'll see what the future holds

Ignatio de Loyola, founder of the Jesuits order, writes in his memoirs that at some point he meets an Muslim
So they have a friendly and polite dispute over some theological shit (virginity after giving birth
or something), they shake hands and they go apart, each on his own road
Ignatio realize later that the offence to Christianity is just too great, so he goes back and take the road the Muslim took, just to kill him with the dagger

Is anyone in Turkey protesting against him
That would certainly help show him that some of his country is definitely not with him and no longer staying silent
I don't think everyone in Turkey agrees with Erdogan, but it certainly helps him that they're not willing to get real vocal about it
Good luck anyhow
Hope somehow you get rid of him

You need some more Art Nouveau and Art Deco to be perfect
You are right, but the Eiffel Tower it's not the most representative example of Art Nouveau
But Brutalism isn’t ugly, it can be hard to understand, but it’s surely an interesting style that asks the architects “what can you do when you only have raw concrete to work with
”, it tests creativity in a period of limited resources
Lots of small (between 1000 and 3000) villages
Besides mountains, I don’t think you can go 20 km in a straight line without meeting any village or town

When i visited London and people asked me where i was from they always put on a sour face after telling them i was from Romania
But of course that only literal dictatorships are worse than we
You never surprise, UK but always disappoints me

Cute photo bombing near Castel Sant’Angelo, Roma, Italy
